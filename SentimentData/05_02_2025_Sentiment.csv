This early recognition places Litecoin ahead of other pending altcoin ETFs for Solana and XRP, sparking optimism that LTC might become the next asset to grab mainstream attention. Meanwhile, analysts highlight two other standouts this February: Sui, a newly rebranded chain, and Remittix(RTX), a PayFi altcoin bridging daily financial needs. Below is a closer look at what’s fueling Litecoin’s renewed hype and why some believe Sui and Remittix(RTX) might also be top movers. Litecoin’s Early ETF Acknowledgment: A Big Win Over Solana & XRP Litecoin, originally forked from the Bitcoin blockchain, just saw a 17% price jump after the SEC recognized Canary Capital’s application to launch a Litecoin ETF. Observers say this puts it ahead of Solana and XRP, which also have filings in the works but haven’t received the same nod yet. If the ETF gets approval, it could usher in a wave of mainstream capital, potentially returning LTC to price levels unseen since 2021. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunasremarked that this filing is already checking most boxes, feeding rumors of a relatively smooth path toward final approval. Critics note that parallels between Litecoin and Bitcoin might make regulators more comfortable green-lighting an LTC-focused product. Many also expect the current SEC administration to be friendlier to crypto, given acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s stance on digital assets. Should the ETF pass, it may also further normalize crypto within traditional finance circles. That official confidence can ripple outward, boosting liquidity and consumer adoption across the sector. Although Solana and XRP remain strong contenders in their own right, the race for altcoin ETFs appears to favor LTC at the moment. Sui and Remittix (RTX): Two Other Altcoins Grabbing Headlines Amid the ETF talk, analysts are also singling out Sui and Remittix(RTX) as potential top performers in February. Sui, fresh from a rebrand, wants to boost transaction speeds and scale for dApps, making it attractive to developers who are chasing fast networks. However, the more consumer-facing star might be Remittix (RTX), a PayFi solution bridging FIAT and crypto for cross-border payments. Imagine a traveling event organizer in Latin America, frequently wiring funds to overseas partners. Conventional methods hurt with hefty fees; Remittix (RTX), by contrast, provides quick wallet-to-cash methods without typical bank overhead. So far, Remittix (RTX) has raised over $10.5 million and sold roughly 430 million tokens. One token is now selling for $0.0512. The altcoin’s real-world benefits—lower wire costs, more straightforward cross-border flows—could help it stand out in a sector often dominated by purely tech-driven or comedic tokens. Observers see this PayFi approach as possibly mirroring the early success of major players like XRP but focusing more on grassroots adoption. If LTC’s ETF ushers in a fresh wave of crypto positivity, watchers believe tokens addressing daily financial needs—like Remittix(RTX)—may ride the tide exceptionally well. Conclusion: What Sets February’s Winners Apart? Litecoin’s ETF momentum is an essential step toward mainstream crypto integration, overshadowing altcoin ETF filings for Solana and XRP that remain unacknowledged. Meanwhile, coins like Sui emphasize high-speed networks, and Remittix(RTX) focuses on bridging everyday finance for consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. With LTC’s climb already impressing investors, the door is open for these lesser-known gems to capture attention in a bullish February. Whether you’re watching the ETF race or hunting for the next big PayFi breakout, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX)—its mission to reduce cross-border friction could spark the same mainstream interest that helps entire ecosystems flourish.

This early nod gives Litecoin an edge over other pending altcoin ETFs like those for Solana and XRP, raising hopes that LTC could be the next cryptocurrency to gain widespread popularity. Meanwhile, analysts are also spotlighting two other notable contenders this February: Sui, a newly rebranded blockchain, and Remittix(RTX), a PayFi altcoin addressing everyday financial needs. Below, we delve into what’s driving Litecoin’s renewed enthusiasm and why Sui and Remittix(RTX) are also seen as potential top performers. Litecoin’s Early ETF Nod: A Significant Lead Over Solana & XRP Litecoin, which originated as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, has recently experienced a 17% price increase after the SEC acknowledged Canary Capital’s proposal for a Litecoin ETF. Analysts point out that this development places it ahead of Solana and XRP, which have yet to receive similar recognition for their filings. Should the ETF receive approval, it could attract substantial mainstream capital, potentially elevating LTC to prices not seen since 2021. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas noted that the current filing meets most requirements, fueling speculation that final approval might be relatively straightforward. Critics argue that the similarities between Litecoin and Bitcoin could make regulators more inclined to approve a product focused on LTC. There’s also an expectation that the current SEC leadership might be more favorable towards crypto, given acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s positive stance on digital assets. If the ETF is approved, it could further legitimize crypto within traditional financial sectors, boosting liquidity and wider adoption. Although Solana and XRP remain strong contenders, the current race for altcoin ETFs seems to favor LTC for now. Sui and Remittix (RTX): Other Altcoins Making Waves As discussions around ETFs continue, analysts are also focusing on Sui and Remittix(RTX) as potential stars in February. Sui, having undergone a rebrand, aims to enhance transaction speeds and scalability for dApps, making it appealing to developers seeking fast networks. On the other hand, the more consumer-oriented Remittix (RTX) emerges as a PayFi solution that connects FIAT and crypto for international payments. Consider a traveling event planner in Latin America who often sends money to international partners. Traditional methods can be costly with high fees, whereas Remittix (RTX) offers quick wallet-to-cash options without the usual bank fees. To date, Remittix (RTX) has amassed over $10.5 million and sold about 430 million tokens. Each token is currently priced at $0.0512. The practical advantages of this altcoin—such as reduced wire transfer costs and easier cross-border transactions—could help it stand out in a market often dominated by tech-centric or meme-based tokens. Analysts see this PayFi model as potentially echoing the initial success of major players like XRP but with a stronger focus on grassroots adoption. If LTC’s ETF brings a new wave of positivity to the crypto world, those focusing on everyday financial solutions—like Remittix(RTX)—could benefit significantly. Conclusion: What Distinguishes February’s Top Picks? Litecoin’s ETF momentum is a crucial step towards mainstream crypto adoption, overshadowing unacknowledged altcoin ETF filings for Solana and XRP. Meanwhile, altcoins like Sui focus on high-speed networks, while Remittix(RTX) aims to bridge daily financial needs for consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. As LTC’s ascent already impresses investors, there’s potential for these under-the-radar coins to gain attention in a promising February. Whether you’re observing the ETF contest or searching for the next significant PayFi breakthrough, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX)—its goal to ease cross-border transactions could ignite the same kind of mainstream interest that helps entire ecosystems thrive.

The cryptocurrency has recently seen increased buying interest, with firms adding DOGE to their holdings. At press time, Dogecoin price was down 10% trading at $0.2637, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $4.36 billion. Despite recent volatility, market watchers anticipate an upward trend based on historical price patterns and renewed institutional interest. Will Dogecoin’s Price Rally 300%? Dogecoin has experienced notable price fluctuations, with a recent 10.94% decline in the last 24 hours. However, analysts remain optimistic, pointing to a potential breakout. In the last week, DOGE price has plummeted by 17% in the last week and 31% in the long term startetgy. Traders have observed similarities between the current market cycle and the 2020-2021 bull run, where Dogecoin underwent two major corrections before a strong price surge. Crypto analyst Javon Marks has projected a rise to $0.6533, an increase of over 80% from current levels. He further suggests that a move beyond this threshold could push Dogecoin above $1.25, representing a 333% gain. Another analyst, Kevin, has also identified patterns aligning with the previous bull cycle, reinforcing the outlook for a strong recovery. Institutional Investors Show Renewed Interest in Dogecoin Companies are beginning to accumulate Dogecoin, signaling growing confidence in its long-term potential. Neptune Digital Assets, a blockchain company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, has recently acquired 1,000,000 Dogecoin tokens through a strategic derivative purchase. The firm acquired DOGE at an average price of $0.37 per token on December 27, 2024. Neptune has also expanded its crypto portfolio with a recent purchase of 20 Bitcoin at an average price of $99,833 per BTC. This move aligns with the company’s strategy of strengthening its digital asset holdings. Neptune’s CEO, Cale Moodie, stated that the firm remains committed to acquiring more assets while managing leverage risk. This move follows Grayscale’s launch of a Dogecoin Trust early Friday morning, providing institutional and accredited investors with a regulated way to invest in the cryptocurrency. DOGE Price Historical Patterns Hint at Breakout Market analysts have compared Dogecoin’s current cycle to previous trends, noting similarities in price corrections and rebounds. The previous bull run saw two major corrections before Dogecoin surged to new highs. In the ongoing cycle, the cryptocurrency has followed a similar pattern, with the first correction leading to a 65% decline and the second dropping 58.18%. If Dogecoin follows past trends, analysts believe it could experience a strong recovery, potentially reaching $1.25. Some market watchers have set even higher price targets, suggesting that DOGE could rally towards $4 if conditions align with previous growth patterns.

Table of Contents Diplomatic talks spark ETH recovery Ethereum ecosystem updates Can Ethereum hold its ground? Ethereum price prediction: will the downtrend reverse? Diplomatic talks spark ETH recovery Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price has had a rough few days, with a sharp drop to $2,150 on Feb. 3, the lowest it has been since September 2024. The decline came as financial markets reacted to new U.S. tariffs, which took effect on Feb. 1. The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods, leading to uncertainty across global markets, including crypto. Within hours, diplomatic efforts were underway. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on X that he had spoken with Donald Trump and secured a temporary 30-day pause on the tariffs while both countries worked on a broader border security agreement.

Following these developments, market sentiment improved , and Ethereum’s price has rebounded to $2,700 as of this writing on Feb. 4. At one point, ETH briefly touched $2,900 after Trump halted tariffs on Canada and Mexico.

So, what’s really happening in Ethereum’s ecosystem, and how could it impact Ethereum’s price prediction in the days ahead? Let’s dive deeper. Ethereum ecosystem updates Ethereum has been making critical changes to improve scalability and transaction efficiency. Gas limit increase and scalability improvements On Feb. 3, validators approved an increase in Ethereum’s gas limit for the first time since 2021, marking the first adjustment in the post-Merge era. The increase raised the gas limit from 30 million to over 31 million units, with a maximum capacity of 36 million expected soon. Unlike previous changes that required a hard fork, the adjustment took effect automatically after more than half of the validators signaled their support. Gas represents the computational power needed to execute transactions and smart contracts on Ethereum. Every action on the network incurs a gas cost, and the gas limit determines the total computational work that can be processed in a single block. When transaction volume exceeds this limit, users either wait for inclusion in a later block or pay higher fees to have their transactions prioritized. Raising the gas limit increases the number of transactions and operations that can fit within a block, improving overall throughput and easing congestion. The change also allows more complex decentralized applications to function smoothly, benefiting the growing ecosystem of financial applications, NFT platforms, and on-chain services. However, while raising the gas limit helps improve transaction capacity, it does not address Ethereum’s core limitations in cost and speed. For instance, Ethereum handles 1 to 1.5 million daily transactions, while Solana processes between 60 and 65 million. The difference is substantial, with Solana not only processing exponentially more transactions but also doing so at a fraction of the cost, making long-term scalability a persistent challenge. Ethereum’s market position and competitive challenges To address these concerns, Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade, set to go live in early 2025, is expected to enhance network scalability further, particularly for layer-2 solutions. A key part of this upgrade involves increasing the blob target from three to six. Blobs are large data packets used in layer-2 scaling solutions, allowing them to store transaction data temporarily rather than writing it directly onto Ethereum’s main chain. Expanding blob capacity effectively increases the throughput of layer-2 networks, making them faster and cheaper. Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum ( ARB ), Optimism ( OP ), and zkSync ( ZK ) already play a crucial role in reducing congestion and gas fees for Ethereum users. Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 network in terms of total value locked, has seen consistent growth due to its ability to batch multiple Ethereum transactions into a single compressed proof, significantly cutting costs. Optimism follows a similar approach but integrates an incentive model that distributes OP tokens to projects building on its network. zkSync, which leverages zero-knowledge rollups, provides an even more advanced scaling solution, offering near-instant transactions with lower fees. While these layer-2 solutions help alleviate Ethereum’s congestion issues, they highlight a fundamental contrast between Ethereum and its competition. Unlike Ethereum, which relies on additional layers to scale, other blockchain ecosystems have built-in scalability. Solana, Avalanche ( AVAX ), and even emerging players like Sei ( SEI ) are capable of handling large transaction volumes without requiring external scaling solutions. Beyond technical upgrades, Ethereum’s market position has also been facing pressure. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped to 0.027 as of Feb. 4, its lowest level since March 2021 and nearly 50% lower than a year ago. ETH/BTC price chart | Source: TradingView As Bitcoin continues to gain dominance in both liquidity and investor interest, Ethereum’s relative valuation remains under scrutiny. Can Ethereum hold its ground? Ethereum’s recent price drop to $2,150 on Feb. 3 was not just a reaction to broader economic uncertainty but also served as a market reset, clearing out excessive leverage that had built up in Ethereum’s open interest. “There was a lot of garbage low-quality leverage long open on Ethereum which got closed when price touched the 2100 area,” noted one analyst, highlighting a $4 billion reduction in open interest that ultimately helped stabilize the market. This dump was probably the best thing that happened to Ethereum.

This was a healthy Dump for ETH. pic.twitter.com/bfbdM3SMbM — Emperor👑 (@EmperorBTC) February 3, 2025 With those positions flushed out, Ethereum’s price recovery to $2,700 was driven by spot demand rather than excessive leverage, signaling a healthier foundation for future price movement, he added. From a technical perspective, Ethereum briefly dipped below its 200-week moving average, a significant level that has often acted as a major support zone. “ETH may have offered the sweetest gift of 2025, dipping below the 200 WMA in the early morning and testing the 0.618 Fib,” another trader pointed out, referring to key retracement levels that have marked past cycle bottoms. $ETH may have offered the sweetest gift of 2025 dipping below the 200 WMA in the early morning and testing the 0.618 Fib, as it did in August and Sept. Price is already back above the 200 WMA now That being said, getting $ETH around the 200 WMA is the same as buying a Mega Cap… pic.twitter.com/g5xtEAz5Jf — The Long Investor (@TheLongInvest) February 3, 2025 While price has already reclaimed the 200 WMA, previous instances where Ethereum tested this level in August and September 2024 led to strong recoveries. However, the broader macro landscape still presents risks. The recent market dip was triggered by escalating U.S. tariffs, a policy shift that briefly shook global financial markets. While diplomatic resolutions have provided temporary relief, uncertainties remain, particularly around potential retaliatory measures or further economic restrictions. If global liquidity tightens or risk sentiment weakens, Ethereum’s ability to sustain a recovery could face challenges. Another factor to watch is Ethereum’s ability to maintain market dominance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ). The ETH/BTC ratio has been on a downtrend, reflecting a shift in investor preference toward Bitcoin, which has seen stronger institutional flows. Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and the recent gas limit increase could support its ecosystem growth, but these improvements need to translate into tangible benefits for users and developers to sustain long-term demand. Ethereum price prediction: will the downtrend reverse? The latest market reset, which cleared out billions in leveraged positions, has left Ethereum in a healthier position, but what happens next depends on a mix of factors—scalability upgrades, adoption, competition, and economic conditions. Ethereum price prediction 2025 Ethereum’s price action in 2025 is expected to be shaped by its ability to scale efficiently while maintaining strong demand within its ecosystem. DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an average of $5,510, with a potential peak of $6,037, while Changelly takes a more bullish stance, predicting an average of $6,124 and a maximum of $7,194. Joe, co-founder of DeAgentAI, told crypto.news that the recent price action fits a broader historical pattern. “Short-term bearish signals—like the one flagged on Feb. 3—often require nuanced interpretation.” He pointed to historical setups from 2023 and 2024 that triggered sharp reversals, suggesting traders should watch for Ethereum’s reaction to key support levels. Ethereum price prediction 2027 If Ethereum continues leading the smart contract space and scaling solutions mature, ETH could see a rise in 2027. DigitalCoinPrice projects an average of $9,580 with a peak at $10,098, while Changelly paints an even stronger outlook, predicting an average of $12,316 and a maximum of $14,527. At the same time, DeFi growth, NFT innovation, and Ethereum’s role in real-world asset tokenization could provide fresh demand for ETH. However, if risk assets face tightening conditions, ETH’s price could face headwinds despite fundamental improvements. Ethereum price prediction 2030 Meanwhile, long-term forecasts see Ethereum reaching levels that once seemed distant. DigitalCoinPrice estimates an average price of $14,829 in 2030, with a high of $15,108, while Changelly provides a much more aggressive projection, predicting an average of $40,055 and a potential peak of $47,066. That being said, long-term predictions always come with risks. Ethereum faces competition from Solana, Avalanche, and emerging blockchain networks, all aiming to offer lower fees and higher speeds. While ETH prediction models remain optimistic, it’s essential to combine technical forecasts with real-world adoption trends before making any long-term commitments.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC and a post on the ministry’s official Telegram channel , the government wants to create a “unified registry” as part of its ongoing efforts to regulate the mining sector. Russia’s Deputy Minister of Energy Yevgeny Grabchak unveiled the proposal at a “working meeting” on mining this week. Why Does Russia’s Energy Ministry Want Crypto Mining Hardware Register? The ministry thinks this measure will help it keep tabs on crypto miners as it looks to “increase the effectiveness of regional bans.” Russian Ministry of Energy officials speak about crypto mining at a meeting on February 3. (Source: Minergo Rossii/Telegram) Moscow is extremely keen to develop its crypto mining sector. Recently, some state-run organs have been given the green light to develop their crypto mining-related projects . These could see crypto mining projects launched in the Russian Far East and in other parts of the country with surplus power. However, Russian decision-makers are worried that a surge in mining could cause power shortages in energy-deficient areas. While US-led export controls on Russia have primarily targeted weapons components and high-end chips, a less threatening product shows just how hard it will be for Donald Trump to squeeze Vladimir Putin’s economy: Japanese grand pianos. https://t.co/P68AgUBjac — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 4, 2025 Power Problems? Some parts of the nation are already experiencing crypto mining-related power shortages. Moscow has responded with regional wintertime bans on mining in several parts of the country. But these bans do not appear to have made much of a dent on the nation’s wide network of “grey” and illegal miners. May operators appear to be flaunting the bans. Thus, the ministry appears to think it will be able to keep tabs on miners by forcing them to report on their mining rig purchases. The TEC-27 power plant near Moscow, Russia. (Source: PJSC Mosenergo/Anna Samarino [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Growth Potential Grabchak’s proposal would see Moscow create a single register of “equipment without which cryptocurrency mining is impossible.” “The fundamental task of the registry will be optimizing the mechanisms for identifying mining activities. This will help us effectively enforce bans on mining in regions where it is prohibited.” Russian Energy Ministry Additionally, the ministry said, the registry could help boost crypto mining in other regions. The registry will help economic growth, including through the introduction of new IT solutions, the ministry added. Russia’s Energy Ministry has spearheaded work on the bans, which some provinces already want to see extended . Furthermore, Grabchak claimed that Russian crypto miners “have increased their electricity consumption by 14% in the past two years.” He added that crypto miners “have used up all available capacity in some areas.” And this means “new consumers (miners)” “cannot connect to these networks,” Grabchak said.

Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced a stablecoin bill today. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said he plans to try to move that bill through Congress before a larger crypto market structure bill. But he added that he hopes to have both on the President’s desk within the administration’s first 100 days. In part, he said, that could be possible because both pieces of legislation have had bipartisan support in the past session of Congress. Sen. Scott pointed out that the market structure bill being worked on in the Senate will be a bipartisan one continuing the work that Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) did in the Senate and the FIT 21 legislation that passed in a bipartisan vote in the House last year.

In his opening remarks, Sacks shared that “the President said in his executive order in the first week that it’s the policy of his administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology and related technologies across all sectors of the economy.” He also reminded the audience that in that executive order, the President established both a working group for digital assets as well as a mandate for the group. “Our objective is to accomplish the task the President assigned for us in his EO, which is to propose a Federal regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of digital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States,” said Sacks. The ""Golden Age"" For The Bitcoin And Crypto Industry Begins Sacks also contextualized the significance of this new administration’s not being antagonistic to the Bitcoin and crypto industry, especially in light of what transpired under the Biden administration. “I’ve talked to many founders over the last few years and they’ve told me repeatedly that the number one thing they need from Washington is regulatory clarity,” he said. “They just want to know what the rules of the road are so they can abide by them. We’re coming off frankly four years of arbitrary prosecution and persecution of crypto companies where the SEC wouldn’t tell founders what the rules were and then they would prosecute them. Many founders even told me stories of being debanked personally just because they had founded a crypto company,” he added. Before concluding his opening remarks, Sacks noted that he looks forward to working with the politicians hosting the conference alongside him — Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman French Hill (R-AR), Senator John Boozman (R-AR) and Congressman (R-PA) — in “creating a golden age for digital assets.” Senator Scott began by stating that this “golden age has begun” and that “the good news is that it’s going to get better.” He also noted that he plans to “work synergistically with the House and the Senate, with the White House leading the way” when it comes to passing bills on digital assets. The U.S. At The Forefront Of Bitcoin And Crypto Innovation Rep. Hill stressed that the United States should be leading the way, not falling behind when it comes to the digital asset industry. “We don’t want to be behind in financial technology and digital assets in the United States, [and] our innovators need clarity,” said Rep. Hill. “They need to know what the rules of the road are.” He also stated that he’s forming a working group between the House Financial Services Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, the House Agriculture Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee to craft a clear regulatory framework. Senator Boozman highlighted the fact that not all crypto assets are the same (without necessarily singling bitcoin out). “Some assets are commodities, some are securities,” said Senator Boozman, who noted that different regulatory agencies should oversee different crypto assets accordingly. Rep. Thompson walked the audience through the stages of the Internet, pointing out the fact that the internet today has become the “Internet of value.” “America really was the leader when it came to Internet 1.0, and [with] Internet 2.0, again, it was America that led that for the world,” said Rep. Thompson. “Internet 3.0 is what we’re talking about today, and that’s the Internet of value — and we’re approaching it in a principled way.” This “principled way” includes protecting consumers while still offering innovators in the Bitcoin and crypto industry space to foster innovation, according to Rep. Thompson. “The opportunities [in crypto] are unimaginable,” said Rep. Thompson. “I know that [David Sacks] is laser focused on bringing certainty to digital asset markets.” During a question and answer session, Senator Scott noted that bipartisan efforts are being made around crypto in the Senate. “Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand are coming together for the market structure bill ,” he said. Comments On Anti-Money Laundering Regulation When asked about reconsidering Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws as they pertain to crypto, Senator Scott said he’s open to it. “I think that the broader conversation should not be about digital assets alone,” said Senator Scott. “It’s about bad actors doing bad things by any means necessary.” Rep. Hill chimed in regarding AML regulations, stating that they should exist, much like they do in the analog financial space. Educational Efforts Rep. Thompson brought up the importance of educating those in the House and Senate about crypto assets, given that it’s still a relatively new subject. “Member education is what our first goal is here,” he said. Rep. Hill echoed his sentiment. “A key element now is the education and technical assistance that can be provided to members both in the House and Senate,” he said. Sacks also offered his thoughts on this topic. “Part of what we’re here to do is provide resources on education,” he said, adding that some of the educators can be “luminaries in the industry.” As Sacks spoke on this topic, he also differentiated between Bitcoin and all other crypto assets and networks. “Crypto can be an esoteric subject, and it is good to explain it, to demystify it,” said Sacks. “You’ve got the cryptocurrency itself like bitcoin, [and then other assets that] run on blockchains, which are just distributed ledgers.” The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Before the conference concluded, Sacks also addressed the prospect of the U.S. creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . “One of the things that the President instructed us to do was to evaluate the idea for a Bitcoin reserve,” said Sacks. “So, that is one of the first things we’re going to look at as part of the internal working group in the administration.”",Trump|Politics|Politicians|President Trump|Politics|Regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-02-04 23:39:46

KyberSwap, Indexed Finance Fraudster Charged According to the Monday press release , the 22-year-old man broke through KyberSwap’s coding to artificially alter the prices within the protocol’s liquidity pools. “Medjedovic then calculated precise combinations of trades that would cause the KyberSwap AMM to “glitch,” in his words, allowing him to steal tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from the liquidity pools,’ the United States Attorney’s Office states. Shortly after the hack, Medjedovic attempted to extort KyberSwap’s developers for control of the platform and its DAO, ultimately stealing $48.8 million worth of coins from the crypto collective.

In an October 2021 incident, Medjedovic manipulated prices on Indexed Finance’s index pools using borrowed cryptocurrencies, resulting in over $16.5 million being drained from investors. The following year, the now-indicted Medjedovic conspired with an unnamed accomplice to launder the pocketed funds through fraudulent crypto exchange accounts while further hiding their origins through the use of a crypto mixer. “Hackers can at times be painted in a flattering light by pop culture, some admiring their skills and acumen,” stated FBI Assistant Director in Charge Dennehy. “They’re stealing money that isn’t theirs, and they’re breaking the laws of this country.” “We allege Andean Medjedovic violated several of those laws, and he, along with all the other cyber criminals who believe they’re untouchable will face justice,” he added. Andean Medjedovic Facing 90 Years Behind Bars Despite this month’s indictment, The New York Times reports that Medjedovic views himself as a crypto “pirate” and has been at large since 2021. According to reports, the U.S. Attorney’s Office allegedly believes that the one-time University of Waterloo student is currently on the lam from the charges somewhere outside of the United States. Medjedovic has been charged with one count of money laundering, one count of money laundering conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, and one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer.

The vote will determine whether the exchange resumes trading or undergoes liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act. If approved, the restructuring plan could see trading recommence by April 2025, with initial payouts starting within 10 business days. WazirX Creditors To Vote On Restructuring Plan According to a recent statement from the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, creditors will vote on a restructuring plan to recover losses from the WazirX hack. The proposed plan outlines a 52% immediate debt settlement, with the remaining 48% to be paid from future profits and asset recoveries. The vote follows approval from the Singapore High Court, allowing WazirX creditors to decide the exchange’s future. If the plan is accepted by at least 75% of creditors, trading may resume by April 2025, and payouts will begin within 10 business days. In addition, the development comes days after the Singapore High Court granted WazirX approval in late January to convene a Scheme meeting. This meeting will allow creditors to vote on the proposed recovery plan, facilitating a structured repayment of unstolen funds. What Happens If Plan Fails? If WazirX creditors reject the restructuring plan, the exchange will undergo liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act. This could postpone repayments until 2030, significantly reducing the chances of full recovery for affected users. Industry experts have warned that liquidation could lead to unpredictable asset distribution. The timeline for payouts would be extended, and the value of recoverable assets could decrease due to market volatility and operational challenges. Source: X Planned Recovery Measures And Future Operations To facilitate debt repayments and restore operations, WazirX plans to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) and introduce recovery tokens. The proposal also includes periodic buybacks to stabilize the platform and improve financial sustainability. Moreover, the restructuring plan will allocate Net Liquid Platform Assets to creditors as part of the recovery process. The company has been working closely with the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to ensure faster distribution and prevent prolonged delays in fund recovery. The vote will determine whether the Indian exchange can resume trading or enter a liquidation process. The restructuring plan is an alternative to liquidation. It offers creditors a more immediate path to fund recovery. With over 4.4 million creditors involved, the voting process is a crucial moment for the Indian exchange Meanwhile, WazirX continues its efforts to recover stolen funds, freezing $3 million in assets as part of its recovery plan. Founder Nischal Shetty emphasized that this is just the beginning, reaffirming the platform’s commitment to retrieving lost crypto.

According to the team, the upgrade “turns the Uniswap protocol into a platform for developers”. At the heart of the new version are special hooks contracts with detailed parameter customization for pools, swaps, fees and order interactions. The creators noted that v4 is the cheapest version of the protocol to date. Organizing pools will be 99.9% cheaper than the previous iteration, Uniswap v3. Swap users have been promised savings on multicast exchanges. According to a statement from the team, the development utilized suggestions from “hundreds of community members.” The update code went through nine security audits, and as part of the bounty program, the company paid out $15.5 million. No critical vulnerabilities were found. In July 2023, the Uniswap team announced that it would launch the fourth version of the protocol within four months of the Dencun hardfork on the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly before that, the creators published a “draft” of the v4 code, which had not yet undergone a number of audits and refinements.

Key support levels are $4.55, $4.28, and $3.60, crucial for stability. Experts believe Polkadot may surge past $50, possibly revisiting its $55 high. Polkadot (DOT) has taken a hit, with its price dropping sharply and leaving many to wonder what’s next. This isn’t just a small dip—it’s a major setback for the cryptocurrency, causing some concern about its short-term future. Before this drop, Polkadot had been trading above $6, riding a wave of optimism, with its price rising over 12% amid hopes that a Polkadot exchange-traded fund (ETF) could soon launch in the United States. The excitement kicked off last week when digital asset manager 21Shares filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission to launch a Spot Polkadot ETF. Polkadot Price: Key Levels to Watch Polkadot is currently in a correction phase after reaching a high. The price is currently trading near the $4.80 level and is trying to break above the $5 target. DOT closed the previous session at $5.14 and key resistance levels are at $6.10 and $5.94.

It’s about building trust, establishing value, and setting the stage for long-term success. Web3Bay is taking a methodical, transparent approach with its 28-stage token presale, aiming to balance supply and demand while solidifying its position as the highest potential crypto. This strategic roadmap is not just about raising capital; it’s about fostering sustainable growth and investor confidence. The current stage, Stage 4, illustrates this carefully planned progression. Web3Bay has already garnered significant interest, raising $1.07 and distributing 270 million tokens. At the current price of $0.004562625 per token, early adopters have the opportunity to participate at a favorable entry point. The projected ROI at launch is over 6,400%, a compelling figure that underscores the potential of this structured model. Strategic Token Allocation: Fueling Long-Term Value What distinguishes Web3Bay’s presale is its emphasis on controlled token availability. Each stage brings a reduction in the number of tokens offered, creating a sense of scarcity that can contribute to price stability at launch. Early stages might release a greater volume of tokens, but subsequent stages gradually tighten the supply. This approach not only rewards early believers in the project’s vision but also helps prevent market saturation. By the final stages, the limited availability is designed to maintain demand and support price integrity – qualities often associated with the highest potential crypto. This systematic approach stands in contrast to many “all-at-once” token sales that can flood the market, often leading to volatile price swings. Web3Bay’s stage-based strategy offers a clear, predictable structure. It ensures that the project enters the market with a balanced, sustainable ecosystem, avoiding a sudden influx of tokens that could create instability. This controlled release schedule positions Web3Bay as the highest potential crypto. A Foundation for Future Growth: More Than Just Fundraising Fundraising and token distribution are just the initial steps. Web3Bay’s structured presale is part of a broader roadmap designed to achieve the project’s long-term objectives. By carefully scaling funding through incremental price increases, Web3Bay can concentrate on sustainable development rather than relying solely on initial hype. This strategy provides the team with the resources needed to fulfill its promises while building confidence among investors and future users. Each stage builds upon the previous one, generating natural momentum. As the price gradually increases, it reflects the growing interest and trust in the project. The staged structure also provides opportunities for Web3Bay to regularly update its community, keeping them informed and engaged. By the time the project launches, it will have a solid foundation, a strong community base, and a price that more accurately reflects its market potential. This measured approach is a key factor in Web3Bay’s potential as a highest potential crypto. Open Communication: Building Confidence and Trust Transparency is central to Web3Bay’s presale strategy. By clearly outlining each stage and openly communicating pricing, token availability, and overall progress, Web3Bay is building a relationship of trust with its supporters. Potential investors can easily see where the project stands, what’s coming next, and how their participation fits into the overall vision. The gradual token release and ongoing updates help prevent misinformation or confusion that can sometimes occur during rapid token sales. Instead of rushing the process, Web3Bay ensures its backers are well-informed, increasing confidence and reducing uncertainty. This commitment to transparency, combined with a well-structured presale, strengthens Web3Bay’s standing as the highest potential crypto. A Path to Stability: Beyond the Initial Launch Web3Bay’s 28-stage presale is more than just a fundraising mechanism; it’s a carefully designed roadmap aimed at fostering long-term growth and market stability. The gradual reduction in token availability supports price integrity, the measured price increases build momentum and trust, and the ongoing transparency reinforces community confidence. With $970,000 already raised, 250 million tokens sold, and the price per token steadily increasing, Web3Bay’s presale structure is demonstrating its effectiveness. Early participants are positioned for significant returns, and the project is on track to achieve a launch price that reflects genuine market interest rather than short-lived speculation. This structured, transparent approach to fundraising and token distribution not only supports a successful launch but also lays a strong foundation for continued success. With its clear vision and measured strategy, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the highest potential crypto , potentially benefiting both its early backers and the wider community.

Could 2025 bring another golden opportunity? Top analysts say RCO Finance (RCOF), Sui (SUI), and (XRP) might be the next big winners. They believe these must buy altcoins can turn a small $1,000 investment into $1 million. Let’s look at why experts are so confident. 1. RCO Finance Some say RCO Finance could be the next big name in crypto. It’s a DeFi trading platform that stands out because it brings AI into finance. This makes trading easier for everyone and removes some of the usual barriers that stop people from getting involved. A key feature of RCO Finance’s offering to traders is its AI-powered Robo Advisor. This is a tool that helps you make better decisions by trading how you like, based on your risk tolerance and goals. Think of it as a portfolio manager, but one that is automated such that you are profitable without the heavy lifting that comes with personal trading or the fees that come with portfolio managers. In early 2024, many traders lost money when Telegram-based coins crashed after Notcoin launched. With the robo advisor, they could have avoided big losses. What’s more, the platform prioritizes security by conducting regular audits of its smart contracts. SolidProof , a trusted Web3 auditor, conducts these audits to guarantee the safety of investors’ funds. Another thing that makes RCO Finance different is that it doesn’t require KYC, which protects user privacy. It also lets users stake their assets and earn rewards. This can help investors grow their money over time without needing to do much. The platform recently launched its beta version and is letting users test its AI-driven tools. More updates are expected, which could increase interest even further. With strong security measures in place, traders have another reason to consider RCOF as a key pick for Q1 2025. 2. Sui In the world of blockchain, speed is more than just a bonus. It’s something platforms need to compete. That’s where SUI comes in. It can handle huge amounts of transactions without slowing down. Many developers and companies see it as one of the best crypto to buy because it works faster than others still using old methods. But speed isn’t the only thing SUI brings to the table. It also makes life easier for developers. Imagine a small team in Latin America trying to build an app for gig workers. With SUI, they can do it without struggling with slow networks or system crashes. This is a big deal for anyone working on new projects in the crypto world. Meanwhile, SUI’s price movement has been slow recently. SUI is valued at $3.74, a 3.36% decrease in its value from last week. Sui’s recent integration into Phantom Wallet will increase its availability and usage, making SUI one of the must buy altcoins. This could push its price to $5 soon. 3. XRP One of XRP’s biggest strengths is speed. The network can handle over 1,500 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the crypto world. It also keeps costs low, which is why many see it as one of the must buy altcoins for quick payments. Businesses and individuals looking for a reliable way to send money worldwide find it useful. XRP continues to be a popular choice. Its speed, low fees, and ability to handle many transactions make it stand out. Ripple’s latest XRP Markets Report showed that the company held 4,485,366,320 XRP at the end of 2024, giving investors insight into the current coin’s price and market trends. XRP’s performance has been dropping recently. XRP is trading at $2.88, which indicates a 4.95% fall from last week. Moving forward, some experts predict an uptrend for XRP due to the possibility of an XRP ETF soon. This could push the value of XRP to $4, making it one of the must buy altcoins. RCOF Becomes One of the Must Buy Altcoins: Join Now and See Your $1k Rise to $1 Million The RCOF presale is catching the interest of many crypto traders. Some believe it could become a major name in the market. So far, RCO Finance has raised more than $12 million, moving into the fifth stage of its presale. Right now, the RCOF token costs $0.10. Experts think that when it officially launches, the price could jump to somewhere between $0.40 and $0.60. If that happens, early investors might see a return of over 670%, making it one of the must buy altcoins. Some analysts are even more confident. They believe they could easily turn an investment of $1,000 into $1 million quickly. With so much talk around the RCOF token, many traders are keeping a close eye on it.

BlockDAG’s Biggest Offer Turns Up the Heat! SOL Price Analysis Hints at Recovery & XRP Supply Debate Resurfaces,https://thecoinrise.com/350-more-bdag-blockdags-biggest-offer-turns-up-the-heat-sol-price-analysis-hints-at-recovery-xrp-supply-debate-resurfaces/,"Solana, XRP, and BlockDAG are shaping up as strong contenders for the best crypto to buy now, each making headlines with key developments. The latest Solana (SOL) price analysis highlights its potential for recovery after briefly dipping below $195, with investors watching resistance levels to determine its next move. Meanwhile, discussions around XRP supply continue, sparking fresh debates about its total token limit. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing all the attention with its biggest offer yet — the FINALCALL700 bonus. This offer is fueling its record-breaking presale, offering a massive 350% extra BDAG with every purchase. With $191.5 million already raised and demand surging, early buyers rush to lock in this limited-time opportunity before BDAG’s price climbs. Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Recover After Dropping Below $195? The recent Solana (SOL) price analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency recently dropped below $195 before making a swift recovery. This decline followed a rejection near $280, sparking concerns about short-term movement. Despite the pullback, analysts believe the asset still has room for upward momentum, provided key resistance levels are broken. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests an oversold market, which could support a potential rally. For Solana to reach $500, it must first surpass resistance at $280 and $400, while maintaining support above $180 and $200. The Solana price analysis also highlights Bitcoin’s influence, as broader market trends continue to impact its trajectory. XRP Supply Debate: Why 100 Billion Cap Is Permanent Discussions around the XRP supply have resurfaced, with some questioning whether Ripple holds the ability to create additional tokens beyond the 100 billion originally issued. However, XRPL validator Vet has clarified that the network’s design prevents any increase in supply. The XRP Ledger includes an “invariant checker,” a security feature that ensures no new tokens can be minted. Unlike Bitcoin, which once faced an accidental inflation bug, XRPL’s structure makes such an issue highly unlikely. Additionally, XRP’s supply is decreasing over time due to transaction fees that burn small amounts with each transaction, reinforcing the token’s scarcity. FINALCALL700: 350% Bonus Drives BlockDAG’s $191.5M Presale BlockDAG’s presale is reaching new heights, and its latest offer, FINALCALL700, is making it even more appealing. For a limited time, every BDAG purchase comes with a 350% extra coin bonus, making this the most rewarding offer in BlockDAG’s history. Traders looking to maximise their holdings before launch are moving quickly, as this bonus significantly increases their BDAG count. For example, a $1,000 BDAG purchase with FINALCALL700 results in $4,500 worth of BDAG, an opportunity rarely seen in early-stage crypto sales. The BDAG coin presale has already raised $191.5 million and sold over 18.3 billion coins, making it one of the largest in the market. BDAG’s price has surged 2380% from $0.001 to $0.0248, fueling strong demand. The combination of its rapid growth and FINALCALL700 has many traders calling it the best crypto to buy now, as presale participation continues accelerating. The bonus isn’t just an extra incentive—it’s actively driving momentum, pushing BlockDAG toward new milestones as interest skyrockets. But what does the future hold for BDAG holders once the presale ends? Analysts predict a $1 price right after launch, positioning BDAG as a strong long-term contender. The FINALCALL700 may be the best chance to stake up on BDAG coins before prices climb even higher, but it won’t last forever. With demand accelerating, those still on the sidelines risk watching this opportunity slip away as BDAG moves toward its next phase. Final Thoughts: Where SOL, XRP & BDAG Stand Now? As the market continues to shift, each of these contenders presents a unique opportunity. The Solana (SOL) price analysis suggests a potential rebound, but breaking resistance levels will be key to its next rally. The XRP supply remains fixed at 100 billion, confirming its scarcity as discussions around its tokenomics settle. However, BlockDAG’s momentum is on another level. With FINALCALL700 offering 350% extra BDAG, demand is high and the presale has skyrocketed past $191.5 million. Analysts predict BDAG will hit $1 post-launch, making this presale phase a rare entry point for those looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Once the FINALCALL700 bonus disappears, so does the chance to secure extra BDAG coins at this affordable price.

The company has reportedly enlisted Jefferies Financial Group Inc. to assist with the potential listing. If the IPO happens, Bullish will go public among several cryptocurrency companies as hope rises that President Donald Trump will be friendly to crypto. Led by Chief Executive Officer Tom Farley, the exchange is growing internationally, with offices in the U.S., Hong Kong, Singapore, Gibraltar, and the Cayman Islands. Bullish pursues IPO as market conditions improve An IPO would see Bullish joining a growing number of companies in the sector moving ahead with plans to go public amid expectations that President Donald Trump will pursue a pro-crypto agenda. The firm once revealed its plans to go public in 2021 via an SPAC, only to shelve those plans. The new IPO discussions reflect the company’s shift in approach as market conditions improve and the regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies becomes more defined. Bullish is a subsidiary of Block.one, a blockchain software company subsidiary whose backers include Thiel, Alan Howard, Louis Bacon, and Richard Li. Block.one, whose co-founder and CEO Brendan Blumer also serves as Bullish’s chairman, launched the company in 2021 and capitalized Bullish with about $10 billion in digital assets and cash. Crypto firms set to reenter IPO market as regulatory landscape shifts Going public via an IPO was challenging for crypto firms under the Biden administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Chair Gary Gensler, was slow to review filings from companies like Circle, which initially pursued a public listing through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. However, following the collapse of FTX and the resulting investor skepticism toward the crypto market, Circle abandoned its plans in December 2022. Over the past four years, big crypto firms haven’t had much hope of going public, but all that’s set to change in January. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to reverse course on President Joe Biden’s digital asset crackdown is spurring hope that the initial public offering market could soon open to stablecoin provider Circle Internet Financial, trading platform Kraken, and other firms that have said they’d like to go public. Recently, Circle refiled for a traditional IPO, and there’s ample reason to think the stars will align for the firm and others like it to be successful this time. A representative of the firm said: Due to the nature of the registration process, we cannot comment. I can say that becoming a public company has always been a part of Circle’s core strategy, underscoring our commitment to trust and transparency. Circle spokesman. The Bullish IPO discussions are ongoing, and details, including timing and valuation, remain subject to change. Additional banks may also be brought in to support the offering. The representatives of Bullish and Block.one have not yet responded to the requests for comment, and a spokesman for Jefferies has declined to comment. Bullish’s IPO plans align with those of other crypto companies returning to the public markets. With more definitions of regulations and the positive shift in the investor’s mindset, more companies are expected to go for the public market.

Though no official information has been released concerning the IPO, Bloomberg reported that the Peter Thiel-backed firm may advance this push this year. Bullish Global IPO Is Not a Surprise According to the Bloomberg report , citing people familiar with the IPO , Bullish Global allegedly works with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. on the potential listing. Before this time, Bullish Global has been considering going public. Almost four years ago, it announced its intention to go public through a Special-Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). Despite the lofty plans, the firm soon broke from this move. According to the same sources, which requested to be anonymous due to the confidentiality of information, there are ongoing deliberations on the matter. However, they also clarified that details of the offering could change, which may include adding more banks to the existing lineup. Bullish Global made the news last year when it acquired the crypto media site Coindesk. Despite the claims of editorial independence, the platform has had to deal with management and editorial conflicts of interest. Bullish IPO and Top Crypto Candidates Beyond the Bullish IPO plans, many organizations are gradually moving towards going public. Popular stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial is still mulling the possibility of going public in the United States. Meanwhile, another Peter Thiel-backed firm, Bitpanda, has its sights set on public listing. In the case of Bitpanda, it has collaborated with Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to advise it on its next step. The crypto industry is advancing, with companies recording impressive earnings amid the turn of the bull run. According to Galaxy Research, at least four companies are on track to go public this year. Besides Circle, it named Fireblocks, Chainalysis, and Kraken the likely candidates to go public. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings’ CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed, against broad industry clamor, that there are no IPO plans . Should the Galaxy IPO come true, these firms will join Coinbase, MARA Holdings, and other crypto-native firms in the stock market. Favorable Crypto Policies To Help Noteworthy, President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance may have revived the US companies’ faith toward going public. It is worth noting that Thiel was one of those who supported the Republican politician around the time of his campaign. With the spotlight on the industry, regulatory shifts may also favor the service providers to go public. Bullish Global and Circle, with failed SPAC moves, may finally gain the IPO pathway to going public.

39928573,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=668671,1738714433,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39928573.jpeg,White House Crypto Czar David Sacks holds “disappointing” first press conference,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/white-house-crypto-czar-david-sacks-holds-disappointing-first-press-conference/,"David Sacks, the newly appointed White House Crypto Czar, walked into his highly anticipated press conference on Capitol Hill today and left many in the crypto community frustrated. His mission was to explain how President Trump’s administration plans to push the US into crypto dominance after years of chaos under Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto regime. Instead of providing the hard-hitting regulatory clearances everyone expected, Sacks played it safe with broad strokes, vague assurances, and a lot of talk about “the golden age of digital assets.” Sacks opened with gratitude, thanking leaders from both the House and Senate, including Chairmen Tim Scott, French Hill, John Boozman, and GT Thompson, who were all standing right beside him as you can see in the video below. “The president set this as a week-one priority,” Sacks said. “We’re committed to ensuring American dominance in digital assets.” Trump’s crypto vision triggers regulatory shake-up Trump’s executive order laid the groundwork for the Crypto Czar’s mission, which is to craft a federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, particularly stablecoins. Sacks pointed to the working group established under the executive order, which includes big names like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick, and incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now led by crypto-friendly commissioner Mark Uyeda until Paul Atkins gets Senate-confirmed, has also created a dedicated crypto task force, which is led by ‘Crypto Mom’ Hester Peirce, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. Sacks took a moment to vent about the damage done by the SEC’s previous approach. “I’ve talked to many founders who told me their biggest problem is regulatory uncertainty,” he said. “They were prosecuted without being told what they did wrong. Some were even debanked personally just for founding a crypto company.” Sacks blamed this hostility for pushing innovation offshore, something he and the administration are desperate to reverse. The Crypto Czar also made it clear that he wholeheartedly believes all financial assets are going digital, whether regulators are ready or not. “Just like every analog industry became digital, financial assets will follow,” he said. “We don’t want that innovation happening in other countries.” To drive the point home, Sacks referenced FTX’s collapse, which he said was proof of the dangers of offshore operations. “The biggest fraud in crypto history happened in the Bahamas,” he reminded the room. “Keeping innovation onshore means better consumer protection.” Stablecoins come first as Congress warms up to crypto Sacks repeatedly pointed out the importance of stablecoins in the administration’s strategy. He mentioned the bill introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, which plans to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins that would maintain the US dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency, as Cryptopolitan reported yesterday. “Stablecoins could create trillions in demand for US Treasuries and potentially lower long-term interest rates,” Sacks explained. French Hill, who is the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, confirmed that stablecoins would be prioritized over other crypto issues. “We’re moving fast on this,” Hill said. “Bipartisan support between the House and Senate is already in place, and we’ve learned from past efforts.” He referenced last year’s bipartisan success when 71 Democrats joined House Republicans to pass stablecoin legislation in the House, though it stalled in the Senate. Hill also praised Hester’s involvement. “Hester brings a clear-headed approach to crypto regulation,” he said. John Boozman, who is the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, explained why his committee, typically focused on farming, has a role in crypto regulation. “The CFTC oversees commodities, and some digital assets fall under that category,” he said. Boozman promised that collaboration between the SEC and CFTC would prevent jurisdictional battles from delaying progress. “We’ve worked separately before, but now we’re coming together with purpose.” AML laws under scrutiny; Bitcoin reserve under consideration Fred Peterson from Punchbowl News asked Sacks whether crypto-specific AML measures were on the table. Sacks responded cautiously. “We’re open to discussions,” he said, “but this isn’t just about digital assets. Bad actors exist in all financial systems.” One of the more intriguing moments came when Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schwanberger asked about Trump’s campaign trail promise to explore a Bitcoin reserve. Sacks confirmed that: “The president instructed us to look into it. We’re still waiting for some key officials to be confirmed, but this is one of the first things we’re reviewing.” He clarified that while a Bitcoin reserve is being explored, a crypto sovereign wealth fund would require separate discussions. GT Thompson, who is Chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said Congress is in sync with the White House’s goals, so any and all expectations of pto-crypto legislations are allowed.

From Dogecoin’s explosive rise to Shiba Inu’s unforgettable bull run, meme coins have consistently turned small investments into life-changing gains. And most recently, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) proved once again that meme coin magic is very much alive, making early investors massive returns in record time. But here’s the thing—crypto never sleeps, and a new golden opportunity is already knocking. With its bulls-backed community, staking rewards, and Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already live, BTFD Coin (BTFD) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s shaping up to be a movement. If you missed CHILLGUY’s rocket ride, don’t let history repeat itself—BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to join in February 2025 , gearing up to be the next legendary meme coin to watch. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad and Staking—A Community-Backed Powerhouse BTFD Coin isn’t just about memes and hype—it’s about community-driven growth, smart tokenomics, and explosive earning potential. While CHILLGUY had its run, BTFD’s Bulls Squad is setting a new standard for meme coin engagement and rewards. The Bulls Squad is a referral program designed to bring early believers massive rewards. Think of it like this: you refer friends, they buy BTFD, and you earn free tokens. It’s simple, it’s lucrative, and it’s already making waves. Imagine stacking up tokens just by bringing in more people to the movement—it’s like growing your own crypto empire before the token even lists! But that’s not all. BTFD Coin also features a Play-to-Earn game that went live on January 1st, 2025, letting users battle, trade, and earn tokens while having fun. And if staking is more your style, BTFD offers a whopping 90% APY, making it one of the best new meme coins to join in February 2025, offering one of the best passive income opportunities in the meme coin market today. Now, let’s talk numbers—Stage 14 is here, and BTFD is currently sitting at just $0.00016 per token. But this price won’t stick around for long. With over $5.93 million already raised, 69 billion tokens sold, and more than 10,200 bullish holders, the BTFD army is only getting stronger. How big could BTFD get? Let’s do the math. Listing price is $0.0006 and the projected price after launch is $0.006. If you invest $10,000 at today’s price of $0.00016, you’d get 62.5 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its predicted post-launch price of $0.006, that stash would be worth a massive $375,000! That’s enough to wipe out debt, put a down payment on a house, or even buy a Tesla. But to catch this wave, you’ve got to act fast. The price is set to increase with every stage, and with demand surging, the chance to grab BTFD at these low levels won’t last. How to Buy BTFD Coin? Set up your bullish wallet – Get MetaMask or Trust Wallet and secure your keys. Load up with BNB or ETH – You’ll need these to swap for $BTFD. Connect your wallet – Head to the presale page and get ready. Buy BTFD – Select your purchase amount and confirm. Receive your BTFD – Tokens will be claimable before listing. Stay updated – Staked rewards and game earnings will vest after launch.

With its laid-back branding, massive community engagement, and a dedicated meme culture, CHILLGUY attracted thousands of investors who saw their portfolios skyrocket.

The hype is building, the numbers are solid, and the Bulls Squad is turning early believers into crypto heavyweights.

The price dropped over 9% in just a few hours, hitting a low of $91,530, only to bounce back by more than 12% following reports that President Trump is negotiating with Mexico and Canada to lift tariffs. This shift in sentiment quickly fueled renewed optimism across the market. Related Reading: Solana Retraces TRUMP Meme Pump Gains – But Technicals Suggest A $300 Run Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s resilience amid uncertainty. He noted that BTC still looks much stronger than anything else in the market, maintaining a solid uptrend when viewed from a broader perspective. Despite the aggressive sell-off, Bitcoin remains structurally sound, with strong demand levels preventing deeper corrections. With BTC trading back above key levels, investors are watching closely to see if the cryptocurrency can sustain this momentum and push toward all-time highs. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can solidify its position as the dominant asset in the market or if further volatility will test its strength again. For now, Bitcoin appears to be leading the market recovery, proving its resilience once more. Bitcoin Holding Bullish Price Action Despite recent volatility and aggressive selling pressure, Bitcoin continues to show strength compared to altcoins, proving its dominance in the market. While many altcoins struggle to recover, BTC has rebounded quickly from its lows, reinforcing its position as the leading asset. Yesterday’s price action further confirmed that Bitcoin is still in control, and the long-anticipated altseason may be delayed until altcoins can catch up with BTC’s momentum. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s resilience. He noted that BTC is much stronger than anything else in the market and still looks perfectly fine when zooming out. According to Daan, Bitcoin’s demand remains significantly higher than other assets, especially during times of uncertainty. This is evident in the recent market movement, where BTC recovered swiftly while most altcoins remained stagnant or continued to drop. Daan’s analysis reveals that Bitcoin is currently trading within a defined range, with an all-time high (ATH) of $109K at the upper boundary and strong support at the $90K level. As long as BTC holds within this range, the potential for another breakout remains high. If bulls manage to push BTC above the ATH, a new bullish phase will begin, potentially leaving altcoins further behind. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target Another key factor driving Bitcoin’s dominance is institutional interest. The recent data from major on-chain analytics platforms reveals that Bitcoin accumulation remains strong among whales, with large holders continuing to add BTC despite market uncertainty. Unlike previous market cycles, where retail investors drove price surges, this rally appears to be fueled by institutions and long-term holders, making it more sustainable. Testing Key Demand Levels Bitcoin is testing crucial liquidity below the $100K mark, currently trading at $99,400 and attempting to find a strong footing before its next move. Price action remains highly unpredictable and volatile, with investors closely watching key levels for signs of a potential breakout or further downside. For BTC to confirm short-term strength, it must reclaim the $100K mark and hold it as support. This level is a psychological and technical barrier that, once secured, could trigger renewed bullish momentum. If Bitcoin struggles to maintain this level, further consolidation below $100K could follow, delaying any breakout attempts. The $98K level is another crucial support zone. As long as BTC stays above this mark, a push back above $100K remains highly likely. Losing this level could lead to a deeper retracement, testing lower demand zones before another attempt to reclaim higher levels.

HTX was formerly known as Huobi. The disclosure came in the middle of a string of posts on X touting the Decentralized USD (USDD), a stablecoin backed by subsidiaries of Sun’s Tron platform. In one of the posts, Sun says (translated from Chinese) that “even if Li Lin uses it, he can leave unscathed; USDD will give him every penny of the interest!” In the post, Sun continues by saying Li “concealed due diligence materials, creating a $30 million hole internally.” Furthermore: “I discovered it, exposed it, and after being exposed, he [Li] tried to weasel out of it and didn’t pay a cent.” Sun ended up lending the company money to cover the loss. “Fortunately, I had money back then,” he concluded. Sun has been posting heavily about USDD as Tron plans to issue a new version of USDD — USDD 2.0 — that will offer 20% APY on staking. Sun and Li’s numerous issues This is not the first issue that has arisen with the October 2022 sale of Li’s share in Huobi. In May 2023, Sun alleged that Li’s brother Li Wei obtained a large quantity of Huobi’s native HT token at no cost “through improper means” in a now-deleted X post. Sun promised to recover and destroy Li Wei’s HT, despite also claiming that Lin Wei sold the token. In June 2023, Li Lin filed a suit against Huobi Global in Hong Kong, claiming that his X-Spot company owned the rights to the Huobi trademark, despite the sale of his shares. According to Bloomberg, Li Lin went on to co-found New Huo Technology Holdings digital asset service platform. Harvard has called him the 39th most generous philanthropist in China. Justin Sun stays busy with finance and art The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Sun in March 2023 for the sale of purported crypto securities. Sun has invested over $30 million in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, where he already served as an adviser. Sun is probably best known to the public for his purchase for $6.2 million of a conceptual artwork that consisted of a banana taped to wall. He went on to eat the banana.

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With analysts closely watching OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , the token is proving to be a standout investment. Its record-breaking presale, exclusive availability, and massive growth potential make it a top choice for anyone looking to capitalize on crypto’s next breakout.

Starting at approximately $0.52 in November 2024, XRP’s price jumped to around $2.46 by early 2025, marking an increase of nearly 373%. It’s currently sitting at $2.65, which means more than a 400% increase over one year. This gave rise to all kinds of speculation about whether XRP would achieve a big breakout against BTC. If we take a look at the monthly price chart (courtesy of CoinMarketCap), it’s noticeable that XRP has been performing very well. However, this can always change when it comes to cryptocurrencies, though some experts and well-known traders have a positive stance regarding future developments. Expert Opinion: Bullish, but Cautious For instance, a few days ago, Peter Brandt said on X that even though he doesn’t care about XRP, there is no other way right now to define the chart other than a bull flag.

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 345,000 YouTube subscribers that Sui ( SUI ) may be repeating a historic pattern that could lead to a collapse. According to Pizzino, SUI saw an overbalance in time and price following its collapse to a low of $2.38. Pizzino explains that the overbalance means SUI went down longer in price and further in time than any corrective period it witnessed during this bull market. With the current setup, the trader says SUI may be following in the footsteps of its April to August 2024 price action when it initially crashed from about $2 to below $1 before witnessing another deep corrective move. “[Sui is] trying to hold the 50% level similar to what it did last time [in April 2024]. Okay, that was a 58% decline into this freak bottom ($0.43 in August 2024). So see that dump into this level. It’s almost exactly the same guys.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube He says if Sui cannot hold $2 as support on the daily chart it may dip to $1.60 or even lower, which would be in line with the 2024 pattern. “So if you get these next couple of panic lows, I’d be looking somewhere around back to $1.60, maybe even $1.10, $1.20 at those previous tops, maybe back down into that zone [around $0.73]. But we won’t worry about those yet. Let’s see if it actually gets back down to the $2 level.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube SUI is trading for $3.60 at time of writing, up 14% in the last 24 hours. ?

As 2025 unfolds, Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) remain popular choices, but a new contender, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is making waves with its AI-driven decentralized wallet and smart trading solutions. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale already attracting major interest, the question is clear: Will Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) keep up, or is WLTQ the next big thing? Let’s dive in and uncover what 2025 holds for these three altcoins and why WallitIQ (WLQT) could be your best bet right now. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Promising Future: The Presale Surge And What It Means For 2025 The ongoing presale for WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been a success, with the presale rapidly gaining traction. Investors are flocking to secure the token before the price rises further. With the presale gaining momentum, the future looks promising, and the project is gearing up for a major leap in 2025. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is a clear indicator of the project’s growing popularity and potential. With more people flocking to join, the presale continues to raise substantial funds, and with its ongoing pace, experts predict that WLTQ could see a substantial surge in value by 2025. As more investors jump on board, the presale success is just the beginning . This decentralized wallet is designed to improve the DeFi experience, making it easier for users to trade, invest, and participate in crypto markets. Features like exclusive airdrops, community rewards, AI chatbots, and performance tracking make the platform more than just a wallet; it’s a fully integrated ecosystem designed for both crypto enthusiasts and serious investors. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is redefining the way people interact with digital assets through its AI-powered, decentralized crypto wallet. With its focus on security, speed, and user-friendly features, the platform includes an MVP of Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App offering faster and safer crypto transactions. Additionally, transaction security is guaranteed through a Solidproof audit, affirming the safety of its ecosystem. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) tokenomics are designed for long-term growth and sustainability. With a limited supply of WLTQ tokens, early investors have a prime opportunity to secure their stake in the ecosystem. As the presale nears completion, WLTQ is poised to launch on major exchanges and is already listed on CoinMarketCap at a price of $0.0420 , increasing its visibility in the crypto market . XRP’s Path To New Heights In 2025 In 2024, XRP (XRP) broke its resistance and traded above $2, fueled by market optimism. Many experts predict a bullish 2025, with XRP (XRP) potentially reaching $5 or even $7 by mid-year. Key drivers of this growth include the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, bringing clarity to investors. Additionally, Ripple’s new RLUSD stablecoin is gaining momentum, and the potential approval of an XRP (XRP) ETF could attract institutional interest. With major players like Canary Capitals seeking approval, this could drive XRP (XRP) to new price heights, solidifying its position in the future of finance. Dogecoin’s Future: Potential For Growth Or Decline By 2025 Dogecoin, initially created as a meme coin, has evolved into a widely recognized cryptocurrency. As of the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.33 . Analysts have mixed predictions for its future; some anticipate that if social media hype and community support persist, Dogecoin could surpass $1. Conversely, a decline in interest might see it revert to around $0.10. However, not everyone is optimistic. Another big Dogecoin price prediction says the coin could crash down to $0.10 by 2025 if meme-driven momentum evaporates. Dogecoin fans shrug that off, claiming that a loyal community can push any dip back up, but some watchers say new tokens like WallitIQ (WLTQ) might lure investors away. What’s Next For Crypto Investors? As we look ahead to 2025, the crypto landscape is full of potential , but only a few projects stand out from the crowd. While Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) may have had their moments, they’re facing increasing competition from projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ), a game-changer in the world of decentralized finance. With its presale already generating massive excitement, WallitIQ (WLTQ) represents a promising investment opportunity, and this is the perfect time to get in early and secure your share of the tokens.

MANTRA has sharply bounced back from a significant price point, doubling its value for all holders. A recent review of Ethereum prices suggests a potential fall to $2,913 if it slips below $3,023. Web3Bay stands out by reducing doubts entirely. It hands control over its holders with trustless smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring openness. The platform’s presale success, raising over $1 million with 280 million tokens sold, signals strong market adoption. Web3Bay isn’t just attracting users; it’s drawing them into a transformative future. Mantra Surges 60%: What’s Next? The 60% increase in MANTRA demonstrates a strong recovery from an essential support level, securing 100% profits for all its holders. This achievement boosts investor confidence as MANTRA utilizes the latest technological innovations. Transaction activities on top exchanges like Binance ($746.8M) and OKX highlight vibrant market participation. With a positive market outlook and solid technological backing, MANTRA’s rise seems to have strong market and technological support. Ethereum Price Analysis: The Battle for $3,000 Current Ethereum price analyses indicate significant stress, with a recent 6.8% drop pushing it near the crucial $3,000 threshold. The market has seen $850 million in liquidations, emphasizing a growing bearish view. Data on Ethereum derivatives points to caution, with a decline in open interest and a drop in the long-to-short ratio, signaling waning confidence. If Ethereum breaks below $3,023, it could test $2,913, though any rebound around this level could provide temporary relief. How Web3Bay Ensures Trustless, Profitable, and Fair E-Commerce Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce with a safer, more effective, and cost-friendly platform powered by smart contracts. These contracts execute on their own, ensuring precision and fairness without the possibility of external tampering. By committing to relinquish ownership after distributing non-team tokens, Web3Bay guarantees a system free from central control, promoting transparency and fairness. At the core of Web3Bay’s operational model are the 3BAY token holders, who play an active role in guiding the platform’s decisions. They have a say in everything from fee structures to new feature integrations, making every important decision community-driven. Web3Bay is set to evolve into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enhancing its flexibility and maintaining its user-focused ethos. This transition is already garnering global interest. The presale for this web3 crypto has crossed the $1 million mark, with over 280 million tokens claimed. Investors getting in before the close of Stage 4 at a presale price of $0.004562625 per token have the prospect of a 4,200% gain upon launch, with a target price of $0.1959 per token. Final Say! The 60% surge in Mantra underscores the potential of robust technology and solid fundamentals, whereas Ethereum’s price faces increasing uncertainty. With substantial trading on Binance alone, Mantra’s climb reflects a solid foundation. Conversely, Ethereum risks falling to $2,913 without strong support at $3,023. While one shows stability, the other is uncertainty, yet Web3Bay provides a unique narrative. With an upcoming price increase at launch, early investors in this web3 crypto might realize a 4,200% return. However, with limited time left in presale Stage 4, timing is critical for those looking to invest.

After briefly rising above the $100,000 price mark on Tuesday, BTC has since fallen back and now hovers just above $99,000. The rebound that initially raised market sentiment appears to have been short-lived, as the cryptocurrency struggles to regain the upward momentum needed to break through higher resistance levels. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Price Crash Could Be a Buying Opportunity for Big Players Bitcoin Smart DCA Flashes—What This Means While BTC faces these ups and downs, Darkfost, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlighted a potential opportunity for investors employing a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. According to Darkfost, the Smart DCA indicator was recently triggered, suggesting that current price levels may be a “favorable” entry point for those looking to accumulate BTC over time. Darkfost explained that by comparing Bitcoin’s average price to its short-term realized price—ranging from one week to one month—this indicator aims to identify optimal zones for long-term accumulation. The analyst added: When executed properly, a DCA strategy can generate substantial returns in the short, mid, or long term, depending on the investor’s goals. However, this indicator should be used alongside other metrics and a broader market analysis for optimal accuracy and effectiveness. Signs of Bullish Momentum Emerge While short-term price fluctuations have rattled some investors, other analysts point to underlying trends that hint at bullish potential. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Onatt, observed that buyer activity is beginning to outweigh selling pressure. Related Reading: After The Bitcoin Crash: Will It Rise Or Drop Again? 5 Key Indicators Using data from Coinbase, Onatt noted a visible premium indicating strong demand for Bitcoin, even in the face of recent volatility. Furthermore, negative funding rates—driven by approximately $2 billion in long liquidations—suggest a market environment where buyers are taking advantage of discounted prices to position themselves for a potential upward movement. Onatt also explained: Bitcoin’s upward momentum remains likely as long as USDT dominance stays below 4.65%, signaling continued market confidence and potential for further recovery. Adding to this sentiment, analyst Ali identified a critical demand zone for Bitcoin between $96,475 and $99,360. According to Ali, as long as this range holds as a support level, the market outlook favors the bulls. A breakout above the $102,350 to $103,900 supply zone could further strengthen the bullish case, potentially setting the stage for a sustained recovery. #Bitcoin $BTC has reclaimed a critical demand zone between $96,475 and $99,360 as support. As long as this level holds, the odds favor the bulls; especially if the $102,350–$103,900 supply wall breaks. pic.twitter.com/FLpwRqYVuu — Ali (@ali_charts) February 4, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-05 02:00:45

This abysmal performance has seen crypto analysts predict that DOGE could continue plunging. As a result, investors are flocking to RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging AI altcoin that has raised over $12.73 million during its ongoing public presale. Why are Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pivoting toward RCO Finance (RCOF)? Let’s find out! Dogecoin Price Dumps 25% In A Week: What’s Next? Dogecoin has performed dismally over the past week, tumbling by double digits. On January 27, the Dogecoin price was trading at around $0.3335. After trading around this range for days, the Dogecoin price experienced a sharp drop on February 2. This slump came after Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below the $100,000 support level, triggering a bearish trend in the altcoin market. The resulting downtrend saw Dogecoin (DOGE) trade as low as $0.2477 on February 3. Notably, this price means Dogecoin (DOGE) has plunged 25% in a week. Moreover, experts expect the Dogecoin price to plummet further as investors migrate to tokens with better prospects. RCO Finance: A Trading And Investment Hub With AI Features With the Dogecoin price grappling with the renewed bearish trend in the crypto market, investors are searching for alternative investments to hedge against further losses. To address this need, investors are flocking to RCO Finance , a budding DeFi platform that supports over 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). By combining the crypto and TradFi industries, RCO Finance lets you create a robust investment portfolio that can withstand the current bear market. While this offering is impressive, it mainly complements RCO Finance’s top feature, an AI-powered robo advisor. The robo advisor is RCO Finance’s flagship feature because it leverages machine learning and advanced algorithms to analyze data from prominent sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. With the carefully curated data, the robo advisor is able to offer custom investment insights based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. These recommendations can tell you when to enter, double down, or exit positions for the highest possible returns and minimal risk exposure. For example, the robo advisor could have suggested purchasing Dogecoin (DOGE) before the Q4 2024 rally. Also, the robo advisor could have prompted you to sell before the Dogecoin price crashed. RCO Finance designed its robo advisor with you in mind. To this end, RCO Finance allows you to customize your trading station, giving the robo advisor the power to trade on your behalf. This feature saves you the time and effort needed to find high-potential investments early. Thus far, RCO Finance has launched its beta platform , allowing you to interact with the robo advisor and other features early. Notably, RCO Finance has rolled out its beta platform while still running its presale. This milestone explains why this budding DeFi platform has already onboarded over 10,000 users. RCOF: A One-Of-A-Kind Investment Opportunity As the Dogecoin price continues crashing, investors are shifting to RCOF to hedge against more losses. DOGE investors and other crypto enthusiasts are rushing to buy RCOF because it is a safe investment. It is worth noting that SolidProof, a leader in blockchain security, audited RCOF’s smart contract and found it was vulnerability-free. The crypto space is also buzzing about RCOF because of its robust tokenomics. Notably, RCOF is a deflationary token with a maximum supply of 800 million tokens. This tokenomics model positions RCOF for tremendous growth as the RCO Finance ecosystem scales. As of February 3, RCOF was in Stage 5 of its presale. RCOF’s price during this stage is $0.1. This price is set to jump to $0.13 when RCOF kickstarts Stage 6. Also, RCOF is poised to generate more gains for Stage 5 investors, seeing as its listing price is $0.4-$0.6. Astonishingly, experts foresee RCOF surging 12,000% in Q1 2025. In doing so, RCOF will have mirrored the 12,800% climb in the Dogecoin price in 2021. This forecast explains why you should snag this rare opportunity and join the RCOF presale today!

NEAR Protocol has faced significant price fluctuations, with its value dropping over 12% in the past session, reflecting the market’s volatility. Despite this, analysts see NEAR as a long-term blockchain contender due to its ability to recover rapidly from market downturns. Polkadot continues to establish itself as a multichain champion, enabling different blockchains to communicate and interact. By introducing parachains, it has given developers the freedom to create custom blockchains that enhance blockchain efficiency and adoption. Among these strong contenders, Qubetics stands out with its innovative Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This project is tackling the inefficiencies of traditional financial systems, offering seamless interoperability and a transparent, secure trading environment. With a thriving presale, selling over 460 million tokens and raising $11.9 million, Qubetics is rapidly becoming a must-watch crypto project. Qubetics – Revolutionizing Real World Asset Tokenization Traditional financial markets often struggle with inefficiencies, high transaction fees, and slow settlements. Qubetics is set to change that by introducing a blockchain-based Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. By allowing businesses and individuals to tokenize tangible assets such as real estate, fine art, and commodities, Qubetics is opening up new investment opportunities. How Qubetics’ Tokenization Marketplace Works Imagine owning a fraction of high-value real estate without needing massive capital. Qubetics allows investors to buy, sell, and trade tokenized assets seamlessly, democratizing access to valuable assets that were once exclusive to large financial institutions. For businesses, this platform offers greater liquidity by enabling quicker asset transfers without relying on traditional banking intermediaries. This means companies can raise funds by selling tokenized shares of their assets while investors gain exposure to diversified, high-value markets. TICSScan – Empowering Blockchain Transparency A vital part of the Qubetics ecosystem is TICSScan, a blockchain explorer that provides in-depth insights into transaction activity, validator performance, and smart contract management. This transparency ensures that every transaction on the Qubetics blockchain is verifiable, enhancing trust within the ecosystem. Qubetics Presale – A Golden Opportunity Currently, in its 20th stage, the Qubetics presale has already attracted over 18,300 holders. With tokens priced at $0.0667, analysts are optimistic about its growth trajectory, expecting significant adoption upon its mainnet launch. Polkadot – The Multichain Champion Polkadot is redefining blockchain interoperability, allowing multiple chains to work together in a unified ecosystem. Instead of separate blockchains operating in silos, Polkadot’s parachain structure connects them, ensuring seamless data sharing and scalability. Parachains enable projects to create custom blockchains optimized for specific use cases while still benefiting from Polkadot’s security and scalability. This means that DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise applications can build on Polkadot without facing the same congestion issues as single-chain networks. With a rapidly expanding developer community and major partnerships, Polkadot is one of the most robust blockchain networks today. As enterprises and governments seek scalable blockchain solutions, Polkadot is positioning itself as a leader in real-world blockchain integration. NEAR Protocol – A Scalable Blockchain for the Future NEAR Protocol has gained traction as one of the most developer-friendly blockchain platforms. Despite recent price volatility, NEAR continues to show resilience with significant recovery patterns. This Layer-1 blockchain is designed for speed, low fees, and scalability. By utilizing sharding technology, NEAR ensures that transactions are processed efficiently without causing network congestion. This makes it an ideal blockchain for DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and decentralized marketplaces. While NEAR has experienced recent price fluctuations, its ability to recover quickly shows strong market demand. As adoption increases, this blockchain is expected to maintain its status as one of the top cryptos to join now. Why Real World Asset Tokenization is the Future With growing adoption of blockchain technology, real-world asset tokenization is set to disrupt traditional finance. Qubetics is leading this movement, ensuring seamless interoperability between physical and digital assets. As blockchain transparency becomes increasingly essential, TICSScan plays a crucial role in providing users with real-time insights into transactions and network activity. Conclusion – The Future of Crypto is Here For those looking to invest in transformative blockchain projects, Qubetics , Polkadot, and NEAR Protocol stand out as the top cryptos to join now. Whether it’s Qubetics’ asset tokenization marketplace, Polkadot’s multichain capabilities, or NEAR’s scalability solutions, these projects are shaping the future of decentralized finance.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.10 Market cap $907,369,647.51 Trading volume $62,296,802.87 Circulating supply 1,028,555,202 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.8428 24-hour high $0.9342 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.27% 50-day SMA $1.272 14-Day RSI 32.21 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.941 Tezos price analysis: XTZ shows signs of recovery despite broader bearish momentum TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has lost 5% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $0.774, and resistance is at $1.109. Tezos shows signs of short-term recovery. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ continues to trend lower The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on February 5 shows a continued dip in the price. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.88, below the 20-day SMA and just above its critical support of around $0.774. XTZ continues to trend lower The MACD indicator, with a bearish crossover, also confirms the selling pressure observed on the chart. The RSI (33.51) reflects an oversold market, indicating strong selling pressure and a possible rebound. If buyer interest does not return soon, XTZ could break below $0.774. The coin must break past resistance at $1.109 for a recovery to be confirmed. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Slight buying pressure is present for XTZ The 4-hour chart shows a slight recovery, trading above the lower Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger Bands are slightly expanding, suggesting increased volatility in the short term and possible recovery. Slight buying pressure is present for XTZ The CMF indicator shows some capital inflow and mild buying pressure, although limited. On the other hand, the MFI suggests a balance between sellers and buyers, indicating potential consolidation. If XTZ fails to stay above $0.790, it might move toward lower support levels. XTZ must move back above the middle Bollinger Band at $0.905 to confirm a recovery. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.0404 SELL SMA 5 $1.0611 SELL SMA 10 $1.1080 SELL SMA 21 $1.1870 SELL SMA 50 $1.2729 SELL SMA 100 $1.1756 SELL SMA 200 $0.9411 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.1551 SELL EMA 5 $1.1987 SELL EMA 10 $1.2557 SELL EMA 21 $1.3073 SELL EMA 50 $1.2899 SELL EMA 100 $1.1612 SELL EMA 200 $1.0313 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ is struggling to break past resistance around $0.9 – $1, which it needs to clear to continue its recovery. However, with the capital inflow observed in the short term, the price could trend higher and may even break past $1.10. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today after a failed attempt at the 0.915 resistance level—a move spurred by sellers disposing of their coins and taking a profit. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover?

XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark.

The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it’s in the red zone, trading between $0.8428 and $0.9342.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-05 02:32:18

These two projects have caught the attention of traders, but another rising star is quickly making waves— Lightchain AI , which has now raised $14 million in its presale, positioning itself as a top contender for high-growth investments in 2025. As established players like Solana and Kaspa ride the bullish momentum, Lightchain AI is proving that early-stage investments can deliver massive ROI, making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens in the market. Solana and Kaspa – Altcoin Market Leaders Solana (SOL) has been a dominant force in the crypto market, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. With increasing adoption from both developers and institutions, Solana’s price surge reflects the growing demand for scalable Layer-1 blockchains. Meanwhile, Kaspa (KAS) has gained traction for its blockDAG technology, which enhances transaction throughput without compromising decentralization. This innovation has fueled its rapid rise, making it one of the strongest performers in the altcoin sector. While these projects continue to attract investor interest, Lightchain AI is emerging as a serious competitor, offering a unique combination of AI-powered blockchain technology that could drive long-term adoption. Lightchain AI – Newcomer Making an Impact Lightchain AI stands out from traditional altcoins by bridging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, introducing decentralized AI processing with a focus on innovation. Its privacy-preserving AI infrastructure ensures secure and efficient data computations, making it a unique solution in the evolving tech landscape. By addressing the growing demand for AI-driven blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI is carving a niche in the industry. A key feature is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which replaces traditional mining with AI computations. Network nodes perform tasks such as model training and inference, which are cryptographically verified for accuracy before being added to the blockchain. This innovative system ensures efficiency and reliability while pushing the boundaries of blockchain capabilities. The Future of High-Growth Crypto Investments Solana and Kaspa are still leading the way in the altcoin market, but Lightchain AI’s explosive presale growth is turning heads as a potential top early-stage investment for 2025. Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge parallelized architecture lets multiple AI tasks run at the same time, reducing latency and boosting performance. This makes it perfect for real-world applications. With its presale already hitting an impressive $14 million, Lightchain AI is building strong market confidence and earning its spot as a rising star in the competitive blockchain space. Thanks to its innovative tech and fast-growing momentum, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming one to watch in the next wave of high-growth crypto assets.

Back then, a flurry of tweets and memes turned casual holders into overnight millionaires. Today, a fresh contender, RCO Finance, is catching buzz, claiming it can top DOGE’s success with AI-driven innovation. If you missed out on Dogecoin’s explosive run or are simply tired of waiting for a second wave, you’re not alone. Many DOGE faithful are now exploring RCO Finance to invest in a project with more than just meme appeal. Keep reading to see why these two tokens are being compared—and why RCOF might reshape your crypto game. Dogecoin’s Legacy and the 2021 Rally Glow Dogecoin soared in 2021 thanks to viral social media hype and celebrity endorsements. Prices leaped faster than most experts ever imagined, going on a 21,000% rally and creating a new generation of crypto believers. Even after a cooldown, DOGE remains a household name, albeit one that rides market sentiment. Some holders are waiting for another big run, but things have quieted. Meme-driven mania can resurface, yet there’s no guarantee lightning will strike twice. That uncertainty has Dogecoin investors scanning for new opportunities, hoping to replicate the thrilling upswing that defined DOGE’s 2021 Rally. RCO Finance: A New Vision for DeFi While Dogecoin relies on community buzz, RCO Finance stands on real-world utility and AI-driven insights. Thanks to a non-KYC approach, this project lets you buy assets like shares and real estate straight with crypto. Audited by SolidProof , the platform has drawn over 10k users who are impressed by its transparency. The AI-powered Robo Advisor is at the core, which helps you make more intelligent trades by evaluating live market data. Suppose You spot a trending altcoin that seems ready to pop. You consult the Robo Advisor, which has been monitoring trading volumes and social media buzz. It reveals that network congestion is currently high, pushing up gas fees. Rather than diving in and wasting money on fees, the AI advises you to wait a few hours. Later, when traffic dips, you execute your trade at a lower cost and keep more profits. This hands-on approach shows why many believe RCO Finance could match or surpass the hype Dogecoin experienced during its 2021 Rally. All this is available to test on RCOF’s Beta Platform , a rare treat for an ongoing presale. Presale Details and Future Potential RCOF is in its fifth presale phase, priced at $0.1. It’s already raised close to $13 million, reflecting strong interest from those chasing the next major breakout. Some analysts hint at a 1,000x gain once it hits leading exchanges, and rumors of a $100K giveaway only add to the excitement. Add 50x leverage options and a 30% bonus for early birds, and you can see why investors are flocking to RCO Finance. While Dogecoin’s success was primarily meme-powered, RCOF builds its case on real features, AI technology, and a robust roadmap designed to stand the test of time. Ready to Embrace the Next Big Thing? Dogecoin’s 2021 Rally will forever stand as a highlight in crypto history. But RCO Finance offers more sustainable prospects, guided by data and AI. If you’ve been waiting for a coin that doesn’t rely on social media whimsy, RCOF might be your answer. The presale won’t last forever, and if the hype is justified, early participants could see massive rewards. Maybe this is your chance to jump aboard a project combining cutting-edge AI with a real plan to change DeFi. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by—especially if you missed Dogecoin’s legendary surge.

With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

The days of shrugging off these so-called “joke” tokens are long gone. Just ask those who got in early on Notcoin—life looks pretty different when your meme coin investment pays off. But here’s the real question: what if you missed those golden opportunities? What if you could go back in time and grab those early presale prices before they exploded? Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) —the meme coin that’s turning heads and sending shockwaves across the crypto space. With its viral presale gaining momentum and an eye-watering 90% APY on staking, BTFD is offering a second chance for those who feel like they missed out. The time to act is now because, as history shows, meme coins with strong hype and community backing tend to skyrocket once they hit the open market. . Notcoin: The One That Got Away Notcoin was one of those projects that flew under the radar at first but quickly became one of the most talked-about meme coins of its time. What started as a fun, gamified token quickly turned into a high-return investment for early adopters. Those who got in at the ground floor saw their holdings multiply, leaving latecomers regretting their hesitation. This is the classic story of crypto investing—blink, and you miss it. By the time the mainstream caught onto Notcoin’s potential, prices had already surged. The biggest winners? Those who had the guts to jump in early. The rest? Well, they’re the ones kicking themselves, wishing they had seized the opportunity when it was dirt cheap. But here’s the thing: history has a way of repeating itself, and if you felt the sting of missing out on Notcoin, there’s good news—BTFD Coin is here, and it’s looking even more promising. Unlike Notcoin, which relied primarily on hype, BTFD backs its momentum with tangible staking rewards and a presale that’s already raising eyebrows. The writing’s on the wall: early adopters of BTFD could be looking at the same kind of gains, if not bigger. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Notcoin’s success is a lesson—those who wait, miss out. And with BTFD following a similar trajectory, the question is: are you going to make the same mistake twice? 2. BTFD Coin: The New King of Meme Coin Gains If you missed out on Notcoin, consider this your redemption shot.

Those who got in early have already seen their initial investment multiply, and with BTFD’s listing price set at $0.0006, the upside potential remains massive. Unlike Notcoin, where gains relied purely on market speculation, BTFD is rewarding its investors even before launch with lucrative staking returns. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it’s doing everything right.

This restructuring is one of the first concrete moves by President Trump’s administration to diminish the regulation of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Early executive orders of Trump’s administration aimed to promote crypto growth and prevent over-regulation. Some of the changes include the fact that some members of the crypto enforcement team are being moved to different divisions within the SEC, one high-profile lawyer has been taken out of the enforcement division, and one could say a demotion. The regulatory firm did not comment on the restructuring when asked. Trump shifts to crypto support as SEC leadership overhaul signals new regulatory approach During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump, a previous cryptocurrency skeptic, changed his position to support digital assets and was endorsed by the crypto community, which had considered former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler as an enemy. The current acting SEC chair, Mark T. Uyeda, has shown crypto-friendly tendencies and has made several notable alterations to the agency’s leadership, including forming a team to review the SEC’s tactics regarding digital assets. This team is headed by Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner and a known crypto advocate, who has recently expressed disappointment with the watchdog’s previous handling of crypto regulation. The team calls it legally ambiguous and unworkable. Peirce wants to develop a regulatory framework that encourages innovation and helps avoid fraud. Uncertainty looms over crypto enforcement as SEC reshuffles It is currently unknown how this downsizing will affect ongoing enforcement actions, including a high-profile case launched against Coinbase in 2023. The regulator accused Coinbase of providing exchange services without being registered with the SEC, which was in violation of federal securities laws. However, the company has argued that many digital assets are not securities — a position the crypto industry has rejected. The crypto enforcement unit at the SEC was created during Trump’s first term and was greatly enhanced during Gensler’s tenure. When Biden took over in May of this year, the agency had already essentially doubled the size of the team responsible for cracking down on fraudulent and unregistered crypto-asset offerings and had brought more than one hundred enforcement actions. During that time, Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a lawyer with strong crypto industry ties, to succeed Gensler as SEC chair. At the time of this writing, awaiting Senate Banking Committee confirmation is Atkins, an advocate of a less stringent regulatory regimen.

ETH is showing positive signs but faces many hurdles near the $2,880 level. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,550 zone. The price is trading below $2,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,880 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Faces Hurdles Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it dropped heavily below $2,500, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH tested the $2,120 zone and recently started a recovery wave. The price was able to surpass the $2,500 and $2,550 resistance levels. It even climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,402 swing high to the $2,127 swing low. However, the bears are now active near the $2,900 zone. The price failed to clear the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,402 swing high to the $2,127 swing low. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,800 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,880 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,920. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,120 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,880 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,640 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550. A clear move below the $2,550 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

However, the US proceeded with its 10% tariffs on China, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The escalation has pushed BTC back below the critical $100,000 price level. Bitcoin Suffers Amid Trade Wars After a volatile 24 hours filled with uncertainty surrounding US trade tariffs on Mexico and Canada, BTC experienced a short-lived relief rally to $102,000. This came after US President Donald Trump announced a 30-day delay in imposing tariffs on the two North American nations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Shows Market Far From Overheating – Details However, today’s implementation of US tariffs on China triggered a sharp downturn, causing BTC to break below the $100,000 level. In response, China’s Ministry of Finance announced new countermeasures. Starting February 10, China will impose an additional 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on agricultural equipment, crude oil, and certain vehicles. Additionally, Beijing has accused the US of violating World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations with its one-sided tariff policies. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce also stated that it would tighten export controls on key raw materials, including molybdenum, indium, bismuth, tellurium, and tungsten, citing national security concerns. With trade tensions escalating between the US and China, analysts predict heightened volatility in the crypto market in the coming days. Well-known crypto strategist Michael van de Poppe shared his outlook: Bitcoin bounced back swiftly and is currently acting within the range. I assume we’ll see new ATHs in February and it’s quite normal to correct after such a strong bounce. Volatility through the roof, but, as long as Bitcoin remains above $93K, a new ATH is likely. Meanwhile, crypto trader and investor Phoenix suggested that BTC could establish a new trading range amid the ongoing trade war. However, history suggests that heightened tariffs could spell trouble for cryptocurrencies. Web3 enthusiast merts.eth pointed out in an X post that BTC plummeted 65% in 2018 when Trump first initiated a trade war with China. The effects were not limited to digital assets, as the S&P 500 also dropped 12% in the weeks following the implementation of tariffs. More Downside For BTC? As Bitcoin struggles to hold the $100,000 price level, concerns are mounting about another potential breakdown in price. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently pointed out that if BTC fails to hold the $97,190 support level, there could be more pain for the top digital asset.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. Can WIF attain new heights in 2025? Will Dogwifhat reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.831 Market cap $831,938,350.39 Trading volume $498,378,469.08 Circulating supply 998,841,559.49 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.8525 24-hour low $0.7486 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 21.40% 50-day SMA $1.761 14-Day RSI 27.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 8/30 (27%) 200-Day SMA $2.21 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: Bulls re-enter the market as green candles surface TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis suggests a recovery despite broader bear market. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $1.173. WIF’s support level is present at $0.747. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF trades below 20-day SMA, slight uptrend appears The 1-day chart for WIF on February 5 shows the coin trading below the 20-day SMA at $0.998, reflecting a bearish trend. The MACD suggests ongoing bearish momentum, confirming that the slight bullish turn is not solid enough. WIF trades below 20-day SMA, slight uptrend appears The RSI at 29.78 indicates the asset is in oversold territory, hinting at a potential bounce if buyers solidify their position. A break above $0.998 could signal further upside, while rejection risks a fall to support near $0.747.

TrumpCoin (DJT) is one such project that skyrocketed on the day of Trump’s inauguration, but quickly crashed soon after. Meanwhile, the more established Pepe (PEPE) has also seen losses, highlighting the inherent volatility within the meme coin space. Many investors are now seeking utility-focused projects and Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming a top choice. This powerful PayFi solution takes a pragmatic approach to dealing with issues in the global payments space, offering a modern alternative to outdated systems. So why is Remittix seeing so much attention and how will TrumpCoin and Pepe perform in Q1 of 2025? TrumpCoin Continues To Decline TrumpCoin is trading at approximately $0.000277, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $43,210. The coin has seen a slight decline of about 2.57% in the past day. Since its launch in mid January, TrumpCoin experienced an initial surge, reaching a peak of $0.0024 on January 19. Early data indicates that some of the largest holders of TrumpCoin have realized substantial returns. Approximately 33% of the top 15 holders had fully exited their positions by late January, with one investor achieving a 91% return. Notably, some investors reported returns exceeding 10,000% with one reaching nearly 19,000%, while still retaining significant portions of their holdings. However, the launch of TrumpCoin has prompted mixed reactions. While some view it as an innovative venture into the crypto space, others express concerns over potential ethical and legal implications. Critics argue that such initiatives could undermine the credibility of both the cryptocurrency market and political institutions. Pepe Posts 15% Loss In 24 Hours Pepe (PEPE) has seen a steep 15% loss in the last 24 hours, plummeting down to $.00001041. Pepe is still up by 1,020% over the past year, though recent losses have brought the project’s future into question. Pepe continues to suffer from its large whale holding with roughly 47.82% of its holding base made up by whales and 52% by regular traders. This adds another layer to Pepe’s volatility with big-sell offs becoming commonplace in times of market uncertainty. Remittix (RTX): Making Crypto as Easy to Use as Cash Crypto was supposed to revolutionize finance, yet most people still cannot spend it in their day-to-day lives without great hassle. If you want to cash out, pay bills or send money abroad, you’re forced to deal with high fees, slow processing times and complicated workarounds. Ultimately, crypto isn’t as practical as it should be. Remittix (RTX) is changing that. It allows users to convert over 40 different cryptocurrencies into FIAT instantly and send the money directly to any bank account worldwide with no delays, no hidden fees, just simple, fast transactions. Whether you’re a freelancer needing to cash out your earnings, a trader looking to move profits into FIAT, or someone sending money to family across borders, Remittix makes the process effortless. The benefits go even further. 1.4 billion people worldwide don’t have access to a bank account, but many have crypto wallets through mobile apps. With Remittix, they can receive funds in digital assets and withdraw them in cash via remittance services like Western Union, breaking down financial barriers and increasing global accessibility. Remitttix Presale Booms, Surpassing $10.7 Million The Remittix (RTX) presale has taken the crypto space by storm, surpassing $10.7 million raised in record time. Tokens are currently up for grabs for just $0.0539, creating an ideal entry point for proactive investors. The project’s deep value proposition has prompted analysts to anticipate a steep 800% price rise during the presale phase alone with further growth after the launch. For those who want to push the boundaries of what is possible in PayFi, this market disruptor is not a project to sleep on in 2025.

Republican lawmakers are stepping up their efforts to bring clear rules to the crypto industry, forming a bicameral working group to push legislation on stablecoins and digital asset market structures. The move, announced on Feb. 4 at a Capitol Hill press conference, marks a coordinated effort between key House and Senate leaders to create a structured framework for crypto regulation, an issue that has remained in legal limbo for years. 🚨Chairman @RepFrenchHill : ""In the 119th Congress, we have a bicameral project for both a stablecoins bill and a regulatory framework that will bring clarity to digital assets in the United States."" Watch more📺 pic.twitter.com/HIxvssZTS5 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) February 4, 2025 The working group includes members from four major committees—the House Financial Services Committee, the House Agriculture Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, and the Senate Agriculture Committee—showing that lawmakers see crypto regulation as an issue that spans multiple sectors of financial oversight. Representative French Hill of Arkansas, along with Senators Tim Scott and John Boozman and Representative Glenn Thompson, will play leading roles in shaping these policies, drawing from existing legislative efforts while introducing new proposals.

Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott has made it clear that speed is a priority , saying he wants to push the crypto bills through the Senate within the first 100 days of the congressional session. Conversations with Democratic colleagues are already underway, raising the possibility that some elements of these bills could gain bipartisan support. At the press conference, David Sacks , Trump’s crypto and artificial intelligence czar, spoke about the broader vision for digital assets, calling this a key moment to create a “golden age” for crypto in the U.S. His role extends beyond Congress, as he is also overseeing a separate initiative within the White House to assess the possibility of a government-held Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. Trump’s executive order on Jan. 23 laid the foundation for that discussion, along with directives to prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency. For years, the lack of clear rules has driven many crypto firms to set up operations overseas, where regulations have been more clearly defined. If successful, this working group could finally give the crypto industry the clarity it has long been waiting for.

Speaking to Cointelegraph , Yun emphasized that this choice was not a limitation but a necessity , given TON’s ability to handle Telegram’s massive user base of 950 million . In January 2024 , Telegram announced that TON would be the exclusive network for its Mini Apps , sparking mixed reactions from the crypto community. However, Yun defended the move, arguing that blockchains without sharding lack the scalability for mass adoption and that alternative solutions often compromise security . Why Did Telegram Choose TON as Its Exclusive Blockchain? 1. Security & Scalability for 950 Million Users TON uses sharding , allowing it to handle Telegram’s large-scale transactions efficiently. Other blockchains may struggle with congestion and higher transaction costs . 2. Mass Adoption Requires High-Performance Blockchain Infrastructure Telegram aims to make Web3 services user-friendly . TON’s architecture ensures faster transaction speeds and lower fees . 3. Telegram’s Long-Term Vision for Blockchain Integration Originally developed by Telegram , TON aligns with its Web3 strategy . TON-based Mini Apps will offer decentralized services to millions of Telegram users. Will Telegram’s TON Exclusivity Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? Bullish for TON: Telegram’s endorsement boosts TON’s credibility and adoption . More developers may build on TON , leading to a stronger ecosystem . Increased use cases for TON-based payments, gaming, and social apps . Concerns & Criticism: Some developers worry about Telegram limiting blockchain choices . Other Layer 1 blockchains could lose potential integration opportunities. Regulatory scrutiny may increase as TON’s influence grows. Despite making TON the default blockchain for Mini Apps , Telegram bots will continue to support multiple blockchains , ensuring some level of interoperability. Conclusion Steve Yun’s defense of Telegram’s exclusive TON adoption highlights its strategic importance for scalability, security, and mass adoption . While the move has sparked debate , it positions TON as a major player in the Web3 ecosystem , potentially accelerating crypto adoption among Telegram’s 950 million users .

Andrew Kang , co-founder of Mechanism Capital , has predicted that Ethereum (ETH) could fall to between $2,200 and $2,400 if the U.S.-China trade dispute intensifies . Kang also noted that ETH faces short-term resistance between $2,900 and $3,000 , suggesting that macro uncertainties could weigh on Ethereum’s price action in the coming weeks. Why Could Ethereum Drop to $2.2K–$2.4K? Several factors could contribute to a potential ETH price decline : 1. Rising U.S.-China Trade Tensions China recently imposed new tariffs on U.S. goods , escalating the trade conflict. Uncertainty in global markets could lead to a sell-off in risk assets , including Ethereum. 2. Resistance at $2.9K–$3K Levels Kang highlighted that Ethereum faces key resistance in the $2,900–$3,000 range . If ETH fails to break through, a pullback to lower support levels is likely. 3. Broader Crypto Market Weakness Bitcoin dominance remains high , suggesting altcoins like ETH may struggle . Macroeconomic factors , including interest rate expectations , could add pressure on ETH. Can Ethereum Hold Above $2.4K? Bullish Scenario (ETH Holds Above $2.4K): If institutional demand for ETH ETFs continues, Ethereum could remain stable. Ethereum network upgrades (like Dencun) may provide long-term support . A weaker U.S. dollar or improved trade conditions could push ETH higher. Bearish Scenario (ETH Falls to $2.2K–$2.4K): Further trade war escalation could lead to a broader risk-off sentiment . If Bitcoin retraces , Ethereum could follow suit. Profit-taking at $2.9K–$3K resistance could push ETH lower. Conclusion Andrew Kang’s Ethereum forecast highlights the potential downside risk for ETH amid U.S.-China trade tensions . While ETH faces resistance at $2.9K–$3K , a major escalation in trade disputes could trigger a drop to $2.2K–$2.4K . Traders should closely monitor global macro trends and Ethereum’s key support levels in the coming weeks.

This move comes as retaliation for the 10% tariff the U.S. imposed on Chinese imports . Breakdown of China’s New Tariffs: 10% tariff on oil and agricultural machinery . 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) . This decision further escalates trade tensions between the U.S. and China , impacting energy, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors . Why Is China Imposing These Tariffs? 1. Retaliation Against U.S. Trade Policies The U.S. recently implemented a 10% tariff on Chinese goods . China’s countermeasure aims to protect its economic interests . 2. Strengthening Domestic Energy & Industrial Sectors By taxing U.S. energy imports , China may push for more domestic energy production . The tariffs on agricultural machinery could benefit China’s local manufacturers . 3. Increasing Leverage in Trade Negotiations The move signals China’s willingness to retaliate in ongoing trade talks . The U.S.-China trade war has historically led to economic uncertainty for global markets. Impact on the Global Economy & Markets Potential Negative Effects: Increased costs for U.S. energy and machinery exports to China. Greater uncertainty in global trade , impacting stock and commodity markets. Possible escalation of a broader U.S.-China trade conflict . Possible Positive Outcomes: China may boost domestic production in affected industries. The U.S. could seek alternative buyers for its coal, LNG, and machinery exports. Potential future trade negotiations could lead to a resolution. Conclusion China’s decision to impose up to 15% tariffs on U.S. goods signals escalating trade tensions between the two economic superpowers. As both nations adjust tariff policies , investors and businesses should prepare for potential market volatility in the energy, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors . If tensions continue, global supply chains and trade flows could face significant disruptions.

This move could mark a significant step toward institutionalizing Cronos (CRO) by making it available through traditional financial products. While details remain limited , this announcement indicates that Crypto.com is exploring ways to expand CRO’s accessibility to a broader investor base . Why a Cronos ETF Matters for CRO Adoption 1. Increased Institutional Interest in CRO ETFs allow traditional investors to gain exposure to CRO without directly holding the asset. A regulated Cronos ETF could bring greater legitimacy to CRO. 2. Crypto.com’s Push for Mainstream Adoption Crypto.com is heavily investing in CRO adoption through partnerships, staking rewards, and DeFi integrations. A Cronos ETF would align CRO with institutional-grade crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. 3. Potential Market Impact If approved, a Cronos ETF could drive significant demand for CRO . Similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , the listing of a CRO ETF could boost Cronos network adoption . Challenges & Considerations for a Cronos ETF Regulatory Uncertainty The SEC has been hesitant to approve altcoin-based ETFs , making approval uncertain. Market Demand for CRO Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum , CRO has a smaller institutional presence , which could impact ETF viability. Competition from Other Crypto ETFs More established altcoins like Solana and XRP may receive ETF approvals before CRO . Conclusion Crypto.com’s decision to include a Cronos ETF in its 2025 roadmap highlights its long-term vision for CRO adoption . While regulatory challenges remain , the move could position Cronos for institutional exposure if approved. As more details emerge, investors should monitor Crypto.com’s progress and regulatory developments surrounding altcoin-based ETFs .

Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, often referred to as “Crypto Mom” for her supportive stance on digital assets, the task force aims to address long-standing uncertainties in the crypto space. What SEC Can & Can’t Do? In a recent statement , Peirce outlined that the Crypto Task Force has a big job ahead. One of its main goals is to settle the long-debated question of whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or commodities. The crypto Task Force webpage is live. Join us for the drive (toward crypto clarity): https://t.co/o2jzNUhJ5D and https://t.co/9AwTYkmOCw — Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) February 4, 2025 It also aims to create a smoother registration process for crypto firms, a task that has been a challenge under existing SEC rules. Another key focus is crypto lending and staking programs, two areas that have faced regulatory scrutiny. The task force will determine how these activities fit into the current legal framework and whether any adjustments are needed. Additionally, the SEC will work to define its role in the crypto space and clarify which aspects of the market fall outside its authority. Clearing the Path for Innovation This change in direction comes just weeks after Gensler stepped down as SEC Chair. His leadership was marked by a strict “regulation by enforcement” strategy, which many in the industry criticized for being unclear and overly aggressive. Peirce compared the SEC’s previous handling of crypto regulations to a chaotic road trip—full of sudden stops, unclear directions, and an uncertain destination. However, Peirce noted that the new task force will focus on creating fair and transparent rules rather than simply punishing companies after the fact. Focus on Other Crypto ETFs In addition to regulatory clarity, Peirce also mentioned that the SEC is also reviewing applications for new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024, the agency is now considering funds for other cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. In addition, there are proposals to introduce new features for crypto ETFs, such as staking rewards for investors. Peirce promised that the SEC would provide clear explanations for its decisions on these applications.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 04:53:51

On Feb. 4, Robinhood pulled the plug on its Super Bowl betting contracts just a day after launch, following a request from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has formally requested that Robinhood Derivatives, LLC (RHD) “not permit customers to access” sports event contracts. While we continue to work with the CFTC to understand their concerns, we are suspending the rollout of the Pro… — Robinhood Comms (@RobinhoodComms) February 4, 2025 The move comes as regulators grow increasingly wary of event-based trading products, particularly those tied to major sporting events. The product, launched in partnership with prediction market platform Kalshi , allowed users to bet on the outcome of the Feb. 9 Super Bowl matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs. Only about 1% of Robinhood’s customers had access to the contracts before they were suspended. Those who had already placed bets will be able to either close their positions or see them through to settlement, but no new trades will be allowed. Robinhood, frustrated with the turn of events, stated in a tweet that it had been in “regular communication” with the CFTC about its plans and was disappointed by the outcome. The company did not disclose the exact reasoning behind the CFTC’s intervention, but the decision comes amid broader regulatory scrutiny of event-based contracts. You might also like: Polymarket users spin $16m volume on Trump’s picks Just two days ago, the agency launched an inquiry into Crypto.com and Kalshi, questioning whether their own Super Bowl contracts complied with derivatives laws. Robinhood isn’t new to event-based trading. In October 2024, the company made its first move into the space with contracts tied to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. That launch followed a court ruling in favor of Kalshi, which had challenged the CFTC’s attempts to block election-based prediction markets. The legal victory allowed Kalshi to continue offering election contracts, but it did little to resolve the regulatory gray area surrounding event-based derivatives. A CFTC spokesperson reinforced its concerns, stating that it will “exercise its oversight authority to the fullest extent” to ensure firms comply with derivatives laws, Reuters reported . The agency is taking a hard look at whether these products fall under traditional derivatives rules or if they should be treated as a different class of financial instruments. For Robinhood, this latest hurdle may not mark the end of its push into the space. The company has indicated plans to launch a more expansive event contracts platform later this year, signaling that it still sees opportunity in the market.

SOL price is consolidating and might face resistance near the $215 and $220 levels. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $215 and $212 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $212 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel or a bullish flag forming with resistance at $213 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $220 zone. Solana Price Faces Resistance Solana price struggled to clear the $250 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $220 and $200 support levels. It even dived below the $180 level. The recent low was formed at $175 before the price climbed and tested the $220 resistance. A high was formed at $220 and the price is now consolidating. There was a drop below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $175 swing low to the $220 high. Solana is now trading below $220 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $212 level. There is also a short-term declining channel or a bullish flag forming with resistance at $213 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $215 level. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $232. Any more gains might send the price toward the $250 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $202 zone. The first major support is near the $198 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $175 swing low to the $220 high. A break below the $198 level might send the price toward the $192 zone. If there is a close below the $192 support, the price could decline toward the $175 support in the near term.

The SEC Office of Inspector General (SEC OIG) completed the report more than a year ago, but the SEC has yet to release it or provide related documents despite multiple Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The lawsuit, filed today, calls on the SEC to disclose the final report, which examines potential conflicts of interest involving William Hinman, the former Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance, and his role in the agency’s decisions on cryptocurrencies. Of particular concern is Hinman’s ties to his former law firm, Simpson Thacher, which had an interest in promoting Ether (ETH) over other cryptocurrencies. Watchdog sues to force @SECGov to release the IG report on its investigation into former Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman https://t.co/b5osUpwCrk — CryptoLaw (@CryptoLawUS) February 4, 2025 Empower Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group, has been pushing for greater transparency from the SEC since August 2021, when it first requested communications between SEC officials and cryptocurrency entities. Over the past few years, the group has filed multiple lawsuits to secure access to documents, including those tied to Hinman’s 2018 speech declaring Ether not to be a security, while other similar cryptocurrencies were classified as unregistered securities. Tristan Leavitt, president of Empower Oversight, criticized the SEC’s ongoing delays, calling its refusal to release the report “suspicious” and stressing the public’s need for transparency in light of the agency’s role in regulating the growing cryptocurrency sector. With the SEC’s internal watchdog report still not released, Empower Oversight’s legal efforts continue as they press for clarity on the agency’s handling of conflicts of interest and cryptocurrency enforcement decisions.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 05:10:59

Crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) recently shared an updated chart and analysis on X, providing insights into the projected price movements of XRP based on Elliott Wave Theory. His analysis highlights an intermediate cycle targeting $5.85 and a primary cycle suggesting a long-term target of $18.22. The analyst has previously predicted these targets , and his updated analysis shows a clearer picture of XRP’s potential path. XRP had a 4th Wave on his Intermediate Cycle, which I highlighted in Dark Blue, aiming for $5.85 with the 5th Wave. On the other hand, Primary Cycle Waves, highlighted in Light Blue, still aim for $18.22. (Not Financial Advice) I have used the same structure since July 23,… pic.twitter.com/CZXFSRyftb — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) February 3, 2025 The Path to $5.85 Dark Defender’s analysis identifies XRP’s current position in an Elliott Wave cycle. He notes that XRP is in the fourth wave of its intermediate cycle, with an anticipated fifth wave pushing the price toward $5.85. This prediction is based on Fibonacci retracement levels, with 261.80% Fibonacci support aligning with the $5.85 mark. As of the latest update, XRP has broken through a key monthly resistance level, reinforcing the possibility of an upward movement. The digital asset enjoyed a monthly close above $3 for the first time, and despite the decline over the past few days, Dark Defender remains unfazed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Long-Term Outlook of $18.22 In addition to the short-term projection, Dark Defender mapped out a broader primary cycle, suggesting XRP could eventually reach $18.22. This price level corresponds to a 361.80% Fibonacci extension, a common measurement used in technical analysis to predict potential high points in strong bullish trends. He mentioned that his structural analysis has been consistent since July 2024, when XRP was valued at around $0.40 to $0.50. “We are following it as the Northern Star,” he stated, affirming confidence in his long-term projections. Market Context and Considerations XRP has experienced significant volatility over the past few days, largely influenced by broader market trends. A notable analyst also drew attention to potential market manipulation , which contributed heavily to the digital asset’s brief dip below $2. While Dark Defender’s approach is grounded in technical analysis, it does not account for external factors that could drastically change its trajectory. Despite this, the community is still optimistic, and Dark Defender is confident that XRP will hit these targets in this cycle.

The firm warned through a blog post that holding people responsible for systems and actions over which they don’t have jurisdiction leads to obstructive outcomes. Part of the statement read: Unfortunately, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has ignored this distinction and is attempting to do just that by holding software developers responsible for the actions of third parties that use neutral tools the developers created but no longer control. A16z Trump’s biggest policy priority should be decoding the legally correct meaning of control A16z further asked the new administration to prioritize “codifying the proper and legally correct understanding of ‘control’ in law” as it would help users, DOJ, and software developers understand control in a legal context. In past legal actions, US prosecutors have targeted cryptocurrency developers for activities conducted on their platforms by others. A16z compared this to holding a car manufacturer accountable for actions by a careless driver that led to a crash. They pointed out that the action doesn’t make sense: You can’t blame the carmaker for the accident when someone crashes a car he bought from them. That analogy is quite obvious for vehicles, but cryptocurrency handles it differently. In recent cases like United States v. Storm and Rodriguez , the DOJ has prosecuted the blockchain developers and compared them to unlicensed money transmitters. Critics counter that this approach misunderstands the fundamental nature of control in decentralized systems since developers typically have no direct control over the software once it has been deployed. The move to unpack “control” is critical to determining whether crypto firms qualify as money-transmitting entities guided by specific rules and regulations. According to its website, A16z’s portfolio of venture investments includes over 100 crypto companies, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap. Fed’s stance on crypto is bound to change during Trump’s administration During the tenure of former President of the United States Joe Biden, federal agencies were very strict with crypto cases. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the financial regulator, has opened more than 100 cases against companies and people who have raised money through crypto, claiming they broke US laws. However, things are expected to change during President Trump’s administration. The president seems accommodating toward crypto and promised to make the US the world’s crypto capital. So far, Trump has replaced SEC leadership with more crypto-friendly appointees.

These Top Crypto Presales Could 1000x By The End Of The Year appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto investors are no strangers to chasing the next high returning crypto. Many who missed the hype surrounding $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens are now looking for a presale project with the potential to deliver massive gains. This is where $UNOMAI comes into play. This presale could redefine the meme-coin market and potentially 1000x by year’s end. With a bold vision, innovative technology, and a first-of-its-kind ecosystem, $UNOMAI is quickly becoming the most talked-about crypto investment of 2025. The Vision: The United Nations of Memes $UNOMEME is more than a meme token—it’s an ecosystem. Its mission? To unite fragmented meme communities into a single governance structure called the United Nations of Memes. By fostering collaboration instead of competition, $UNOMEME aims to create a seamless trading environment, solving one of the biggest challenges in meme trading today: fragmentation. For those who saw the frenzy around $TRUMP and $MELANIA, imagine the potential of a token that bridges all major meme markets under one banner. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about long-term value and sustainability. Why $UNOMAI Stands Out Unlike traditional meme tokens that rely solely on hype, $UNOMAI introduces real utility with high-leverage trading (up to 1000x), smooth cross-chain transfers, and attractive staking rewards of 35% APY – creating a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for traders and long-term holders. High-Leverage Trading Access up to 1000x leverage with lightning-fast cross-chain executions. This maximizes profit potential while capturing opportunities across diverse markets, offering the aggressive upside that meme investors crave. Cross-Chain Accessibility The Universal Bridge connects Ethereum and Solana for instant, low-fee transfers.

Prosperity Program Rewards Staking $UNOMAI offers 35% APY plus daily profit sharing and community perks. Unlike speculative tokens, $UNOMAI provides consistent returns, combining long-term growth with daily liquidity for strategic reinvestment. Tokenomics: Built for Growth With 30% allocated to rewards and 47.5% for infrastructure, the tokenomics ensure both scalability and community benefits. Transparent governance builds trust, while strategic allocations fuel sustainable development and investor security Turning Meme Market Fragmentation into Sustainable Growth Presale investments in crypto have consistently delivered massive returns, and $UNOMAI is primed for explosive growth through its first-mover advantage, practical utility, and vast market potential. By uniting fragmented meme communities like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba under a shared financial ecosystem, $UNOMAI addresses the industry’s liquidity challenges and fosters collective growth. Its high-utility features, including 1000x high-leverage trading, seamless cross-chain access via the Universal Bridge, and a 35% APY staking program, appeal to both short-term traders and long-term investors. These offerings create diverse opportunities, from capturing quick gains to earning passive income. As the multi-billion-dollar meme-coin market expands, $UNOMAI offers more than speculative hype—delivering sustainable rewards and long-term growth potential, unlike the fleeting excitement seen with $TRUMP and $MELANIA. $UNOMAI Is the Next Big Thing If you missed the boat on $TRUMP and $MELANIA, don’t let $UNOMAI slip through your fingers. This presale offers the potential for exponential growth, backed by innovative features and a clear vision for the future. With the promise of uniting meme communities, rewarding stakeholders, and creating a seamless trading experience, $UNOMAI is shaping up to be the top crypto presale of the year.

While prices briefly rebounded after President Donald Trump announced a 30-day delay on new tariffs, some analysts warn that Bitcoin could still face a correction below $90,000 if geopolitical risks intensify. Bitcoin ETFs See Unprecedented Growth Despite the bloodbath in Satoshi Street in the last few weeks, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a record-breaking month. January saw over $5.25 billion in net inflows, surpassing the $4.53 billion recorded in December 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $3.23 billion in inflows, bringing its total assets to $59.39 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $1.28 billion, pushing its total net assets to $21.76 billion. The Kobeissi Letter reported that net inflows hit around $4.5 billion in January alone, making it one of the best months on record. Since their launch in January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $40 billion in total inflows, pushing assets under management (AUM) beyond $125 billion for the first time. The Kobeissi Letter also highlighted that Bitcoin ETF holdings have doubled in just four months, signaling strong investor confidence in crypto-based financial products. This rapid growth also brings Bitcoin ETFs closer to the level of spot gold ETFs, which have been trading for over two decades. The comparison suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a legitimate store of value, similar to gold. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto.com Plans CRO Spot ETF Launch and New Financial Products in 2025 , Strong Institutional Backing Signals More Growth Bitcoin ETFs had a strong end to January, pulling in nearly $1 billion in just two days. BlackRock’s iBIT led the inflows with $685.3 million. Despite some volatility, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan remains optimistic, predicting that total ETF inflows could surpass $50 billion by the end of the year. While some days saw outflows, the overall trend points to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Beyond the ETFs, Bitcoin adoption is growing across the U.S. Oklahoma recently proposed a bill to allow Bitcoin payments for state employees, businesses, and individuals, a move that could pave the way for broader crypto acceptance. Other states are also exploring similar legislation, further integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. With institutional demand surging and regulatory clarity improving, Bitcoin ETFs are proving to be a major driver of crypto adoption in traditional finance, setting the stage for continued growth throughout 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meanwhile, the SEC is reassessing its stance on crypto assets, and Commissioner Hester Peirce revealed plans for potential retroactive relief and a more predictable regulatory framework. The agency is also scaling back its crypto enforcement unit after several key leadership departures. Crypto Legislation Could See a Breakthrough Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director under Donald Trump, believes that US lawmakers will look to get on the good side of the crypto community ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In an interview with the Financial Times on Feb. 4, Scaramucci suggested that members of Congress, particularly those facing competitive primaries and elections in swing districts, will want to establish a track record of supporting crypto-related legislation before the next electoral cycle. He speculated that Congress could push forward a wave of legislative activity before its holiday recess in 2025, possibly including a long-awaited crypto market structure bill. Scaramucci said lawmakers might move on crypto regulation as early as November 2025, but if they failed to act by then, it will likely still happen in his proposed timeframe. Scaramucci has been a very outspoken critic of Trump in the 2024 election, and firmly believes his pro-crypto stance was purely transactional rather than genuine support for the industry. He went further by describing Trump as “unwell” and warning of the dangers of the political power he has accumulated. His comments only added to the debate over how crypto is shaping political alignments in Washington, particularly as industry-backed political action committees (PACs) begin to play a much larger role in influencing elections. Special interest groups and PACs are expected to have a huge impact on the 2026 elections, especially as candidates try to appeal to more crypto-focused voters. The Fairshake PAC spent around $131 million in the 2024 US elections to support pro-crypto candidates, and plans to continue its efforts into the midterms. The growing financial backing of the industry also suggests that lawmakers may face more pressure to take clear positions on digital assets. Scaramucci also weighed in on Trump’s controversial entry into the meme coin market by calling the launch of the TRUMP token damaging to the industry. The President introduced the token on Jan. 17, just before returning to office, which led to a massive surge in market cap that briefly exceeded $15 billion before dropping. TRUMP market cap since its launch (Source: CoinMarketCap ) He compared the project to the scams that have plagued the crypto space for years now, and argued that it reflects poorly on an industry that is already fighting for legitimacy in the eyes of regulators and the public. SEC Explores New Approach to Crypto Assets The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking a new approach to regulating the crypto sector, which includes reassessing the security status of digital assets and considering retroactive relief for certain token offerings. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce issued a statement on Feb. 4 revealing that the White House’s newly announced Crypto Task Force is recommending SEC action to grant temporary prospective and retroactive relief for coin or token offerings, provided they meet specific conditions. SEC statement These conditions include updating and providing necessary disclosures and agreeing not to contest the commission’s jurisdiction in cases involving alleged fraud related to the purchase and sale of crypto assets. She also shared that the task force is reconsidering the classification of certain assets as securities, and acknowledging that the legal status of crypto assets is very crucial when it comes to addressing broader regulatory concerns. The election of Donald Trump in November started a major shift for the crypto industry as his administration moved quickly to reshape regulatory oversight. Trump appointed Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, as the new SEC chair, introduced a special advisory role focused on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, and signed an executive order to establish a digital asset working group. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes the administration will also prioritize passing stablecoin regulations , which he considers essential to maintain the US dollar’s dominance as the world’s reserve currency. Lawmakers are also actively pushing for clearer regulatory guidelines. Republican Representative Tom Emmer stated that passing comprehensive market structure and stablecoin legislation will be a key priority for Congress. With growing interest from traditional financial institutions, clearer rules could accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan indicated that banks are particularly focused on crypto payments, and suggested that if digital transactions become more established, the banking sector will aggressively move into the space. SEC Scales Back Crypto Enforcement Unit The US SEC is also reportedly scaling back its dedicated crypto enforcement unit by reassigning some of its 50 staff members to other departments in the agency. According to a Feb. 4 report from The New York Times, multiple sources confirmed that one of the unit’s top lawyers has already been moved from the SEC’s enforcement arm. However some insiders viewed it as an unfair demotion. The report was published very shortly after SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce outlined the new shift in the agency’s regulatory approach to digital assets, including the reassessment of the security status of crypto assets and the possibility of retroactive relief for certain token offerings. Peirce compared the SEC’s previous enforcement-driven strategy to a chaotic road trip that frequently slammed on the brakes, and shared that the new Crypto Task Force plans to create a much more stable and predictable regulatory environment. The SEC’s crypto enforcement unit played a big role in cracking down on noncompliance in the industry by bringing 33 enforcement actions against 90 defendants in 2024 alone, according to Cornerstone Research . However, recent developments indicate that there will be a broader leadership shift at the agency, which has gained a lot of momentum since Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. (Source: Cornerstone Research ) A series of high-profile departures also completely reshaped the SEC’s enforcement landscape, including the resignation of Chief Enforcement Officer Gubir Grewal in October of 2024. Grewal was a strong advocate for aggressive crypto oversight, and recommended more than 100 enforcement actions against major industry players. His departure started speculation that the agency may be adopting a softer regulatory stance. Sanjay Wadhwa, who was promoted to acting director of the enforcement division, also left the SEC on Jan. 31 after more than two decades at the agency. Meanwhile, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler officially resigned on Jan. 20, which coincided with Trump’s return to office. These leadership changes and a potential reduction in crypto enforcement efforts suggest that the regulatory approach to digital assets in the US is in the middle of a major transformation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-05 05:44:58

Senator Sandra O’Brien has introduced a proposal that would allow the state’s treasurer to invest in Bitcoin, making Ohio one of the growing number of U.S. states embracing digital assets. Ohio’s Plan for a Bitcoin Reserve Senate Bill 57, introduced on January 28 and referred to the Financial Institutions, Insurance, and Technology Committee a day later, seeks to establish the “Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Fund.” I just introduced legislation to create an Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Fund. The crypto world is here, and Ohio needs to be a leader. Crypto will be a major part of President Trump’s term. When his working group issues recommendations, Ohio will be ready. — State Senator Sandra O'Brien (@OBrienOH32) January 28, 2025 If passed, this law will allow the state to invest public funds solely in Bitcoin while ensuring that these holdings are securely stored for at least five years. Senator O’Brien believes that Ohio must take a leadership role in crypto adoption. She emphasized on social media that “the crypto world is here, and Ohio needs to be a leader.” She also noted that with President Donald Trump’s growing interest in digital assets, Ohio must be prepared for potential federal-level crypto policies. Bitcoin for Payments and Donations The bill doesn’t stop at just investing in Bitcoin. It also proposes that Ohio state agencies and government entities accept Bitcoin for payments, including taxes, fees, and fines. Once received, the funds will be converted into Bitcoin and stored in the reserve. Additionally, Ohio residents, state agencies, and universities will have the option to donate Bitcoin to the fund. The bill even suggests creating a recognition program to honor major contributors, further encouraging Bitcoin adoption at the state level. Other US State Joining Too This isn’t Ohio’s first attempt to embrace Bitcoin. In December, Ohio House Republican leader Derek Merrin introduced a similar bill, HB 703, which would give the state treasurer the option to allocate Bitcoin to a reserve fund, Merrin argued that the devaluation of the U.S. dollar makes it essential for states to explore alternative assets like Bitcoin. Ohio isn’t the only state pushing for crypto adoption. Across the U.S., other states like Utah and Arizona are also advancing bills to allow public funds to be invested in cryptocurrencies. In total, more than twelve U.S. states are considering legislation to allow Bitcoin reserves.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 05:58:26

A report by ARK Invest highlighted Bitcoin’s declining volatility and the rapid growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs, while research from Mempool suggested that the adoption of inscriptions could drive Bitcoin’s average block size to 4MB. As regulatory discussions around stablecoins gained traction in Congress, the evolving digital asset landscape signaled a shift toward broader institutional adoption and increased blockchain utility. Bitcoin’s Block Size Could Reach 4MB Amid Widespread Inscriptions Adoption, Mempool Research Reports The Bitcoin network could see its average block size grow significantly, potentially reaching 4 megabytes (MB) per block, as inscriptions gain wider adoption, according to a new report published by Mempool Research on Feb. 4. This represents a substantial increase from the current average block size of just over 1.5 MB. The findings highlight the potential scalability implications of inscriptions—a method that efficiently encodes arbitrary data within Bitcoin blocks. If widely adopted, these inscriptions could push Bitcoin’s total blockchain size to 1 terabyte (TB) as early as 2026, though Mempool Research estimates a more likely timeframe between 2027 and 2029. Bitcoin’s block size has been a hotly debated topic in the cryptocurrency space for years. Larger block sizes allow more data to be stored per block, increasing the network’s ability to process transactions. However, they also pose scalability challenges, as more storage and bandwidth are required to maintain a full node. Currently, Bitcoin blocks are limited to 4 MB of raw data, with most blocks averaging around 1.5 MB. However, since the 2021 Taproot upgrade, some blocks have stored as much as 2.4 MB of data. Taproot’s implementation enabled more efficient transaction encoding, leading to increased usage of Bitcoin’s block space for novel applications such as inscriptions. Mempool Research’s report outlines two key scenarios: A return to pre-inscription dynamics, resulting in slower block size growth. A future with widespread adoption of inscriptions, which could push average block sizes toward 4 MB. With larger block sizes, Bitcoin’s total blockchain could surpass 1 TB within a few years, requiring significant storage capacity for full node operators. Bitcoin’s block size limitations contrast starkly with newer blockchain networks like Solana, which can theoretically store up to 128 MB per block, according to the Solana Foundation. This massive difference allows Solana to process thousands of transactions per second, while Bitcoin remains constrained by its 10-minute block time and relatively smaller block capacity. The competition from high-performance blockchains like Solana sheds light on Bitcoin’s challenges in maintaining its dominance as both a store of value and a functional transaction network. However, Bitcoin’s unparalleled security and decentralization remain key advantages. The Role of Taproot and Bitcoin DeFi in Scaling the Network Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade laid the groundwork for innovations in smart contracts, inscriptions, and Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi). While Bitcoin was originally designed as a peer-to-peer payment system, its ecosystem has evolved, now supporting NFTs, layer-2 solutions, and other DeFi applications. Industry experts predict that Bitcoin-native DeFi will be a major theme in 2025, with institutions increasingly interested in Bitcoin as a programmable asset. Platforms built on Bitcoin’s network, such as Stacks and RSK, are enabling DeFi functionalities while benefiting from Bitcoin’s security. However, Bitcoin still faces competition from networks that offer far greater block space and lower transaction costs. In September 2023, Celestia—a layer-1 network specializing in data availability—announced a roadmap aiming to scale its block size to an unprecedented 1 gigabyte. If successful, this could create new challenges for Bitcoin’s long-term competitiveness. As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, the network must balance scalability, security, and decentralization. While larger block sizes can increase transaction capacity, they also introduce new trade-offs, such as increased storage requirements for node operators and potentially higher fees. The Mempool Research report suggests that widespread adoption of inscriptions could drive Bitcoin into a new era of growth, pushing its blockchain storage requirements beyond previous expectations. Whether Bitcoin will fully embrace these advancements or remain constrained by its original design remains a topic of debate within the community. With institutions increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and the rise of Bitcoin-native DeFi, the network’s ability to scale will be a defining factor in its future success. Bitcoin and Stablecoins Dominate 2024 as Digital Assets Enter a New Era: ARK Invest Report 2024 was a landmark period for digital assets, with Bitcoin achieving historic stability and stablecoin transaction values surpassing those of financial giants Visa and Mastercard. These insights are part of ARK Invest’s recently released Big Ideas 2025 report, which outlines key trends and developments in the cryptocurrency space. According to the report, Bitcoin’s annualized volatility fell below 50% in 2024—a record low for the leading digital asset. This marked a sharp contrast to previous years when Bitcoin’s volatility hovered around 80% in 2022 and exceeded 100% in 2018. Alongside reduced volatility, Bitcoin delivered a stellar 122.2% return in 2024, reinforcing its growing status as a reliable investment vehicle. A major factor behind Bitcoin’s success in 2024 was the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. Approved in January, these ETFs marked the “most successful ETF launch in history,” according to ARK Invest. By the end of the year, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had accumulated over $100 billion in net assets, demonstrating strong institutional demand. The introduction of these ETFs provided traditional investors with a regulated and accessible means of gaining exposure to Bitcoin, which played a pivotal role in stabilizing the asset's price movements. Another key milestone was Bitcoin’s inflation rate falling to 0.9% after its quadrennial halving event in April. For the first time in history, Bitcoin’s issuance rate dipped below that of gold’s long-term supply growth, reinforcing its status as ”digital gold” and a hedge against inflation. While Bitcoin solidified its position as a store of value, stablecoins emerged as a dominant use case for blockchain technology. ARK Invest’s report highlights that stablecoin transactions reached an annualized value of $15.6 trillion in 2024—equivalent to 119% of Visa’s transaction volume and 200% of Mastercard’s. Stablecoin adoption also saw a massive surge in transaction volume, hitting 110 million transactions per month. Although this still represents a small fraction of Visa’s and Mastercard’s transaction count (0.41% and 0.72%, respectively), the value per transaction was significantly higher than those processed by traditional payment networks. The rapid growth of stablecoins has been driven by their low transaction costs, fast settlement speeds, and increasing regulatory clarity, making them an essential tool for cross-border payments, remittances, and on-chain transactions. Regulatory Landscape: Stablecoin Framework Gains Momentum As stablecoins gained prominence, US lawmakers ramped up efforts to establish a clear regulatory framework for these digital assets. Stablecoin regulation became a top priority for pro-crypto Republicans in Congress, with multiple legislative proposals introduced throughout the year. Before the November 2024 presidential election, Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2024, building on previous proposals by former House member Patrick McHenry. Earlier in the year, bipartisan efforts were also evident, as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D) and Cynthia Lummis (R) introduced a bill aiming to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Following the Republican Party’s sweep of both houses of Congress in November, passing legislation to clarify crypto market structure and stablecoin regulations became a top priority. Republican Representative Tom Emmer emphasized that regulatory clarity would be critical for fostering innovation and maintaining the US’s leadership in financial technology. Miller Whitehouse-Levine, head of the DeFi Education Fund, told Bloomberg that there is now broad bipartisan consensus in Congress regarding stablecoin regulation. With stablecoins playing an increasingly critical role in the global economy, lawmakers are under growing pressure to balance innovation with consumer protection. As the crypto industry goes into 2025, Bitcoin and stablecoins appear poised to dominate the next wave of digital asset adoption. The success of Bitcoin ETFs, the network’s declining volatility, and stablecoins surpassing traditional payment giants signal that blockchain-based finance is moving toward mainstream acceptance. Looking ahead, several key developments will shape the industry: Bitcoin’s halving effects: With the April 2024 halving reducing new Bitcoin issuance, supply constraints could drive further price appreciation. Stablecoin regulation: The implementation of clear US stablecoin regulations could accelerate adoption and institutional use cases. Decentralized finance (DeFi) growth: The maturation of Bitcoin-native DeFi and increasing integration of stablecoins into financial systems could unlock new blockchain applications. With the combination of growing institutional adoption, a more favorable regulatory environment, and technological advancements, 2025 is set to be another transformative year for digital assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-05 06:00:00

Additionally, the spot Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of nearly 11K ETH. With these bullish developments, will Ethereum price recover losses and revisit $3,000? Can Ethereum Price Revisit $3,000 Anytime Soon? On Monday, Ethereum price crashed 27%, setting a daily low of $2,080. Massive liquidations, short positions covering and investors buying dips led to a 38% bounce on the same day. Due to the sudden crash and recovery, there is a large wick on the daily chart. More often than not prices typically retrace toward the wick’s midpoint before a full-blown recovery rally. If such an outlook should unfold, investors can expect ETH’s value to crash another 10% to $2,474, which is the midpoint of the wick. A revisit to this level could lead to a revisit of the $3,000 psychological level if the price stabilizes around $2,400 to $2,500. ETH/USDT 1-day chart Supporting this outlook is IntoTheblock’s IOMAP (In/Out of the Money Around Price) indicator. This metric shows that the next key support area is $2,438, where roughly 2.71 million addresses bought 58.55 million ETH at an average price of $2,438. This level coincides with wick’s midpoint, adding credence to a 10% crash for Ethereum price. ETH IOMAP While technicals suggest a correction on the lower time frames, a decline in the supply of ETH held on exchanges and ETF inflows suggests a bullish outlook from a big-picture perspective. 340K ETH leaves Exchanges Ethereum price is influenced by the supply of ETH held on exchanges. According to Santiment , a data analytics platform, the supply of ETH on exchanges dropped from 10.86 million to 10.52 million between February 2 and 5. Roughly 340K ETH worth $920 million left exchanges. Still, this is not bullish for ETH when looking at the big picture. While the supply of ETH steadily declined after November 28, 2024, it stopped on January 21 and reversed, noting an inflow of 210K ETH in the next 12 days. Hence, the recent outflow, might seem bullish if isolated, but does not mean it is positive development that could support ETH price recovery. ETH held on exchanges Despite such a brutal sell-off, Ethereum ETFs saw an inflow of 10,980 ETH on February 4, according to CoinGlass data . Since January 30, the inflows have been positive, which is an optimistic development considering Ether’s 2024 performance. ETH ETF Sees Inflows ETH Netflows All in all, the big-picture perspective remains bullish, with the short-term outlook expecting a correction in Ethereum price. A good place for buying dips is $2,400 to $2,500 as suggested by both technical and on-chain analysis.

The Ripple token fall comes as the XRP Ledger halted blockchain production for nearly an hour on Tuesday. However, Ripple CTO David Schwartz has confirmed that the network has recovered and is almost back to normalcy. XRP Price Drops Amid XRP Ledger Downtime On Tuesday, the XRP Ledger faced some downtime for an hour before resuming operations. However, the development was enough to send XRP price down by 8% to its crucial support of $2.50. With the XRP Ledger halting the block production for an hour, the network activity froze at the ledger height of 93927173. The Ledger has once again resumed normal operations without reporting any loss of transactions or assets. Ripple CTO David Schwartz acknowledged the development stating: “We don’t know exactly what caused the issue yet”. He further noted that although the consensus was running, the validations were not published which caused the network to drift apart. “Validator operators manually intervened to choose a sane starting point and begin publishing validations from there,” he added. Ripple Community Celebrates Quick Network Recovery Commenting on the network recovery, the Ripple CTO referred to the Unique Node List (UNL), a core component of the XRPL consensus mechanism. “Very few UNL operators actually made any changes, as far as I can tell, so it’s possible the network spontaneously recovered. I’m not sure yet,” said Schwartz . Other community members have backed Ripple for this quick recovery. Edo Farina, head of XRP Healthcare, the first healthcare platform built on the XRP Ledger said: “The $XRP Ledger has been operational for over 110,000 hours since its launch in 2012. With today’s halt, the total downtime where validators failed to agree on transactions reached about 2 hours. That’s 99.999% of efficiency. The MOST efficient blockchain in existence!” He further clarified that the Ripple network halt wasn’t typically the outcome of network congestion but instead related to the consensus mechanism. Last week, the XRP Ledger implemented the AMMClawback amendment, a significant upgrade aimed at bolstering the regulatory compliance of its Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools. Will XRP Price Bounce Back Again? As of press time, XRP price is down 7.3%, trading at $2.51, with daily trading volumes crashing 41% to $13.11 billion. Furthermore, the Coinglass data shows that XRP futures open interest is down 12.2% to $3.65 billion while the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $21 million. Earlier this week, Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP amid discussion around XRP reserves. Since the beginning of 2025, XRP has seen strong inflows. Coinshares report shows that the Ripple cryptocurrency has solidified its position as the second-best performing altcoin, recording year-to-date (YTD) inflows of $105 million. Notably, the digital asset attracted $15 million in inflows just last week, underscoring growing investor interest. Additionally, the push for introducing spot XRP ETF by asset managers Grayscale and Canada’s Purpose Investments has further drawn institutional interest.

However, the network recovered on its own without requiring major interventions from validators. According to Schwartz, while consensus was running, validations weren’t being published, “causing the network to drift apart.” “Very few UNL operators actually made any changes, as far as I can tell, so it’s possible the network spontaneously recovered,” he added. A Unique Node List (UNL) is a core component of the XRPL consensus mechanism that acts as a trusted validator directory to ensure network integrity and transaction finality. The network is now recovering. We don’t know exactly what caused the issue yet. Super-preliminary observation: It looked like consensus was running but validations were not being published, causing the network to drift apart. Validator operators manually intervened to choose a… — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) February 4, 2025 A Rare Ripple Outage “Once servers started seeing a few validations from a few sources, they were able to build enough consensus to pull the network over to a coordinated ledger stream after the last ledger the network managed to validate,” explained Schwartz, who added that these were all preliminary findings. He confirmed that no assets on XRPL were lost, adding, “It just caused ledgers not to be seen as trusted for about an hour.” The incident occurred during a period of changes for the network as it recently reduced its base reserve requirement from 10 XRP to 1 XRP. Additionally, the validator structure was modified in 2023 to reduce Ripple’s influence to 2 out of 35 validators. The network had faced other technical issues in recent months, including a node crash in November 2024 and full history node failures in September requiring emergency patches. XRP Price Tanks XRP prices have taken a hit, dumping 10% on the day in a fall to $2.45 following the incident. The cross-border payment token was trading at $2.49 at the time of writing, down 26% from its 2025 high of $3.38 in mid-January. XRP fell back to $2 following the imposition of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs over the weekend but managed to recover to almost $2.80 on Feb. 4. Ripple’s native token has performed very well in the recent crypto rally, having gained almost 400% since the same time last year. Nearly all of those gains have come in the past three month,s with the change in guard in American politics promising a brighter future for crypto companies.

He believes that once the US takes this step, other nations will follow suit. “It’s entirely possible that our voting systems, our government procurement systems, our payment systems, our identity systems, and our central bank functions will all have some form of blockchain connectivity within five years,” Hoskinson said.

The project has rapidly emerged as a go-to platform for traders, reaching 250,000 monthly active users and over 500,000 total users. With a 96.3% month-on-month growth rate in app installs, Best Wallet has seen an impressive 658% increase in total installations since its launch in November 2024. With investor interest still high, funding for Best Wallet has surged by $500,000 in just the past five days, further accelerating its momentum. Currently, early adopters can acquire $BEST tokens at $0.02385, but this round closes in less than 13 hours, after which the price will increase as the project moves into its next phase. Best Wallet’s Pick: Pepe Unchained Delivers The steady influx of capital into Best Wallet reflects growing confidence in the platform, fueled in part by the success of its “Upcoming Tokens” project screener, which spotlighted Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) last year. Over the past 13 days, $PEPU has surged by 142%, rewarding early investors who followed Best Wallet’s presale recommendation. Those who got in early and held their tokens have seen returns exceeding 203% since January 20. Pepe Unchained made history as the first meme coin to raise over $73 million in its presale, making it the top presale of 2024. A key factor behind its early success was its inclusion in Best Wallet’s “Upcoming Tokens” feature, which helps users discover high-potential projects in the crowded crypto space. Best Wallet has consistently identified promising opportunities, and Pepe Unchained is no exception. Investors who followed its recommendation have remained in profit since the token’s launch. Initially priced at $0.008 during presale, $PEPU is now trading at $0.02004, delivering over 150% returns to early backers. PEPU $0.0195 USD price today, Pepe Unchained live chart, forecast | DEXTools Although the token has retraced from its peak of $0.06858, where early investors saw gains of over 757%, those who bought on January 20 have still more than doubled their investment.

MetaMask’s new Gas Station eliminates this hassle by covering fees within the swap process itself. On Feb. 5, MetaMask introduced “Gas Station,” a new feature aimed at addressing one of the most frustrating roadblocks in the Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem—insufficient gas fees preventing transactions from going through. No ETH for gas? No problem. ⛽️ You can now pay for gas with the token you're swapping. pic.twitter.com/rBNW3ymL65 — MetaMask.eth 🦊🫰 (@MetaMask) February 4, 2025 Since network fees must be paid in ETH, users without a sufficient balance often find themselves stuck, forced to go through the time-consuming process of purchasing ETH from an exchange and transferring it to their wallet before they can proceed. With its new Gas Station feature, users can now complete token swaps without needing to maintain a separate ETH balance for gas. Instead, transaction fees are included directly in the swap quote, eliminating the need for last-minute ETH top-ups and making the process smoother. The feature is currently live on the MetaMask browser extension for Ethereum’s mainnet, with a mobile rollout planned soon. It supports swaps involving a range of assets, including Tether ( USDT ), USD Coin ( USDC ), Dai ( DAI ), ETH, Wrapped Ethereum ( wETH ), Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ), Wrapped Staked Ethereum ( wstETH ), and Wrapped Solana (wSOL). Users simply need to ensure that their swap value is sufficient to cover the gas fees. MetaMask’s update comes at a time when Ethereum itself is undergoing a major change. Validators recently approved an increase in the network’s gas limit, raising it from 30 million to a planned maximum of 36 million gas units. The gas limit determines the amount of computational work that can be processed in a single block, effectively setting the number of transactions that can be included. When the limit is too low and network demand is high, fees surge as users compete for block space. Increasing the gas limit allows more transactions to fit into each block, improving network efficiency and easing congestion. According to on-chain data , the average gas limit has already climbed to 35.5 million units as of Feb. 5. The last time Ethereum made such a change was in 2021, when it doubled the gas limit from 15 million to 30 million. However, this latest increase is particularly notable as the first since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake , marking a big step in the network’s post-Merge evolution.",News|Ethereum|GAS Fee|Metamask,EN,0,0,ETH|USDT|WALLET|BTC|DAI,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-05 06:17:22

According to data from Farside Investors, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $340.7 million on Feb. 4, marking a shift from the outflows recorded the previous day when these investment products saw $234.4 million in net redemptions. BlackRock’s IBIT once again took the lead in inflows with $249 million entering the fund following a day of remaining still. The spot Bitcoin has seen about $40.7 billion in inflows since the launch day. ARK and 21 Shares’ ARKB followed with $56.1 million in inflows. Other ETFs that experienced net positive flows included Grayscale’s GBTC, which drew in $19.5 million, and Bitwise’s BITB, which saw a $16.1 million inflow. The remaining seven ETFs reported no inflows or outflows, indicating a pause in investor activity for those funds. The resurgence of inflows into the 12 Bitcoin ETFs followed President Donald Trump’s agreement with the presidents of Mexico and Canada to suspend the controversial 25% tariffs on both nations for one month. This was accompanied by Trump signing an executive order to establish a first-of-its-kind sovereign wealth fund, sparking speculation within the crypto community that the U.S. may use it to purchase Bitcoin. Following the news, Bitcoin briefly reclaimed the $100,000 key level on Feb. 4, while Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin also posted significant gains, signaling a potential bullish resurgence.

The reaction from market participants fueled fears of a global trade war, causing the crypto market to briefly shed over $500 billion on Feb. 3. At press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was exchanging hands at $98,070, down 1.3% over the past day. Commenting on the recent scenario, Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares told crypto.news, that while the tariffs have caused short-term volatility, they “may contribute to a longer-term shift that ultimately benefits Bitcoin.” If the U.S. seeks to “weaken the dollar’s overvaluation while maintaining cheap borrowing costs,” it could lead to increased pressure on the Fed to cut rates, creating a “more accommodative monetary environment.” He emphasized that a weaker dollar, lower Treasury yields, and rising global liquidity could act as catalysts for Bitcoin’s next major rally, reinforcing its position as a hedge against fiat debasement. Mena also pointed out that while the market correction has been sharp, it acts as a “healthy shakeout,” as crypto cycles rarely sustain parabolic runs without pullbacks. Historically, February has been a strong month for Bitcoin, posting positive returns in 12 of the last 14 years, with an average return of 15.66%, per data from CoinGlass. Although these developments may seem negative for Bitcoin in the short term, Mena suggests that “this period of volatility may ultimately set the stage for its next major expansion,” with macroeconomic conditions aligning for Bitcoin to potentially break past previous all-time highs and consolidate within the “$150k-$200k range.” Read more: David Sacks press conference: how will Bitcoin and altcoins react",News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-05 07:06:35

While the bears are constantly exerting more pressure, the submissive behaviour of the bulls may eventually lead the rally towards lower ranges. On the other hand, the whales have also turned bearish on Chainlink, which should be a huge matter of concern for the upcoming LINK price rally. The whale movement is closely monitored, as it is considered one of the best indicators to speculate on the next price action of the token. A greater accumulation raises optimism among the market participants, while a huge drop in their holding could certainly create fear among them. In a recent update, the whales have shed off a huge portion of their holding, which has raised concerns for the next price action. The Santiment data shared by a popular analyst, Ali , shows a massive drop in the LINK whale holdings. They have offloaded nearly 4.3 million LINK in the last 48 hours, which has promoted the bearish activity. This appears to be a quite significant move, probably to tone the market where the small players take advantage of the market volatility. So what’s next for the LINK price rally? Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis The latest rebound from the lows close to $15.5 was supported by over 1659 transactions with a minimum value of $100K. Meanwhile, the unique active LINK address shot up above 9500, which is the highest in the past 4 weeks. Despite this, the drop in whale accumulation, which has dropped from above 200 million to close to 181 million, seems to have dragged levels below the crucial range. The latest pullback has dragged the LINK price below the ascending triangle while the bulls are trying hard to defend the support zone that it held since December. The volume fluctuates, which suggests a rise in volatility. Besides, the RSI continues to form lower highs and lows, indicating a rise in the bearish dominance, while the OBV triggered a bearish divergence before reaching the local highs. These indicators suggest a drop in the strength of the rally, which could further push the prices lower. Currently, the LINK price is strongly holding above $19 support but a lack of bullish candles may initiate a 17% correction close to $15; otherwise, a rebound could elevate the rally beyond $25. The present market dynamics show only a little scope for a bullish reversal and hence, holding the crucial support at $18.97 is mandatory.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|LINK|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 07:14:01

The latest example? Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), a token that took off before many could even blink. Investors who got in early saw their portfolios surge, while those who hesitated were left watching from the sidelines. But crypto never stops moving, and the next big meme coin is already making waves. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, and it’s bringing serious heat with its high-reward referral program, Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and lucrative staking options. If you’re searching for the top new meme coins to invest in right now , this is your shot at catching a breakout project before it takes off. BTFD Coin’s Explosive Presale and Referral Program — The Bulls Are Charging BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token riding on hype. It’s backed by a thriving community, solid tokenomics, and an innovative referral program that rewards early adopters. Unlike other projects that rely only on social media buzz, BTFD has created a system where holders can earn passive rewards simply by sharing the opportunity. This unique referral program has already driven massive interest, as investors can earn 10% in BTFD tokens at the end of the month if they land in the top 20 referrers. The competition resets every month, giving new and existing investors fresh chances to stack their holdings. The referral structure benefits both referrers and new investors. When someone uses a referral code to buy BTFD, they receive an extra 10% BTFD tokens on purchases of $50 or more. At the same time, the referrer earns 10% of the purchased amount if they make it to the leaderboard. This setup creates an ecosystem where investors actively spread awareness while growing their own holdings. It’s a powerful incentive that’s attracting a flood of new users into the BTFD ecosystem. While the referral program is the standout feature, it’s not the only way to earn. The Play-to-Earn game, which went live on January 1st, 2025, is already rewarding players with BTFD tokens, combining entertainment with real earning potential. For those looking to maximize passive income, staking offers a massive 90% APY, making it one of the most lucrative options in the meme coin space. Between the referral program, gaming rewards, and staking incentives, BTFD Coin is proving itself to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in right now. Now, let’s talk about why timing matters. BTFD is in Stage 14 of its presale, with tokens currently priced at just $0.00016. But this price won’t stay for long. Once the presale ends, the token will list at $0.0006, and analysts predict a post-launch surge to $0.006. That means an early investment could lead to significant returns . If you put in $5,000 at today’s price, you’d secure 31.25 million BTFD tokens. If BTFD reaches the projected price of $0.006, that investment would be worth $187,500. That’s life-changing money that could be used to buy a new car, fund a dream vacation, or even put a down payment on a house. With over $5.93 million already raised, 69 billion tokens sold, and a growing community of more than 10,200 holders, the demand is rising fast. Those who wait too long will miss out on the best possible entry price. BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to invest in right now, and this is your chance to get in before the next stage kicks in. Goatseus Maximus Had Its Moment—But That Ship Has Sailed No one can deny that Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) was one of the meme coin success stories in recent months. With a massive community, a strong narrative, and rapid price surges, GOAT created wealth for those who got in early. But early entry is everything. By the time most investors caught wind of GOAT’s potential, the biggest gains had already been made. That’s the nature of meme coins—timing is the difference between catching a moonshot and watching from the sidelines. This is why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to invest in right now. Unlike GOAT, which already had its moment, BTFD is still in its presale stage. That means you still have a chance to buy in before the big wave hits. The Bottom Line History repeats itself in crypto—those who hesitate often miss the biggest opportunities. If you sat out on Goatseus Maximus and regretted it, BTFD Coin is giving you a second chance to get in before the big run. With its explosive presale, lucrative referral program, and high-stakes potential, BTFD Coin is primed for a breakout. But this window won’t stay open forever— act now before the presale ends and the next stage kicks in. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does the BTFD referral program work? The referral program lets you earn 10% in BTFD tokens when your referral code is used, as long as you make it to the top 20 on the leaderboard. Additionally, your referrals get an extra 10% tokens on their purchases of $50 or more. How much can I make if BTFD Coin hits its projected price? At the current presale price of $0.00016, a $5,000 investment would get you 31.25 million BTFD tokens. If the price hits $0.006, that investment could be worth $187,500. Is BTFD Coin a good investment? Yes, BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to invest in right now. With a strong referral program, staking at 90% APY, and a Play-to-Earn game already live, it offers multiple ways to earn.

Notably, in the last one year, the XRP market has showcased an impressive growth of 395%. A recent revelation by Ryan Rasmussen, the head of research at Bitwise Invest, indicates that top institutional players are closely watching developments related to the XRP market. Wealth Management Teams Want XRP, BTC and ETH in Client Portfolios Rasmussen revealed that a prominent wealth management team is interested in allocating XRP in their clients’ portfolios. Emphasising this team’s extreme confidence in the future of top cryptos, he noted that the team personally holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP and many more. SEC’s Approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Boost Industrial Adoption 2024 was an excellent year for the crypto industry, especially for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the last one year, BTC and ETH have surged by at least 129.5% and 18.9%, respectively. The SEC’s BTC Spot ETF approval and its ETH Spot ETF approval were the two significant developments witnessed last year. These developments influenced the entire crypto industry, as they paved the way for the entry of more institutional players into the sector. The total market cap of the cryptocurrency sector experienced an impressive growth of 98.13% in 2024. Interestingly, bettors at Polymarket suggest that there is an 80% probability that an XRP Spot ETF will be approved in 2025. Experts believe that if the SEC gives approval for XRP Spot ETFs, it will not only benefit the XRP market, but also the entire crypto market. Compliance Hurdles Still Exist for Wealth Firms Expressing the uncertainty around whether wealth management firms will use XRP Spot ETF products this year, Rasmussen pointed out that even though Bitcoin Spot ETFs were approved in early 2024, many prominent wealth management firms have not yet approved these products for client portfolios. XRP’s Future: A Quick Analysis Several prominent institutional players have expressed their interest in launching XRP Spot ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is currently considering numerous applications seeking approval for XRP Spot ETFs. Reports suggest that CME Group is planning to launch XRP futures contracts. XRP’s growing institutional interest signals a promising future, especially with potential ETF approvals and CME’s plans for futures contracts. While compliance hurdles still exist for wealth management firms, the increasing demand for XRP, Bitcoin and Etheruem in client portfolios highlights crypto’s expanding role in traditional finance. If the SEC approves XRP Spot ETFs, it could significantly boost adoption, benefiting both XRP and the broader crypto market.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|MARKET|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 07:16:18

The 20-EMA at $3.58 serves as immediate support, while $3.87 – $4.12 remains a key resistance range. A break below $3.50 could push SUI toward $3.08, while a breakout above $4.12 may drive it toward $4.90. Sui (SUI) has been under pressure after it failed to sustain its position above $4.00, which sparked speculation about its next move.

The case, which began in 2020, centers around allegations that Ripple Labs failed to register its XRP token as a security with the SEC. However, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, recently shared his thoughts on recent regulatory shifts on the case. In an interview with CNBC, when asked about the latest developments in the case, Alderoty said that Ripple was not accused of fraud, market manipulation, or consumer harm. In fact, he pointed out that the SEC has not been able to identify any specific victims of the alleged wrongdoing or any evidence of financial loss. Instead, the lawsuit largely stems from Ripple’s alleged failure to register with the SEC, despite the fact that there was no clear mechanism in place for crypto companies to do so at the time. Alderoty described the case as part of a broader “war on crypto,” a regulatory approach under the previous administration that sought to stifle the growth of the cryptocurrency industry through aggressive enforcement actions. He said that Ripple spent over $150 million defending itself in this case over the course of four years. What’s Next for Ripple? Following the shift in power, the SEC’s stance has begun to change. In the final days of the Trump administration, the SEC filed an appeal in the case, submitting their opening brief just five days before the inauguration. However, with the anticipated confirmation of Paul Atkins as the new SEC chair, Alderoty hopes that the new leadership will take a more measured approach and reconsider the merit of such lawsuits. Ripple’s legal team is still moving forward with their defense, preparing to file a responsive brief in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. However, Alderoty views the ongoing case as background noise in the grander scheme of Ripple’s strategy. He also expressed his belief that continuing with these lawsuits, particularly those that involve “non-fraud, victimless crime” allegations, is a waste of taxpayer money and regulatory resources.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 07:20:52

Notably, on-chain data by a top crypto analyst revealed that roughly 4 million tokens were dumped in the last 48 hours. In turn, bearish market sentiments bubbled the coin, with its price extending its weekly loss to 15%. Chainlink Whales Offload Heavily Igniting Market Concerns According to an X post by crypto market analyst Ali Martinez on February 5, Chainlink whales dumped 4.13 million tokens to exchanges in the last 48 hours. The massive dump amid the broader crypto market’s recent waning movement has set off severe investor concerns about future performance. Source: Ali Charts, X For context, massive whale dumps to exchanges flag a loss of large-scale investors’ confidence in the asset’s potential. As a result, the future performance remains at risk, with the broader trends further solidifying bearish market sentiments. Crypto Market Wanes Aside from the bearish Chainlink whale activity, another factor threatens the coin’s price. The global crypto realm has seen alarming price drops this week, primarily attributed to trade war speculations amid Trump’s new tariffs. Although postponed for 30 days, the new tariffs still threaten the global markets. In sync with this saga, even the crypto market sees a downtrend, with BTC and altcoins tanking notably in the past 24 hours. LINK price also mirrored a similar action intraday. Chainlink Price On Shaky Grounds? At the time of reporting, LINK price lost nearly 2.5% and exchanged hands at $19.58. The coin’s intraday low and high were $19.37 and $21.26, respectively. As mentioned above, the current waning action aligns with the broader market trend and increased selling pressure amid Chainlink whales’ selloffs. However, recent data by Santiment indicated that LINK has stood out amid the recent market swing down. Notably, the coin witnessed heavy key stakeholder dip buying, with massive on-chain activity recorded below the $20 level. This data has set off contrasting speculations over the asset’s long-term prospects. Source: Santiment, X Also, a recent Chainlink price analysis by CoinGape aligned with Santiment’s data, revealing that the recent dip is a potential buy-the-dip opportunity for investors.

The post presents a hypothetical scenario where owning a single share of XRP would represent 0.000001% ownership in these markets, equating to approximately $62,000. This calculation is based on a comparative analysis of how different asset classes would be valued under similar ownership percentages. The original post references figures showing that 0.000001% of the U.S. stock market equates to $62,204.75, while the same proportion of the M2 money supply is valued at $21,000, and the derivatives market at $12,400. These figures highlight the vast scale of these financial markets and suggest significant potential value for XRP if widely adopted in such sectors. If you own 1 share of XRP, and they use xrp for derivatives, m2 money supply and real estate, you'd own 0.000001%. Thats about $62,000. — John Denver ( Parody ) (@JohnDParody) February 3, 2025 Community Reactions and Speculative Calculations Following Denver’s post, X user QuietConqueror responded with a series of speculative calculations, emphasizing the potential for substantial returns with relatively small holdings of XRP. They noted that holding 20 XRP could theoretically be worth $1,240,000 (20 * $62,000), owning 100 XRP could amount to $6,200,000, and 500 XRP could be valued at $31,000,000. The user suggested that individuals might not need to accumulate large amounts of XRP for it to be financially significant. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, these figures are purely speculative and depend on the assumption that XRP would be integrated into these financial systems at a level that represents a fixed percentage of their total value. While intriguing, this perspective does not account for factors such as liquidity, adoption rates, regulatory constraints, or the mechanics of how XRP would function within these markets. Feasibility of XRP’s Integration into Large Financial Markets The discussion raises an important question: Could XRP realistically be integrated into global markets such as derivatives and M2 money supply at a scale that would justify these valuations? XRP’s primary use case is facilitating cross-border payments and liquidity in financial systems, with its core strength lying in its ability to enable fast and low-cost transactions. While institutions and banks have explored XRP for payments and settlement purposes, its direct role in broader financial markets like derivatives remains speculative.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

The same happened with this crypto trader, earning $4.5M ($4.4 more precisely) in profits after trading in the newly launched ENRON memecoin. Although this high-stakes trade favored him, let’s discuss how this happened. ENRON Memecoin Trade Paid Off, Turning $900k Into $5.3M A crypto trader went all in with the newly launched ENRON meme coin, spending $900k to buy the $11.66M ENRON token. According to the Lookonchain post , the trader acted swiftly and grabbed the opportunity seconds after the creators posted about the contract address. Within less than 30 minutes, the trader sold all the tokens, cashing out $5.3M at the ENRON price peak. More importantly, the crypto investor netted $4.4M in profits from this trade within less than an hour. Apart from the impressive profits, the crypto trader made the right decision about trade placement, significantly as the ENRON price dropped moments after the trader’s sale. The ENRON meme coin commenced trading at a market capitalization of $500M, but soon, it surged to $900M. However, the market’s volatility played its role, dropping the valuation by 70% to $250M within 30 minutes. Not The Only Trader With Such Massive Returns Along with the aforementioned crypto trader, a few others succeeded with their trade on the ENRON memecoin. Another trader spent $1.2M to purchase 10.75M ENRON and sold all within 12 minutes. However, these 12 minutes were enough to yield 246.4% returns, making them a profit of $3.94M. However, the community calls such trades insider jobs. Regardless of the doubts, these two traders have presented the bullish side of the market. Whether this bullishness will persist or fall short with time for this crypto has to be seen. ENRON Price Surged 115% Amid Hype After Donald Trump launched the TRUMP meme coin , more businesses came forward with meme-themed cryptocurrencies. Enron, a powerhouse in the American energy sector before its bankruptcy in 2001, is behind the ENRON token. Satirical performance artist Connor Gaydos publicly announced the token and allocated 20% of its supply to early participants. Interestingly, this token had a seven-day vesting period and a 180-day liner unlock period. This event highlights the crypto landscape taking over the financial ventures and new tokens gaining investors’ attention. At present, ENRON memecoin trades at $0.1654 after its price surged by 114% per Dexscreener. Also, it has a market capitalization of $165.4M and a 24-hour trading volume of $101.6M, showing significant demand. However, it also shows signs of high volatility, so investors must research before getting involved in this or any other crypto token. Bottom Line Meme coins are among the most demanded cryptocurrencies. The aforementioned crypto trader earned $4.4M in profits within just 30 minutes with ENRON memecoin. This points to the profitability of the market if the trades are placed right. However, not all trades go according to expectations and may go entirely wrong as the newly launched tokens possess high volatility.

Trong tuần qua, Bitcoin đã giảm xuống dưới mức 100.000 USD, phù hợp với kỳ vọng về việc giảm biến động và khả năng điều chỉnh thị trường trong ngắn hạn. Mặc dù Bitcoin khởi đầu năm 2025 với mức tăng 10% trong tháng Một, đà tăng trưởng của nó đã chậm lại, với giá giao dịch trong phạm vi 15% trong 65 ngày qua. Thực tế, BTC đã dẫn đầu các thị trường chứng khoán Mỹ trong việc phản ứng với các diễn biến vĩ mô. Cấu trúc hai đỉnh xuất hiện trên cả biểu đồ Bitcoin và S&P 500, nhưng xuất hiện ở BTC trước. Xúc tác mới nhất của thị trường – các thông báo về thuế quan của Trump – đã khiến S&P 500 giảm 0,5% vào thứ Sáu tuần trước và gây ra một đợt sụt giảm rõ rệt hơn đối với Bitcoin. Hệ số tương quan 30 ngày giữa Bitcoin và S&P 500 đã tăng lên mức 0,8, đánh dấu mức cao nhất trong năm tháng. Điều này củng cố quan điểm rằng Bitcoin đang giao dịch giống như một tài sản rủi ro được thúc đẩy bởi các yếu tố vĩ mô. Dù có biến động ngắn hạn, Bitcoin vẫn giữ vững cấu trúc mạnh mẽ trên các khung thời gian dài hơn. Kể từ cuộc bầu cử Mỹ, BTC đã vượt trội so với các thị trường truyền thống, tăng từ 67.000 USD lên hơn 100.000 USD, trong khi các cổ phiếu chỉ phục hồi một cách chập chờn. Biểu đồ BTC/USD 4H. (Nguồn: Bitfinex) Trong bối cảnh này, nền kinh tế Mỹ tiếp tục thể hiện sự bền bỉ thông qua chi tiêu tiêu dùng mạnh mẽ và tăng trưởng kinh tế, nhưng cũng đang đối mặt với những trở ngại từ sự bất định về chính sách, gián đoạn thương mại và lạm phát dai dẳng. Cục Dự trữ Liên bang (Fed) đã giữ nguyên lãi suất ở mức 4,25–4,50% vào tuần trước, cho thấy các nhà hoạch định chính sách chưa sẵn sàng nới lỏng điều kiện tiền tệ cho đến khi lạm phát cho thấy xu hướng giảm rõ ràng. Chi tiêu tiêu dùng tăng mạnh vào tháng 12, với mức chi tiêu thực tế tăng 0,4%, củng cố thêm sự tăng trưởng kinh tế nhưng làm phức tạp lộ trình phía trước của Fed. Thay đổi phần trăm hàng tháng của Chỉ số Giá Tiêu dùng Cá nhân (PCE) Lạm phát vẫn cao hơn mục tiêu hai phần trăm của ngân hàng trung ương, với lạm phát PCE cốt lõi dao động ở mức 2,8% so với cùng kỳ năm ngoái. Dù tốc độ tăng lương chậm lại, thị trường lao động thắt chặt và các hạn chế tiềm tàng về nhập cư có thể đẩy chi phí lao động lên cao, gia tăng rủi ro lạm phát. Trong khi đó, tăng trưởng kinh tế kết thúc năm ở mức 2,3% , được hỗ trợ bởi tiêu dùng hộ gia đình mạnh mẽ và chi tiêu chính phủ tăng, mặc dù đầu tư kinh doanh chậm lại và bất ổn thương mại tiếp tục tạo ra rủi ro. Thị trường đã điều chỉnh kỳ vọng cắt giảm lãi suất , định giá khả năng nới lỏng trong ngắn hạn thấp hơn. Với các biến số chính trị và kinh tế đang thay đổi, những tháng tới sẽ là then chốt để xác định liệu Fed có chuyển sang nới lỏng chính sách hay duy trì lập trường thắt chặt để chống lại áp lực lạm phát. Khi nền kinh tế Mỹ đi qua giai đoạn vừa bền vững vừa bất định về chính sách, ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử đang trải qua một điểm uốn riêng – được đánh dấu bằng sự tích lũy mạnh mẽ từ các tổ chức, đổi mới tài chính và hội nhập sâu hơn với cơ sở hạ tầng tài chính truyền thống. Với áp lực lạm phát khiến Fed tạm ngừng hành động, các bên tham gia thị trường đang theo dõi sát sao cách các tài sản kỹ thuật số phản ứng với các xu hướng kinh tế vĩ mô, sự thay đổi chính sách tiền tệ và việc áp dụng ngày càng nhiều của các doanh nghiệp. MicroStrategy tiếp tục tăng cường đầu tư vào Bitcoin , mua thêm 10.107 BTC với giá 1,1 tỷ USD, nâng tổng số lượng nắm giữ lên 158.400 BTC. Công ty cũng đã nộp hồ sơ đăng ký với SEC, cho phép huy động vốn hiệu quả hơn cho các đợt mua Bitcoin trong tương lai. Trong khi đó, Metaplanet , một công ty niêm yết tại Tokyo, đã lập kỷ lục khi huy động được 745 triệu USD để mở rộng dự trữ Bitcoin, củng cố chiến lược “Chỉ Bitcoin và vì Bitcoin” của mình giữa lúc đồng yên suy yếu. Đây là tín hiệu cho thấy niềm tin ngày càng tăng của các tổ chức rằng Bitcoin là một biện pháp phòng ngừa chống lại sự mất giá tiền tệ và bất ổn kinh tế. Đồng thời, Tether đang mở rộng tiện ích của stablecoin USDt trị giá 140 tỷ USD bằng cách tích hợp nó vào mạng Lightning của Bitcoin. Động thái này nâng cao đáng kể cơ sở hạ tầng tài chính của Bitcoin, cho phép giao dịch toàn cầu nhanh hơn và hiệu quả hơn. Bằng cách tận dụng Taproot Assets, Tether đang thu hẹp khoảng cách giữa stablecoin và tính bảo mật của Bitcoin, biến nó thành một mạng lưới thanh toán khả thi hơn chứ không chỉ là nơi lưu trữ giá trị.

The change, first reported by The Washington Post on February 4, signals the company’s approach to national security partnerships as AI becomes more integrated into military and intelligence operations. In a blog post published on Tuesday, Google executives stated that the update was necessary due to AI’s increasing prevalence and the need for technology companies based in democratic nations to support government and defense clients. We believe democracies should lead in AI development, guided by core values like freedom, equality, and respect for human rights. And we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security. Google The company’s previous AI ethos, enacted in 2018, explicitly rejected “weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly “injury people” and “technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms,” have now been removed from its AI Principles website. Google updates AI principles for “national security” Google’s revised principles now state that the company will proceed with AI development where the “overall likely benefits substantially exceed the foreseeable risks and downsides.” The update marks a notable departure from its earlier stance, which emphasized broad ethical considerations and the avoidance of AI applications that could cause harm. Moreover, US tech industry leaders are seemingly working towards improving the country’s AI capabilities, in order to charge ahead in the technological “cold war” between the United States and China. On Monday, Palantir’s Chief Technology Officer, Shyam Sankar, described the AI race as a “whole-of-nation” effort that needs to go past the walls of the Department of Defense, for “America to win.” For years, Google’s restrictions on national security applications of AI made it an outlier among leading AI firms. Other tech giants, including Microsoft and Amazon, have maintained long-standing partnerships with the Pentagon, but newer AI companies are warming up to military ties. Late last year, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, announced a collaboration with defense contractor Anduril to develop AI technology for the U.S. military. Similarly, Anthropic, the company behind the Claude chatbot, partnered with Palantir to provide AI services to U.S. intelligence agencies through Amazon Web Services. Michael Horowitz, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and former Pentagon official well-versed in emerging technologies, told the WP that Google’s policy change is part of a broader trend. “ Google’s announcement is more evidence that the relationship between the U.S. technology sector and the Defense Department continues to get closer, including leading AI companies ,” he said. “ It makes sense that Google has updated its policy to reflect the new reality .” Controversy over Google’s military and surveillance contracts In 2023, as reported by CNN, Google let go of over 50 employees following a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint cloud computing and AI contract with Amazon to provide services to the Israeli government and military. Executives repeatedly defended the deal, avowing that it did not violate Google’s AI principles. However, documents revealed by The New York Times in December suggested that Google’s agreement with Israel included AI capabilities such as image categorization and object tracking, as well as potential provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. According to the Times , four months before signing onto Project Nimbus, Google executives had privately raised concerns that the deal could damage the company’s reputation and that its cloud services might be linked to human rights violations. At the same time, Google has faced criticism for restricting internal discussions about geopolitical conflicts, including the war in Gaza. Some employees accused the company of suppressing debate while simultaneously deepening its involvement in defense and surveillance-related AI contracts. On social media, following Google’s updated AI principles, netizens are debating whether the tech startup’s plan is to protect the interests of Americans, or its just a ploy to take the biggest piece of cake in government defense contracts. “Sooooo….is AI going to be used for US weapons and surveillance or sold to top bidder?” One X user asked .

Crypto Expert Warns Of Devastating Crash Ahead!,https://coinpedia.org/news/suis-30-drop-just-the-beginning-crypto-expert-warns-devastating-crash/,"The post SUI’s 30% Drop Just the Beginning? Crypto Expert Warns Of Devastating Crash Ahead! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SUI, the native token of the Layer-1 blockchain, has taken a major hit, dropping more than 30% in a month. Such a massive drop has raised concerns among traders, with crypto analyst Jason Pizzino warning that the token might be following a historical pattern that led to a deep crash in the past. Could SUI be on the verge of another major downturn? SUI on the Brink of a Major Crash According to Jason Pizzino’s analysis , the SUI token is displaying an “overbalance in time and price,” meaning its recent decline has lasted longer and fallen further than previous corrections in this market cycle. However, this similar pattern was last seen before a sharp drop in April 2024, when SUI fell 58% from its high. Meanwhile, if it follows the same pattern, it could see another round of panic selling. Pizzino further points out that SUI recently dropped to $2.38 before rising again. He believes that this recovery might not last long, and the price could fall again. And if SUI fails to stay above $2, Pizzino notes it could drop to $1.60 or even between $1.10 and $1.20, returning to its previous low points. Rising Short Sellers Dominance Adding to the concern, traders in the derivatives market seem to be betting against SUI. The token’s funding rate, which measures the cost of keeping a position open, is currently negative at -0.01%. It suggests that short sellers who profit when prices fall are dominating the market. Therefore many traders expect SUI’s price to continue falling in the short term, which could add more downward pressure. As of now, it is trading around $3.58 , reflecting a rise of 5.6% in a day. SUI Price Analysis Technical indicators also point to potential further losses. On the daily chart, SUI has fallen below the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level, signaling weak support. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has turned negative, reflecting the bearish sentiment. If this trend continues, SUI could drop another 25%, sliding to the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $2.49. However, if buyers step in and defend the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, the token might avoid further decline and even recover toward $4.56.",News,EN,0,0,SUI|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 07:46:29

US SEC to Scale Back Its Enforcement Division,https://cryptopotato.com/good-news-for-crypto-us-sec-to-scale-back-its-enforcement-division/,"The SEC is scaling back its special unit of more than 50 lawyers and staff members that were responsible for bringing crypto enforcement actions, according to a Feb. 4 New York Times report citing people with knowledge of the matter. Some of the lawyers in the crypto enforcement unit are being assigned to other departments in the agency, the report noted , adding that one of its top litigators was moved out, with others describing the move as “an unfair demotion.” One of the first things the new SEC chair, Mark Uyeda, did was establish a team to review the regulator’s approach to dealing with digital assets. The new task force is led by pro-crypto Commissioner Hester Peirce. The SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit.

One of President Trump’s first executive orders signed on Jan. 23 was aimed at promoting the growth of crypto and “eliminating regulatory overreach” from financial regulators over the past few years. One of the order’s policies was to provide “regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral regulations, frameworks that account for emerging technologies, transparent decision making, and well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries.” The SEC downsizing news comes hours after Hester Peirce outlined the regulator’s new approach to crypto markets and reconsidering whether certain crypto assets are securities. She said that the task force’s main priorities were examining the security status of crypto assets, identifying areas outside of SEC jurisdiction, addressing token offerings, improving registration pathways, and updating broker-dealer regulations. It would also clarify custody solutions for investment advisers, provide clarity on crypto lending and staking, and review crypto exchange-traded products, she said.

He introduced the GENIUS Act, focusing on stablecoin regulation and establishing clear regulatory frameworks, and announced the formation of a joint House-Senate working group on crypto legislation. The main objectives were to keep crypto innovation within the United States, create regulatory clarity, foster blockchain development, and harmonize regulations across agencies such as the SEC and CFTC . The key takeaway from today’s press conference led by @DavidSacks : Congress is serious about passing stablecoin legislation. ABOUT TIME!

SparkCat, a malware targeting both Android and iOS users, spreads through malicious software development kits embedded in seemingly harmless apps, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky warned in a Feb. 4 report . It uses optical character recognition, a technology that reads text from images, to scan through a victim’s photo gallery, hunting for crypto wallet recovery phrases hidden in screenshots or saved notes. The malware has been active since March 2024, and some of these infected apps, including food delivery and AI-powered messaging apps, were available on Google Play and the App Store. It is also the first known instance of an OCR-based stealer reaching Apple’s platform. How does SparkCat work? On Android, the malware is injected via a Java-based SDK called Spark, which disguises itself as an analytics module. When an infected app is launched, Spark retrieves an encrypted configuration file from a remote GitLab repository. Once active, SparkCat uses Google ML Kit’s OCR tool to scan the device’s image gallery. It searches for specific keywords related to crypto wallet recovery phrases across multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and several European languages. The malware then uploads the image to an attacker-controlled server, either via Amazon cloud storage or a Rust-based protocol, which adds an extra layer of complexity in tracking its activity due to encrypted data transfers and non-standard communication methods. You might also like: Russian gang targets crypto holders with cross-platform spear-phishing malware On iOS, SparkCat operates through a malicious framework embedded in the infected apps, disguised under names like GZIP, googleappsdk, or stat. This framework, written in Objective-C and obfuscated with HikariLLVM, integrates with Google ML Kit to extract text from images in the gallery. To avoid raising suspicion, the iOS version only requests gallery access when users perform specific actions, such as opening a support chat. The report also warned that the “flexibility of the malware” allows it to steal other sensitive data like “content of messages or passwords that could remain on screenshots.” Several users at risk Kaspersky estimates that the malware has infected over 242,000 devices across Europe and Asia. While the exact origin remains unknown, embedded comments in the code and error messages suggest that the malware’s developers are fluent in Chinese. Researchers at Kaspersky urge users to avoid storing important information like seed phrases, private keys and passwords within screenshots. Sophisticated malware campaigns remain a consistent threat within the crypto space, and this is not the first time bad actors have managed to bypass Google and Apple’s store security measures. In September 2024, crypto exchange Binance flagged the “Clipper malware,” which infected devices via unofficial mobile apps and plugins and replaced the victim’s copied wallet address with one controlled by the attacker to trick them into transferring crypto to the wrong destination. Meanwhile, private key theft has dealt serious damage to the crypto industry, being one of the main reasons behind some of its biggest losses yet.

The monthly average network hashrate rose 1% to 785 exahashes per second (EH/s), the bank noted, while mining difficulty fell 2% month-on-month. The month-end, weekly moving average hashrate was 781 EH/s, a 2% decline from the end of December, the report said. ""This is relatively uncommon, and a modest tailwind for bitcoin (BTC) mining economics,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, adding that network difficulty remains 25% higher than before the halving event last April. According to a CoinDesk report from Tuesday , Bitcoin's 7-day moving average hashrate hit an all-time high of 833 exahashes per second (EH/s). Mining profitability also inched higher in January. The bank estimated that miners earned an average of $57,200 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue, an increase of less than 1% from December. The total market cap of the bitcoin miners that the bank tracks rose 5% from the month previous. Cipher Mining (CIFR) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) outperformed, gaining 23% and 16% respectively, after announcing high performance computing (HPC) related news.

XRP’s deflationary model contrasts with Bitcoin’s increasing circulating supply. Tax regulations hinder Bitcoin’s use as currency, favoring investment over spending. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has been in the spotlight lately after claims that Ripple could boost XRP’s total supply beyond its 100 billion token cap. Some critics, especially Bitcoin maximalists, suggest that Ripple might just create additional XRP, weakening its scarcity. But, validators within the XRPL community have offered evidence to dismiss these claims. This discussion touches on a bigger issue in the crypto world: the role of blockchain transparency and supply integrity. Unlike Bitcoin, which once had a bug that generated excess tokens, the XRPL has safeguards that prevent such things from happening.

Experts have chosen $FXG to lead Dogecoin and Solana with a dramatic rise this year. But investors are asking why $FXG is the best crypto to invest in instead of DOGE or SOL. Let’s find out! Solana’s Bull Run Driven by Increased DEXs Volume Data from DefiLlama shows that the DEXs volume of Solana recently reached $13.74 billion. This growth has led Solana’s SOL to see a positive price action over the past month. The Solana token ended December 2024 with a price of $198.68 after dropping 17.15% from its December 1, 2024, price of $239.81. SOL quickly jumped 5.23% to $209.07 in just 48 hours into January.

However, DOGE recovered 6.25% to $0.34 in just 48 hours into January 2025. DOGE rose further by 2.90% to reach $0.36 by January 24, 2025.

As we navigate 2025’s crypto market, emerging sectors like Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents could rival memecoins’ narrative mindshare. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) $200 Level Recovery Looks ‘Very Solid’, Is The Bleeding Over? Memecoins Defined 2024’s Crypto Market On Tuesday, Binance Research shared its “Full-Year 2024 & Themes for 2025” report, crowning memecoins as the “Defining Narrative of 2024. The platform highlighted the sector’s outstanding performance last year, which drove significant attention to the crypto market. According to the report, memecoins played a “significant role in onboarding new users to the crypto space and offer a unique way to monetize attention in the social media era.” Additionally, the notion of “so-called ‘blue-chip’ memes” served as a testament to the “growth and diversity of the memecoin market and its structure,” the report noted. The crypto community saw the creation of various sub-sectors within the memecoin space, encapsulating the events that shaped the year. For instance, PolitiFi tokens, which rose amid the American electoral campaign, recorded the many changes in the political landscape through these tokens. This narrative eventually led to the launch of the Solana-based TRUMP memecoin, the first-ever token officially backed by a politician. The memecoin was created in January to “celebrate Courage & Strength” after the July 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump. Binance Research points out that memecoins meteoric rise could be attributed to various factors, including increased transparency and a perception of fairness, accessibility, and addressing users’ frustration with the “low float, high FDV” issue. Additionally, it noted the sector’s high-risk, high-reward nature appears to have fulfilled the industry’s search for the first crypto AAA game. The report argues that the “thrill of creating memecoins of the smallest moments in cultures” trade them into “sky-high valuations” could be perceived as a game, keeping the community invested in the sector and increasing its popularity. AI Agents: The Growing Narrative Second to memecoins, the AI crypto sector took 12.6% of the narrative mindshare in 2024, opening the stage for the market’s “newer fascination,” AI Agents. This sub-sector captured investors’ attention throughout Q3 2024, fueled by Truth Terminal and GOAT’s growing popularity, and became a leading narrative in recent months. AI agents, initially sparked by Truth Terminal and $GOAT, have captured the market since October and become a dominant narrative. Infrastructure providers like Virtuals Protocol (G.A.M.E. framework) and ai16z (ElizaOS framework) have been key players. The sector has also faced backlash from the crypto community. Some investors consider the new trend “worse than other past trends,” arguing that it is “overrated.” Similarly, an anonymous poll showed that Solana founders consider AI agent tokens to be overhyped. Nonetheless, it has continuously evolved and has “lots more in development.” As of this writing, the sector has a market capitalization of $7.84 billion, according to CoinGecko data. What’s Next? Binance Research pointed out the issue of memecoin longevity, as many of the tokens see a rapid rise and fall. It considers that, despite not all tokens having the level of popularity to stand the test of time, memecoins are “likely to have some staying power” in some form. Related Reading: TRUMP Coin Tanks 18%—Even Donald Trump Couldn’t Save It Meanwhile, AI Agents are significantly earlier in their development but share the “power to onboard users (AI is a key topic across business and finance) and monetize attention.” As a result, the growth of the “AI x crypto” intersection is almost certain. The report concludes that the “entry of web2 into AI Agents, and the rapid development and anticipated trajectory of AI x crypto” are some of the key areas to watch this year.

""First Concrete Step Taken, Restructuring Has Started!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-continues-positive-moves-for-cryptocurrencies-first-concrete-step-taken-restructuring-has-started/,"Gary Gensler, known for his anti-cryptocurrency stance, resigned from his position and left the SEC on January 20, the day Trump took office. After Gensler’s departure, the SEC was expected to reduce cryptocurrency enforcement and soften its stance, with interim SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda establishing a task force to loosen regulations. The SEC's newly formed crypto task force is expected to bring more clarity to cryptocurrency regulations. As expectations for the SEC rise, the SEC has decided to downsize its cryptocurrency enforcement unit. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is taking steps to downsize its special unit for cryptocurrency enforcement actions, The New York Times reported, citing five sources familiar with the matter. Accordingly, the SEC has decided to downsize a special unit of more than 50 attorneys and staff members responsible for cryptocurrency enforcement. While it was stated that some lawyers working in the unit in question were reassigned to other departments in the SEC, the change of duties of some key lawyers was seen as an unfair action. While this was the first concrete step taken by the Trump administration regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, it was stated in the statement that some of the lawyers in the sanctions unit were reassigned to other departments. Republican SEC member Hester Peirce recently said that the working group will work to classify different cryptocurrencies and activities, determining which ones qualify as securities. US President Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, known for his long-standing support for cryptocurrencies, as SEC chairman. *This is not investment advice.

Ahead of the planned talk between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing has scheduled to implement a 15 percent tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) among other control measures in the coming days. The short-term macroeconomic uncertainty has impacted major stock indexes in a bearish outlook. With the crypto industry, led by Bitcoin, depicting a positive correlation with major stock indexes, most crypto experts believe taking some profits is prudent. Key Targets for Bitcoin Today To understand how Bitcoin price is likely to perform in the next 24 hours, it is prudent to study the price action for the past three months. From a technical analysis point of view, Bitcoin price has been forming a horizontal channel, whereby the upper range is between $108k and $109k and the lower range is between $89k and $91.5k. In the past few days, Bitcoin price has been forming a falling trend, characterized by lower lows and lower highs. As a result, Bitcoin price is likely to dip below the support level of around $96k again, with a midterm target of about $91k. The bearish sentiment will, however, be invalidated if Bitcoin price breaks out of the falling logarithmic trend in the four-hour time frame. Market Picture The short-term macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the tariff wars has conflicted with the ongoing talks of implementing a strategic BTC reserve in the United States. Already, individual states have front-run the federal government, despite the Donald Trump administration issuing an executive order to help in the creation of a strategic BTC reserve. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT has continued to accumulate more Bitcoins aggressively, whereby it recorded a net cash inflow of $249 million on Tuesday to currently hold about $57.7 billion in net assets.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 08:04:10

On Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order for the Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a fund designed to provide long-term financial stability, economic growth and protection against economic shocks. Palihapitiya says on the social media platform X that the Trump administration can get the project off the ground quickly by capitalizing on assets the US government already holds, including its Bitcoin trove. “I think we can start by slowly selling down our 50% share of TikTok + borrowing against our BTC holdings if we don’t want to sell them. We can then add to this by directing any revenues from land/drilling deals and sales of any real estate from all of the abandoned buildings. This is ~$50-100 billion with little effort over the first two to three years. No borrowing. It should be invested in a mix of index funds, bonds, private equities, hedge funds and venture capital (VC) where VC is less than 10% and should shrink as the denominator gets bigger.” According to Bitcoin Treasuries, the US government currently holds 198,109 BTC worth $19.408 billion. Sovereign wealth funds are government-owned investment funds that typically use excess revenues, often from natural resources like oil, to grow money for the future. While states like Alaska have been running their sovereign wealth funds for years, the federal government itself has never utilized one.

A similar whale sell-off occurred in late January, leading to a price drop from approximately $26 to $22. Since no major negative news about Chainlink has surfaced, this sell-off is likely due to profit-taking, as LINK recently traded above $25, according to CoinGecko . Moreover, the broader crypto market sentiment fuelled by the recent implementation of tariffs by the U.S. President Donald Trump may have played a part. These tariffs, affecting imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, led to increased market volatility and prompted many to liquidate positions in riskier assets such as Chainlink .

With its presale priced at $0.00525 and $13.5 million already raised, Lightchain AI is gaining attention as a promising project in the evolving crypto market. Table of Contents Lightchain AI: Transforming blockchain with AI Solana: Leader in high-speed transactions Polygon: King of layer-2 solutions Cryptocurrency has a history of delivering life-changing gains, and few know this better than traders who made good money during Dogecoin’s (DOGE) 4000% surge back in 2017. Now, these traders are turning their focus to three emerging coins that could potentially replicate that astronomical rise, including the highly talked-about Lightchain AI. With its presale priced at $0.00525 and $13.5 million already raised, Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining attention as a project to watch in 2025. Lightchain AI: Transforming blockchain with AI Lightchain AI is the first name on the list, thanks to its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a pioneering platform that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering smart solutions across various sectors. Its tokenomics ensure sustainability and equitable distribution, with a total supply capped at 10 billion tokens allocated for presale, staking rewards, liquidity, marketing, team, and treasury. Lightchain AI employs a deflationary tokenomics model to enhance the value of its ecosystem. A portion of transaction fees and payments for AI tasks are systematically burned, permanently removing these tokens from circulation. This reduction in supply creates scarcity, which can potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens over time. By merging advanced AI capabilities with blockchain, Lightchain AI stands out as a transformative force in the digital landscape. Its presale success suggests strong investor confidence, making it a top pick for those seeking exponential returns.

Launched in 2020, it has gained attention for its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest networks in the blockchain space. Solana’s unique combination of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms enables rapid transaction processing and low fees, often less than $0.001 per transaction. This efficiency has attracted developers and users seeking scalable and cost-effective solutions. As of writing, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is trading at approximately $205.50. Polygon: King of layer-2 solutions Polygon , formerly known as Matic Network, is a prominent Layer-2 scaling solution designed to enhance Ethereum’s performance by providing faster and more cost-effective transactions. By utilizing sidechains and a modified Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, Polygon effectively reduces congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, enabling developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) with improved efficiency. In a significant development, Polygon migrated its older MATIC token to POL, aiming to serve as the network’s gas and staking token. This transition is part of the broader upgrade to Polygon 2.0, reflecting the platform’s commitment to continuous innovation and scalability. As of writing, POL (ex-MATIC) is trading at approximately $0.32 per token. For more information on Lightchain AI, visit their website , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

Thanks to its growth potential, FXGuys ($FXG) is now drawing comparisons to two of the most successful meme coins in crypto history. As one of the trending altcoins, FXGuys is gaining momentum thanks to its viral presale and features designed to attract investors seeking long-term gains. The platform rewards traders with $FXG tokens through its Trade2Earn program and offers revenue-sharing opportunities from broker trading activities. These features make it a standout in the market. FXGuys also removes buy and sell taxes, allowing investors to keep more profits. Its Trader Funding Program, which provides accounts up to $500,000 without KYC, adds another reason for its growing appeal. Could FXGuys follow the same path as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu to deliver life-changing returns? Read on to find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Analyst Says Dogecoin Could Outpace Other Meme Coins to Hit $1 On January 5, 2025, crypto analyst Ali Martinez posted a bullish forecast for Dogecoin on X, setting a target price of $1.75. According to Martinez, Dogecoin’s historical pattern of rising by 1,000% within weeks could see DOGE rally beyond the $1 mark. Currently priced at $0.31 , Dogecoin is seeing increased buying interest. Some DOGE analysts predict it could soon rise to $1.20 if market conditions remain favorable. The crypto market is buzzing with optimism, with several trending altcoins gaining traction. Ali Martinez’s forecast for Dogecoin is fueling speculation about broader market movements. Dogecoin traders are watching closely to see if Dogecoin can replicate this 1,000% move this year. As meme coins like DOGE gain momentum, the market appears poised for further growth. DOGE analysts believe these developments could set the tone for early 2025. However, other DOGE experts suggest FXGuys as one of the trending altcoins that could yield better returns than DOGE due to its high-flying presale. Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Skyrockets as the SHIB Price Struggles Shiba Inu, with a market cap of $12.8 billion, has made headlines with an incredible 2,133% jump in its burn rate . This is one of its efforts to create scarcity and increase its worth. The move has sparked talks about SHIB’s potential as the best crypto to buy among meme coins. The community’s focus on reducing SHIB supply aims to strengthen its long-term value. These efforts highlight how Shiba Inu supporters are determined to keep the token as a leading meme coin, even as the crypto market evolves. In the past week, SHIB’s price has declined by 15% to trade at $0.0000178 , causing skepticism among traders and crypto experts. Concerning price predictions, some analysts foresee an uptrend for SHIB if the burn rate continues to rise. Thus, SHIB could rise to $0.0000250 soon. On the flip side, Shiba Inu’s open interest has dropped recently, and this is usually a bearish sign. As such, SHIB could still fall to $0.0000170 in a few weeks, and this is making analysts consider $FXG one of the best cryptos to buy. FXGuys Becomes Traders’ Favorite Platform With its Numerous Features DeFi projects spring up very often, but very few truly cater to the needs of traders. As a trader, finding the right platform to improve your profits is key. FXGuys offers a platform tailored to make your trading easier and more profitable. First, with the FX Guys Trader Funding Program, you can access up to $500,000 in trading capital. This is ideal for traders who struggle with a lack of funds. If you pass the challenge phase, the FXGuys platform provides the capital, and you can focus on trading. You get to keep 80% of the profits so you can grow your earnings. Another benefit is the staking feature. By staking $FXG tokens, you can earn a 20% share of profits and revenue from the broker’s trading volume. This gives you a passive income stream, even if you’re not actively trading. It’s a great way to increase your returns while holding your tokens. The FX Guys platform also stands out because of its diverse platform options. You can trade on MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, or DXtrade, depending on where you’re located. This flexibility allows you to choose a platform you’re comfortable with, thereby providing smoother trading experiences. These platforms support trading in forex, stocks, cryptos, and commodities.

To create a fair and transparent environment, South Korean authorities are tightening their grip on tax evaders who hide wealth in cryptocurrency. As per the local reports , the Gwanak district in Seoul has announced a new investigation targeting 325 individuals who owe a combined $714,000 in unpaid taxes. To track down hidden funds, officials will request data from the country’s five major crypto exchanges. How Seoul is Cracking Down ? In recent years, South Korea has made it easier for local governments to seize and sell cryptocurrency belonging to tax evaders. A Supreme Court ruling in 2018 classified Bitcoin and other digital assets as property, making them eligible for confiscation. In 2022, new laws gave tax agencies the authority to directly seize and liquidate unpaid assets. Gwacheon City in South Korea is set to launch a crypto seizing system next month to target 361 high-income tax evaders! With over 18.8 billion won at stake, officials aim for fair taxation by seizing hidden crypto assets. Will this change the game for tax compliance? … — quAInt (@crypto_quAInt) February 4, 2025 Gwanak’s initiative follows similar actions in other regions, including Gwacheon, showing that even smaller cities are joining the crackdown. If individuals fail to pay their taxes, authorities can freeze their wallets and eventually sell their holdings to recover the owed amounts. Since crypto tax policies are postponed till 2027, the local government has no other option than to seize the assets. What Happens to Seized Crypto? Once the government seizes cryptocurrency, taxpayers are given a chance to settle their debts. If they refuse or fail to respond, the assets are sold on the open market. The recovered funds go toward public finances, helping local governments cover various expenses. Officials believe these measures will somehow discourage tax defaulters and ensure that digital assets are not misused as a way to hide wealth. Crypto Tax Delay Sparks Mixed Reactions In the meanwhile, South Korea’s People’s Power party proposed delaying crypto tax reforms, worrying investors. While some see it as a move to attract investment, others fear it may encourage crime. The crypto market in South Korea is booming, with a 27% YoY growth reaching 55.3 trillion won by June 2024, while daily trading hit 20 trillion won. In contrast, the stock market has struggled, with margin deposits dropping 10 trillion won. The cancellation of a higher tax threshold has also frustrated young investors, adding to concerns about fairness in taxation.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 08:14:17

New high-potential altcoins emerge and gain traction, and certain crypto assets continue their dominance as blockchain adoption grows. Top altcoins like Sui have maintained their momentum as promising high-flyers, while other low-cap but high-potential altcoins like Wormhole, Brett, Beam, and Remittix present distinct offerings and price potential. Remittix (RTX) , meanwhile, is growing into a more fascinating option with practical financial utilities. According to crypto price predictions by experts, these five top altcoins look primed to record significant gains as speculation grows, but which one will rise the highest? Sui Traders Anticipate Massive Upswing Sui has plunged by 22% in nine days, falling to as low as $3.87 after its all-time high of $5.36 earlier in January. The RSI is at its lowest since August 2024, indicating weak buying pressure and persistent bearish momentum. Regardless, Sui’s funding rate remains optimistic, demonstrating traders’ confidence in a price recovery for SUI. Maintaining the $3.69 support level is critical to preventing further declines. If Sui returns to the $4.05 support mark, it could propel toward $5, bouncing back from recent declines and reviving investor optimism. Wormhole Price Prediction in 2025 2025 looks like a breakout year for Wormhole. According to specific expert forecasts, it could trade between $0.246184 and $1.144466, which is a rather massive range, but that’s the possibility crypto holds. The predicted average price is $0.647858, denoting a 352.61% return for investors who buy W early. Should these high-end predictions materialize, Wormhole might pass the $1 mark by the end of the quarter. Brett Looks Set For Massive Leap Brett has maximized Solana’s swift and affordable transactions to inspire massive trading activity, earning it a top spot among high-potential altcoins selected by investors seeking an alternative to Ethereum-based meme coins. With a rising adoption rate, this meme coin proves it has more going for it than speculation. Here’s community power in action. Brett’s distinctive branding and meme culture keep it at the forefront of the Solana meme coin battle. As Solana remains a dominant figure in the crypto market, Brett has established itself as one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Beam (BEAM) Thrives Off Blockchain Gaming Revolution Beam (BEAM) is inspiring a blockchain gaming revolution by combining smart contracts and tokenized assets with traditional gaming systems. By delivering an easy-to-use growth toolkit, Beam is furnishing game developers with tools to produce immersive, blockchain-powered experiences.

Liquidated long positions totaled around $76.4 million, with $55.8 million of that coming out in just one hour. This was the second-largest single-hour liquidation event we’ve seen in the past year, right after a December 9 liquidation that saw around $56 million in long positions taken out. The futures market itself seems just fine; around the time of the liquidation event, open interest still looked quite healthy and was well above the kind of trendline you would expect to see over the course of a year without any major event taking place. And spot Ethereum ETFs? They’re still seeing nice inflows. Yesterday, $76.4M in $ETH long liquidations hit the market, with $55.8M wiped out in a single hour – the second-largest spike in a year, just behind Dec 9’s $56M: https://t.co/6Gj0BlXWMf pic.twitter.com/N0XBrU752T — glassnode (@glassnode) February 4, 2025 Massive Liquidations Shake Ethereum’s Futures Market The crypto market experienced an intense wave of liquidations, but Ethereum’s market saw the most significant knock-on effects. The liquidation of $76.4 million in long positions took place as price fluctuations hit leveraged traders hard. These traders were forced to close over-leveraged positions due to the almost hourly changes in direction that Ethereum’s price was taking. But within this larger context, one hour stood out: over $55 million in Ethereum long positions got liquidated in just this one hour, making this the second biggest hourly liquidation event in the past year. When using leverage, traders are required to maintain minimum margin amounts. If they don’t, their positions are closed—liquidated—from the least favorable side. And when several positions get liquidated at once, we have a cascade. A cascade is a not-an-assault-on-the-resort-kind-of-thing liquid event in which leverage detonates in a falling market, hitting the market harder in the downward direction. Ethereum Futures Open Interest Drops but Stays Above Trendline The futures market for Ethereum was affected directly by the mass liquidation, seeing a sharp downturn in open interest (OI). At the beginning of February, OI for Ethereum futures was at a healthy $20.5 billion. But the liquidations impacted OI heavily. We’re now sitting at $15.9 billion, which translates into roughly a $4.6 billion drop. This is certainly telling us something, and what it is saying is that a lot of speculative positioning has come off the table. Ethereum futures open interest has decreased, but the amount that remains suggests traders are still taking positions in the market. OI has dropped about 15% in the last month, but it stands at about $16.2 billion, which is well above where we would expect the OI to be given the number of pending trades on the Ethereum network. The next section will explore the implications of these OI levels on future market activity for Ethereum prices. Ethereum Spot ETF Sees Positive Net Inflows During the windfalls and adjustments to the futures market, the Ethereum spot ETF was hit by only a slight increase in its total net outflows of $16.88 million for the week, and on February 3 even saw some net inflows of $83.54 million. If you’re keeping score, none of this is actually good for the ETFs themselves, since they’re not supposed to be losing or gaining that much in value en route to an apparent goal of simply tracking the price of Ethereum. The crypto market has seen a significant new development in the form of Ethereum spot ETFs. These exchange-traded funds give traditional investors a chance to invest in Ether, the asset that powers the Ethereum network, in a regulated manner. And even if they haven’t yet been launched, the actual proposals are seen as a positive sign for the overall crypto market. On February 3, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs was US$235 million, the first net outflow after the net inflow in the past 4 days. Fidelity ETF FBTC had a net outflow of US$177 million. Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow of $83.5404 million.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 4, 2025 What’s Next for Ethereum? The most recent market activity for Ethereum showcases the clash between speculation driven by leverage and true investment. The sharpness of the recent liquidation event can’t be overstated—it wiped out billions in futures positioning. Yet, despite this write-down, Ethereum’s open interest suggests that speculative interest remains. Should it continue building without true investment backing, the next liquidation event could be even sharper and hit even harder. Concurrently, the affirmative inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs signal that institutional investors are undaunted by ephemeral price movements. This trend appears to be one that could provide long-term stability to Ethereum’s price, buffering the effects of trading activity that is simply too highly leveraged. In the future, traders need to watch Ethereum’s OI levels closely because a further drop could imply a decrease in speculation—and, as a result, a more stable market. Reduced speculative use of Ethereum would mean its price is more tied to genuine demand and less to the forces unleashed when big traders bet either for or against it. Despite being a work in progress, the confidence that so many have in Ethereum seems to be intact. And that is valuable in and of itself, because the Ethereum Foundation and the many developers who have committed to the Ethereum ecosystem clearly need a certain modicum of confidence to keep carrying on with projects that have the potential to significantly rewire parts of our economy.

39942675,https://nulltx.com/?p=143823,1738746488,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin ETF Inflows Remain Strong in January Despite Slight Dip from December,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-etf-inflows-remain-strong-in-january-despite-slight-dip-from-december/,"The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market sustained a strong investor demand throughout January, net inflows were around 45,100 BTC. This figure comes in only marginally lower than last month’s total, which, along with this month’s total, signals a continued push by institutions and retail investors to place more of their capital into Bitcoin investment products. Accumulation of Bitcoin was led by none other than BlackRock, which secured 26,100 BTC during the period. Coming in a distant second was Fidelity, which added 12,400 BTC. Both turnaround strategies were bolstered by buys from other funds. Grayscale slowed down its outflows significantly. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Remain Steady as Grayscale Outflows Slow Institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs maintained its strong momentum from late 2023 and appeared to reap the benefits of that historic moment in January. Net inflows in the month totaled approximately 45,100 BTC, closely resembling December’s total and underscoring the seemingly insatiable appetite for investment in this space. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, kept its aggressive accumulation strategy intact, adding 26,100 BTC to its Bitcoin ETF holdings. This solidified its position atop the institutional buyer tier. Fidelity, another traditional finance firm, followed with an inflow of 12,400 BTC, underscoring the growing interest in Bitcoin from legacy financial institutions. Even though other funds did not see large inflows, they still added to the overall market strength. Bitwise added about 1,650 BTC, while the Ark/21Shares ETF recorded a net addition of 3,100 BTC. Demand for Bitcoin ETFs appears to be widespread and not restricted to the largest asset managers, with multiple investment firms now in the game. A key shift in market dynamics was the slowing outflows from Grayscale. In earlier months, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) had been under significant sell pressure following its conversion to a spot ETF, with investors very much interested in cashing out their holdings that had been accumulated under the previous fund structure. However, in January, it appeared that most people simply weren’t interested in selling their GBTC shares anymore. This resulted in a more subdued 4,000 BTC outflow from GBTC in January. That outflow number is almost like a very 180-degree change from the type of atmosphere GBTC was in during December. Ethereum ETF Demand Cools as Outflows Rise Despite the strong interest from institutions and other investors, inflows into Ethereum ETFs weakened in January. After seeing some serious accumulation in December, Ethereum ETF inflows slowed significantly. At least, they didn’t keep up with the pace and intensity seen during the previous month. Two of the biggest holders of Ethereum ETFs in the market experienced considerable outflows. Grayscale reduced its holding by 73,200 ETH. Fidelity experienced outflows of 42,400 ETH. These might be sales events where some early investors in Ethereum ETFs took profits and/or repositioned their portfolios. Yet, BlackRock offset these outflows with a robust inflow of 145,400 ETH, keeping the overall net flows in positive territory at +10,500 ETH. The investment giant’s aggressive stance in Ethereum accumulation stands in contrast with demand from other institutional players, which appears to be cooling. Market Implications and Outlook The consistent need for Bitcoin ETFs hints at strong institutional interest in the cryptocurrency, even when its price is uncertain or volatile. In particular, outflows from Grayscale have stopped declining, and this is best interpreted as a sign that the sell pressure from those who really wanted to sell has been absorbed. Stabilization of my price seems pretty likely in the near term. At the same time, the mixed signals from Ethereum ETFs indicate an outlook that is less clear-cut. On the one hand, BlackRock’s substantial accumulation of Ethereum is a bullish indicator. On the other hand, the overall slowdown in ETF inflows and the significant outflows we’re seeing from Grayscale and Fidelity suggest that investor sentiment is not as positive as it was just a few months ago. Inflows and outflows aside, it’s unclear what those developments are meant to signal. Bitcoin ETFs are expected to keep drawing heavy inflows, especially if the macroeconomic backdrop continues to work in digital assets’ favor. The next several months will be pivotal in figuring out whether Ethereum ETFs can reclaim their lost upward trajectory or if their investor appeal has dimmed for good.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-vs-xrp-narrative-is-quietly-being-reversed-heres-why/,"A recent tweet from respected crypto researcher SMQKE has sparked discussions within the cryptocurrency community regarding the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial system. SMQKE’s analysis suggests that the long-standing Bitcoin vs. XRP debate is undergoing a quiet reversal, with institutional and regulatory bodies now favoring cryptocurrencies that integrate within traditional financial frameworks rather than those that operate outside them. The Bitcoin vs. XRP narrative is quietly being reversed. Why? Because Bitcoin “falls outside the system.” Now, the IMF is pressuring countries not to use it as legal tender. Meanwhile, XRP “falls within the system.” So ask yourself—what will the IMF push countries to adopt?… https://t.co/DMbC58gCET pic.twitter.com/I86PzSfESb — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) February 4, 2025 Bitcoin’s Legal Tender Status Under Pressure The tweet highlights recent reports that El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is facing pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reverse its stance. According to Daily Hodl, as shared by unusual_whales on X, El Salvador has reportedly removed Bitcoin’s legal tender status after less than four years due to IMF pressure. Bitcoin’s classification as an asset that “falls outside the system” has been a key factor in its appeal to proponents of decentralization. However, this characteristic has also led to increased scrutiny from global regulatory bodies. The IMF and other financial institutions have consistently expressed concerns over Bitcoin’s potential risks, including its volatility, lack of centralized oversight, and implications for monetary policy. XRP’s Role Within the Financial System In contrast to Bitcoin, XRP has often been positioned as an asset that aligns with the existing financial system rather than opposing it. XRP’s primary use case— facilitating cross-border transactions and improving liquidity within financial institutions—has made it a more attractive option for banks and regulators. SMQKE’s argument suggests that because XRP “falls within the system,” it is more likely to be embraced by policymakers and global financial institutions. This perspective aligns with Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with banks and payment service providers, as well as its engagement with regulatory bodies worldwide. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulators Favoring Integrated Crypto Assets? The implications of this shift are significant. If regulatory bodies continue to discourage the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for legal tender status, while simultaneously fostering the adoption of assets that integrate with existing financial frameworks, the crypto landscape could see a substantial transformation. Alessio Meloni, another X user who commented on the discussion, stated : “The shift is happening right in front of us. Bitcoin was the rebellion. XRP is the integration. Regulators and institutions won’t fight the system—they’ll reshape it with assets that work within it. The question isn’t if—it’s when.” Meloni’s view reflects a broader trend in the financial sector. Rather than outrightly rejecting digital assets, regulators and institutions appear to be selectively endorsing cryptocurrencies that enhance efficiency while maintaining compliance with existing financial structures. Future Implications for Crypto Adoption The debate over Bitcoin’s place in the financial system is far from settled, and while El Salvador’s reported decision may not be the final word on Bitcoin as a legal tender, it does highlight the challenges it faces in gaining institutional acceptance. Meanwhile, XRP’s positioning as a regulatory-compliant digital asset could strengthen its adoption in the years ahead. As institutional engagement with cryptocurrency continues to evolve, the distinction between assets within the system and those outside it may play a critical role in shaping the future of digital finance. Whether this shift accelerates or faces resistance will depend on how regulatory frameworks develop and how financial institutions navigate the changing landscape of digital assets.

The cryptocurrency briefly dropped to $173 before recovering, reflecting heightened market activity. SOL has declined 30% from its all-time high of nearly $280, experiencing volatility. Investors are closely watching whether Solana can sustain its support levels as the broader market undergoes pullbacks, testing the strength of its bullish momentum. Will Solana Price Stay Above $200 Despite Market Downturns? Solana price is testing the crucial $200 support level, which holds significant technical importance. This level aligns with previous value area highs, key highs, and the current value area low, making it a key battleground for traders. Despite broader market volatility, Solana has managed to maintain this level, suggesting strong buyer interest. However, a decisive breakdown below $200 could trigger further downside, potentially testing lower support zones like the yearly open. On the upside, the $222 level remains a key resistance point that traders can closely observe. If Solana manages to reclaim this level, it could signal renewed bullish momentum. Here’s Why SOL Price Will Hold a $200 Support Level. Solana price remains above the $200 mark as VanEck’s recent Solana ETF filing fuels bullish momentum. The move follows successful Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, signaling growing institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. SOL surged past $215, rebounding from recent lows and drawing renewed investor attention. Increased trading volume and bullish derivatives data indicate the potential for further gains. Analysts suggest Solana’s strong ecosystem and increasing adoption could sustain long-term growth despite being 30% below its January all-time high. Additionally, a surge in Solana-based meme coins like MELANIA, BONK, TRUMP, and WIF may contribute to SOL’s upward trajectory. Market conditions remain key, with Bitcoin’s potential rise above $100K acting as a crucial factor. If the broader crypto market rebounds, Solana could extend its rally. Technical indicators show signs of recovery, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Investors closely watch market trends as Solana holds above $200, maintaining optimism for continued price strength. Solana Price Short-term Prediction As of Wednesday, the SOL price is trading at $205, slightly recovering 0.33% within the last 24-hours. The price remains consolidated, fluctuating between key support at $180 and resistance at $220. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 41, slightly below the neutral 50 mark. This indicates weak momentum, with sellers still maintaining some control. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at 0.27, signaling a resurgence of capital inflows into SOL. For a bullish scenario, the Solana price prediction needs to break above the $220 resistance level. A successful move past this zone could open the path toward $250, with an extended target at $300. Conversely, failure to hold above $200 may lead to a retest of the $180 support. Solana Price Chart: TradingView Solana price remains above $200 despite market corrections, showing resilience.

Both bulls and bears remain resilient, which may drop the volatility, leading to a range-bound consolidation for a while. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and the other popular altcoins have been following a similar trend, while these two popular tokens, Solana & Sui, are about to undergo a massive price action. Solana (SOL) Price Feared for a 10% Plunge Solana has been one of the most popular altcoins, which has been overlooked by many market participants. The rise in the volume of the platform had a positive impact on the SOL price , which smashed a new ATH at $295. Since then, the bears have dominated the rally and as a result, the token has reached a crucial juncture. Therefore, the price, which is facing a notable rise in the upward pressure, may drop below the psychological barrier at $200 soon. After the latest drop, the Solana price has plunged and reached the ascending trend line, which has been acting as a strong support since September 2024. Although the bulls have managed to defend the support, the technicals suggest a deeper correction is fast approaching. The RSI is constantly forming lower highs and lows, indicating a rise in bearish dominance. As the price has lost the resistance at the 50-day MA, it may drop and test the pivotal support at the 200-day MA at $182.53 if the bulls fail to defend the support at $$196. Sui (SUI) Price May Rise Back Above $4-But Here’s a Twist Similar to the Solana price rally, the SUI price has also reached lower support along the ascending trend line. While the SOL price is primed for a deeper correction, the SUI price is experiencing a significant rise in the bullish momentum, which may squash the persisting bearish influence over the token. Amid the bullish possibility, the SUI price seems to be primed for a small pullback. The SUI price is fighting to sustain the resistance at $3.57 after a marginal rise above $3.6 with a rise in the bullish momentum. Besides, the MACD suggests a drop in the selling pressure with the levels approaching for a bullish crossover. Besides, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the buying and selling pressure, has just triggered a bullish divergence suggesting a rise in the buying volume. Therefore, the SUI price is expected to marginally drop below $3.5 and further attract significant buying volume and rise to reach the apex, followed by a breakout beyond $4. Solana & Sui both have reached a crucial phase wherein the SOL price is primed for a small setback while the SUI price may continue to grow.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|SUI|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 09:28:03

The power plant could scale up to 1 GW of power. In a press release , the Singapore -based Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining firm announced it has successfully completed an acquisition deal for a 101 MW site and gas-fired power project located near Fox Creek, Alberta, Canada worth $21.7 million. According to Bitdeer, the site is fully licensed and already includes the permits required to construct an on-site natural gas power plant. In addition, Bitdeer also received approval to build a 99 megawatt interconnection grid with Alberta Electric System Operator worth around $30 million or $300,000 per MW. The 99 MW grid of datacenter capacity will be used to mine more Bitcoin. The site comes with a projected energy production cost of around $20 to $25 per MWh, according to current gas prices. In partnership with Engineering, Procurement and Construction or EPC Company, Bitdeer plans to develop and build a power plant that will be ready and energized by the fourth quarter of 2026. In addition, Bitdeer will be allowed to deploy 9 EH/s of its SEALMINER A3 mining machines once development on the site is complete.

Chief Strategy Officer at Bitdeer, Haris Basit, stated the deal marks Bitdeer’s first site acquisition in Canada. The company has previously acquired mining sites in the U.S., Bhutan and Norway. “It marks a significant step in our strategy to become the first fully-vertically integrated Bitcoin miner, giving us unmatched control over costs, energy efficiency, and scalability,” said Basit in a statement. As part of the deal, Bitdeer will deploy a carbon utilization system that captures CO2 on the site, making it a net zero carbon producer project. This is meant to offset Canada’s carbon tax and potentially generate revenue through carbon credits. Premier of Alberta, Danielle Smith, welcomes the Bitcoin mining project and encourages other firms to come to Alberta if they want to “do business and have a plan to bring your own power.” “Today’s investment is another sign that Alberta continues to be a leader in technology and innovation not only across the country, but across the world,” said Smith. According to H.C. Wainwright analysts, Bitcoin miners experienced significant growth in the last quarter of 2024 after Bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time. The rise of Bitcoin prices subsequently raised mining activity as BTC production went up by 16.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis while transaction fees surged by 59.4%.

The incident began when the network's consensus process appeared to function, but validations were not being published, causing the network's ledgers to “drift apart.” In the XRP Ledger, consensus among validators is crucial for updating the ledger with new transactions. If validators cannot agree on which transactions to include in the next ledger version, the network can't move forward. A “drift” in this context means that while the consensus protocol was technically running, validations (or confirmations of transaction sets) weren't being published. At least one validator operator manually intervened to reset the network's consensus to a previously validated ledger state, although the network seemed to have rectified the problem independently, Ripple CTO David Schwarz said in a X post after the incident. “It's likely that servers refused to send validations precisely because they knew something was wrong,” Schwarz said. “And wanted to make sure no server accepted a ledger as fully validated when they couldn't be sure the network would retain and eventually agree on that ledger. “One possible failure mode for XRPL is if all the validators think something's wrong with the network, all refuse to send any validations, and then there's no chatter to let the network reconverge. This is the 'silent network' failure,” Schwarz added.

""A Rare Situation!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-report-from-jpmorgan-a-rare-situation/,"January was a month of ups and downs for Bitcoin. At this point, BTC broke a new record by exceeding $ 108,000 in January, but on the contrary, it fell to the level of $ 89,000, last seen in November 2024. While BTC paints a mixed picture, the Bitcoin network hash rate, which represents the competition and difficulty in the mining sector, increased in January. JPMorgan analysts, discussing the change in Bitcoin hashrate, stated that January was a quiet month in terms of hashrate growth. JPMorgan analysts said the Bitcoin network hash rate increased slightly in January, Coindesk reported. At this point, analysts stated that the monthly average hash rate increased by 1% to 785 exahashes per second (EH/s), while mining difficulty decreased by 2% on a monthly basis. Analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce said: “A drop in Bitcoin mining difficulty is relatively rare. “Although there was a decrease in network difficulty in January, the current network difficulty is 25% higher than before the halving event last April.” The bank recently reported that mining profitability also increased slightly in January, with miners earning an average of $57,200 per EH/s in daily block rewards.

Within three hours on February 3, 2025, XRP experienced a rapid decline from $2.57 to $1.76, a staggering 31% decrease. Nevertheless, the rapid recovery above $2 that occurred shortly after the decline was a cause for concern.

He noted that the price drop followed an odd trend whereby liquidity seemed to disappear during the last leg of the collapse. He thinks it is possible that market players purposefully delayed buy-side liquidity, allowing the price to collapse and then tactically running purchase orders at reduced levels to profit on the comeback. “I don’t want to resort to conspiracy but if you think that move was “natural”, think again. It simply looks to me like a cohort effort to crash altcoins WHILE filling their own bids,” Dom said on X. Furthermore notable was the fact that the drop in XRP did not seem to be isolated. Another market guru, Vincent Van Code, noted over the same period that Bitcoin, HBAR, and several other cryptocurrencies had quite comparable price swings. This spurred questions about coordinated market behavior or automated trading. The Mysteries Are Further Complicated By Synchronized Market Movements Unless there are outside factors actively impacting price behavior, there is a statistically little chance that several cryptocurrencies would see the same sharp collapse and recovery in the same time periods. Although algorithmic trading sometimes creates correlation across assets, experts argue that the accuracy of these movements suggests a deeper degree of coordination. Dom emphasized that although panic selling and abrupt liquidations may be factors in these declines, the event’s structure and pace make it unlikely that natural market forces were the only factor. It is possible, Dom said, that market makers are manipulating XRP to accumulate it at discounted prices, if they do indeed remove liquidity to facilitate a price decline. “Whether that was the low or not, these players are UP BIG!,” the analyst said. Related Reading: Trump Meme Coin Faces Criticism, But Cathie Wood Sees A Bold Future What This Means For XRP Investors This incident reminds XRP holders of the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Whales or institutional players may be abusing their power when there are abrupt price drops and recoveries. Investors should employ prudence when dealing with unpredictable markets and consider using tools like stop-loss orders to lower their risks. XRP has subsequently returned beyond $2, but the question of whether this was a planned move or a normal market correction is still up for debate.

While uncertainty lingers over a potential Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, Garlinghouse sees the legislative push for crypto clarity as a breakthrough moment for the US. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Lauds Legislative Support For Crypto Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse dismissed criticism of the recent policy discussions from US crypto czar David Sacks, emphasizing their long-term significance. He pointed out that the involvement of major financial committee leaders marks a pivotal shift in Washington’s stance on crypto regulation. In a recent X post, the Ripple CEO stated: “Any criticism of today’s press conference is absolutely missing the forest for the trees. Having the Chair of Senate Banking, the Chair of House Financial Services, the Chair of Senate Ag, and the Chair of House Ag join the Crypto Czar to commit to passing legislation for crypto clarity is 100% a big deal (and something we haven’t seen before).” Sacks acknowledged Ripple CEO’s support , further fueling speculation about Ripple’s potential role in upcoming regulatory frameworks. Notably, this comes amid recent market rumors suggesting that XRP could be considered for a national reserve list, though no official confirmation has been given. Why David Sacks’ Remark Receives Criticism? David Sacks, head of the US digital assets working group, recently addressed the Senate Banking Committee alongside key lawmakers. Sacks revealed that the administration is evaluating the possibility of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , following President Donald Trump’s directive. While the market initially saw this as a positive step, concerns arose when Sacks mentioned “digital assets” more frequently than Bitcoin itself. This fueled speculation that the US government might be shifting focus from a Bitcoin-centric reserve to a broader digital asset framework. Stablecoin In Focus Sacks also highlighted the role of stablecoins in strengthening the US dollar’s global position. He argued that stablecoins could drive digital dollar adoption and create significant demand for US treasuries, potentially lowering long-term interest rates. This comment might also have caught the Brad Garlinghouse’s attention. Notably, Sacks’ remarks align with Senator Bill Hagerty’s recent introduction of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act . Brad Garlinghouse Remains Bullish On US Crypto Advancements The comment from the Ripple CEO has given some relief to the investors. It appears that Brad Garlinghouse is looking at the broader crypto regulatory trend and clarity in the US rather than focusing on a specific area. With growing momentum in legislative discussions, the US crypto market is entering a crucial phase. While the feasibility of a Bitcoin reserve remains uncertain , broader regulatory clarity is gaining bipartisan support. As lawmakers refine stablecoin policies and digital asset frameworks, industry leaders like the Ripple CEO see this as a defining moment for crypto’s future in the US.

39943467,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=381875,1738748197,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/39943467.jpeg,Massive Shiba Inu (SHIB) Announcement,https://cryptopotato.com/massive-shiba-inu-shib-announcement/,"TL;DR SHIB’s price surged by 8% on a 24-hour scale as the meme coin partnered with the UAE’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure. Shibarium blasted through another major milestone, which could also be interpreted as a bullish element. The Main Factor The cryptocurrency market experienced severe turbulence in the past few days, largely caused by Donald Trump’s trade war with China, Mexico, and Canada. In the last 24 hours, most leading digital assets consolidated or charted minor losses, but this was not the case with Shiba Inu (SHIB). The price of the popular meme coin increased by 8% during that timeframe, currently trading at around $0.0000164 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its market capitalization jumped above $9.5 billion, and thus, SHIB re-entered crypto’s top 20 club . SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most apparent reason fueling the rally is Shiba Inu’s partnership with the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure of the United Arab Emirates. The team behind the meme coin explained that the collaboration aims to transform how nations embrace Web3. “For the first time, a world government is integrating blockchain at a federal level. This isn’t just another crypto partnership – it’s a nationwide movement unifying Shiba Inu’s Operating System across all Emirates,” the disclosure reads. Speaking on the matter was H.E. Eng Sharif Al Olama, Undersecretary for Energy and Petroleum Affairs at MoEI. He said the deal “represents a pivotal moment in our journey toward redefining government services.” “By embracing emerging technologies, we aim to set a global benchmark for innovation, delivering transformative solutions that benefit both our citizens and the wider community. Together, we are shaping a future built on sustainability, connectivity, and digital excellence,” he added. Additional Reasons Other elements that may have boosted SHIB’s price are Shibarium’s advancement and Shiba Inu’s burn rate. The layer-2 blockchain solution recently hit another major milestone as total transactions processed on the network surpassed 900 million. Shibarium is specifically designed to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and according to some industry participants, its progress could be viewed as a bullish factor. For its part, SHIB’s burn rate exploded by almost 600% in the last 24 hours, resulting in nearly 18.7 million tokens sent to a null address. Continuous efforts in that field will reduce the meme coin’s circulating supply and potentially create upward pressure on the price (should demand remain constant or head north).

Tokens left after the presale will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment. This approach aims to enhance investor value and ensure long-term sustainability. Token burn transactions are recorded on Binance Smart Chain. The Arctic Pablo Coin implements a strategic token burn mechanism to create scarcity and increase value. During the presale, unsold tokens are permanently burned on a weekly basis, reducing the overall supply. Once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment that benefits holders by enhancing scarcity. This burn strategy ensures that only a limited number of $APC tokens remain in circulation, creating potential for greater demand. Transactions related to token burns are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain , ensuring that the process is traceable and secure. This approach not only increases the scarcity of $APC but also promotes long-term sustainability and investor confidence, ultimately driving the value of the token upward.

Trump’s crypto czar, David Sacks, made it clear that his goal is to secure America’s dominance in digital assets. Speaking at a press conference, he outlined a strong pro-crypto agenda alongside key congressional leaders. As discussed in a recent Altcoin Daily analysis , this move could mark a major turning point for the industry, bringing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. The revelations came at a time when crypto is facing both inside and outside tariff war pressure dropping the major crypto assets including Bitcoin dropping to $97K from a high of $100K. The Trump’s administration’s positive Bitcoin push at this moment may give some relief to the investors. A National Bitcoin Reserve? According to Sacks, one of the major element of Trump’s 100-day plan is the potential creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. This initiative seeks to position the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets while leveraging Bitcoin as a strategic hedge against inflation. Analysts like Max Raskin, an adjunct professor at NYU, suggest that such a reserve could provide the country with financial stability outside traditional Federal Reserve policies. However, skeptics worry about the economic risks of integrating Bitcoin into national reserves too quickly. Crypto-Friendly Regulations on the Horizon Moving on, regulatory clarity is another key focus of the plan. Trump’s administration is looking to establish a Digital Asset Task Force, with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce expected to play a leading role. This task force aims to create a framework for cryptocurrency regulations, addressing concerns about innovation flight and market instability. David Sacks, as an advisor to Trump’s crypto policy, chimed into the importance of clear guidelines to prevent U.S. crypto companies from moving offshore. Stablecoins to become prime focus Making Stablecoins a stable asset in US regulators are taking every step carefully. Just hours before David Sacks press conference, Senator Bill Hagerty introduced a bill for regulating stablecoins, aiming to balance state and federal oversight. This bill shows that Trump is confident on bringing crypto innovation in the U.S., with federal agencies like the Federal Reserve involved. Moreover, David Sacks, highlighted that digital transformation is necessary in finance, and the U.S. wants to lead in this space, not let other countries take the lead. Supporters argue that stablecoin regulation could drive mass adoption and make digital payments more efficient, while critics remain cautious about potential systemic risks. Crypto Reaction Responding to the press conference, Bill Morgan expressed frustration on X, saying that the market is tired of hearing David Sacks say “we are working on it” and needs to hear concrete action, like “we have done it,” especially after 10 years of waiting. Can only hope there are no more press conferences of David Sacks that has the message ‘we are working on it’. The market is not impressed. After 10 years we need to hear “we have done it” like yesterday. pic.twitter.com/zugX3WlIzb — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) February 4, 2025 Another X user noted that, even Bitcoin Reserve plan is not confirmed in political tone.

According to data from the country’s Bitcoin Office, 12 BTC was added to its stash on Feb. 4 across two separate buys. First, it acquired 11 BTC for around $1.1 million at an average price of $101,816 per BTC and subsequently bought 1 BTC for $99,114 just hours later. With these latest buys, El Salvador’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 6,068 BTC, valued at over $592 million when writing. The country has been consistently stacking sats and has added 60 BTC over the past month alone. El Salvador accumulated BTC as it struggled to climb back above $100,000, following market jitters from President Trump’s recent tariff shock. Bitcoin dropped to a low of $98,361 on Feb. 4, according to CoinGecko data. Previously, El Salvador scooped up 11 BTC on Jan. 9 and repeated the move on Jan. 20. You might also like: El Salvador ends mandatory Bitcoin acceptance for merchants El Salvador initially began accumulating BTC under its “1 Bitcoin a day” program that was introduced in 2022 after President Nayib Bukele made history by officially recognizing the bellwether crypto as a legal tender. However, it has deviated from this pattern and adopted a more aggressive accumulation strategy, scooping up larger chunks of Bitcoin at a faster pace. Stacy Herbert first mentioned this new approach on December 19, a little over a week after the country negotiated a $1.4 billion loan with the International Monetary Fund. The deal came with conditions to scale back some of its Bitcoin-related policies. El Salvador has already made Bitcoin acceptance optional and has agreed to wind down the state-backed Chivo wallet as part of the agreement. Elsewhere, other nations are taking cues from El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy, with some exploring the idea of building their own reserves. The United States is the most prominent among them, while countries like Brazil , the Czech Republic , and Poland , among others, have also considered it.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) is still above $100,000, but signs of a slowdown are showing, and analysts warn it might be too early for long positions. Despite Bitcoin’s recent jump past $102,000 after dipping to $91,229 on Feb. 3, the Relative Strength Index has been consolidating. “Bitcoin has historically presented strong buying opportunities only when the RSI dropped to around 40%,” analysts at blockchain firm Matrixport wrote in a Feb. 5 research note . As of press time, the RSI sits at 48%. The mark still too high to trigger the usual market patterns for optimal entry points, the analysts warn.

While investors closely watch ETH’s price movements, Skyren DAO is making headlines with its upcoming airdrop platform, designed to reward early adopters and bring more users into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Ethereum’s Wild Price Swing: What Happened? Ethereum recently fell below the critical $3,000 threshold, triggering widespread panic among investors. Key support levels at $2,800 and $2,650 were broken, accelerating the sell-off and pushing ETH down to as low as $2,127. However, a sudden rebound saw Ethereum climb back above $2,400, showing resilience despite broader market volatility. Source: TradingView Several technical indicators remain bearish, with ETH trading below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipped to 28, signaling oversold conditions, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) continued to show bearish momentum. Despite these signals, ETH’s recovery suggests that market confidence is gradually returning. Skyren DAO’s Revolutionary Airdrop Platform While Ethereum’s price fluctuations dominate headlines, Skyren DAO is making waves with its soon-to-launch airdrop platform. Designed to simplify entry into the crypto world, the platform aims to distribute SKYRN tokens to active community members, providing an accessible way for new investors to participate in DeFi.

The Bigger Picture: DeFi’s Role in Crypto’s Recovery The crypto market remains volatile, with external factors like inflation, regulations, and macroeconomic trends influencing prices.

As reports mention, the maturation of $9.2 trillion of government debt, and economic uncertainty is looming, especially for the Bitcoin price. Representing over a quarter of the total $36.2 trillion debt, this unprecedented scenario fuels concerns about rising interest rates, soaring debt servicing costs, and potential market turbulence. Let’s look into this and how it affects the biggest cryptocurrency in the market. $9.2T of US Debt Matures in 2025, Bitcoin Price At Risk? This year, around $9.2 trillion will mature, representing 25.4% of the total $36.2 trillion debt on the country. This scenario has built in the connection of rising interest rates and deficit spending, resulting in higher debt servicing costs. More importantly, the average interest rate of the US Treasury Department has climbed to the roof at $3.2%, the highest rate in the last 15 years, per the Kobesissi Letter . On this, the Kobesissi Letter comments that the US requires rate cuts more than anything. However, the recent FOMC meeting has put rate cuts on hold. This will lead to massive economic challenges, especially for Bitcoin, as its reaction will likely be more volatile around this massive debt maturation. The historical trends clearly indicate the BTC’s sensitivity to interest rate changes. Not only that, but many other significant macroeconomic events have the same effect. In the current scenario, industry experts anticipate higher internet rates with this maturation or refinancing, which will help the dollar dominate. A stronger dollar outlook would become a risk for volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, and a flux of new volatility may hinder the BTC price trajectory. Bitcoin Price Prediction For 2025 The Bitcoin price prediction depends on various factors, but the most common timelines remain the same. Multiple analysts and tools have presented a bullish outlook for this cryptocurrency. However, the debt redefining could introduce high volatility, especially in the first half of 2025, as 70% of debt will be refinanced between January and July. Bitcoin is already witnessing volatility, trading at $97.9k despite hitting an ATH at $109.1k at the beginning of the year. The debt refinancing could drop it down, where some analysts already fear the BTC price drop to $70K. Regardless, volatility may settle over time. Moreover, historical BTC price movements and projects show bullish outlooks. A crypto analyst, Immortal X, also shared a comparative Bitcoin price analysis, commenting on the same outlook. Immortal analyzed the various trajectories but concluded the bullish outlook at the end, calling it “so different and yet so similar,” before predicting that the BTC price will hit $120K in the short term and $200K in the long term. Bottom Line The US’s rising debt has long been a concern, as reports suggest it adds $1 trillion annually. Although many industry experts have presented Bitcoin as the solution to the debt, progress is on hold. For now, the $9.2 trillion debt maturation could introduce volatility in the Bitcoin price trajectory. Despite that, the $200k target for 2025 stands present, as historical trends, investor demand, and Bitcoin reserve approval may introduce bulls in the market.

Dubbed Gas Station, the innovation addresses a common issue faced by Ethereum users: transactions failing due to insufficient gas fees. Details of the New Update The crypto wallet provider announced the functionality in a February 4 post on X, stating that it will help users avoid transaction failures due to a lack of ETH for gas fees. Such payments are required for processing transactions on the Ethereum network and must traditionally be settled in ETH. This often leaves users stranded if they do not have enough of the cryptocurrency in their wallet, forcing them to purchase it from an exchange before proceeding with their transaction. “Being blocked by insufficient gas will no longer be a problem when swapping, thanks to MetaMask’s new Gas Station feature,” the company stated in an accompanying blog post. The new functionality eliminates this issue by allowing clients to utilize select tokens to pay gas fees when using MetaMask Swap. Supported cryptocurrencies include USDT, USDC, DAI, ETH, wETH, wBTC, wstETH, and wSOL. Additionally, the new system ensures that network charges are already factored into the quoted price, providing a smoother experience. The update is currently available on the MetaMask extension for the Ethereum mainnet, with a mobile release expected soon. It also maintains the wallet provider’s existing functionality of sourcing the best exchange rates from multiple liquidity providers, ensuring users receive competitive pricing. Ethereum’s Gas Limit Increase The introduction of the Gas Station feature comes at a pivotal moment for the Ethereum network, which is also undergoing an update of its own. Validators recently approved an increase in the blockchain’s gas limit, raising it from 30 million to a planned maximum of 36 million units. According to on-chain data , the average gas limit has already reached 35.6 million units as of February 5. This marks the first adjustment since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) and the most notable change since 2021 when the network doubled the limit from 15 million to 30 million. The increase is designed to enhance scalability, ease congestion, and support the growing demands of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Gas limits determine how much computational work can be handled in each block, directly impacting the number of transactions that can be processed. When demand exceeds capacity, fees rise as users compete for space. By expanding the cap, Ethereum aims to improve efficiency, allowing more transactions to be processed per block and reducing overall congestion.

Network usage declines of this magnitude have historically come during Bitcoin's euphoric phase at the end of halving cycle rallies. Demand from spot ETFs and public companies like MicroStrategy does not appear to be slowing down. Year to date, Bitcoin has accounted for 82% of digital asset capital flow. I continue to hold the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF due to my belief that BTC will make yet another high before a multi-year pullback. In my previous two articles centered around Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), we've looked at the potential implications of the Trump administration examining a 'digital asset stockpile' rather than the widely expected 'strategic Bitcoin reserve.' Another recent angle has been possible signals that traders can derive from things like on-chain data and seasonality history. In this update, we'll explore some of the network usage data from January and how it compares with previous months and years. We'll dive into capital flows through products like spot ETFs and corporate treasuries. Finally, I'll detail why I'm still holding the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) despite apparent weakness in some of Bitcoin's on-chain usage metrics and why I think we're entering the fun phase of this Bitcoin halving cycle. January Usage Data During the month of January, the Bitcoin network produced $20.4 million in fees. This was down 48% month over month from $39.3 million in December and down a staggering 85% from $133.7 million in January 2024. Bitcoin, Monthly Fees (Token Terminal) You can see in the chart above the monthly fee figure with the USD price of BTC. This coin price move from $60k per coin in September 2024 to $100k today is reminiscent of the July 2021 to November 2021 price rally from $30k to nearly $70k in their relationship to fees. During the initial price pops from both the 2020/2021 and 2024/2025 cycles, we've observed network fees move up with price. However, on that second price surge, we've seen increased coin prices come with declining network fees. This divergence is indicative of speculators hoarding BTC rather than using it. Bitcoin DAAs (monthly) (Token Terminal) In the past, I've raised concerns about the daily active user base on Bitcoin shrinking from an active address average of over 700k in September 2023 down to just a little over 400k in June 2024. We've indeed seen a resurgence up to about 500k DAAs on average in January 2025, but we're still well below highs. My personal view on this has consistently been that network usage is required to give miners an incentive to validate transactions. Long term, this will likely become an issue if miners can't run machines profitably. During the price run from $25k to over $60k that started in Q4-23, DAAs declined in-part because the average transaction fee spiked from less than $2 to nearly $20. This fee spike had a clear impact on usage: Bitcoin Users vs Average Fees (Token Terminal) Average transaction fees have since normalized, but usage reflected by monthly DAAs has still remained low relative to pre-halving levels last April. Thus, monthly network fees have plummeted. What's also interesting to consider is the degree to which even non-zero wallet addresses haven't meaningfully grown in the last several months. The long-term trend over the last 15 years has generally been a steady rise in non-zero addresses. However, more recently, we've seen stagnation in address growth that resembles what was observed back in 2021: BTC Non-Zero Address Trend (IntoTheBlock) Non-zero wallet addresses on Bitcoin peaked in June 2024 at 53.4 million addresses. That figure is now down slightly to 53.2 million, and we again see an interesting analog in the 2020/2021 bull cycle, where non-zero wallet addresses peaked 7 months before the coin price peaked. HODLer Balance (IntoTheBlock) During the 2017 bull run, Bitcoin 'HODLer' balance - supply held dormant for a year or longer - started dropping more intensely about 6 months before the coin printed the high price for the cycle. Perhaps noteworthy, the decrease in HODLer balance actually started about 12 months before the price peak. The 2021 price peak came almost exactly 12 months after HODLer balance started to noticeably decline. As of article submission, we're again about 12 months from the high HODLer balance high of 13.8 million last January. Finally, on-chain transactions have fallen off a cliff. There were just 11.5 million transactions during the month of January; the lowest since February 2024 when BTC rallied by roughly 44%. Bitcoin Transaction Memory Pool (Mempool.space) Furthermore, the transaction memory pool has dried up. For a brief period on February 1st, the mempool was almost completely empty. Meaning, there was very little demand for Bitcoin block space. My read on all of this is very simple; we are looking squarely into the supply crunch phase of this cycle. The only question is whether or not the bid will return to push the price skyward again as it has in the past. Which brings us to the major difference between this cycle and previous halving epochs. Capital Flows & FBTC Investment Flows (CoinShares) Despite yearning from many in the crypto market for a proper 'altseason,' Bitcoin has continued to dominate investment capital flows. Through January, nearly $4.9 billion in capital has flowed into Bitcoin investment products this year already. Bitcoin makes up 92% of the total flow into digital assets so far this year as tracked by CoinShares. Bitcoin spot ETF Supply (The Block) There are now over 1.2 million BTC held via US-based spot ETF products alone. 273k of which is held through the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ETF. Even when accounting for the outflow from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), the net flow into US ETFs over the last year has been about a 600k BTC increase held via TradFi custodians. I continue to be a long-term holder of this fund and like it against most of the other spot products in the market. The 0.25% expense ratio, while certainly not the lowest, is undoubtedly competitive with the rest of the market. Judging by the total return of FBTC against the other two spot ETFs in the top 3 by AUM, we see a very tight competition between FBTC and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) with FBTC edging slightly. Data by YCharts While there is no question IBIT dominates the market in terms of both AUM and share of volume, I maintain that FBTC is the best pick the US market has to offer because Fidelity handles custody without a third party. In my view, this shifts risk to Fidelity from a company like Coinbase ( COIN ). But that's a trade-off I'm happy to make in an environment where Coinbase is increasingly relying on institutions for a share of volume. This is middleman avoidance on my part, pure and simple. Corporate Treasuries In addition to spot ETF products, the big bidders on Bitcoin over the last year have been public companies adopting 'Bitcoin Treasury' strategies. The most famous of which is MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). More recently, we've seen MARA Holdings ( MARA ) and Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) begin to follow the strategy of borrowing to buy BTC. Public Company BTC Holdings (BitcoinTreasuries) In just one year, public companies have increased BTC holdings 125% from 275k BTC to nearly 619k BTC. Now, it should be noted that 82% of that public equity-held BTC growth year over year has been due to the aggressive buying from MicroStrategy. This BTC buying has created volatility in MSTR shares and also resulted in a 1.9x premium to the Bitcoin held by the company: MSTR Premium (MSTR-Tracker) While I've advised against paying a large premium over the BTC that backstops MSTR's $88 billion market cap, the fact that the company's common shares still trade at nearly twice the value of the BTC held by the company is perhaps an indication that MicroStrategy is not yet finished issuing preferred shares or convertibles to buy Bitcoin. Thus, I suspect Bitcoin still has another leg up given the MSTR premium, ETF demand, and lack of on-chain selling supply. Closing Summary I've been pretty consistent in my view that Bitcoin will ultimately need to have more reliable usage to have a sustainable long-term security model. Perhaps a problem to be addressed another day. For now, we have to trade the market we have rather than the market we might want. The preponderance of what I'm seeing on-chain is reminiscent of action that we've seen in prior cycles. The signal that I'm getting from this action leads me to believe we're entering the rapid up-phase climax for this halving epoch. Following such a move, I do suspect we'll get a significant multi-year pullback in the coin. We should also consider the possibility that the price highs for BTC have already been made. I'm not currently in that camp, but I could get there if we fail to see a meaningful rally in February. As I detailed in a prior piece , I think February is going to be a strong month for BTC returns. From an on-chain usage standpoint, we're seeing things that we've historically seen right before an explosive blow off the top. I'm of the view that we'll see that happen yet again, given the supply/demand dynamics of Bitcoin. My preferred way to play this rally? The same as it was before BTC hit six-figures .

Analyst Predicts Possible 50% Drop,https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-crash-analyst-predicts-possible-50-drop/,"TL;DR Ethereum’s price struggles below $2,800, with some analysts warning of a potential drop to $1,200 if key support fails. Others, including Michael van de Poppe, remain optimistic, citing Trump-linked investments as a bullish indicator. ETH Bulls to Suffer More Pain? Ethereum (ETH) – the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization – is among the very few leading digital assets that have not charted impressive gains during the bull cycle in the past several months. It currently trades at less than $2,800, representing a 24% decline on a 30-day scale. ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko And while many industry participants believe the asset has yet to catch up with Bitcoin (BTC) and the rest of the market, some are quite pessimistic. The popular X user Nebrascangooner recently claimed that the “potential cup and handle pattern” witnessed on ETH’s price chart is no longer valid. The analyst suggested that the valuation formed a double top in the past year, envisioning a collapse to as low as $1,200 if it loses the $2,400 support. “No breakdown currently, though, and it’s sideways in a large consolidation,” they added. The Bullish Scenario As mentioned above, the majority of analysts on X remain optimistic that ETH will hit a new all-time high in the following months. The one using the X moniker MANDO CT thinks the long-awaited rally of the asset “is about to happen,” setting a target of $10,000 per coin. Michael van de Poppe also chipped in, saying that if Donald Trump “bets massively on ETH, it’s almost foolish not to follow that route at these valuations.” To the uninitiated ones, World Liberty Financial (WLF) – a DeFi project linked to Donald Trump and his family – has recently made significant investments in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Eric Trump, the son of the American president, claimed that now is “a great time to add ETH.” Some key on-chain metrics also signal that the price of the asset might be on the verge of a rally. According to CryptoQuant, ETH’s exchange netflow has been negative in the past three days. This suggests a potential shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, which in turn reduces the immediate selling pressure. The post Ethereum Price Crash?

The country’s Bitcoin Office tracker confirmed that 11 BTC were acquired for just over $1.1 million at an average price of $101,816 per coin, followed by an additional BTC purchase for $99,114. This latest acquisition brings the total Bitcoin holdings of the Central American nation to 6,068 BTC, valued at over $554 million. The purchase follows President Nayib Bukele’s announcement last month of a $1.4 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which required El Salvador to scale back certain Bitcoin-related activities. Legislative Changes in El Salvador Bitcoin Policies In response to the IMF deal, El Salvador made several changes to its Bitcoin policies . One of the key adjustments involved making Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for private businesses, reversing the previous requirement for mandatory acceptance. Additionally, the government agreed to reduce its involvement in the Chivo wallet, a state-sponsored crypto payment platform. Despite these concessions, El Salvador’s Bitcoin buying spree continues unabated. The country has accumulated 21 BTC this week alone and 60 BTC in the last 30 days, according to data shared by the National Bitcoin Office on X. “The first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the world keeps growing, and so El Salvador keeps winning,” the office declared in a February 4 post. Bitcoin Market Movements Bitcoin’s price dipped to a 24-hour low of around $96,000 before rebounding to approximately $98,000. While still down from its intraday high of over $100,700, El Salvador capitalized on the market dip to expand its Bitcoin reserves. The decision to continue buying Bitcoin despite the IMF deal highlights President Bukele’s steadfast belief in the long-term value of digital assets. National Bitcoin Office Director Stacy Herbert stated in a December that El Salvador’s crypto ambitions remain intact, even amid international scrutiny. As one of the most prominent state actors involved in Bitcoin adoption, El Salvador’s approach continues to be a point of interest for global financial markets.

After receiving $13.5 million in funding organised by 1kxnetwork, it made the World’s first AI agent app store, Pearl, live as a desktop application. The funding received was followed up by the launch of $1 million in Grants for Agent developers under the initiative of Olas Accelerator. The $13.5 million funding saw funds coming in from various global Venture Capital funds such as Tioga Capital, Borderless, ARKN Ventures, Generatives Ventures, Metropolis, Keyrock, Smape, Sigil Fund, Zee Prime Capital, Very Early, Perridon Ventures, Spaceship. The core contributor Olas’ fundraisers also included selected angel investors – Leo Mindyuk, Co-founder of ML Tech and Nicolas Gallet, CEO of Gallet Capital, The fundraise is set to be used for accelerating the scaling of Olas’ agent app store – Pearl. It will also be used to enhance the development of decentralized AI agents and their integration in the crypto world – making crypto actions more faster and automated. Types of AI agents offered in Pearl The customizable decentralised AI agents available on Pearl aim to provide users the complete decentralised ownership of their own AI agents, suited to their specific needs. By staking OLAS tokens, the AI agents enable automatic working for specific tasks set out by the developers. The work that can be automated by the AI agents include DeFi trading, analysing data to make informed predictions in prediction markets, say Polygon and Kaishi, or can also be used to manage and automate social media handles. The open source framework of Ola stack is used by the developers for the creation, deployment and management of autonomous AI agents. Currently, the AI agents that can be set up at Olas include: Prediction agents to forecast outcomes and place bets in prediction markets. Modius agents to invest crypto assets on users’ behalf on Mode chain. Agents.fun agent – Celo for creation of AI influencers on Celo chain that can post and perform tasks on X. Optimus agents to streamline the DeFi experience by managing users’ assets on SuperChain. Olas Accelerator: Grants for the development of new AI agents By using Proof-of-Active-Agent (PoAA) – a combination of Proof of Work (PoW) nd Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms – Olas has facilitated over 3 million agent transactions to date, with growth rate of 30%+ MoM. The Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has also backed the AI agents, arguing that such agents would be ‘ubiquitous’ in prediction markets. Moreover, the rewards mechnaism introduced by Olas last year, in the form of OLAS token, for useful agent activity is also incentivising the development of AI agents. David Minarsch, CEO of Olas said, “Pearl’s agent app store represents a significant step forward in democratizing access to AI agents. By giving everyone AI agents they can not only use, but fully own and customize, we’re turning the status quo on its head. At a time when advances in AI can seem increasingly daunting, Olas is uniquely giving control of AI back to the user.” And now, the 10 seats that are available under the Olas Accelerator initiative – to fund 10 teams rewards worth $100K for developing AI agents for Pearl – is set to accelerate the creativity of Agent Developers by coming up of innovation and new agents. In the time when AI seems to be becoming monopolist, centralised and dominating in nature, AI agents offered by the OLAS can possibly make best efforts in giving the ownership and benefits of AI in user’s hands.

With Sui joining the list, users have more choices for managing their crypto holdings. Interestingly, SUI’s price has been on the rise. SUI has recovered to $4.19 as of January 30, 2025 , after dropping to $3.50 on January 27. Moving forward, top analysts forecast further gains for SUI due to its integration into Phantom Wallet. With this, SUI could rise to $5 in a few weeks. On the flip side, some analysts are pessimistic about investing in SUI as it has shown high price volatility over the past week. Hence, SUI could drop to $3 soon, and experts say that if this happens, capital could flow into trending altcoins like $FXG. Cardano’s Plomin Upgrade Goes Live, But ADA Price Struggles Cardano recently has just launched its Plomin hard fork, a big step toward full decentralized governance. With this upgrade, ADA holders can now vote on important changes, including fund spending and future network updates. The Cardano Foundation says this move puts power directly in the hands of the community. This has created pressure on the market. ADA is currently valued at $0.96, a 1% decline from last week, according to the CoinMarketCap data . Despite this subpar price performance, some traders still see ADA as one of the trending altcoins to buy due to its high use case. Also, the upcoming upgrade could catalyze a surge. So, experts believe that ADA could surge to $1.50 in a few weeks. On the other hand, some analysts are skeptical about investing in Cardano because of the recent bearish momentum in the crypto market. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Why is FXG Making Waves in DeFi And Gaining Market Share Ahead of Other Trending Altcoins? FXGuys has a strong system that keeps its coin, $FXG, stable. The project’s staking method helps hold its value steady. Right now, the presale has already pulled in $3.7 million. This is an early chance to get in before the token price goes up in later stages. At Stage 2 of its public presale, $FXG costs just $0.04. When it officially launches, the price is expected to hit $0.10. Many believe this could be the next big thing in the DeFi world. Some experts predict its value could surge by 100x after launch because of the way the project is structured. Sui and Cardano have been popular in the market for a while, but FXGuys is catching attention fast. With Trump’s return shaking up the scene, FXGuys is set to rise with the excitement surrounding DeFi. Right now, you can still buy $FXG at the lower presale price. As demand increases, so will the token value. Many are jumping in early, hoping to see big gains later. Getting in during presale could be a smart move. The chance to buy before the official launch may bring good profits for those who act fast.

39947465,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=668850,1738755056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39947465.jpeg,US Treasury eases anxiety over Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E as USAID staff get fired,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-treasury-eases-anxiety-over-elon-musks-d-o-g-e-as-usaid-staff-get-fired/,"The US Treasury has tried to shut down panic over Elon Musk’s new role in managing federal payments. Despite the eccentric billionaire’s claims of blocking what he called “illegal payments,” Jonathan Blum, a principal deputy assistant secretary, reassured Congress on Tuesday that no remittances had been canceled. “The ongoing review of Treasury’s systems is not resulting in the suspension or rejection of any payment instructions submitted by other federal agencies,” Blum reportedly explained in a letter to the lawmakers. The Treasury confirmed that Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency—better known as D.O.G.E—only had limited “read-only” access to the payment infrastructure. This system handles trillions of dollars in annual disbursements, including essential payments like Social Security. But the announcement came after Elon, the world’s richest man and ‘First Buddy’ of President Donald Trump, declared over the weekend that his team was shutting down government grants he claimed were fraudulent. Elon’s comments on X, his social media platform, referenced a list of grants to Lutheran organizations. Elon shakes up Washington, Senators demand answers Things got worse yesterday after Elon publicly justified D.O.G.E’s involvement, alleging that payment officers had been instructed to approve transactions even for “known fraudulent or terrorist groups.” This made Senator Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, demand an explanation from newly-elected Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. “I can think of no good reason why political operators who have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law would need access to these sensitive, mission-critical systems,” Wyden said. In his response, Blum claimed that Tom Krause, the CEO of Cloud Software Group and one of Elon’s appointees, had been granted special government employee status. Krause is now leading a review of federal payments in collaboration with career Treasury officials. Blum assured Congress that “all operational processes continue to be conducted only by career Treasury staff in accordance with all standard security, safety, and privacy standards.” Despite these reassurances, Wyden dismissed the response, accusing Trump’s Treasury of trying to “downplay the risks as Elon Musk seizes power.” He went further, claiming, “Nothing they’re saying is believable or trustworthy.” Former Treasury official Don Hammond also weighed in, expressing concern over Elon’s involvement. “A non-federal employee would have no accountability for the actions they take when in charge of the payments system,” Hammond warned. He added that improper access could jeopardize both the integrity of government payments and sensitive data. USAID thrown into chaos as mass layoffs hit While the Treasury scrambles to justify Elon’s presence, another crisis is brewing at the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Most of the agency’s staff will be placed on leave starting Friday, and overseas employees have been given 30 days to return to the US. The decision, which was communicated to employees through an internal email and a notice on USAID’s website, is Elon’s aggressive plan to cut foreign aid spending. President Trump and Elon are saying that USAID has been a major source of unnecessary federal expenditures. Marco Rubio, now serving as acting USAID administrator, confirmed to Congress that he is exploring a plan to merge parts of the agency into the State Department. Rubio, who is also Secretary of State, described the decision as key to improving government efficiency. According to the agency’s official statement, “all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership, and specially designated programs.” Staff were told they would receive notifications by Thursday about whether they are considered important. The agency also said that exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for employees dealing with family issues or safety concerns. USAID employs around 10,000 people worldwide, with two-thirds of its workforce stationed in more than 60 countries. The agency’s projects, which include humanitarian aid and development programs, are now in jeopardy. The freeze has left staff scrambling to understand what this means for their futures. “This is going to destroy USAID’s capacity to operate,” said a former senior official at the agency. The official explained that while the president cannot legally abolish USAID without congressional approval, the administration has effectively found a way to render it powerless. “Congress still has to act if you really want to kill USAID, but until that happens, this is the end. The nail in the coffin is being hammered in.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-05 11:30:56

Why Solana & XRP Are Set for a Legendary Comeback!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/50x-growth-in-sight-why-solana-xrp-are-set-for-a-legendary-comeback/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the standard for cryptocurrency investments, while Ripple (XRP) dominates cross-border payments. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning. Act Now Before It’s Too Late Analysts are calling THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN one of the most promising tokens for 2025, with unparalleled growth potential.

The company has successfully registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), clearing a significant regulatory hurdle after past compliance issues. Bybit Secures FIU Registration On February 5, Bybit announced that it had officially registered with India’s FIU, a critical requirement for any financial entity operating in the region. Vikas Gupta, Bybit’s country manager for India, expressed confidence in the process, stating that the exchange expects to secure its full operational license in the coming weeks. This comes after the exchange faced regulatory trouble, leading to a temporary halt of its services in India last month. As part of the registration process, Bybit has to pay a fine of $1.06 million for previous violations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2005. With this settlement, the company has effectively resolved all outstanding compliance issues, paving the way for a smoother regulatory path ahead. The exchange even ensured its commitment to working closely with Indian authorities, guaranteeing full compliance with the country’s financial laws. Pursuing a VDASP License Beyond its FIU registration, Bybit is aiming for a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDASP) license, which would allow it to fully operate in India’s crypto market. The exchange submitted its application for VDASP registration on June 26, 2024, and is now awaiting approval. This update comes shortly after Bybit suspended its services in India due to evolving regulatory concerns. However, the latest progress suggests the company is actively working toward a full comeback. India’s Strong Stance on Crypto Bybit isn’t the only crypto exchange that faced strict action from Indian authorities. Binance, KuCoin, and OKX have also encountered challenges, with tougher rules on registration and compliance. However, both Binance and KuCoin have agreed to follow India’s PMLA rules and resumed operations in the country after securing regulatory approval . These changes show that India is taking a stronger stance on regulating the crypto industry, setting clear guidelines, and penalizing those who don’t follow them.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 11:34:30

This demonstration underscores XRPL’s multi-currency capabilities and interoperability, proving that Bitcoin can be transacted seamlessly without the delays associated with its native blockchain . Chris Larsen sends Bitcoin instantly over the XRPL. pic.twitter.com/qkAWdBweKz — XRPDAILY (@XRPXLMVERSE) February 4, 2025 Bitcoin Transactions on the XRP Ledger Bitcoin transactions traditionally rely on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which requires miners to validate transactions—a process that can take up to 10 minutes for a single confirmation. However, Larsen’s demonstration proved that Bitcoin can be sent instantly using XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX) and pathfinding feature. During the demonstration, Larsen accessed his Ripple wallet, which held Bitcoin balances. Unlike traditional wallets that send BTC over the Bitcoin network, Ripple wallets utilize the XRP Ledger’s advanced interoperability features, allowing users to send multiple currencies—including BTC—efficiently. How the Instant BTC Transfer Works on XRPL Selecting Bitcoin for Transfer: Larsen initiated the transaction by choosing Bitcoin from his Ripple wallet. Pathfinding and Transaction Routing: The XRPL system automatically calculates the best available path for the transaction. The XRP Ledger boasts a distinctive feature that facilitates effortless conversion and transfer of various assets, ensuring a seamless user experience. Consensus Mechanism for Instant Settlement: Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining process, the XRPL utilizes a Federated Consensus Model to validate transactions and enable instant settlement. This means that transactions do not require energy-intensive mining but are validated by a trusted network of nodes. Once consensus was reached, the Bitcoin transfer was instantly confirmed—bypassing the usual 10-minute delay of the Bitcoin network. Finalization of the Bitcoin Transfer : The Bitcoin transaction was completed off the Bitcoin network, leveraging XRPL’s interoperability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why This Demonstration Is Significant Larsen’s demonstration highlights XRPL’s position as a leading blockchain for cross-currency transactions and interoperability. The key benefits of using XRPL for Bitcoin transfers include: Instant Settlement: Bitcoin transactions on XRPL are executed in seconds rather than minutes. Lower Transaction Costs: XRPL’s efficient consensus model minimizes fees compared to Bitcoin’s mining fees. Multi-Currency Support: Using a single wallet, Users can hold and transfer multiple assets, including BTC, USD, and stablecoins. Decentralized Exchange (DEX): XRPL’s built-in DEX allows users to trade and transfer assets without relying on third-party intermediaries. The Future of Cross-Chain Transactions Chris Larsen’s demonstration is a significant step toward a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem. The evolution of blockchain technology will rely on solutions like XRPL’s multi-currency interoperability, which facilitates smooth and efficient transactions between diverse networks This innovation will allow Bitcoin users to enjoy faster, more cost-effective transactions without being limited by the constraints of the Bitcoin network. The ability to send Bitcoin instantly over XRPL reinforces Ripple’s vision of a highly efficient, scalable, and interoperable financial ecosystem, further strengthening XRPL’s role in global finance.

Over the last month, the decline was even steeper at 79.90%. Despite these recent downturns, the coin is up by 77.89% over the past six months, showing long-term growth. Currently, AI16Z trades between $0.27 and $0.67. This is below both its 10-day simple moving average of $0.39 and its 100-day average of $0.47. The Relative Strength Index stands at 51.85, indicating a neutral market stance. The stochastic value is 30.34, suggesting the coin is approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0027, pointing to a possible bearish trend. Looking ahead, if the price continues to fall, it may reach the nearest support level at $0.12, which would be a significant drop from current levels. Conversely, if momentum shifts, the coin could rise toward the nearest resistance level at $0.93, marking a potential increase of over 200%. Traders are closely watching these key levels to gauge where AI16Z might head next. OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) has experienced notable price movements recently. Over the past week, the coin’s price dropped by 36.65%, settling within a range of $16.22 to $28.10. Despite this short-term decline, TRUMP has surged by 365.58% over the past month and six months, indicating substantial growth in the longer term. The coin’s technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45.88, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The Simple Moving Average (SMA) over 10 days is $17.33, which is below the 100-day SMA of $20.90. This could point to a potential downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.4824, and the stochastic value is 31.98, both hinting at possible bearish momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $35.20, with a second resistance at $47.08. If TRUMP’s price moves upward and breaks these levels, it could signal further gains. On the downside, the nearest support level is $11.44. A drop below this could lead to additional declines. Based on the recent data, TRUMP may face volatility, but the significant growth over the past month suggests potential for future increases. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has seen significant volatility recently. Over the past week, its price has dropped by over 40%. In the past month, it has fallen nearly 69%. However, looking at the bigger picture, the token has surged approximately 154% over the last six months. Currently, PENGU is trading between $0.0083 and $0.02139. The nearest resistance level is at $0.02972, while the closest support level is at $0.003701. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.01242, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.01365. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 51.27, indicating neutral momentum. The stochastic oscillator is at 34.89, suggesting the token is neither overbought nor oversold. Based on these figures, PENGU’s price could move in either direction. If it rebounds towards the nearest resistance level, it could see gains of around 39% from its current upper range. Alternatively, if it dips to the support level, it could experience a decrease of about 56%. Traders are watching these levels to gauge potential shifts in the market. Turbo (TURBO) Turbo (TURBO) is currently trading between $0.00315 and $0.00567. Over the past week, its price has dropped by 22.84%. In the past month, it has fallen by 59%. However, over the last six months, it has gained 11.29%. The coin is hovering near its support level at $0.00221. The nearest resistance is at $0.00725. If it breaks above this, the next target is $0.00977. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.00404, while the 100-day average is $0.00471. This suggests short-term bearishness but longer-term stability. Technical indicators are mixed. The RSI is at 54.27, indicating a neutral market. The Stochastic is at 52.18, also neutral. MACD is slightly negative at -0.00000028166, suggesting minimal downward momentum. Based on this data, Turbo’s price could stabilize or rise towards the resistance levels, potentially increasing by over 100% if it reaches the second resistance. Conclusion While AI16Z, TRUMP, PENGU, and TURBO show rebound potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) excels by uniting sports fans in a pioneering memecoin aiming for massive growth.

The price chart indicates a fluctuating uptrend, suggesting potential gains. With DOGE maintaining support above $0.26, historical whale activity hints at a possible 3X surge. If accumulation trends persist, Dogecoin could see a notable price increase soon. Dogecoin Price Could Triple as DOGE Whale History Repeats The Dogecoin recent market activity suggests a potential price rally, fueled by a surge in whale transactions. Historical data reveals that on December 20, 2024, DOGE suffered a steep 45% decline over 12 days. However, a sudden increase in whale transaction counts above the 200-day moving average signaled strong accumulation, leading to a 52% price recovery within 15 days. A similar trend is unfolding now, as Dogecoin experiences a 53% crash over 16 days while whale transactions spike above the 200DMA. Market analysts point to the triple confluence of a sharp price drop, rising whale transaction volumes, and a key technical breakout above the 200-day moving average as indicators of a potential bullish reversal. Past patterns indicate that when whales increase buying activity after a steep correction, the DOGE price tends to surge significantly in the following weeks. This aligns with this scenario, raising expectations that the top meme coin may soon see another rapid price appreciation. Will DOGE Repeat Its Bullish Fractal Pattern? Crypto analysts have drawn attention to a potential fractal pattern in Dogecoin price action. The analyst shared a chart comparing DOGE’s past rallies with its current structure, suggesting that history could repeat itself. The analyst highlights Dogecoin’s bounce off the 200-day SMA, a key level that triggered a major price surge. In early 2024, DOGE followed a similar pattern, consolidating before a sharp breakout. If this fractal holds, the price could aim for the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, targeting approximately $0.706. Currently, DOGE is trading around $0.26 after dipping from the $0.48 range. Traders are closely watching whether the 200-day SMA will act as strong support again, potentially fueling another bullish run toward the projected target. Dogecoin Price Analysis DOGE Price traded at $0.267 on Wednesday, February 5th, slightly recovering after its recent decline. The meme coin had fallen below key resistance levels but found support around $0.25 before rebounding. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator stands at 0.10, suggesting modest buying pressure. A continued rise could indicate stronger accumulation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 41 remains below the neutral 50 mark, indicating weak bullish momentum. Key Support and Resistance Levels To Watch The $0.30 Resistance level remains a critical barrier for bulls. A breakout above this could lead to a rally toward $0.35. Conversely, a failure to maintain momentum may push the Dogecoin price forecast lower, testing the $0.25 support level again. Dogecoin price Chart: TradingView Dogecoin whale activity suggests a potential 3X surge if historical trends hold. A breakout above $0.30 could confirm bullish momentum, driving prices higher. However, failure to sustain key support may trigger another correction.

As the market surges, investors are eager for fresh opportunities. Insights from Bitwise’s CIO suggest a growing interest in products linked to popular meme coins. This has sparked chatter on which coins might be in the spotlight. Coins like SHIB, PEPE, BONK, and FLOKI are capturing attention. An emerging project, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., is also gaining traction. Modeled after the successful PEPE coin, Agent A.I. promises significant community-driven growth. Investors are keenly watching to see which projects will tap into the exploding meme coin ETF interest. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Shiba Inu Faces Challenges Amid Price Declines Over the past week, Shiba Inu’s price has dropped by 19.23%. The past month has seen a decline of 36.99%. Despite this, over the last six months, the price has risen by 19.02%. This shows that while recent performance has been weak, there has been some longer-term growth. The current price sits between $0.00001358 and $0.00001856. The Relative Strength Index is at 44.75, which suggests the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. There could be room for movement in either direction. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00002161. If the price moves up to this level, it would represent an increase of around 16%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00001165. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of around 14%. Based on recent trends, the price could continue to fluctuate between these levels. The significant declines over the past week and month indicate some bearish pressure. However, the positive change over six months suggests potential for recovery. Pepe (PEPE) Nears Key Resistance Amid Steady Trading Pepe (PEPE) is currently trading between $0.0000089 and $0.0000136. This range reflects a period of consolidation as traders await the coin’s next move. In recent trading sessions, PEPE’s price has remained relatively stable within this band. This steady performance suggests that the market is balancing supply and demand, setting the stage for potential volatility. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000166. Breaking above this point could signal a strong upward trend. If PEPE reaches this level from its current upper price, it would represent an increase of about 21%. Such a move might attract increased attention and drive further gains. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.0000070. A drop to this level from the current lower price would be a decrease of approximately 21%. Falling below this support could lead to additional declines. Traders are closely monitoring these levels to anticipate PEPE’s next direction BONK: Solana’s Rising Meme Coin with Big Potential Bonk (BONK) has seen a significant price drop recently. In the last week, its value decreased by 31.13%. Over the past month, the price fell by 49.47%. However, over six months, the decline was only 5.63%. Currently, Bonk trades between $0.00001575 and $0.00002501. This suggests it has found a trading range after the declines. The RSI is at 42.32, indicating it is neither overbought nor oversold. The nearest support is at $0.00001229, about 39% below the current price. If the price drops to this level, it could mean further decline. The nearest resistance is at $0.00003081, about 51% above the current price. Breaking this level could lead to significant gains. Given the recent declines, Bonk may be ready for a rebound. If it stays above support, there is potential for recovery. Traders may look for a move towards the resistance level, which could offer gains over 50%. However, a break below support might lead to more declines. FLOKI Coin Shows Potential Ahead of Key Resistance Level FLOKI coin is trading between $0.00008092 and $0.0001329. This range shows significant price movement recently. The coin’s price has fluctuated within this band, indicating active interest from traders. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0001653. To reach this point, FLOKI would need to rise by around 24% from the higher end of its current range. Breaking through this resistance could signal further upward momentum. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.00006124. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of about 24% from the lower end of the current range. Holding above this support is crucial to avoid further declines. Based on the current data, FLOKI has potential to move towards the resistance level. If buying pressure increases, the price might test $0.0001653. Traders are watching to see if the coin can maintain its momentum. Conclusion The recent hints at new meme coin ETFs have the crypto community buzzing. While popular tokens like SHIB, PEPE, BONK, and FLOKI have made waves in the past, they may offer less potential in the short term. Agent A.I. enters the scene as a memecoin with a unique strategy. Through a community-driven presale and plans to develop AI-powered tools, it aims to distinguish itself from other tokens. With the crypto market on an upswing, Agent A.I. stands out as a potential new player to watch.

Geo Chen, a macro trader and author of the popular Substack-based newsletter Fidenza Macro, suggested the market has been held up by hopes Trump would step in and ""buy everybody's bags,"" but that's unlikely to materialize soon. Consequently, the market is vulnerable to risk aversion driven by ongoing tariff discussions. ""Crypto will not be spared in the ensuing risk-off volatility, and I expect many coins to draw down 50% or more from their January highs. I have limit orders to buy some of my favorite coins like SOL at lower than half price,"" Chen wrote . Speaking of SOL, Amberdata's options block flow tracker revealed a sizable bear put spread involving a long position in the $200 put and a short position in the $120 put, both expiring on Feb 28. This strategy bets on a decline to at least $120 by month-end, reflecting an increasingly pessimistic outlook. Sentiment remains bearish for ether, too. ETH has already fallen 15% this month and reached its lowest in four years against bitcoin. Joe McCann, founder and CEO of Asymmetric, pointed out that ""Ethereum's fundamental positioning has weakened. Solana's ecosystem is expanding rapidly, offering higher throughput and stronger performance, making Ethereum's historical valuation premium harder to justify."" Ethereum's layer-2 scaling solutions — Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon — are all down over 50% this year, he noted. ""This signals broader struggles, as L2s were supposed to drive ETH adoption and usage, yet they're failing to generate sustained momentum."" On the macro front, investors are pivoting toward gold and U.S. Treasury notes amid the threat of a potential trade war, pushing gold to a new high of $2,877 per ounce, an impressive 10% gain for the year. Historically, a heightened preference for gold has not favored bitcoin. As if that weren't enough, rising yields on the 10-year Japanese government bond have hit their highest levels since April 2011. Additionally, the U.S. ADP employment report due today could inject further volatility into the market. It's a time to stay alert!

Yet high-profile altcoin debuts also led to significant downturns given the risk and volatility of the sector. Lookonchain pointed to a trader who lost $2.6 million out of fear of missing out on Venice.ai’s VVV token, while another trader lost $21 million on Donald Trump’s memecoin. Even the biggest altcoin by market capitalization, ether, saw supply return to pre-merge levels and has been significantly underperforming bitcoin, with the ETHBTC ratio dropping below 0.03 for the first time since 2021 this year. Meanwhile, Pump.fun’s success remains, having recently surpassed Circle, the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, in 24-hour revenue according to DeFiLlama data . Derivatives Positioning Perpetual funding rates for XLM, TON, SHIB, BCH and ONDO remain negative, hinting at a bias for shorts. These tokens could see a short squeeze should BTC surge, reviving risk-taking in the crypto market.

Meanwhile, Ethereum faces market skepticism despite its 2025 strategy, struggling with liquidity and resistance levels. XRP also sees a significant drop in transaction volume, raising concerns about demand and network activity. While established projects work through challenges, BlockDAG’s momentum continues to grow, backed by strong presale numbers and a clear vision for scalability. With a major event on the horizon, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a key player to watch in the evolving crypto sector. BlockDAG’s Hollywood-Produced Keynote 3 Promises BlockDAG is preparing for a major showcase with its Hollywood-produced Keynote 3, scheduled for March 28, 2025. Unlike conventional blockchain presentations, this event aims to blend cinematic production with technical insights, making complex topics more engaging for a wider audience. Moreover, a Hollywood producer is reportedly involved, signaling an effort to elevate blockchain storytelling and captivate both crypto enthusiasts and newcomers. Additionally, BlockDAG’s technological innovations—specifically, its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility—will be the main topic of Keynote 3. These features highlight its push for greater scalability, security, and efficiency, all while maintaining decentralization. By presenting these developments in a compelling format, BlockDAG is looking to reshape how blockchain innovations are introduced to the public. At the same time, the project’s presale continues to gain traction, surpassing $192 million and distributing over 18.3 billion BDAG coins. Consequently, early buyers have seen a 2,340% return, reflecting growing confidence in the network’s potential. The combination of a high-profile keynote and strong market performance suggests that BlockDAG is aiming for long-term impact. With its mix of cinematic storytelling and blockchain expertise, Keynote 3 could redefine expectations for crypto announcements. Therefore, the industry will be watching closely to see how this approach influences the way blockchain technology is communicated and adopted in the future. Ethereum’s 2025 Strategy Faces Market Skepticism Ethereum’s performance in 2024 was lackluster, and the start of 2025 hasn’t shown significant improvement. Currently, the cryptocurrency’s price hovers around $3,400, reflecting ongoing market challenges. In response to these difficulties, co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a strategy focusing on scaling both Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) solutions. Specifically, he emphasizes the importance of ensuring that L2s fulfill their intended roles while maintaining Ethereum’s value accrual in an L2-centric environment. Despite these plans, data indicates a decline in investor confidence. For instance, the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), which measures the average age of coins weighted by purchase price, has been increasing. This trend suggests that long-term holders are retaining their assets, leading to reduced trading activity and liquidity. In addition, there has been a noticeable rise in selling pressure from large holders, further complicating Ethereum’s path to recovery. Meanwhile, technical analysis points to potential ETH price resistance at $3,677, which could impede upward price movement. The success of Buterin’s 2025 approach is still being closely watched by the cryptocurrency community because Ethereum’s performance in the near future will depend on its capacity to break beyond this level. XRP Network Sees Significant Decline in Transaction Volume The XRP network has recently experienced a notable decrease in transaction activity, with completed transactions dropping by approximately one million. Notably, this decline follows a period of heightened activity earlier in the year. Although XRP’s blockchain has handled extended periods of high throughput in the past, the current reduction in transactions raises questions about market sentiment and potential influencing factors. As a result, this decrease may indicate a cooling phase, often suggesting that traders and investors are adjusting their positions, possibly awaiting new catalysts to reenergize the market. Alternatively, it could reflect a temporary dip in demand for XRP’s use in remittances and payments, which are primary drivers of its network utilization. Therefore, monitoring Ripple price support levels at $2.80 and $2.50 is advisable, as they could act as buffers in case of further declines. While the drop in network activity suggests a slowdown, it doesn’t necessarily signal a negative outlook for XRP. If market confidence returns and transaction volumes increase, XRP could leverage this momentum to test its resistance levels. Consequently, investors should closely watch the $3.30 mark and look for signs of renewed activity in both price movement and on-chain metrics. Final Say As Ethereum grapples with investor skepticism and XRP sees a slowdown in network activity, the broader market reflects shifting sentiment and cautious optimism. However, BlockDAG continues to gain traction, with its upcoming Hollywood Keynote 3 expected to reshape how blockchain technology is presented. The combination of a strong presale and a well-structured roadmap positions BlockDAG ahead of projects facing uncertainty. While Ethereum and XRP navigate their respective hurdles, BlockDAG’s ability to maintain momentum suggests it could define new expectations in the crypto sector.

In 2025 , from Jan. 13 to Feb. 5, net inflows equaled $4.4 billion, while the 2024 net inflows for the first three weeks equaled $1.6 billion. The spot bitcoin ETFs were one of the most successful ETF launches of all time, and have accumulated over $40.6 billion in total net inflows. In the same time, BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) has seen a total of $40.7 billion in net inflows. While the total net inflow for all 11 spot BTC ETFs is $40.6 billion, due to Grayscale GBTC witnessing outflows of $21.9 billion. To determine whether these inflows reflect a directional long position or are part of a basis trade—where an investor goes long on the underlying asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling futures contracts when they trade at a premium to spot. Currently, investors can capture a premium of approximately 10%, which will eventually diminish as the spot price converges with the futures contract's expiry. According to Glassnode data, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the primary venue for such trades, has seen a year-to-date decline in open interest from 180,099 BTC to 168,549 BTC, suggesting that these inflows are not primarily driven by basis trading.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-05 12:03:30

With hopes of the mainnet launch in the first quarter fading, how long will it take for Pi to jump to $100? Pi Network Price Technical Analysis: When Will It Hit $100? The weekly chart shows that the Pi Network price has remained in a tight range since 2023 when it crashed from a record high of $344 shortly after launch. It has remained within a narrow range, with the upper side at around $100 and the lower side at around $30. Pi Network is now nearing the lower side of the slightly ascending channel and is slightly below the 10-week moving average. The coin has also formed a double-top-like pattern, which often leads to further downside. On the positive side, the two-year consolidation may be a part of the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This theory identifies four stages that assets go through: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. A prolonged consolidation characterizes the accumulation phase. An asset then moves to the markup phase when a catalyst emerges, leading to a strong surge. In Pi Network’s case, this trigger may happen when the developers give the definitive date when it will move from the enclosed mainnet to the open mainnet. Such a move will likely see it jump to $100, the highest level in November. This rebound may happen either in February or in March since the developers have hinted that the mainnet launch will happen in the first quarter. On the other hand, a move to delay the mainnet launch further will likely lead to a strong brearish breakdown. Such a move will see it drop to the key support at $18.20, its lowest level in May 2023. Pi Network Price Potential Catalyst For the Pi Coin Price The Pi Network price has wavered after the developers postponed the KYC verification deadline from January 31 to February 28. This was a notable move since it was now the third time that they have delayed the deadline. Their excuse was that the delay would allow more pioneers to migrate their tokens to the mainnet. Those who won’t migrate their tokens when the deadline ends will still have a six-month extension that will allow them to move tokens mined in the past six months. The key concern is that the Pi Network’s developers have a long record of missing deadlines, meaning that the mainnet launch may not happen in this quarter. If this happens, the value of Pi may crash further.

We have a degen running the US. And as the first-ever ICO hosted within the Telegram app, Dogizen is presenting itself to nearly 1 billion people. Many of them are hungry for crypto. Seeing $3.8m flow into Dogizen’s presale pot is clear evidence of this bullishness. With Dogizen’s ICO ending on 7th February and an exchange listing in the works, investors can’t open their wallets quickly enough. Telegram GameFi: Ready to send Dogizen parabolic 2024 was Telegram GameFi’s year. Big names like Hamster Kombat smashed player numbers, Notcoin hit over $2.5 billion in market cap, and all the major players—Notcoin and Hamster Kombat included—earned Binance listings. Probably the most exciting statistic powering Telegram GameFi’s rise is that recent evidence shows 50% of Telegram gamers never having owned crypto before. This should not be understated: it indicates Telegram GameFi’s unique ability to grow a market that’s otherwise notoriously confusing and inaccessible to outsiders. Telegram GameFi is turning gamers into crypto investors, and Dogizen is ready to do the same. Why Dogizen has an unfair advantage Everything Dogizen’s rivals have done, Dogizen has watched from a distance and improved upon. Dogizen held airdrops, and while they managed to distribute tokens rapidly, many of these free tokens were sold equally rapidly: nobody had truly invested so had no incentive to hold, and the price plummeted. Plus, as the first-ever ICO on Telegram, Dogizen’s reach is absolutely massive. So when DOGIZ hits exchanges, its buy pressure is primed to be through the roof. Dogizen’s rivals also couldn’t have picked a worse time to launch. 2024 had a gigantic slice of flat, underwhelming market activity in Q2 and Q3. And all the big Telegram GameFi players ploughed straight into it, drowning in market-wide FUD. Dogizen’s market cap is set deliberately modest at around $10 million. This leaves crazy room for Dogizen to do a 20x or more, given that all its rivals have smashed market caps of at least $200 million. As with multiple great products like Facebook, Starbucks, and Google, Dogizen is using its 2nd mover advantage. Learning from rivals’ mistakes and launching just as the crypto market picks up. You’re not ready for what’s about to happen The fact that the US president has launched meme coins and torn up one of the most crippling pieces of crypto legislation ever is enough to make any crypto investor cry with joy. Dogizen has taken a step back, assessed both the cryptosphere and Telegram GameFi, and is coming in hot with a Telegram gaming project set to destroy the competition. You can buy DOGIZ for just $0.000085. But once it starts open trading, you’re unlikely to see a lower price ever again.

As these memecoins created huge hype, investors flocked to them. This caused incredible increases in their prices, which were followed by a major crash. While this collapse caused losses to investors who bought TRUMP and MELANIA at high levels, a citizen complained about Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump to CIMER. While it was stated that the complaint was made due to crypto money, the complainant claimed that Donald Trump and his wife were issuing crypto money and defrauding people. At this point, the complainant stated that he was complaining about the Trump couple, claiming that the TRUMP price had dropped from $75 to $16. “American President Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump have defrauded people by issuing cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum (ETH) is suddenly up around 3%, while Trump (TRUMP) has just broken out of its downtrend and is up nearly 13% so far on Wednesday. Total2 about to break out? Source: TradingView After labouring in a sideways, and then a pronounced new downtrend for quite some period of time, the Total2 chart (Combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies except $BTC) is showing signs of a possible recovery. The current downtrend needs to be broken and there is a good possibility that this could happen at some point on Wednesday. If the bulls can push the altcoin market cap up through the 0.5 Fibonacci, and the descending trendline, progress can be made towards the major descending trendline that goes all the way back to December 2024. Can $ETH break out and breathe new life into the alts? Source: TradingView $ETH is a key player here. In its own particular downtrend against the US dollar (ETH/USDT), the $ETH price really plumbed the depths in the midst of the Trump tariffs market crash. A major bottom support was tested, and it now looks as though the bulls want to push the price all the way back to the descending trendline and beyond. Just as in the case for Total2 price action, the price is up against the 0.5 Fibonacci. A break here could see $ETH tap that descending trendline once again, and this time, a confirmed breakout could occur, potentially breathing new life into the altcoin market as a whole. $TRUMP breaks out Source: TradingView A real favourite in the altcoin/memecoin space is obviously $TRUMP (TRUMP/USDT). This memecoin caused an absolute sensation when it first appeared on the scene at the time of Donald Trump’s investiture for his second term as president of the US. An absolutely huge run up took this meme to a multiple billion market cap, from which it has since rolled over and followed a huge downtrend. However, a recent pop through the descending trendline with a whole candle body on the 8-hour time frame, has led to renewed hope for a fightback. Target prices are in the above chart based on the Fibonacci levels. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

ZachXBT believes that the blame for the losses lies with Coinbase’s leadership, failing to report theft addresses, offer responsive support, and react swiftly to threats – issues rivals like Kraken and Binance manage far more effectively. Coinbase’s Security Crisis Popular pseudonymous on-chain investigator ZachXBT, alongside zeroShadow researcher ‘tanuki42,’ has uncovered that at least $65 million was stolen from Coinbase users through social engineering scams between December 2024 and January 2025. Their findings , based on on-chain data analysis and victim reports received via direct messages, suggest the actual figure is likely much higher, as it does not account for cases reported directly to Coinbase or law enforcement. The scams typically involve attackers posing as Coinbase support, using spoofed phone numbers and emails to gain victims’ trust, often leveraging personal data from private databases. Victims are tricked into transferring funds to compromised Coinbase Wallets and whitelisting fraudulent addresses. One case involved a loss of $850,000, with the stolen funds consolidated alongside assets from over 25 other victims linked to the address ‘coinbase-hold.eth.’ ZachXBT attributed these scams to groups based in India and low-level cybercriminals from online communities like Com. He criticized Coinbase’s risk models and customer security measures, which he claims have failed to prevent over $300 million in annual losses to such fraud. Leadership Inaction and Weak Support In addition to rampant social engineering scams, ZachXBT claimed that Coinbase has quietly experienced several security incidents that were not publicly disclosed. These include breaches involving old API keys used for tax software, which were supposed to have read-only permissions but were compromised, and a recent bug that allowed verification codes to be sent to any email address, regardless of whether it was linked to an account. In 2023, $15.9 million was stolen from Coinbase Commerce, and a threat actor laundered $38 million from the BTCTurk hack through Coinbase in just a few hours. The blame, according to the detective, largely falls on Coinbase’s leadership for systemic failures in security and customer response. Theft-related addresses often go unreported in compliance tools for weeks, leaving gaps in fraud detection. Victims frequently encounter ineffective customer support, with little follow-up, and the company’s unavailability outside US hours is problematic for a global 24/7 market. He further added that competitors such as Kraken, OKX, and Binance manage similar risks more effectively, Coinbase has failed to take decisive action against even low-level US-based threat actors with poor operational security. ZachXBT stated that the core issues stem from leadership decisions, not individual employees. “Coinbase needs to urgently make changes as more and more users are being scammed for tens of millions every month. Other major exchanges do not have similar panels created by scammers for fraud. While the victims are partially responsible it’s unreasonable to expect elderly victims to understand the nuances of email/phone spoofing.” The post Social Engineering Scams Hit Coinbase Users Hard: $65M Stolen, Actual Losses Likely Higher appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Coinbase|Crypto Scams|Hacks,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-02-05 12:15:53

KOFIA head Seo Yoo-seok further explained that the risk of a direct crypto investment may be balanced by regulated ETFs. Demand Push from Aging Investors Seo’s comments certainly underline the tectonic shift in crypto demographics. By local reports , the number of new crypto exchange registrations has surged 450% this year, with nearly half coming from those 40 years and older. For many older investors, there is interest in tapping into the world of digital assets. A good number prefer exposure through regulated means and not actual ownership of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Challenges Remain Regardless of this demand, the Financial Services Commission of South Korea does not consider cryptocurrencies an underlying asset according to the Capital Markets Act. This has kept crypto-backed ETFs from getting approved, hence making it hard for financial institutions to launch these products. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are unlikely to launch if there are no changes in legislation. Government to Rethink Crypto Policies In October 2024, South Korea launched a Virtual Asset Committee that would re-discuss corporate crypto trading and ETFs. As of recent discussions, reviews on corporate trading accounts are almost done, which might open up avenues for future ETF approvals. This may increase institutional participation manifold if the regulators change their minds. South Korea Crypto Market and Regulation South Korea is one of the world’s most active crypto markets, with the local currency even briefly eclipsing the US dollar as the most traded fiat against crypto in early 2024. Strict AML laws that force exchanges to partner with local banks for crypto-to-fiat services curtail institutional participation. Investors were required to open a real-name account with a local bank to open a crypto-to-fiat account. This, in effect, shut the door on corporate entities from trading cryptocurrencies . Currently, only five exchanges in South Korea meet the banking requirements necessary to provide fiat on-ramps, restricting market access for corporations. If KOFIA succeeds in the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, then it will give older investors a regulated alternative to direct crypto exposure, further legitimizing the industry within South Korea’s financial ecosystem.",Bitcoin|ETF|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-02-05 12:17:31

In a recent post , Ng emphasizes the importance of the press conference conducted by U.S. AI and crypto czar David Sacks on Feb. 5 and what it signifies for other countries. He believes that the development of the crypto industry has become one of the “biggest parameters” of success in the global political arena under the Trump administration. “Therefore, cryptocurrency has become a battleground for the development of the global digital economy and innovation and technology. At the same time, it can help stimulate the sluggish global economy,” wrote Ng in a translated post. In response to the crypto czar’s speech, Ng stated that Hong Kong has already taken government initiatives to develop itself into a global crypto hub that mirrors those in the U.S . However, he believes these efforts are still not enough to truly speed up the growth of Hong Kong’s crypto industry so that it does not run the risk of falling behind in the global crypto race.

There are a few things we must push forward this year, otherwise Hong Kong will fall behind again,” said Ng. Steps inspired by the crypto czar’s speech Echoing David Sacks’ speech, Johnny Ng recommends government initiatives that highlight growth for stablecoins and a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. His recommendations include accelerating research for a feasibility study on Bitcoin strategic reserves in Hong Kong, relaxing transaction types for licensed platforms, permitting companies to issue stablecoins and opening a digital asset department dedicated to developing AI and crypto. In addition, he also suggests seeking support from China in carrying out pilot applications for stablecoins in the country. On Feb. 4, President Trump’s AI and crypto czar David Sacks held a press conference to outline Trump’s vision that would advance the crypto landscape in the U.S. Sacks specifically highlighted stablecoins as a tool to boost the domination of the U.S. dollar. In addition, he also said conducting a “feasibility of a strategic BTC reserve” has become the top priority for the crypto council.

This is a bigger step in how the US will handle crypto assets in the long run. Any criticism of today's press conference is absolutely missing the forest for the trees.

Garlinghouse is particularly pleased that some of the most important lawmakers in the U.S., including those from the Senate and the House of Representatives, are now backing legislation to bring clearer rules for crypto. He believes this united effort is a big step forward, as it shows Washington is finally taking crypto seriously and working on rules that will provide more certainty for businesses and investors. With Garlinghouse supporting the push for clearer rules, there’s growing speculation that Ripple, the company behind the XRP token, could play a significant role in the future of U.S. crypto regulations. Though there are rumors that XRP might be considered for a national reserve list, nothing has been confirmed. Still, Garlinghouse’s support of the ongoing regulatory discussions keeps investors hopeful about Ripple’s potential in the U.S. market. Donald Trump’s meeting before his inauguration with Ripple and this sudden rumor of XRP inclusion in the reserve list seems a planned move if true. Is Bitcoin Reserve Reality or Hype? David Sacks recently spoke about the possibility of creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, following instructions from President Trump. While this initially seemed like a good step, some people were concerned when Sacks mentioned “digital assets” more than Bitcoin itself. This sparked fears that the focus might shift away from Bitcoin, which has some investors feeling uncertain about what this could mean for the market. Stablecoins Could Boost the US Dollar Sacks also talked about the importance of stablecoins, which are digital currencies tied to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar. He believes stablecoins could strengthen the dollar globally and encourage more people to use a digital dollar. This could also create more demand for U.S. government bonds, which might lower long-term interest rates. Positive Outlook for XRP Despite some uncertainties, Garlinghouse remains confident in the future of crypto in the U.S. He believes the push for clearer regulations is a crucial step in the right direction. As for XRP, crypto experts EGRAG Crypto predict it could see price increases soon, possibly reaching $4–$5 soon.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now emerges as a standout candidate, drawing comparisons to Cardano’s legendary 3000% rally in 2021. Phase 1 of its presale is live, with tokens priced at $0.01, a floor level unlikely to last. Already, $70,000 has been raised, and 189 investors have secured their positions. Early buyers will get a guaranteed 600% profit at launch, as MUTM is set to list at $0.06. For those who missed early opportunities in projects like Cardano, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a rare second chance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 1 Live Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates a decentralized liquidity protocol where users act as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Its presale structure is designed to reward early participants, mirroring the trajectory of successful predecessors. Phase 1 offers tokens at $0.01, the lowest price point before exchange listings. Investors entering now lock in a 6x return upon launch—a mathematical certainty, not a forecast. With 45.5% of the 4 billion tokens allocated to the presale, the window for maximum gains narrows rapidly. Over 189 holders have already positioned themselves, and the $70,000 raised signals accelerating demand. The protocol’s tokenomics fuel this urgency. A 10% allocation for liquidity mining and incentives ensures sustained engagement, while a 10% shortfall reserve protects against market volatility. Experts tracking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) note its buyback mechanism. The platform uses profits to purchase MUTM tokens at market price, distributing them as dividends. This creates consistent upward pressure on the token’s value, a feature absent in many decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Key Features Driving Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through two lending models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system pools lender funds and borrower collateral, dynamically adjusting interest rates based on demand. This ensures liquidity is always available, eliminating delays in accessing capital. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model caters to risk-tolerant users, allowing direct trades of volatile assets like PEPE or SHIB without compromising the protocol’s stability. Borrowers choose between variable or fixed rates, providing flexibility unmatched by competitors. Lenders earn passive dividends through MUTM tokens, directly tied to the platform’s revenue. Every transaction reinforces the token’s scarcity, as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continuously buys back tokens from the open market. Security audits and open-source code further solidify trust, critical in a market wary of vulnerabilities. The protocol’s multi-chain strategy expands its reach, planning deployments across EVM and non-EVM networks. This broadens accessibility, attracting liquidity from diverse ecosystems. Instant liquidity access ensures users capitalize on market opportunities 24/7, a necessity in fast-moving crypto cycles. How To Secure Your Position Purchasing MUTM tokens requires four straightforward steps. First, set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet and fund it with Ethereum or other supported currencies. Next, connect the wallet to Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale portal, select the desired investment amount, and confirm the transaction. Tokens appear instantly in the investor’s dashboard, with claims available post-presale. Phase 1’s $0.01 price is a temporary gateway. Historical patterns show presale tokens often surge post-listing, as seen with Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enhances this potential through its dividend model and buyback strategy, creating a self-sustaining growth cycle. Analysts monitoring the project anticipate rapid appreciation, citing its balanced token distribution and real-world utility as key drivers. The crypto market rarely offers opportunities as clear-cut as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 1’s $0.01 entry point, combined with a guaranteed 600% rise at launch, mirrors the conditions preceding Cardano’s historic climb. With $70,000 already raised and the presale advancing, delaying risks of exclusion from the ground floor. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t a speculative gamble—it’s a structured investment with measurable upside. Buying in early ahead of the crowd, sets you up for massive returns, similar to early Cardano holders.

OM’s Next Potential Targets The cryptocurrency market was severely affected at the start of the business week after US President Donald Trump imposed hefty tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly plunged below $92,000, while Ethereum (ETH) and other leading altcoins registered double-digit price declines. However, it was not all doom and gloom, and some cryptocurrencies remained on the bullish track . One example is Mantra (OM), whose valuation tapped a new all-time high of over $6 on February 4. OM Price, Source: CoinGecko The asset is up a staggering 3,500% on a yearly scale , with some major developments potentially driving the rally. Earlier in 2025, for instance, the team behind Mantra signed a $1 billion agreement deal with the investment conglomerate DAMAC Group to boost accessibility to tokenized assets in the Middle East. OM’s bull run was noted by numerous market observers , some of whom believe there is more room for growth in the near future. The X users Erica Hazel and Cowboy Genius described the collaboration in the Middle East as a huge step for Mantra. The former claimed that “this blockchain is ready to disrupt the space in ways others can’t match,” predicting that the price of its native token might soar to $10. For their part, Cowboy Genius labeled Mantra “the king of RWAs right now” and envisioned a 10x rally from the current levels. Ether Wizz chipped in, too, maintaining that Mantra “is solving real problems while others are still figuring it out.” They suggested that OM’s price could skyrocket to $15 by the end of the year. Bulls Should Have This Thing in Mind Despite all the analysts forecasting new peaks for OM, one essential on-chain metric signals that the token’s valuation might head south in the short term. This is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) , which measures the speed and change of price movements to help traders assess overbought or oversold conditions. The technical analysis tool varies from 0 to 100, and readings above 70 suggest that OM could be overbought and due for a correction. The RSI recently spiked above the bearish mark, currently set at around 60.

But here, instead of brick and mortar, it’s pixels and code. That sounds tricky! We agree. Well, people are already buying and selling land in the metaverse for millions of dollars. Big brands like Adidas, Snoop Dogg, and even banks are investing in virtual real estate. But how do you, an everyday investor, buy land in the metaverse? Let’s understand, step by step. What is Metaverse Land? Before you buy, you need to know what you’re getting into. Metaverse land is digital real estate inside virtual worlds like Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Otherside . Think of these platforms as cities in cyberspace. Instead of streets and buildings, you have plots of land that can be used for various things—building experiences, hosting events, running businesses, or simply flipping for profit. Just like in the real world, virtual land follows the principles of scarcity and location . The better the location, the higher the value. If you own land next to a celebrity’s virtual mansion, it could be worth a fortune. Why Should You Buy Land in the Metaverse? There are a few reasons people buy virtual land: Investment: Just like real estate, digital land prices can appreciate over time. Business: Brands use virtual spaces for marketing, concerts, NFT galleries, and even virtual stores. Creativity: Some people buy land just to build unique experiences, like a theme park or a museum. Passive Income: Renting out land for events or advertising can generate income. For example, in The Sandbox, Snoop Dogg built a virtual mansion and sold neighboring plots for thousands of dollars! Choosing the Right Metaverse Platform Not all metaverse lands are the same. Some platforms are more popular than others. Here are the top ones: Decentraland (MANA): One of the earliest metaverse platforms, known for virtual casinos, events, and NFT galleries. The Sandbox (SAND): A gaming-focused metaverse where brands like Atari and Gucci own land. Otherside (BAYC): A metaverse linked to Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, attracting crypto enthusiasts. Somnium Space & Cryptovoxels: Smaller, but still growing, with unique experiences. Each platform has its own ecosystem and currency. For example, Decentraland uses MANA, while The Sandbox uses SAND . Research the platform before buying. Setting Up Your Digital Wallet Since metaverse land is an NFT (a digital token proving ownership), you need a crypto wallet to buy and store it. Here’s how: Step 1: Get a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet . Step 2: Fund it with cryptocurrency (MANA, SAND, or ETH, depending on the platform). Step 3: Connect your wallet to the metaverse marketplace. Your wallet is like your digital key—it stores your assets and lets you make transactions securely. Finding and Buying Land Once your wallet is ready, it’s time to buy your first virtual plot! Step 1: Visit the official marketplace of your chosen metaverse (e.g., market.decentraland.org for Decentraland or The Sandbox marketplace). Step 2: Browse available lands and check their location, price, and nearby attractions. Step 3: Click on the land you want and hit “Buy.” The price is shown in crypto, so make sure you have enough funds. Step 4: Confirm the transaction in your wallet. Once completed, the land is yours! Coinpedia Tip: Buying land in a prime location (near plazas, roads, or big projects) can increase its future value. What Can You Do With Your Virtual Land? After purchasing, the fun begins. You can: Build on it: Create experiences like a concert hall, an NFT gallery, or a game. Rent it out: Some users rent land to brands or event organizers. Sell it later: If the price goes up, you can sell it for a profit. Advertise: If your land is in a high-traffic area, you can place ads and make money. For example, Nike has a virtual showroom in Roblox, and fashion brands are hosting metaverse fashion weeks! The possibilities are endless. Risks and Final Thoughts Like any investment, buying metaverse land has risks: Market volatility: Prices can go up or down, just like crypto. Platform risk: If the metaverse you invested in loses popularity, land values might drop. Security: Always use secure wallets and double-check links to avoid scams. Final Tip: Start small, do your research, and don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose. The metaverse is still evolving, but those who get in early could see big rewards! How to Flip Land for Profit One of the most lucrative ways to make money in the metaverse is flipping land. Here’s how you do it: Step 1: Buy land in an up-and-coming area or near a big event space. Step 2: Hold onto it until the demand increases. Step 3: Sell at a higher price to interested buyers. Many early investors in Decentraland and The Sandbox have made huge profits this way. Community and Networking Being part of a metaverse community helps you stay informed. Join Discord groups, Twitter spaces, and forums related to your chosen platform. Connecting with other landowners and developers can open up new opportunities and insider knowledge. The Future of Metaverse Land The metaverse is still in its early stages, and the possibilities are endless. With big tech companies investing in virtual spaces, we might see new metaverses emerge, making virtual real estate an exciting space to watch. Whether for business, entertainment, or investment, owning land in the metaverse could be like owning a piece of the internet in its early days. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Renowned crypto attorney James Murphy, aka MetaLawMan, has shed light on when the agency might start dropping cases. His insights, particularly on the agency’s recent pivot in the Coinbase case, have sparked discussions on what lies ahead for the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit. XRP News: Lawyer Highlights US SEC’s Pivot On Coinbase Case Pro-XRP lawyer James Murphy, also known as MetaLawMan recently highlighted the SEC’s decision not to oppose Coinbase’s motion for an interlocutory appeal at the 2nd Circuit. This marks a shift from its earlier opposition under SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Murphy stated: “Assuming the 2nd Circuit accepts the case for interlocutory appeal, it would be a few months before the SEC is required to file a brief and take a legal position on the question of whether crypto assets traded on secondary exchanges are investment contracts.” He speculated that the agency might settle or dismiss the case before reaching that stage. This shift has sparked speculation that the agency is softening its approach toward crypto cases. Observers believe the XRP lawsuit could see similar treatment if the SEC continues its trend of case re-evaluations. When The US SEC Can Start Dropping The Crypto Cases? A key factor influencing these decisions is the SEC’s leadership uncertainty. With no Senate-confirmed chairman, Murphy expects a new chair to be appointed by March or April. For context, when an X user questioned when the agency could start dropping the cases and what’s stopping them from such a move, Murphy said: “No Senate-confirmed Chairman yet. Probably March or April time frame. Paul Atkins may be one of President Trump’s least controversial nominations.” This indicates that the SEC could start dismissing or settling the cases once a Senate-confirmed chair, possibly Paul Atkins, takes the SEC role. However, he also noted that “the Commissioners must take a vote to settle or dismiss a case. Right now there are 3 Commissioners, so Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda have the votes to take action on cases.” This suggests that decisions regarding crypto lawsuits could still move forward despite the absence of a permanent chair. Besides, the SEC crypto task force’s latest push towards clear regulations has further fueled market sentiments. What’s Next For XRP Lawsuit? The Ripple lawsuit has been a focal point in the crypto community, especially after reports surfaced that the SEC removed it from its website. Sherrie, a well-known XRP community attorney dismissed settlement rumors , clarifying that the case is now listed under the Court of Appeals website due to its new case number. Ripple is set to submit its appeal-related brief by April 16. XRP attorney Jeremy Hogan also suggested that the SEC may drop or withdraw the case by April or May, aligning with the expected appointment timeline of a new chair. Will The SEC Drop Ripple’s Case? While some experts believe the SEC’s shift in the Coinbase case could hint at a similar approach for Ripple, others remain skeptical. Sherrie argued that an acting chair is unlikely to make a major decision like dropping the lawsuit. However, when an X user asked for an “update on the Ripple Vs SEC appeal”, MetaLawMan said that it is “still chugging along.” He also highlighted that Ripple’s brief is due on April 16. Having said that, many are speculating a potential conclusion in the XRP lawsuit with the new US SEC chair in April.

The latest milestone comes approximately two months after its launch. On the other hand, only 4,109 transactions have been processed on the Ethereum (ETH) network, meaning that more than 95% of RLUSD transactions are occurring on XRPL. The significant preference for XRPL over Ethereum, as suggested by the latest analysis from CryptoQuant, indicates that users are favoring the network’s efficiency and lower costs. The increasing transaction count further reflected a growing adoption. Boosting RLUSD Adoption Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin debuted in mid-December after obtaining the green light from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). It maintains a 1:1 peg with the US dollar and is central to Ripple’s broader plan to improve cross-border payment efficiency using blockchain-based solutions. In an effort to boost RLUSD’s adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), the firm partnered with the decentralized oracle network Chainlink last month. The collaboration aims to introduce reliable price feeds for RLUSD on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, thereby facilitating efficient transactions and enterprise-grade DeFi applications. RLUSD, which is pegged to the US dollar, will leverage Chainlink’s data feeds to ensure accuracy, security, and resistance to manipulation or technical disruptions. Meanwhile, in a recent AMA session , Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson expressed interest in integrating RLUSD and has been in talks with Ripple representatives regarding potential collaboration. The exec mentioned that discussions with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CTO David Schwartz are ongoing, but they were advised to hold off until March. XRP Ledger Activates Clawback Amendment Following a validator vote with over 90% support, a clawback amendment went live on XRP Ledger on January 31st. This change will help RLUSD stablecoin to be traded and exchanged more freely on the network’s DEX while simultaneously increasing liquidity and DeFi growth. The clawback feature allows token issuers to reclaim assets under specific conditions, such as regulatory requirements, fraud cases, or accidental transfers. Additionally, the amendment also improves regulatory compliance for AMM pools and ensures that frozen tokens cannot be deposited into the Automated Market Maker (AMM).

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President ordered the creation of a US sovereign wealth fund within a year. The Treasury and Commerce Departments must present a plan in 90 days, detailing how to fund and manage it. Since the US runs on a deficit, Congress would need to approve the fund before it becomes a reality. But here’s one analyst who has suggested a plan B to reduce government spending on the Sovereign Wealth Fund. Analyst Proposes New Idea Taking a chance on this matter, Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya has floated an interesting idea—what if the U.S. government uses its Bitcoin holdings to kickstart a new sovereign wealth fund? With the U.S. holding about 198,109 BTC, worth roughly $19.4 billion, Palihapitiya suggests that instead of borrowing money, the government could use these Bitcoin holdings while slowly selling off assets like its 50% stake in TikTok. I think we can start by slowly selling down our 50% share of TokTok + borrowing against our BTC holdings if we didn’t want to sell them. We can then add to this by directing any revenues from land/drilling deals and sales of any RE from all of the abandoned buildings. This is… — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) February 4, 2025 Palihapitiya estimates that through careful asset management, the government could generate $50-100 billion over the next two to three years—without the need for borrowing. Moreover, he recommends that the sovereign wealth fund be diversified across index funds, bonds, hedge funds, and private equity, with venture capital making up less than 10% of the portfolio. This idea is to ensure that the money rotates rightfully and gives long-term returns while minimizing risk. As per the Bloomberg report , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that funds are on the way and it will take 12 months. These funds can provide long-term stability in the US economy. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump’s 100-Day Plan: Pro-Crypto Policies, National Bitcoin Reserve, & More! , A First for the U.S. While states like Alaska have successfully started their sovereign wealth funds for years, the federal government has never established one. Countries like Norway and the UK have already used Bitcoin in their financial strategies. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has invested in crypto businesses, and the UK government holds around 61,200 BTC. These investments serve as hedges against inflation and diversify risk, especially since Bitcoin doesn’t move in sync with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. If the U.S. adopts a similar approach, it could signal a major shift in how governments manage digital assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With a jaw-dropping 50,000% growth potential, this token has already raised $1 million in minutes during its presale. With Bitcoin (BTC) crossing $100,000 and XRP’s recent 500% surge might seem impressive, but none can rival the explosive potential and exclusivity driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN forward. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines XRP and Others 1. Massive Growth Potential: XRP’s 500% returns pale in comparison to the staggering 50,000% potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Early investors are already seeing the impact of this token’s high demand and limited availability, making it the standout choice for transformative returns. 2. Exclusive Sale Creates High Demand: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN. This strategic exclusivity has heightened interest and secured its place as one of the most sought-after tokens. 3. Strong Community Support: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN thrives on a loyal and engaged community, driving organic growth and market demand. This strong backing amplifies its visibility and positions it as a top choice for long-term success. How It Stacks Up Against Other Cryptos Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi leader, but its growth has plateaued compared to early-stage tokens like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability, but SOL can’t match the exclusivity and skyrocketing demand of this new token. Optimism (OP): A Layer-2 solution with promise, but its gains are modest compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s potential. Injective Protocol (INJ): A promising DeFi player, but it hasn’t generated the same overwhelming excitement. The Crypto Everyone’s Talking About THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already set new standards in the market. With its explosive potential, exclusive access, and investor confidence, this token is on track to deliver life-changing returns.

In a post on X, the tokenized RWA issuer disclosed that its new platform brings traditional assets on-chain. According to Ondo Finance, Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM) will onboard stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and bonds to the on-chain ecosystem. It said: “Our RWA tokenization platform designed to enable onchain access to stocks, bonds, and ETFs. What stablecoins did for dollars, Ondo Global Markets will do for securities.” The protocol noted that blockchain technology will address the investment ecosystem’s current challenges. Highlighting some of the issues, Ondo Finance mentioned limited access, platform fragmentation, hidden risks, high fees, and transfer frictions, adding that these challenges have prevented many people from accessing the capital markets. However, it noted that its Ondo GM, which has been in the works since last year, will address these issues by enabling securities issuers to create freely transferable tokens while incorporating compliance at the distribution layer. Ondo Finance will bring securities on-chain Per the announcement on its blog, Ondo GM will now enable investors outside the US to gain exposure to US publicly traded securities in the same way they have access to US dollars through stablecoins. Some of those expected to benefit directly from the new platform include individual investors and traditional broker-dealers outside the US, as well as asset managers, issuers, and crypto platforms. The Ondo Finance announcement reads: “Ondo Global Markets brings the transparency, efficiency, and accessibility enabled by blockchain technology to institutional-grade finance.” Although the protocol did not provide information on issuers who will create tokens on the platform, it did mention that over a thousand high-quality securities will be available for users to trade. It added that third-party developers can build financial applications on the Ondo GM using its software development kits (SDKs) and APIs. ONDO sees muted performance despite positive news Meanwhile, the RWA protocol’s unveiling of its new platform is the latest in a series of announcements leading up to its first-ever Ondo Summit, which will be held in New York City on February 6. Before this, the protocol announced the launch of a tokenized short-term US Treasury Fund (OUSG) on the Ripple XRP Ledger. The fund, which is set to go live within six months, is backed by BlackRock BUIDL and taps into the capabilities of the XRPL and Ripple RLUSD stablecoin. More recently, Ondo also unveiled Ondo Nexus, a liquidity supply initiative for tokenized treasuries. The protocol said this would boost liquidity for third-party issuers through a partnership with PayPal and BlackRock. It also selected WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, Fundbridge, Wellington Management, and BlackRock as issuers for its tokenized treasuries. Ondo Finance controls around 80% of the tokenized US Treasuries market. Despite the various initiatives, products, and partnerships with TradFi institutions, the ONDO token has not seen any substantial increase in its value. Since rising as high as $1.499 earlier today, the token has dropped to $1.363 with barely a 2% gain in the last 24 hours. Although it is up 86% over the past 90 days, the token remains down from its $2.141 peak and has lost 6% year-to-date. However, many industry stakeholders believe the protocol will grow substantially in the coming years, especially as tokenization sees more adoption.

Dubbed the Decoupling America’s Artificial Intelligence Capabilities from China Act , the bill seeks to prevent the export, import, and collaboration on AI technologies with the Chinese government or its affiliated entities. While the bill does not specifically mention DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot comparable to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, its provisions would prohibit Americans and U.S. companies from downloading or using the platform. AI Tech Trade Cutoff The proposed legislation includes stringent penalties for non-compliance. Individuals found violating the terms could face fines of up to $1 million and prison sentences of up to 20 years. Companies would face steeper financial consequences, with fines reaching $100 million and potential forfeiture of federal licenses, contracts, and grants. In his announcement, Hawley emphasized the importance of safeguarding American technological innovation: “Every dollar and gig of data that goes into Chinese AI will be used against the U.S. America cannot afford to empower our greatest adversary at the expense of our own strength.” The bill also aims to prohibit U.S. firms from conducting artificial intelligence research in China or partnering with Chinese entities, while banning investment in Chinese AI development projects. Global Implications and Industry Criticism The rise of DeepSeek AI has already sparked international concern over data privacy, with Italy imposing a ban on the platform due to what it described as inadequate data protection measures. Other nations are reportedly evaluating similar restrictions. However, not everyone agrees with Senator Hawley’s approach. Ben Brooks, an artificial intelligence research fellow at Harvard, criticized the legislation as overly aggressive and detrimental to technological progress. “This bill would kill open-source innovation and isolate the U.S. from global advancements in AI,” Brooks said. “It represents the most aggressive legislative action on AI we’ve seen and risks setting back American research significantly.” Despite its intent to bolster national security and maintain technological dominance, the bill has sparked heated debate about whether limiting international collaboration will ultimately hinder or protect American innovation. If passed, it could mark a significant turning point for U.S. policy on AI and its global relationships in the tech sector.

In a first-of-its-kind move, Travala, which is a web3 platform and a travel website known for accepting crypto payments, has joined hands with Trivago. Over 2.2M Trivago properties now support bookings via crypto thanks to Travala’s integration. Customers will be able to choose from dozens of cryptocurrencies, including $BTC and $ETH. What’s more, Travala will also offer loyalty tokens (in $BTC or $AVA) to hotelgoers who use crypto for hotel bookings on Trivago. It’s also worth noting that Travala had previously launched a Bitcoin and AVA treasury plan in December 2024, so this is not their first rodeo. Overall, with an increasing number of companies embracing crypto, there’s likely going to be a huge spike in investor interest in crypto projects in the coming months. To help you make the most of crypto’s breakthrough into everyday use, here are 5 new crypto coins you can consider investing in in 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Best New Crypto Coin to Buy for 100x Return in 2025 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has proven itself as a worthy descendant of the OG Pepe. It’s easily the best-performing crypto presale right now, with close to $70M in presale funding. Moreover, it’s now within touching distance from the highest ever presale raise before listing, which was by its big brother Pepe Unchained ($73M). What’s the hype, you ask? $WEPE aims to level the playing field by making the unfair dominance of crypto whales a thing of the past. These institutional investors hide behind insider information and use it to manipulate the markets. $WEPE will provide token holders with unique market insights, strategies, and real-time trading calls so that they can flip the script and become profitable. Additionally, the project has set aside an impressive 15% of its total token supply to reward token holders who share their profitable trading tactics. Join the $WEPE army now for just $0.0003665, but hurry up because the presale ends in just 11 days. If you need more assistance, check out our guide on how to buy $WEPE . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First-Ever Layer 2 Solution for Fast & Reliable Throughputs Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network, designed with the purpose of elevating Solana to a whole new level. $SOLX, one of the best meme coins , will remove Solana’s critical flaws, including network congestion, limited scalability, and transactions not going through as reliably as they should. By combining Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s efficiency ( Solaxy is a multi-chain crypto), it’ll not only execute transactions super quickly but also at a more affordable rate than any other rival. Moreover, the potential launch of Solana ETFs, which look very likely, by the way, is also going to send $SOLX prices soaring after its launch. Combined with how insanely popular Solana has become in recent months, Solaxy is looking set to be the next 100x meme coin . The $SOLX presale has raised over $18M so far, and interested investors can get in now for just $0.001626 per token. Here’s how to buy $SOLX . 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – A Less Risky Approach to Meme Coins Investments Meme Index ($MEMEX) is undoubtedly a revolutionary project, seeing as it simplifies crypto investment for newbies and conservative traders who want to benefit from what the crypto economy has to offer but without taking on zero-or-hero type trades. Essentially, Meme Index is exactly like your mutual funds provider for the stock market, i.e., it allows you to diversify your risk . $MEMEX offers four different baskets of meme coins, and you can take your pick depending on the amount of risk (and profit potential) you’re willing to carry. For instance, for steadier and safer returns, as well as less volatility during market-wide liquidation (like last week’s) , something like the Meme Titan Index will be a perfect pick. On the contrary, if you want to be more aggressive during a full-blown bull run, consider investing in the Meme Frenzy Index with potential for exponential gains. 1 $MEMEX is currently available for $0.0158443, and early adopters can also utilize the project’s 678% staking rewards to create a nifty passive income source on the side. 4. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – New PolitFi Crypto with the Highest Potential Although it was Donald Trump’s new tariff plan that caused a huge liquidation in the crypto market over the weekend, including his own meme coin, Official Trump ($TRUMP) has jumped over 10% in the last 24 hours, breaking out of an ascending triangle pattern – a major bullish signal. This proves that Trump continues to be a favorite among crypto enthusiasts, who are banking on him to take crypto to the moon. $TRUMP shot up by over 12,000% immediately after its launch in late January, making mind-boggling returns for early investors. It’s currently trading at $19.21, which, considering its PolitiFi nature and Trump’s overall bullish stance on crypto, could be a great entry point for both short and long-term investors. Although the token fell after making all-time highs (which is natural, by the way), it’s still the fourth biggest cryptocurrency in the world in terms of market capitalization – it has a market cap of over $3.8B. 5. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – Elon Musk’s Sweetheart Poised for Growth With increasing crypto adoption, it’d make sense to invest in a coin like $DOGE that has the potential to break into everyday use. We say this because there have been several reports of Dogecoin becoming a government-backed cryptocurrency. Moreover, Elon Musk could also integrate $DOGE into X Money’s payment platform, which would only result in a massive inflow in the token’s already massive $40B market cap. Despite falling prices, analysts are confident in Dogecoin’s future potential, suggesting that it may actually lead crypto gains this month . You can get 1 $DOGE for just $0.2667 right now. Conclusion These were the 5 best new crypto coins you should consider including in your 2025 portfolio. At the same time, though, beware that the crypto economy, like other markets, is prone to violent ups and downs. This is why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing.

At present, bitcoin is trading just below this level, hovering around $98,000. The concern arises when bitcoin falls below the average withdrawal price for a sustained period of time, as this can often trigger continued selling and more downward price pressure. Historically, this metric has served as a strong support level for bitcoin. Busting below this support, however, does not necessarily indicate a bear market or sustained declines, as bitcoin historically reclaims this price level quickly. In 2024, for example, bitcoin repeatedly tested its average withdrawal price just below $60,000. The price indeed did briefly dip below this level multiple times, most notably in August during the yen carry trade unwind when it fell to $49,000. The price, though, managed to reclaim the support level within a few days. Similarly, in 2023, the realized price provided key support on multiple occasions, including during the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March ($20,000) and again in September, just before bitcoin’s Q4 rally. According to Glassnode data, over 2.6 million BTC are sitting at a loss, one of the highest amounts this year.

This triggered panic and a broad market sell-off. This decline led to the largest liquidation ever known in the crypto world, amounting to $2 billion. Traders with long positions were the ones who suffered the most, experiencing the biggest losses. However, Bitcoin held support at $92,000 and bounced back above $100,000 shortly. Analysts predict that this could be an event after which the altseason can begin. While crypto enthusiasts are waiting for the altseason, numerous crypto projects are being launched, including Onyxcoin (XCN), which was just listed on the world's fastest-growing crypto exchange, Bitunix, on February 4th. What is OnyxCoin (XCN)? Onyxcoin is a decentralized digital asset built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and it functions both as a currency for payments and discounts as well as a governance token within the ecosystem. Onyxcoin (XCN) is the core token of the Onyx Protocol, a blockchain system designed to improve financial services. XCN has multiple uses within the Onyx ecosystem. XCN holders can vote on important decisions about how the protocol develops, thus making this a community driven project.

Trump's nomination of Paul Atkins to head the SEC is awaiting confirmation by the Senate. While confirmation for Paul Atkins is eagerly awaited, Bitwise Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) Katherine Dowling said that the SEC is currently in a transition period and needs to approve the appointment of the new chairman, Paul Atkins. Stating that the SEC’s new crypto task force is incredibly realistic, Dowling said that he expects the task force to do good work. Speaking about the Ripple case and ongoing lawsuits, Dowling stated that the SEC is waiting for a “directive from above” regarding the outcome of the cases. “These things don't go away overnight, and they shouldn't. But when you have new leadership, there's a new perspective. It asks, are we looking at the right things in this particular case? Is there a compromise stance that can get us both what we want?” Dogecoin is in a More Advantageous Situation! Speaking about the possible outcomes of ETF applications, the Bitwise executive stated that the security nature of some altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and XRP is still debatable. Dowling, who likened these altcoins to “dolphins caught in fishing nets”, said that the situation regarding these altcoins should be clarified under the leadership of the new SEC chairman. However, the famous name added that if clarity is provided, ETF approval may come, and said that the process for the Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF is clearer and more open. Dowling added that the SEC has never and nowhere considered DOGE a security, and that a DOGE ETF could be easier to approve. The Bitwise COO finally added that a Bitcoin and Ethereum combination ETF could be approved quickly. *This is not investment advice.

RippleX confirmed that XRP Ledger has resumed activity though the exact cause of the disruption is still unclear. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, acknowledged the issue in his post on X , stating that validators had stopped publishing confirmations despite the consensus mechanism functioning normally. His preliminary observations suggest that servers may have deliberately withheld validations to prevent incorrect ledger acceptance. The network is now recovering.

Schwartz initially believed that multiple validator operators manually intervened to restore the network. However, he later clarified that only one operator took action, but it was “still not entirely clear if that solved the problem or the network self-healed.” He also assured that “no ledgers that received majority validation were lost or affected in any way.” Update: It looks like, as far as we can tell, only one validator operator manually intervened. It's still not entirely clear if that solved the problem or the network self-healed. — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) February 5, 2025 In the XRP Ledger , consensus is vital for processing transactions. If validators fail to agree on which transactions to include, the network halts. Prior to this, on Nov. 25, the XRP Ledger faced a brief outage lasting about 10 minutes. Several nodes crashed and restarted simultaneously, leading to a temporary halt in transaction processing. Ripple addressed the issue by urging validators and node operators to upgrade to the latest version, Rippled 2.3.0, to enhance network stability and prevent similar incidents. Despite the disruption, Ripple ( XRP ) price remained relatively stable, trading at approximately $2.50, with a 4% change over the last 24 hours.

Binance coin drops 17% in a month as investors turn to 1Fuel, a rising crypto gaining attention for cross-chain transactions. Table of Contents Bearish signals flashing: Is BNB headed for $485? XRP drops 14%: What’s driving the sell-off? 1Fuel’s presale soars past $1.8M: Why investors are taking notice Final thoughts The crypto market is no stranger to turbulence, but few expected Binance coin (BNB) to take a hit after what was shaping up to be a “bullet-proof” year. With a staggering 17% monthly loss, investors are getting restless. Meanwhile, Ripple’s XRP isn’t faring much better, dragged down by legal uncertainties and ongoing market volatility. As major players stumble, a rising star is capturing attention, 1Fuel (OFT) . With seamless cross-chain transactions and over 100x returns, 1Fuel is quickly becoming the go-to alternative for investors looking for stability and growth. Let’s take a closer look! Bearish signals flashing: Is BNB headed for $485? BNB’s price is in a complicated phase, with recent data reflecting mixed signals over different timeframes. In addition to the 12% losses over the last week and the 17% losses over the past month, the coin’s price fell 2.3% over the last 24 hours after showing some signs of rebound. BNB currently trades at $585, pointing to the continuous market volatility. As the downturn continues, major Fibonacci retracement levels are in focus, with the 0.618 retracement level at $550 serving as a vital support zone. If selling momentum picks up speed and bears become stronger, an additional decline toward $485 may occur. Due to these technical signs, a lot of BNB investors are diversifying their holdings and looking for potential outside of the conventional large-cap market. 1Fuel has become a strong substitute that has drawn interest from many disappointed BNB investors. You might also like: How 1Fuel reflects the key strengths of Solana and Ethereum XRP drops 14%: What’s driving the sell-off? Ripple’s XRP has been the victim of the market’s volatility lately, as its price has dipped over 14% in the last seven days. The drop coincided with an increase in investor fear as financial market geopolitics heightened. XRP showed some signs of rebound in the past 24 hours, but the bears soon took over, as evidenced by an additional 2% decline over the past 24 hours. This variation has been linked to regime changes and regulatory concerns, as would be expected in certain locations. Legal ambiguities still have an impact on Ripple’s performance. Its unsettled situation hinders Ripple’s ability to secure fresh partnerships and stabilize the XRP price. This caused several investors to shift their capital from this crypto veteran to an emerging player, 1Fuel, which has more potential for growth owing to its strong technology. 1Fuel’s presale soars past $1.8M: Why investors are taking notice While BNB takes a dip and XRP sees capital outflows, 1Fuel is gaining attention, collecting over $1.8 million in its ongoing presale with tokens priced around $0.017, offering early investors a 70% return and over 100x returns on listing. 1Fuel stands out with its advanced one-click cross-chain transaction system, allowing users to transfer assets seamlessly across networks without any complexities.

Dogen is set to launch soon, and analysts predict it could surge by a staggering 10,000%. This unexpected contender might shake up the crypto market, capturing the attention of investors looking for the next big opportunity. Alpha Meme Coin DOGEN Off to the Moon After Its Major Listing Event DOGEN, which has recently captured the interest of the crypto community with its bold narrative of the strongest meme coin for alpha males , was listed on February 4th. The listing comes at the perfect timing as the crypto market is on the brink of a massive bull run supported by favorable geopolitical factors. Affectionately dubbed “DOGE on steroids” by one community member, DOGEN is poised to replicate the success of popular meme coins such as Dogecoin, which has seen a whopping 66,000% increase compared to its launch price . Those who bought $DOGEN during the presale got it at a bargain price. However, it is not too late; $DOGEN remains a good value and its price is predicted to increase from here. Community-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a fad; it’s a growing movement with a team dedicated to building a strong community of alpha leaders who are ready to take over the market. This token offers real value, including exciting campaigns and exclusive benefits for early adopters. DOGEN is a chance to be part of something big. The community-driven presale strategy has enabled DOGEN to raise $5.5 million in initial funding and amass a large community of nearly 20,000 DOGEN fans . This provides a strong foundation for the token to start its mission to the moon successfully. The $DOGEN private presale has concluded, and the token can now be purchased with SOL on major cryptocurrency exchanges. DOGEN is heading to the moon! Join the mission and don’t miss out! Dogecoin: A Meme-Based Cryptocurrency with Strong Community Support Dogecoin is a digital currency created in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. It is based on the Shiba Inu meme and was designed to be abundant, with no supply limit and 10,000 coins mined per minute. Initially seen as a joke, its value skyrocketed in 2021 due to social media and Elon Musk’s interest. It gained a large community and became one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. While its past success highlights the importance of online support, its high supply and meme origins make it unique. Potential interest depends on market trends and community activity, but it remains a popular option for tipping and small transactions. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Dogecoin-Inspired Ethereum-Based Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency created in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. It is inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling more advanced functions and integration with decentralized applications. SHIB started with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large portion to charity and burned 40% of the supply. This event brought attention to SHIB. The coin stands out with applications like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading and staking, and future plans for NFTs and decentralized governance. Its compatibility with Ethereum allows for broad use, adding to its appeal in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu lose short-term momentum, DOGEN stands out as the meme token for those seeking luxury and success. Predicted to grow 700% by presale’s end and possibly multiply a thousand-fold this altcoin season, DOGEN follows tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Offering real benefits and perks for early adopters, it’s building a community of market leaders.

Over 12 million tokens were incinerated on Tuesday and another 5.3 million on Wednesday. So, will the increasing burn rate boost the SHIB coin price? Shiba Inu Price in Focus as SHIB Burn Rate Rises The Shiba Inu price has stabilized this week after plunging to a multi-month low of $0.00001175 on Monday. This stability has mirrored that of other coins, which have largely bounced back after Donald Trump paused tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods. Another likely reason for the stability is that more SHIB coins have been removed from circulation through its burning process. Data shows that one user moved over 12.63 million coins to the Burn Address B-2, which now holds over 45.5 billion SHIB coins. Another address moved 5 million coins to the same address. Shiba Inu’s burn rate has been growing, removing over 410 trillion tokens from circulation and boosting its tokenomics. These burns have reduced the number of tokens in circulation to about 589 trillion. Traders Wait For Next SHIB Catalyst While Shiba Inu price is up modestly from its lowest level this month, its price has largely remained muted, in line with other coins. Two bullish catalysts to watch are the potential pause of US and China tariffs and the upcoming US nonfarm payroll (NFP) data. A tariff pause may push stocks higher, driving other assets like cryptocurrencies up this week. Trump’s pause on Mexico and Canada tariffs is a good example . Friday’s NFP report will also be a catalyst because of its potential impact on the Federal Reserve. The value of SHIB rises when the Fed turns dovish. Shiba Inu Price Technical Analysis: Needs to End The Week Above $0.000015 The weekly chart shows that the Shiba Inu price has crashed after peaking at $0.00003328 in November. It dropped below the 50-week moving average and bottomed at the key support level at $0.00001173 on Monday. This was a notable price since it was slightly below the ascending trendline that links the lowest swings since June 2023. It was also near its lowest swing in September last year. SHIB price needs to end the week above the key point at $0.000015 to confirm a hammer candle that is forming. A hammer has a long lower shadow and a small body and is one of the top bullish reversal signs. The coin will likely rally to the 50-week moving average at $0.00001915, up 18% above the current level. Shiba Inu Price Chart The bullish SHIB price forecast will become invalidated if the coin crashes below the ascending trendline. Such a move will point to further downside to the psychological level at $0.000010.

Driven by growing institutional interest and demand for blockchain-based assets, this expansion conforms more to general market trends. Network engagement has also been vital for BNB Chain’s development. By means of continuous improvements of projects and developers under the Binance Smart Chain, its ecosystem is reinforced and its key role among blockchain systems is confirmed. Price Ascent And Market Reactions On December 7, 2024, BNB reached $750 per token, marking a new milestone. Rising demand for Binance’s ecosystem, strategic token burning, and improved macroeconomic conditions supporting the bitcoin market have all contributed to this spike. But, after hitting its peak, BNB faced the expected corrections. BNB is now trading for around $573 as of early February 2025, which is consistent with usual market fluctuations. Despite this, investor mood remains broadly positive, with many experts viewing it as a temporary reversal rather than a sign of a long-term collapse. Price Predictions And Future Outlook Market analysts continue to have high hopes for BNB’s future. While altcoin Investors project a maximum price of $1,000, CoinCodex projects that BNB might rise as high as $732 by March 2025. According to these projections, BNB still has space to develop as a result of ongoing adoption, Binance’s growing clout, and possible regulatory clarity in key areas.

In the past, Binance has worked to keep prices stable and increase long-term value by regularly destroying some of its tokens. What’s Next For BNB? With its past success and strong basics, BNB offers optimism for the future. The bitcoin market is usually unstable, but the altcoin has shown that it can handle challenges and benefit from increases in value. Investors will closely watch changes in laws, the overall market situation, and future updates in the Binance ecosystem. It’s uncertain if BNB will reach a price in the thousands this year, but it remains an important part of the digital asset market.

This will establish the first platform to integrate directly with land registries through notarized agreements, and provide a legally compliant framework for real estate asset tokenization under EU regulations. The incorporated Blocksquare SARL will act as the operational hub for the company’s Notarized Real Estate Tokenization Framework, which is a legal structure designed to make it possible for property owners to tokenize economic rights tied to their real estate assets while still maintaining full ownership. By taking advantage of Luxembourg’s well-established regulatory framework, Blocksquare’s initiative brings blockchain technology together with traditional land registries, and ensures legally protected economic rights for investors through Blocksquare Property Tokens (BSPTs). Bridging Blockchain and Traditional Property Laws The Tokenization Framework follows a structured process. Each tokenization event involves the issuance of a new set of BSPT tokens, which are then bought by property owners through a structured borrowing arrangement. This loan is collateralized by placing a lien on the property title, which will be facilitated by a notary. Subsequently, the property owner enacts a legally binding resolution, transferring the economic rights associated with the property to BSPT holders. These rights primarily stem from revenue streams like lease income and potential property resale proceeds. For investors, the framework offers fractional ownership, secondary market liquidity, and legal security in tokenized real estate assets. Property owners benefit from global capital access, retained control, and streamlined transactions, while partners can receive up to 100% tech license discounts based on their BST holdings. A Big Step Toward Institutional Adoption “Tokenizing real-world assets has faced major roadblocks due to legal uncertainties,” said Denis Petrovcic, CEO of Blocksquare. “With the incorporation of Blocksquare SARL, we have created a legally enforceable framework that merges blockchain technology with traditional property laws. By utilizing the same legal structures that banks use to secure loans with real estate assets, we ensure security and transparency for investors looking to participate in tokenized real estate.” Luxembourg is widely recognized as a leading European financial hub as it offers strong regulatory alignment with EU financial laws, particularly the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). This move reinforces Blocksquare’s commitment to providing a regulated, institutional-grade investment platform for real estate tokenization. With Blocksquare SARL, the company is now preparing to launch pilot projects in Belgium and Austria, with further expansion plans targeting Germany, Poland, and France. The company’s goal is also to attract institutional investors and large-scale real estate ventures to help cement its role as a pioneer in real estate finance. Real-World Asset Tokenization Reaches New Highs Blocksquare shows a lot of promise, especially as the RWA tokenization market recently surged to an all-time high of $17.1 billion in total value locked (TVL). This is a 94% increase year-over-year, according to RWA.xyz . (Source: RWA.xyz ) Since November, the sector gained 26%, or $4 billion, with private credit (70%) and US Treasury debts (21%) dominating on-chain value. Wall Street is also increasingly bullish on RWAs, with major firms preparing for the projected $30 trillion market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-05 14:01:46

Introduced by US senator Bill Hagerty, the bill aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. If passed into legislation, Tether ($USDT), USD Coin ($USDC), and other stable coins with market caps above the $10B mark would need to adhere to US Federal Reserve regulations. Meanwhile, stablecoins with market caps below the $10B threshold would be regulated by the individual states. Hagerty announced the introduction of GENIUS at yesterday’s White House press conference on digital assets . At the same press meeting, AI and crypto adviser David Sacks noted that ‘Stablecoins have the potential to ensure American dollar dominance internationally to increase the usage of the US dollar digitally as the world’s reserve currency and in the process create potentially trillions of dollars of demand for the US Treasury.’ What Does The GENIUS Act Mean For Stablecoins, Meme Coins, And Other Altcoins The Trump administration being in support of stablecoins – or any type of cryptocurrency for that matter – is good news all the way. And while the market has seen a downturn, the community sentiment is bullish. With prices generally down across the board, now’s a good time to buy the dip. That’s especially true when it comes to meme coins, which exploded last year. If you’re thinking of investing in meme coins, here are five that have high growth potential. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – The First-ever Solana Layer 2 Ecosystem Solaxy ($SOLX) is grabbing a lot of investor attention – and for good reason. This meme coin, currently in presale, will power the world’s first-ever Solana Layer 2 ecosystem. Exciting news indeed. Not only will it incorporate Solana’s outstanding characteristics (good speed and low transaction fees) but it will also get rid of the pain points that plague the Solana blockchain – congestion and failed transactions. If that’s not enough good news, it will add even more speed and scalability to the equation. In all, it means a highly robust platform for meme coins and dApps. $SOLX is also a multi-chain token, yet another reason why we have high hopes for Solaxy. It will exist on both Solana (renowned for the hottest meme coins ) and Ethereum, which has a massive DeFi and asset tokenization ecosystem. The Solaxy presale launched in December last year, raising an $5.8M in the first five days alone. That figure now stands at a hefty $18M. A price increase is imminent, but 1 SOLX currently costs $0.001626, with 224% staking rewards. 2. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – A Powerful AI Agent With Valuable Insights For Token Holders Another meme coin we’re keeping a close eye on is MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . More than just yet another iteration of Pepe the Frog, this is a powerful AI agent, and the first meme coin of its kind. The Pepes of the crypto world often do very well for themselves. Take Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) , for instance – another Pepe-inspired meme coin currently on presale. $WEPU has become a phenomenon, having raised close to $69.5M (yes, you read that figure correctly). And as the presale draws to a close, all eyes will be on $MIND to see if it follows in $WEPE’s footsteps. $MIND will set up autonomous X and other social media accounts, and it’ll use those to amass a follower base and identify upcoming crypto market trends, through the clever use of hive-mind analysis. AI is the driving force behind this meme coin, enabling it to continuously learn and self-evolve. And as $MIND’s influencer status grows, it will shape conversations and gain valuable insights, which MIND of Pepe will share exclusively with $MIND token holders. MIND of Pepe will even have blockchain access and the ability to launch tokens. And, of course, $MIND holders will have exclusive early-bird access to those. The MIND of Pepe presale has already raised more than $5M, and right now 1 $MIND will cost you $0.0032662 (with staking rewards at 444%). To find out more about how you can invest in $MIND using $ETH, $BNB, $USDT, or $USD, take a look at our guide to buying $MIND . 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Coin Baskets For Greater Exposure With The Benefit Of Diversified Risk Exposure is the name of the Meme Index ($MEMEX) game. The meme coin market exploded last year, but as even the past week has reminded us, the crypto market is unpredictable. That’s why risk diversification is highly appealing to investors, and $MEMEX does just that. $MEMEX has four meme coin baskets (in another word, indexes) to choose from, each with varying levels of volatility. The Titan Index is the least volatile but with slower rewards. It’s home to $DOGE, $SHIB, $FLOKI, $PEPE, and more of the top and better-established meme coins. Up next is the Moonshot Index, where you’ll find meme coins that are poised to rub shoulders with their counterparts in the Titan basket, but have market caps below $1B. $POPCAT and $PNUT are two of the meme coins in this index. The Midcap Index, meanwhile, is where the risk factor is turned up a notch further. Tokens in this meme coin basket, among them $TURBO and $BOME, have considerable growth potential but, at the same time, are also prone to volatility. Then, there’s the Frenzy Index, which cranks up the heat with high-risk tokens that have potentially explosive rewards. Think $ZEREBRO, for instance. Being Degen territory, however, this index is not for the faint of heart. $MEMEX holders have the additional benefit of community governance, with ability to propose and vote on both the future of the project, as well as which meme coins are in the four indexes. To date, Meme Index has raised close to $3.4M, and 1 $MEMEX costs $0.0159077, with 687% staking rewards. It won’t stay that price for long, though, with a price increase set for less than two days.. 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – A Humor-centric Meme Coin With Lots Of Potential When the market takes a tumble, as it recently has, no one would be blamed for having a good cry. However, a good laugh thanks to Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is another alternative, one that could well pay off in the long term. The premise of Fartcoin is simple – initial tokens could be claimed by submitting fart jokes and memes. Launched in late 2024 on the Solana blockchain, $FARTCOIN also features a ‘Gas Fee’ system, with each transaction accompanied by a digital fart sound. As for utility? There is none. Yet after a CEX listing with a $978M market cap, and reaching the $1B market cap milestone in January, who are we to judge? Like the rest of the market, Fartcoin has been left bruised by the recent downturn. After an all-time high of $2.61 in mid-January, the price has since plummeted to $0.7015. But with the swings and roundabouts of the crypto market, we think $FARTCOIN could recover, with potential for, forgive the pun, explosive growth. 5. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – The Resilient Meme Coin New To Solana Technically speaking, Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) isn’t exactly new, having been on the Ethereum blockchain since 2021. But in December last year, in a move to extend its community and attract new investors, $PENGU launched on Solana. And it’s been (mostly) onwards and upwards ever since then. Pudgy Penguins is an NFT collection of 8,888 pudgy little cartoon characters – representing love, happiness, empathy, and compassion, among other emotions. But don’t let that ‘awwwww’ factor fool you – $PENGU packs a punch. To be fair, the recent downturn of the crypto market has been less than kind to our little penguin friend. Just under a month ago, for instance, Pudgy Penguins had a $2B+ market cap. That market cap has since dropped to a comparatively dismal $820M. But – and it’s a big but – $PENGU has historically been a strong performer, and we expect this resilient little meme coin to recover in due course. After an all-time high of $0.05738 in mid December, it hit an all-time low of $0.01015 two days ago. Right now, $PENGU is up +28.59% on that ATL, at $0.01298. And that price is an increase of 159.63% for the year, according to CoinMarketCap . In A Nutshell… The recent ‘trade wars’ have hit the crypto market hard. So it’s a relief that the GENIUS Act and other crypto-focused legislation is being formalized to the market’s benefit. And the current downturn is a good time to buy the dip. As for the best crypto presales , now’s the time to invest at a low private sale price before listing. But remember, it’s important to always DYOR before making any investment decision.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-05 14:08:18

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As hype around Trump and Melania’s coins fades, investors turn to Lightchain AI, which has raised $13.5m for its unique technology. Table of Contents Trump and Melania’s coins: Short-lived hype cycle Lightchain AI: Combining solutions with real-world applications Why Lightchain AI could be the next big thing In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, hype can drive interest, but creativity is what ensures longevity. Trump and Melania’s coins recently captured the crypto community’s attention with their celebrity-backed appeal. However, as the buzz begins to settle, investors are shifting their focus to projects with tangible use cases and long-term growth potential. One such project making waves is Lightchain AI, which has already raised $13.5 million during its presale phase at $0.00525 per token. While Trump and Melania’s coins thrived on cultural relevance, Lightchain AI is building a reputation for unique technology, positioning itself as a potential leader in the crypto space. You might also like: Lightchain AI and three other tokens under $0.50 capture investor attention Trump and Melania’s coins: Short-lived hype cycle In January 2025, Donald and Melania Trump launched their respective meme coins, TRUMP and MELANIA , which initially experienced significant market interest. TRUMP’s market capitalization briefly exceeded $10 billion, while MELANIA reached over $9 billion. However, both coins have since seen substantial declines in value, with TRUMP decreasing by approximately 50% and MELANIA experiencing a similar downturn. Critics have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given the Trumps’ political positions and the speculative nature of these assets. The volatility and lack of clear use cases underscore perceptions that these coins are driven more by hype than by tangible value. Lightchain AI: Combining solutions with real-world applications Lightchain AI offers more than just hype — it’s a platform designed to change how blockchain and artificial intelligence interact. Lightchain AI (LCAI) employs a deflationary tokenomics model to enhance the value of its ecosystem. A portion of transaction fees and payments for AI tasks are systematically burned, permanently removing these tokens from circulation. This reduction in supply creates scarcity, which can potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens over time. By providing a framework that supports efficient, scalable AI operations, Lightchain AI addresses some of the most pressing challenges in blockchain and AI integration. This unique positioning sets it apart as a project with long-term viability. Why Lightchain AI could be the next big thing As investors grow weary of hype-driven projects, Lightchain AI offers a compelling alternative with its focus on utility, scalability, and solutions. The platform’s ability to attract significant interest during its presale phase highlights its appeal among those seeking more than short-term gains. While Trump and Melania’s coins captured the spotlight for their branding, Lightchain AI’s commitment to technological advancement ensures it has the foundation to become a lasting sensation. For investors looking to capitalize on the next big opportunity, Lightchain AI could be the project that delivers both excitement and enduring value. For those ready to move beyond fleeting trends, Lightchain AI offers the potential to be part of a transformative movement in blockchain and AI. Its rise signals a new era of crypto projects that balance hype with meaningful impact. For more information on Lightchain AI, visit the website , X , or Telegram .

While most coins have been volatile this month, they will likely rebound later this month. A strong Bitcoin breakout, trade deals between the US and its key partners, and spot ETF approvals are potential catalysts. Let’s explore some of the best altcoins to watch for big gains. Best Altcoins to Watch For Big Gains Some of the top crypto to watch for big gains are Ondo, Ethena, Polkadot, Mantra, and Solana Ondo Finance (ONDO): Key Player in the Tokenization Industry ONDO is one of the top altcoins to watch because of its positioning in the real-world asset tokenization industry. The key reason why the ONDO price will surge is that US interest rates will remain higher for longer, attracting more investors to money market funds. This explains why ONDO’s total value locked has jumped near a record high of $652 million. Analysts are optimistic that tokenization will be a big thing. Larry Fink, the head of Blackrock, has asked the SEC to approve tokenized stocks and bonds in America. Ondo TVL Ethena (ENA): Forms a Falling Wedge Pattern Ethena is another top crypto to watch as it remains about 55% below its highest level this year. This drop may make it a bargain in the next crypto bull run. ENA has two main catalysts. First, it is a core part of Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial portfolio , a notable thing now that he has become the president Ethena is also seeing traction in its USDe stablecoin, which has achieved a $6.1 billion valuation, making it one of the biggest players in the industry. It has also formed a falling wedge pattern, pointing to more upside in the near term. Ethena Price Polkadot (DOT): In Accumulation Mode Polkadot is one of the top altcoins to watch as it remains in an accumulation phase. It has held steady inside the key support at $3.70 and the resistance at $11.65 in the past few years. Polkadot is preparing a major network upgrade this year that will introduce features like EVM and a speed increase. This transition will make it attract more developers to the ecosystem, which may boost its price. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $29.78, the 50% retracement point that is 380% above the current level. Polkadot Price Mantra (OM): Potential King of Tokenization Mantra has become one of the best-performing altcoins, surging from $0.0050 in 2023 to almost $6 today. This rally may continue as it establishes itself as the best network for the RWA industry. MantraChain, the recently launched layer-1 network has already seen demand from companies seeking to tokenize their assets. It recently partnered with DAMAC , a top real estate company in Dubai. There are odds that the Mantra price will surge to $10 this cycle. Solana (OM): Biggest Ethereum Competitor Solana is one of the best altcoins to watch because of its role in the crypto industry, where it has become the biggest alternative to Ethereum. SOL has strong fundamentals, as evidenced by the growth of its meme coins and DEX volume. It also has strong technicals after forming a cup and handle pattern. This means that Solana price may surge from $200 to $500 .

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York alleges that Andean Medjedovic, 22, exploited vulnerabilities in the KyberSwap code in 2023. Prosecutors say he employed hundreds of millions of dollars in borrowed crypto to generate artificial prices in the protocol’s liquidity pools (LPs). Medjedovic then allegedly caused what he called a “glitch” in KyberSwap’s automated market maker (AMM) by executing a specific combination of trades, which enabled him to drain $48.8 million in crypto from 77 LPs on six public blockchains. The Canadian national then allegedly attempted to extort KyberSwap developers, demanding control of the protocol and its associated decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in exchange for 50% of the stolen crypto. Prosecutors accuse Medjedovic, who remains at large, of attempting to launder the looted crypto through bridge protocols and a digital asset mixer. He also allegedly exploited liquidity pools from a different DeFi protocol, Indexed Finance, back in 2021, plundering $16.5 million. The indictment, which was unsealed on Monday in a federal court in Brooklyn, charges Medjedovic with wire fraud, computer hacking and attempted extortion.

The legislation seeks to establish straightforward licensing standards, ensure consumer protection, and support financial innovation in crypto. Establishing a Regulatory Framework Known as the GENIUS Act , short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, the bill was introduced by three Republican Senators, Bill Hagerty, Tom Scott, and Cynthia Lummis, and one Democratic legislator, Kirsten Gillibrand. It defines stablecoins as digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar and sets licensing and reserve requirements for issuers. The proposed law also applies different oversight mechanisms based on the size of the stablecoin issuer. For example, companies with more than $10 billion worth of assets in circulation will be required to follow Federal Reserve regulations. This is expected to mainly affect Tether and Circle, whose respective stablecoins, USDT and USDC, boast market caps of $140 billion and $55.1 billion in that order. Those below the $10 billion threshold, including Ethena USDe, DAI, and the recently introduced Ripple USD, will be allowed to operate under state-level rules. However, the document also provides mechanisms for a waiver process to allow issuers exceeding the limit to remain state-regulated. According to Senator Hagerty, the GENIUS Act will create an environment enabling growth and innovation and help fulfill President Donald Trump’s bold promise to make the United States the global center of crypto. “My legislation establishes a safe and pro-growth regulatory framework that will unleash innovation and advance the President’s mission to make America the world capital of crypto.” Reacting to the bill, Tim Scott, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, highlighted the importance of stablecoins in modern finance, noting their role in facilitating quick and inexpensive transactions. He also stressed that it will promote financial inclusion while ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the crypto sector. Stablecoin Adoption to Increase With a combined market cap just north of $227 billion, stablecoins represent about 1% of the United State’s money supply and FX operations. However, a report from last year suggested they could enjoy significant growth of up to 10 times their current value to the U.S. economy. Additionally, a researcher at Delphi Digital recently predicted that such assets will evolve beyond their role in decentralized finance (DeFi) to become more mainstream mediums of exchange. Compared to other digital currencies, their relative stability makes them better suited for daily transactions and long-term value storage.

Polkadot ( DOT ) dropped to a low of $3.53 this week, erasing all gains made since September last year. Two potential catalysts may push the coin higher in the coming months. First, developers will launch the Polkadot 2.0 upgrade, expected to be the most significant update since its inception in 2016. Polkadot 2.0 will follow the recent introduction of asynchronous backing, which accelerated transaction confirmation time and capacity. The upgrade will introduce two key features: agile coretime and elastic scaling. Agile coretime simplifies developer onboarding by providing on-demand access to affordable blockspace, similar to parallel CPUs. Elastic scaling will refine Polkadot’s core structure, enabling parachains to increase block production and transaction capacity. Polkadot will also introduce the Joint-Accumulate Machine,which will replace the relay chain. JAM will function as a rollup chain, operating transactionlessly by focusing on guarantees, assurances, judgments, preimages, and tickets. According to Polkadot, this launch is expected in early 2025. A key benefit is that developers will be able to build on Polkadot similarly to Ethereum. The current version of Polkadot requires parachain developers to go through an auction process, which has discouraged adoption.

The weekly chart shows that DOT has remained in a tight range since 2022, struggling to break below the $3.53 support level or above the $11.85 resistance. This price action may indicate accumulation by institutional investors. The accumulation and distribution indicator has been rising recently, reinforcing this possibility. DOT has also formed a triple-bottom pattern with a neckline at $11.85, a commonly recognized bullish reversal pattern. Therefore, DOT is likely to stage a strong comeback, with a key target at $30—the 50% Fibonacci retracement level—representing a potential 500% surge from current levels. A rally to this level will be confirmed if the price breaks above the 23.6% retracement at $11.85 and the 38.2% retracement at $23.38.

Can Mind of Pepe Become a Winner in 2025?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/holding-the-wrong-ai-crypto-could-end-in-disaster-can-mind-of-pepe-become-a-winner-in-2025/,"Marc Chaikin is a legendary figure on Wall Street, renowned for spotting market trends before they unfold. His insights have accurately predicted major downturns, including the 2012 Priceline collapse, the COVID-19 market crash, and the recent banking crisis. When Chaikin speaks, Wall Street pays attention. This time, he’s sounding the alarm on the AI frenzy sweeping the U.S. stock market. According to Chaikin, investors holding the wrong AI stocks risk devastating financial losses. He stated, “If you’re holding Nvidia (NVDA) or FAANG right now, it’s time to prepare for a massive shift.” However, Chaikin believes there’s still a lot of money to be made in AI stocks, but only the right ones. Unlike before, picking a random trending stock won’t make you a millionaire. The markets are tough, and only accurate stock picking is the key to success. The Growing AI Demand The demand for AI tech and products is growing by the minute. Companies like Palantir Technologies have benefited hugely from this. The stock is up by more than 60% since mid-January. This comes after a huge 340% increase in stock prices in 2024. This surge in prices is backed by a strong 36% year-on-year revenue growth, which now stands at $828M. Alex Karp, Palantir CEO, credits the ‘untamed’ growth of demand in its AI software for the surge. The company now expects to increase revenue by another 54% in 2025. As you can see, picking the right AI stocks is the need of the hour. However, doing so can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Even then, the probability of the stock making you money is less, given the choppy waters in which AI stocks find themselves. This is where AI agents like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) come in. What Is $MIND? MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is an autonomous AI agent that cuts through the information overload floating around about the crypto market and produces actionable insights through hive-mind analysis. What this means is that $MIND can interact with influencers and shape conversations and discussions on platforms like X. In the process, it forms a view of its own to produce triggers for all token holders. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this self-evolving AI agent helps investors identify early opportunities in the market by processing information in real time. The problem with crypto investing is that there’s too much information, all of which may or may not be factual. By the time a human can process this information barrage, the opportunity is long gone. $MIND , on the other hand, uses only real-time information (as fresh as a few seconds ago) to form a view of the markets. This adds to your trading efficiency by cutting down on data deviations. Why Can $MIND Be the Next Big AI Token? MIND of Pepe not only looks to take forward the legendary frog meme legacy but also adds real-time utility for all crypto investors. What would investors love more than regular early-opportunity investment ideas in a dicey AI stock market? Plus, $MIND developers have laid out a long-term vision for the project. Out of a total supply of 100B $MIND tokens, 30% has been reserved for innovation and AI agent updates, while 25% has been kept to support the AI agent ecosystem growth. Early $MIND investors can also earn 443% APY staking rewards – 15% of the token supply has been kept for staking and community incentives. No wonder experts believe $MIND can help investors make crazy gains in this bull run . The $MIND presale is currently live, with the project having already raised $5.1M so far. It’s, in fact, one of the best crypto presales going around right now. Available at a price of just $0.0032662 per token, the next price increase will happen in less than 2 days. This means this is the perfect time to buy the best AI agent coin . Simply visit the official $MIND presale page and connect your wallet. You can buy it with ETH, BNB, or USDT or use your card directly to complete the payment. However, it’s important to remember that crypto markets are subject to volatility and news-based risks.

The framework aims to provide a legally compliant method for property owners to tokenize economic rights tied to real estate while retaining full ownership, according to a note shared with crypto.news. Tokenization converts assets , like real estate, into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents a share of the property’s economic value, such as rental income or resale profits. You might also like: Exclusive: Layer-1 data network Flare teams up with Google Cloud for AI hackathon Property tokens using physical property as collateral Under the new framework, Blocksquare SARL issues Blocksquare Property Tokens for each tokenized property. The property owner acquires these tokens through a structured borrowing process, using the property as collateral. A notary formalizes the transaction, and investors can later purchase BSPTs to gain a stake in the property’s financial returns. These tokens can also be traded on secondary markets, increasing liquidity in the real estate sector. Blocksquare ensures these transactions comply with EU regulations by securing agreements with notaries and aligning with land registry systems. Denis Petrovcic, CEO of Blocksquare, said the initiative removes legal uncertainty in tokenized real estate. The company’s framework follows the same legal structures banks use to secure real estate-backed loans. Luxembourg’s financial regulations, particularly MiCA , provide a secure foundation for the framework. Blocksquare SARL offers investors fractional ownership, the ability to trade tokens, and legal protection. Property owners benefit from access to global capital without giving up control. Blocksquare previously completed a notarized tokenized real estate deal in Slovenia. The company plans pilot projects in Belgium and Austria, with future expansion into Germany, Poland, and France to attract institutional investors and large-scale real estate firms.

The Fed, which cut interest rates by 50 bp in September and 25 bp in November and December, left interest rates unchanged in January and paused the rate-cutting cycle. While this raises the question of whether interest rate cuts are over, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said in an interview that the Fed is still inclined to cut interest rates this year. Speaking to Bloomberg, Barkin said that while the Fed left interest rates steady in January, it is still inclined to cut rates and that he sees no signs right now that the economy is overheating. Barkin said he still thinks the policy rate is moderately restrictive, and added that the Fed needs more time to understand where the US economy and inflation are headed amid increasing uncertainty about President Donald Trump's policies. “It is difficult to know the impact of customs duties and what tariffs will come in the future. The uncertainty extends beyond tariffs to immigration, regulations and other issues. Many of Trump's policies increase uncertainty in the economy. I predict that consumer spending will increase and investments will decrease in 2025. I expect the 12-month inflation figures to decline nicely. I am in favor of interest rate cuts again this year. It does not take any policy moves off the table, but rate hikes require the economy to overheat. I see no signs that the US economy is overheating. Prejudice is seeing what will happen and reacting accordingly. I think the policy rate is still reasonably restrictive. “We've recalibrated to a place that makes more sense given the current state of the economy.” *This is not investment advice.

The merger became possible thanks to BitcoinOS (BOS) – a scalable smart contract operating system designed to enhance Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling developers to build interoperable rollups, dApps, and DAOs directly on the Bitcoin network. The Breakthrough Integration Following the initiative, Arbitrum will provide a robust scaling solution merging the best of both leading networks. Moreover, it will allow additional options for Bitcoin holders to interact with Ethereum-based L2s instead of relying solely on Bitcoin-native scaling solutions. BOS will enable a secure way to bridge BTC to Arbitrum One. By leveraging BitSNARK and the BOS Grail bridge, BTC transfers will be non-custodial and significantly reduce counterparty risk compared to existing market solutions. Arbitrum One will also enhance scalability and liquidity by combining Bitcoin’s strong security with Ethereum’s DeFi, dApp, and smart contract capabilities. This integration is expected to further increase Arbitrum One’s total value locked (TVL), while creating new opportunities for developers to build innovative Bitcoin-based DeFi products. As a leading Ethereum L2 scaling solution, Arbitrum has drawn major DeFi protocols and offered a key alternative for users as they continue to migrate from L1. The integration with BOS will allow it to bring these same scalability benefits to Bitcoin alongside the programmability that its base layer lacks. Despite being regarded as the most secure blockchain, Bitcoin lacks smart contract capabilities, preventing its $2T liquidity from being used in DeFi and dApps, which Ethereum pioneered. To bridge this gap, Bitcoin holders have turned to Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), with over 129,000 BTC ($12.9B) moved to Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, despite concerns over centralization risks. ‘Arbitrum is Pioneering a Paradigm Shift’ One person commenting on the aforementioned initiative was Nina Rong, Head of Partnerships at Arbitrum Foundation. She believes BitcoinOS’s integration with Arbitrum demonstrates how technology can support innovative Bitcoin ecosystem expansion. “This collaboration showcases Arbitrum’s ability to enable trustless bridging and programmability for Bitcoin while maintaining the network’s core security principles. We’re excited to see BitcoinOS leverage our network to unlock the massive $2 trillion Bitcoin liquidity pool for DeFi and smart contract applications,” she added. Edan Yago, core contributor to BitcoinOS, also gave his two cents.

People in the US could face hefty fines or even jail time if they use the Chinese AI app DeepSeek. The bill , named the ‘ Decoupling America’s Artificial Intelligence Capabilities from China Act’ , does not explicitly reference the Chinese AI firm DeepSeek but seeks to safeguard US intellectual property and restrict foreign competitors from accessing potentially sensitive technology. A few days ago, the Chinese chatbot became the most popular AI app in America, which led to a crash in US tech stocks. The bill prohibits Americans from trading AI technology with China In the event the bill is signed into law, Americans will be barred from importing or exporting AI tech to and from China. It would also stop US companies from conducting AI research in China or teaming up with Chinese companies for AI. It would also prevent US companies from investing in the development of AI in China. The punishment for an individual would be imprisonment for up to 20 years and a fine of up to $1 million, while for businesses, the fine could be as high as $100 million. In addition, violators would be required to cease to hold any “license, contract, subcontract, grant or public benefit awarded by any Federal agency.” In a news release, Hawley said that every dollar and gig of data that goes into Chinese AI will be used against the US. He added: America cannot afford to empower our greatest adversary at the expense of our own strength. Ensuring American economic superiority means cutting China off from American ingenuity and halting the subsidization of CCP innovation. – Josh Hawley DeepSeek’s rise sparks global privacy concerns and regulatory actions The rise of DeepSeek AI has ignited global data privacy concerns. Italy banned the AI chatbot after deeming its data protection measures “insufficient.” Other regulators have followed Italy’s lead, demanding DeepSeek developers submit their data practices. According to its privacy policy, DeepSeek is a shared cloud service hosted and stored in China. Bill Conner, chief executive of automation firm Jitterbit and former security advisor to the US government, says this could potentially introduce unknown risks to data privacy, compliance mandates, and security controls. While the bill claims to protect US interests, not everyone agrees with its approach. Ben Brooks, a fellow at Harvard’s AI Research, said the bill would “kill open-source.” Brooks, who also served as the head of public policy for Stability AI, continued to describe the bill as the “most aggressive legislative action on AI.” He added that the bill would set back US research and decouple the rest of the world from the US. The creator of the AI chatbot Truth Terminal, Andy Ayrey, shared similar concerns. He pointed out that the bill would ‘slow Western progress in AI’ than it would hurt competitors. He proposed that a better way forward would be to release open-source model weights and datasets with cooperative and democratic values infused in them so they can organically shape international AI development. Several states have also indicated they are considering a DeepSeek ban, with Texas becoming the first to enforce restrictions on government devices. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the state will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate its critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps.

The bank expects this price surge due to a more favorable regulatory environment and increased access to Bitcoin. Notably, it forecasts Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025, and then steadily rise to $300,000 in 2026, $400,000 in 2027, and finally hit $500,000 in 2028, before stabilizing the following year. Bitcoin is currently priced at $98,600, up 43% from $68,800 before Trump’s November election win. Standard Chartered prediction of $500,000 could mean a 407% increase from the current position. At that price, Bitcoin’s market cap would possibly hit $10.5 trillion, surpassing Apple and Microsoft, and account for about half of gold’s $19.4 trillion market cap. Standard Chartered sees significant growth potential for Bitcoin, largely due to the increased investor access following the introduction of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January 2024.

In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post , Hyland referenced U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats , which have shaken global markets and triggered a crypto sell-off , particularly in altcoins. Key Factors Affecting Altcoin Recovery: Trade war fears leading to investor caution Increased market liquidations after economic uncertainty Historical patterns suggest a 2+ month recovery period Hyland advises investors to “keep expectations tempered” and anticipate a gradual market recovery similar to 2020 and 2022 market disruptions . Why Are Altcoins Struggling? 1. U.S.-China Trade War Fears Impacting Crypto Sentiment Trump’s tariff threats have led to mass liquidations . Investors are risk-averse , leading to declining altcoin prices . 2. Bitcoin Dominance Is Limiting Altcoin Growth BTC ETFs are attracting most institutional funds . Altcoin dominance remains weak , delaying potential rallies. 3. Market Cycles Suggest a Delayed Recovery In 2020 and 2022 , similar economic disruptions took over two months to stabilize. A full altcoin rally could take time , making April the earliest expected recovery period. Will Altcoins Rally by April? Bullish Scenario: If macroeconomic fears ease , altcoins may recover faster . Bitcoin price stabilization could lead to an altcoin rotation . Increased adoption of Layer 1 and DeFi projects could drive altcoin demand . Bearish Risks: Continued economic uncertainty may keep investors away from altcoins . If Bitcoin dominance remains high , capital may stay in BTC instead of alts . Further regulatory risks could slow down an altcoin resurgence . Conclusion Matthew Hyland’s forecast suggests that altcoins will struggle in the short term due to economic fears and market liquidations . While a recovery is expected, the timeline may extend until April 2025 or later.

This confirms that the market remains in Bitcoin Season , as altcoins continue to underperform BTC over the last 90 days. Altcoin Season Index Breakdown: Altcoin Season (Above 75): 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins must outperform Bitcoin . Bitcoin Season (Below 25): 25% or fewer of altcoins outperform BTC, strengthening Bitcoin’s dominance. Current Index at 38: The market is Bitcoin-dominated , but not at extreme levels. With altcoins struggling to gain traction , Bitcoin continues to dictate market trends . Why Is Bitcoin Season Continuing? 1. Bitcoin ETFs Attract Institutional Investors Spot Bitcoin ETFs are absorbing most institutional capital , reducing demand for altcoins. Bitcoin dominance remains strong , preventing an altcoin breakout. 2. Macroeconomic Uncertainty Keeping Investors Cautious U.S.-China trade tensions and global economic concerns are making investors risk-averse. Traders are sticking to BTC as a safe-haven asset , avoiding riskier altcoins. 3. Market Cycles Favor Bitcoin Before Altcoin Rallies Historically, altcoin seasons follow Bitcoin’s major price moves . If BTC stabilizes or retraces, capital may rotate into altcoins . Will Altcoin Season Return Soon? Bullish Case: If Bitcoin price consolidates , capital could flow into altcoins . Upcoming Ethereum upgrades (like Dencun ) may boost ETH and DeFi projects . Layer 1 and AI tokens could drive new altcoin narratives . Bearish Case: Continued Bitcoin dominance may delay altcoin breakouts . Macroeconomic instability could keep investors risk-averse. If altcoins fail to show strong performance , Bitcoin Season may extend further .

The companies will operate under Textile's brand and retain their staff and data infrastructure- focused product lines. Textile CEO Andrew Hill will head the merged organization. Self-described ""friendly competitors,"" Textile and 3Box Labs raised funds from the same VC firms and offered overlapping products, 3Box Labs co-founder Michael Sena said. Between them, the companies have raised at least $42 million since 2019. ""We came to the conclusion that the future we're building toward is an identical one,"" he said in an interview. That future is one where people, companies and, especially, AI agents lean on permissionless blockchain rails for data storage, access and verification. Cheap and accessible data storage is a common tech pain point that some proponents of crypto say tokenized economies can improve. AI's precipitous rise is putting an even greater spotlight on the subsector, as Textile sees it. Agents — artificial intelligence-powered bots that can make decisions and take actions in pursuit of a goal — are one of crypto's big new infatuations, with potential for trading and more. All those agents will need data to feed their decisions, however. That's where the newly joined Textile sees its opening. It will build what a press release called ""the intelligence layer for the multi-agent economy."" ""It's pretty clear that our sweet spot of expertise — how to move, store, share verifiable data on crypto rails — is becoming very relevant to agent builders,"" said Hill. He said blockchains offer a natural platform for agents to operate: They speak the ""lingua franca"" of this tech-driven world. Textile is building a blockchain network atop which agents can interact, access data and even sell alpha amongst themselves. Of course, the crypto industry's AI minds haven't yet figured out what agents are best-suited to do. Many builders are trying out many different things. Momentum is high, though, Hill said, and progress is coming fast.",Finance,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-05 16:00:00

Choosing the top crypto wallet in 2025 means finding a balance between usability, security, and access to a broad range of assets. This year, Plus Wallet, Exodus, Coinbase Wallet, and Crypto.com Wallet lead the way, offering unique advantages for traders, investors, and DeFi users. From reward-driven models to hardware integration and cross-chain functionality, these wallets redefine how cryptocurrencies are stored, traded, and used. Here’s a look at 2025’s top crypto wallets and why they stand out in today’s digital economy. 1. Plus Wallet: A Mobile Wallet That Rewards Traders & Gives Them Control Many wallets focus solely on storage, but Plus Wallet redefines what a crypto wallet can be. Designed for mobile-first users, it streamlines asset management on iOS and Android, ensuring fast and effortless transactions. The on-off ramp feature makes buying and selling crypto seamless, while cross-chain swapping allows users to trade assets between blockchains without relying on external exchanges. What truly sets Plus Wallet apart is its built-in rewards system—users earn USDT simply by swapping crypto, and referrals generate ongoing USDT commissions. Unlike short-term promotions, these features provide consistent value, making Plus Wallet the top crypto wallet in 2025 for active traders. Unlike traditional wallets, Plus Wallet evolves based on community feedback. Users influence the wallet’s roadmap by voting on blockchain integrations, token listings, and feature rollouts, ensuring the app adapts to their needs. Security remains a priority, with local private key storage, advanced encryption, and multi-layer authentication keeping assets safe. By combining convenience, rewards, and user-driven innovation, Plus Wallet stands above the competition. Its blend of efficiency and passive earning opportunities cements its place as the top crypto wallet in 2025 for those who want more than just a storage solution. 2. Exodus Wallet: Crypto Management Across Devices Exodus remains one of 2025’s top crypto wallets, offering a seamless experience to users who want a straightforward yet powerful way to manage digital assets. Its user-friendly interface makes it an excellent choice for beginners, while advanced features like live price tracking and an integrated exchange cater to more experienced traders. Supporting 300+ cryptocurrencies, Exodus enables smooth transactions across mobile, desktop, and browser extensions. Though it primarily functions as a hot wallet, users can enhance security by integrating it with Trezor hardware wallets. However, its closed-source nature may be a drawback for those who prefer fully auditable, open-source solutions. 3. Coinbase Wallet: Secure and User-Friendly With support for thousands of digital assets, Coinbase Wallet is a go-to choice for traders looking for flexibility and security. This self-custody hot wallet allows users to interact with DeFi applications, send and receive crypto, and seamlessly transfer funds—all without needing a Coinbase exchange account. For those prioritising extra security, Ledger hardware integration makes cold storage accessible. As one of the top crypto wallets in 2025, it offers an easy-to-use mobile interface, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced users. However, its lack of desktop support and limited open-source visibility may be concerns for those prioritising full transparency. 4. Crypto.com Wallet: A Strong Option for DeFi & NFTs For those deeply involved in DeFi, Crypto.com Wallet stands out as a feature-rich option. Offering both custodial and non-custodial storage, users can choose how they manage their digital assets. The wallet supports 1,000+ cryptocurrencies and enables seamless swaps across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Cosmos, and Cronos. It also integrates NFT storage and transfers, making it a versatile tool for crypto enthusiasts. With robust security measures like two-factor authentication and biometric login, it balances convenience with protection. As a top crypto wallet in 2025, Crypto.com Wallet is an excellent choice for those seeking decentralised finance tools and cross-chain compatibility. Last Words on Top Crypto Wallets of 2025 Each of these top crypto wallets of 2025 brings something unique to the table. Exodus Wallet offers a smooth multi-device experience, Coinbase Wallet provides access to thousands of assets with DeFi compatibility, and Crypto.com Wallet excels in DeFi and NFT management. However, Plus Wallet takes it to the next level with its USDT rewards, cross-chain swaps, and user-driven model. Designed for iOS and Android, it combines convenience, security, and earning potential in one powerful app. For those looking to go beyond simple crypto storage, start using Plus Wallet today and experience the top crypto wallet of 2025 firsthand.

How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Against Major Cryptos Cardano (ADA, $0.30): Cardano has built a reputation for steady development but lacks the momentum seen in new projects like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN, which promises faster adoption and potentially higher value growth. SEI ($0.12): SEI shows promise in the DeFi space but has struggled with slower adoption rates. THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a faster trajectory, making it an appealing choice for investors seeking transformative opportunities.

While Ethereum (ETH) moves toward a possible $20K surge, several other projects are making waves. Many traders are looking to ride the bullish momentum, and the current market conditions seem ideal. Choosing projects with strong use cases, promising features, and growing popularity could lead to massive gains. This article highlights 5 top bullish cryptos that stand out this month due to their unique strengths, expanding communities, and exciting potential. Whether you’re experienced in crypto or just starting, these projects offer great opportunities. Let’s explore Wall Street Pepe, MIND of Pepe, Web3Bay, Fartcoin, and Meme Index to understand what makes them key picks for February. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe isn’t just another meme coin—it’s designed to support everyday crypto traders. $WEPE gives users exclusive market insights, trading signals, and strategies, helping them compete with major market players. The ongoing presale is performing exceptionally well, nearing its $60 million goal with only 23 days left. Due to high demand, there’s a chance the presale could end earlier than expected. Currently priced at $0.0003665, it presents an entry point before its launch on major exchanges. More than just a meme coin, Wall Street Pepe equips its community with knowledge and tools, blending usefulness with a fun approach. With increasing attention, $WEPE is one of the top bullish cryptos this month. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) MIND of Pepe is a next-level meme coin that merges artificial intelligence into its ecosystem. Instead of being just another digital asset, $MIND works as a self-learning AI tool that collects market trends, interacts with key figures, and provides users with real-time insights. The AI-powered project quickly caught attention, raising $1.8 million within 48 hours of its presale launch. At $0.0031889 per unit, $MIND is expected to gain further value as its adoption grows. Additionally, users get early access to promising meme coin launches, giving them an extra edge. For those interested in a mix of fun and cutting-edge AI, MIND of Pepe brings a fresh perspective to meme coins. Its AI-driven approach makes it a stand out in the top bullish cryptos list. 3. Web3Bay ($3BAY) Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping with its decentralized marketplace powered by blockchain. Unlike traditional platforms that rely on middlemen, Web3Bay enables users to have full control over their transactions, ensuring lower fees and higher transparency. Its presale has already gained traction, with over $1 million raised and 280 million coins sold at $0.004562 each. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, the potential 6,430% ROI makes it an exciting project. Web3Bay includes smart contracts, Layer-2 scaling for fast transactions, and plans for an NFT marketplace. With a rapidly growing user base and an upcoming decentralized governance model, Web3Bay is more than just a crypto—it’s a movement. It remains a top bullish crypto for February. 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) Fartcoin may have a playful name, but its results speak for themselves. Built on Solana, it offers lightning-fast transactions and extremely low fees, making it efficient and practical. One of its standout features is its humor-based community, where holders can submit jokes and memes to earn extra $FARTCOIN. Since its debut last October, it has delivered an impressive 47,000% return to early adopters. Although it has dropped from its peak of $2.70, its current price of $1.18 provides an opportunity to enter before the next rally. As the market picks up, Fartcoin could see another major run, securing its place among the top bullish cryptos for 2025. 5. Meme Index ($MEMEX) Meme Index introduces an easy way to navigate the meme coin space. Instead of holding multiple coins, users can gain exposure to different meme projects through structured index baskets. The platform offers four different categories, from low-risk Meme Titan, which holds established meme coins, to high-risk Meme Frenzy, focused on newer, high-growth options. This structured approach simplifies diversification and has attracted strong interest, with $3 million already raised in presale. Priced at $0.0155312, $MEMEX also offers an 801% staking reward, giving early users additional incentives. For those looking for a controlled and balanced way to explore meme coins, Meme Index is a strong choice among the top bullish cryptos for February. Wrapping Up— 2025’s Top Bullish Cryptos! The crypto market is presenting exciting prospects, and February 2025 is proving to be a great time to explore high-potential projects. Whether it’s Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce system or Fartcoin’s unique community model, each coin brings something valuable. Web3Bay stands out for its real-world utility, strong presale numbers, and projected high ROI. Meanwhile, Wall Street Pepe, MIND of Pepe, Meme Index, and Fartcoin offer different advantages based on their technology, community, or market approach.

However, things are still looking more positive for ADA, compared to ETH. By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart Against USDT, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating between $1.2 and $0.8 over the past few months, forming a large descending channel pattern. However, it broke down to the downside during the crypto market crash led by Ethereum, and ADA’s price briefly traded below its 200-day moving average, located around the $0.6 mark, before rebounding higher. Currently, the price is trying to hold above the $0.8 support level, which would be vital if a bullish shift is bound to occur soon. Source: TradingView The BTC Paired Chart The ADA/BTC chart shows a somewhat similar picture to that of the USDT-paired one. However, ADA is weaker than BTC. The market has lost a key support level at 900 SAT and is now testing the 200-day moving average, which is located around the 750 SAT level. In case of a breakdown, a deeper drop toward the 500 SAT area would be imminent. However, as the RSI is showing a clear oversold signal, a pullback toward the 900 SAT level looks more likely at the moment.

Table of Contents Solana ecosystem metrics and growth XRP ecosystem updates, lawsuit and Trump effect Solana and XRP derivatives and on-chain analysis SOL and XRP technical analysis and price targets Expert commentary on Solana meme coins and XRP, Solana ETFs Solana ecosystem metrics and growth On-chain metrics tracking the activity, participation, and relevance of the Solana blockchain among traders show a decline across all three factors. The 7-day moving average of active addresses on the network is trending downward, as seen in the chart below. A reduction in active addresses signals declining user engagement, which could negatively impact fees collected and overall protocol revenue. Number of active addresses on the Solana network | Source: TheBlock The number of new addresses is also in decline, indicating reduced participation from traders. Combined with a drop in the total value of assets locked, this highlights Solana’s struggle to maintain relevance and compete with other blockchains. Number of new addresses on Solana | Source: TheBlock DeFiLlama data shows that Solana’s TVL has dropped nearly 16% from its January 20 peak of $12.1 billion to $10.227 billion. TVL is considered a key indicator of investor and developer interest in a blockchain. Despite the decline, SOL’s TVL remains above the average level observed in 2024. Total value of tokens locked on Solana | Source: DefiLlama Santiment data shows a steady decline in open interest and volume, while funding rates fluctuate between negative and positive. This suggests derivatives traders remain undecided on Solana’s price direction, even as SOL experiences a sharp drop.

This decline is largely attributed to a broader market correction, with Bitcoin’s drop dragging altcoins lower amid concerns over inflationary pressures. President Trump announced new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, fueling fears of rising inflation while the U.S. Federal Reserve remains hesitant to cut interest rates in 2025. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Stuart Alderoty, expressed confidence in the new administration under Trump and expects a resolution to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple. Throughout the former administration's War on Crypto, Commissioner Peirce remained a steady voice for regulatory sanity. Today's memo is another rapid step toward turning the page on the mess we all inherited (and suffered through). https://t.co/IqdmefhgyX — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) February 4, 2025 CTO Alderoty is optimistic that Trump’s new crypto task force lead SEC’s Hester Peirce, could pave the way for positive regulation. This could help resolve the conflict between the U.S. financial regulator and the cross-border payment firm Ripple. As traders digest the news of the trade war, XRP price outlook remains negative, as it does for the rest of the altcoins in the top 30 tokens ranked by market capitalization. Solana and XRP derivatives and on-chain analysis Derivatives data from Coinglass shows that over $332 million in crypto derivatives were liquidated in the past 24 hours. More than $11 million in Solana derivatives positions were wiped out, with bullish bets suffering the most compared to bearish positions. Solana derivatives data analysis | Source: Coinglass XRP also saw a significant increase in options volume and open interest, reflecting the net value of all outstanding derivatives contracts. According to Coinglass data, over $14 million in derivatives positions were liquidated amid the market-wide correction. XRP derivatives data analysis | Source: Coinglass On-chain data for XRP mirrors Solana’s trends, with total open interest and traded volume declining over the past week. This is reflected in the spot market, where XRP prices continue to drop. Funding rates have remained negative for two consecutive days, suggesting derivatives traders are turning increasingly bearish.

SOL could find support in the two imbalance zones between $190.11 and $198.47 and $169.39 to $185.84, as seen on the daily price chart on Binance. Solana faces resistance at $218.90, the lower boundary of the imbalance zone in the chart below. Technical indicators such as the relative strength index and moving average convergence/divergence support a bearish outlook. The RSI is sloping downward at 42, while the MACD displays red histogram bars below the neutral line, signaling negative underlying momentum.

Technical indicators on the daily timeframe show similar bearish outlook as for Solana. RSI is sloping downwards and reads 38 and MACD shows negative underlying momentum in XRP price trend. XRP/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Expert commentary on Solana meme coins and XRP, Solana ETFs The meme coin ecosystem and its rapid growth catalyzed a rise in Solana’s market capitalization and its competition with Ethereum. Trump’s meme token launch on the Solana blockchain was one such strategic move that fueled further gains in the SOL ecosystem. Sharing his thoughts on meme coins and the Solana meme coin ecosystem, Tim Ogilvie, Global Head of Institutional at Kraken exchange told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “Meme coins transform cultural moments into tradable assets, allowing investors to engage and capitalize on trending narratives. Solana has emerged as the epicenter of the meme coin ecosystem, thanks to its high throughput and low transaction costs. While the long-term trajectory remains uncertain, meme coins have the potential to significantly expand crypto adoption by tapping into contemporary zeitgeist. Once individuals enter the space and experience it firsthand, they may explore other opportunities within crypto, potentially driving greater activity on Solana as well as other blockchain ecosystems.” Nick Forster, founder at Derive.xyz maintains optimism on altcoin ETF approvals in 2025. Forster told Crypto.news: “We’re seeing a number of active spot ETF filings for assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC) from major players like Bitwise and Grayscale. If the SEC approves these, it will signal greater legitimacy for the digital asset industry and trigger more capital inflows, potentially driving prices upward. Additionally, several US states, including Illinois, have announced plans for BTC reserves, which is a strong signal of political intent to accelerate crypto adoption. While these measures will take time to bear fruit, we believe they will contribute to a positive long-term trajectory for the sector, laying the groundwork for growth later in 2025.” Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Therefore, more downside could be expected in the coming weeks. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the price has been making lower highs and lows since getting rejected from the resistance at $4,000. Several support levels have been lost in the last few months, especially the 200-day moving average, located around the $3,000 mark. While the price has already dropped to the $2,200 support and rebounded, there is still the chance for the market to decline lower as long as the cryptocurrency remains below the 200-day moving average. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, the price has gradually declined inside a large falling wedge pattern. While the market broke the pattern to the downside on Monday, it recovered, reclaiming the $2,800 level. Yet, the RSI still shows values below 50%, indicating that the momentum is still bearish. Therefore, if the price does not break back above the $3,000 level soon, a deeper correction or a longer consolidation could be expected in the coming weeks. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Ethereum Open Interest As Ethereum’s price is in a steep downtrend, market participants wonder where the price will finally find support. Analyzing the futures market sentiment could provide helpful insights into this situation. This chart presents the Ethereum funding rates metric, which measures whether the buyers or the sellers are executing their orders aggressively (using market orders) on aggregate. Favourable funding rates indicate bullish sentiment, while negative values show bearish sentiment. As the chart suggests, the funding rates have dropped significantly following the recent crash. Judging by its current values, it is safe to say that the futures market is no longer overheated. However, without sufficient demand in the spot market, the market will not be able to recover any time soon.

The broader digital asset market followed suit, leading to one of the most significant sell-offs since the outbreak of Covid and the collapse of FTX. Specifically, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods. Canada and Mexico initially retaliated but have since reached deals to delay the imposition of U.S. tariffs, while China has announced its own tariffs against U.S. goods. The developments have increased global economic uncertainty and sent risk assets into a temporary free fall. As global economies wrestle with trade disputes, crypto markets face ripple effects in the form of price volatility, mining disruptions and regulatory challenges. But could these tensions also fuel the rise of decentralized finance? Let’s explore how tariff wars could shape the future of crypto. You're reading Crypto Long & Short , our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. BTC’s reaction to tariff announcement Market volatility: a double-edged sword Tariff wars create uncertainty in traditional markets, often driving investors toward alternative assets like bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies. During economic turbulence, crypto is sometimes seen as a “safe haven” similar to gold. However, even as institutional adoption of crypto grows, digital assets remain highly speculative. In the short term, the crypto market will be negatively impacted by increased volatility in global trade, with sudden surges or dips influenced by shifting trade policies — but over time, crypto will be less impacted than traditional finance. Mining disruptions Crypto mining relies heavily on specialized hardware, much of which is produced in countries like China. Tariffs on electronic components, semiconductors and mining rigs can drive up production costs and reduce profitability. Additionally, increased expenses could push smaller miners out of the market, potentially leading to greater centralization of mining power among major players with the resources to weather these financial storms. Regulatory uncertainty and compliance hurdles Tariff wars don’t just impact physical goods; they can also influence financial regulations. Governments engaged in tariff wars may use financial regulations as an additional tool to assert control. Increased scrutiny of international crypto transactions, exchanges and cross-border payments could lead to stricter compliance requirements. This, in turn, could slow adoption rates and make crypto less accessible, particularly in regions where trade restrictions are tightening. At the same time, heightened regulations may push some users deeper into decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which operate outside traditional banking systems. Shift towards decentralized finance (DeFi) As trade conflicts heighten distrust in traditional financial systems, decentralized finance (DeFi) may offer users a way to bypass some of the barriers imposed by tariffs and regulations. More users may turn to DeFi platforms for financial autonomy. DeFi applications allow for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, reducing reliance on traditional banking, which is often impacted by trade policies. If tariff wars continue to disrupt traditional trade channels, crypto-based financial solutions could see increased adoption. Conclusion While crypto is often seen as a hedge against economic instability, it is not immune to the effects of tariff wars. From increased volatility and mining costs, to regulatory shifts and the potential rise of DeFi, the trade conflicts of today could shape the digital economy of tomorrow. While crypto may face new hurdles in the short term, it will emerge stronger in the long term as global markets seek an alternative to traditional finance amidst global governments’ ongoing economic battles. Investors, miners and policymakers should keep a close eye on trade developments as they navigate the complex relationship between geopolitics and digital assets.",CoinDesk Indices|Crypto Long & Short|CoinDesk Indices|China|DeFi|Bitcoin Price|Trump|market volatility|Opinion,EN,0,0,MARKET|MINING|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-05 16:10:24

The analyst predicted that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 by 2028, before Donald Trump's term ends, citing a friendlier regulatory environment and increased investor access. The analyst also predicts that BTC will rise to $200,000 in 2025, $300,000 in 2026, and $400,000 in 2027. Kendrick added that the main drivers of Bitcoin’s rise include spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted $39 billion in inflows, and positive regulatory changes such as the repeal of SAB 121. “If Bitcoin volatility decreases and investor access increases, the price of Bitcoin could rise. “Further improvements in investor access have begun under the Trump administration.” *This is not investment advice.

While established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, history shows that underdog projects often deliver life-changing investment returns to early investors. In 2025, new cryptocurrency projects are emerging, blending blockchain technology, viral appeal, and real-world value. From AI-driven platforms to metaverse ecosystems, these new cryptos aim to solve pressing challenges in the crypto space. But with thousands of tokens vying for attention, how can you spot the next 100x crypto projects? This article explores seven of the best new crypto to buy with huge potential in the 2025 crypto market. These utility tokens focus on innovation and have impressive milestones. Without further ado, grab your digital wallets and let’s dive in. Dawgz AI (DAGZ) Dogecoin (DOGE) Ondo (ONDO) Celestia (TIA) Popcat (POPCAT) Official Trump Token (TRUMP) Pepe Coin (PEPE) Dawgz AI (DAGZ): Merging Meme Culture with AI-Powered Utility Dawgz AI is the best new crypto to buy, giving users a unique opportunity to secure impressive investment returns this year. In a sense, this project stands at the intersection of meme coin virality and artificial intelligence in today’s crypto space. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on social media hype, Dawgz AI integrates blockchain technology and proprietary AI-powered trading tools designed to optimize returns for its users and token holders. The project also introduces alpha calls, a feature that empowers users to invest early and enjoy early access to new crypto coins. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the project leverages the security and scalability of the world’s leading smart contract platform while offering staking rewards to long-term investors. Dawgz AI is a top investment platform that offers long-term value and innovative tools for crypto users seeking new tokens with massive returns. Key Highlights: AI-Driven Trading: The platform’s high-frequency trading bot operates 24/7. It analyzes market trends to execute strategic trades, which could benefit a new generation of users in the project’s growing ecosystem. Strong Presale Momentum: So far, Dawgz AI has raised over $1 million in its ongoing presale event, with the current presale price at $0.00231. It’s vital for users to scoop DAGZ tokens now before the next price increase to $0.00257. Transparent Tokenomics: The total supply is capped at 8.888 billion tokens, with allocations for presale (30%), staking rewards (20%), liquidity pools (10%), and community incentives (15%). While skeptics question the sustainability of meme coins, Dawgz AI’s hybrid model (combining AI utility with community-driven engagement) positions it as the best new crypto to buy in 2025. While other investors chase hype-driven assets, Dawgz AI provides a playing field for users to grab its native token at a discount price and enjoy massive gains. Its upcoming listings on MEXC and BitMart by Q1 2025 could trigger significant demand, making it a moonshot contender. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Meme Coin Poised for a Resurgence Dogecoin remains among the best new crypto projects 2025 for investors seeking high-reward opportunities. As the original meme coin, DOGE thrives on Elon Musk’s endorsement, with rumors of integration into X (formerly Twitter) for payments. Despite lacking advanced utility, its cultural momentum and community make it a top project to watch in the crypto space. Analysts’ opinions expressed that it could dominate the dog-themed token wave. This is rightly so, especially with Musk’s influence driving narratives around new crypto coins with huge potential in 2025. Many experts believe that Dogecoin and other dog-themed digital assets could dominate 2025. Why? Elon Musk’s unwavering support for Dogecoin has reignited interest in established and new crypto coins. From Shiba Inu to new coins, they thrive on viral and emerging trends and community loyalty. While speculative, the combination of cultural momentum and influencer power makes dog tokens a high-risk, high-reward bet for 2025. Why Watch? Elon Musk Factor: Musk’s public support, including labeling DOGE as the “people’s crypto,” could drive institutional adoption. Speculation about DOGE becoming a payment method on X adds legitimacy to the crypto ecosystem. Market Resilience: DOGE has maintained a $20B+ market cap despite volatility, proving its staying power. While this meme coin’s past performance has been incredible, analysts like Ali Charts predict a potential 900% surge in the coming months. This could mirror its rally in the 2021 bull run. Dog Token Trend: Musk’s affinity for Dogecoin often spills into broader interest in dog-themed tokens like Shiba Inu and new projects. This could return a new bullish momentum for meme coins. Ondo (ONDO): Bridging Real-World Assets with DeFi Ondo is a new DeFi crypto project in 2025 that will tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), including real estate and commodities. By democratizing access to fractional ownership, traditional finance will merge with blockchain technology. These features have led to a growing interest in the Ondo ecosystem, making it a top new crypto project for investors. Why Watch? Institutional Partnerships: Collaborations with asset managers expand its RWA offerings, attracting traditional investors. Staking Rewards: Token holders earn passive income and governance rights on the platform’s future. Thus, investors can access and vote on upgrades or marketing decisions in its ecosystem while contributing to the platform’s network security. Market Gap: Ondo taps into the $16T RWA sector, a largely untapped market in crypto. So, early investors can still access this project before it soars in value. Celestia (TIA): Solving Blockchain Scalability Celestia ranks among the best new layer-1 crypto projects in 2025. It introduces a modular architecture to solve Ethereum’s scalability issues, thereby bringing value and increased security features to users and traders. Its testnet achieved 10,000+ TPS (transactions per second), and developers are flocking to build new Web3 projects and secure crypto wallets on its ecosystem. Why Watch? Testnet Success: Demonstrated 10,000+ TPS in trials, outperforming rivals. Developer Adoption: Traders and developers can access over 150 dApps (decentralized applications) on Celestia, signaling ecosystem growth. Ethereum Integration: Celestia’s modular design complements Ethereum, positioning it as a critical scaling solution.

By differentiating itself from other cryptocurrencies in the meme coin market, this utility token evolved from a viral cat meme into a platform planning non-fungible token (NFT) integrations and gaming partnerships. The project’s $200M market cap and 3,000% rally over the past year make it a top crypto project to watch out for in 2025.

While major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum capture most of the attention, history indicates that lesser-known projects can deliver substantial returns to early investors. In 2025, fresh cryptocurrency projects are making waves by combining blockchain technology, trending appeal, and tangible value. These new cryptos, ranging from AI-driven platforms to metaverse ecosystems, are addressing significant challenges in the crypto world. With a multitude of tokens competing for attention, how do you identify the next crypto projects with 100x potential? This article delves into seven of the best new cryptocurrencies to consider buying in the 2025 market, focusing on innovation and significant milestones. So, get your digital wallets ready and let's explore these opportunities. Dawgz AI (DAGZ) Dogecoin (DOGE) Ondo (ONDO) Celestia (TIA) Popcat (POPCAT) Official Trump Token (TRUMP) Pepe Coin (PEPE) Dawgz AI (DAGZ): Blending Meme Culture with AI-Powered Features Dawgz AI emerges as a leading choice for new crypto investments, offering users a rare chance to achieve significant returns this year. This project uniquely combines the viral nature of meme coins with cutting-edge artificial intelligence in the crypto arena. Differing from typical meme coins that rely heavily on social media buzz, Dawgz AI incorporates blockchain technology with exclusive AI-driven trading tools aimed at maximizing returns for users and token holders. Additionally, the project features alpha calls, enabling users to invest early and gain access to new crypto coins before others. Hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, the project benefits from the security and scalability of a leading smart contract platform, while also providing staking rewards for long-term investors. Dawgz AI stands out as a premier investment platform, delivering lasting value and innovative tools for crypto enthusiasts seeking tokens with high returns. Main Features: AI-Driven Trading: The platform's high-frequency trading bot runs continuously, analyzing market trends to execute strategic trades, potentially benefiting a new wave of users within the project's expanding ecosystem. Strong Presale Growth: Dawgz AI has already raised over $1 million in its ongoing presale event, with the current presale price at $0.00231. It’s important for users to acquire DAGZ tokens now before the next price increase to $0.00257. Transparent Tokenomics: The total supply is limited to 8.888 billion tokens, with allocations for presale (30%), staking rewards (20%), liquidity pools (10%), and community incentives (15%). Despite skepticism about the longevity of meme coins, Dawgz AI’s combination of AI utility and community-driven engagement sets it apart as the top new crypto to buy in 2025. While many investors chase assets driven by hype, Dawgz AI offers an opportunity for users to acquire its native token at a discounted rate, potentially leading to significant gains. Its upcoming listings on MEXC and BitMart by Q1 2025 could spark considerable demand, positioning it as a strong contender for moonshot potential. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Poised for a Comeback Dogecoin remains one of the top new crypto projects for 2025, ideal for investors seeking high-reward opportunities. As the pioneering meme coin, DOGE benefits from Elon Musk’s support, with speculation about its integration into X (formerly Twitter) for payments. Despite lacking advanced utility, its cultural significance and community backing make it a noteworthy project in the crypto world. Analysts suggest it could lead the dog-themed token resurgence, particularly with Musk’s influence shaping narratives around promising new crypto coins in 2025. Experts predict that Dogecoin and similar dog-themed digital assets might dominate in 2025. Why? Elon Musk’s steadfast support for Dogecoin has reignited interest in established and new crypto coins. From Shiba Inu to other new coins, these tokens thrive on viral trends and strong community loyalty. Though speculative, the blend of cultural momentum and influencer power makes dog tokens a high-risk, high-reward prospect for 2025. Why Keep an Eye On It? Elon Musk's Influence: Musk’s public endorsement, including calling DOGE the “people’s crypto,” could drive institutional interest. Speculation about DOGE being used as a payment method on X adds credibility to the crypto ecosystem. Market Resilience: DOGE has sustained a $20B+ market cap despite volatility, demonstrating its durability. Although this meme coin’s past performance has been remarkable, analysts like Ali Charts predict a potential 900% rise in the coming months. This could mirror a rally similar to the 2021 bull market. Dog Token Phenomenon: Musk’s fondness for Dogecoin often inspires broader interest in dog-themed tokens like Shiba Inu and new initiatives. This could spark a new bullish momentum for meme coins. Ondo (ONDO): Connecting Real-World Assets with DeFi Ondo is a fresh DeFi crypto initiative for 2025 that focuses on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), such as real estate and commodities. By opening up fractional ownership, it merges traditional finance with blockchain technology. These features have heightened interest in the Ondo ecosystem, making it a leading new crypto project for investors to consider. Why Keep an Eye On It? Institutional Collaborations: Partnerships with asset managers broaden its RWA offerings, drawing interest from traditional investors. Staking Incentives: Token holders gain passive income and governance rights concerning the platform’s future. This allows investors to participate in voting on upgrades or marketing decisions within its ecosystem while enhancing the platform’s network security. Market Opportunity: Ondo targets the $16T RWA sector, a largely unexplored market within crypto. Therefore, early investors can tap into this project before its value surges. Celestia (TIA): Tackling Blockchain Scalability Celestia stands out as one of the top new layer-1 crypto projects for 2025. It introduces a modular architecture aimed at resolving Ethereum's scalability problems, offering users and traders enhanced value and security. Its testnet achieved over 10,000 TPS (transactions per second), attracting developers eager to create new Web3 projects and secure crypto wallets within its ecosystem. Why Keep an Eye On It? Testnet Achievements: Demonstrated more than 10,000 TPS in trials, outpacing competitors. Developer Interest: Traders and developers can access over 150 dApps (decentralized applications) on Celestia, indicating ecosystem growth. Ethereum Compatibility: Celestia’s modular framework complements Ethereum, making it a vital scaling solution. Popcat (POPCAT): A Meme Coin with Bigger Aspirations Popcat is a relatively new entrant in the cryptocurrency scene. Standing out in the meme coin market, this utility token has evolved from a viral cat meme into a platform with plans for non-fungible token (NFT) integrations and gaming partnerships. With a $200M market cap and a 3,000% surge over the past year, it’s a top crypto project to monitor in 2025. Early investors have seen substantial gains, and experts suggest it still holds significant potential moving forward. Why Keep an Eye On It? Community Strength: A committed holder base propelled its 9,500% increase from its all-time low. Modest Market Cap: At over $200 million with a current trading volume of 86 million, Popcat has potential to reach its ATH price of $2.07 again with renewed enthusiasm. Official Trump Token (TRUMP): Crypto with a Political Spin Launched in January 2025, TRUMP is a notable new crypto investment, endorsed by Donald Trump. Its initial $15B market cap and significant trading activity demonstrate the impact of political narratives on crypto, appealing to early investors and traders searching for 100x moonshot cryptos in 2025. Why Keep an Eye On It? Volatility Driven by Narratives: Political tokens thrive on media attention; regulatory changes under the Trump administration could enhance adoption. High Liquidity: With a daily volume of $2.7B, there are plenty of trading opportunities. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Resilient Meme Coin Pepe has withstood major sell-offs but still holds a $5B market cap. Analysts point to a hidden bullish divergence, suggesting it could reclaim its 2024 ATH ($0.00002825) and become one of the top crypto coins to watch in 2025. Why Keep an Eye On It? Track Record: 1,093% YTD (Year-to-Date) gains underscore its standing in the meme coin space. Affordable Entry: At $0.00001, even a little hype could lead to substantial gains. Invest in These Promising Crypto Ventures of 2025 The crypto ventures for 2025 present a blend of high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Each project addresses distinct market needs, from Dawgz AI’s algorithmic trading and advanced technology to Celestia’s blockchain scalability. Many of these projects can be easily swapped on Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange. However, caution is essential. While these cryptocurrencies can offer 100x returns, risks like volatility and regulatory changes are ever-present. Therefore, diversification and risk assessment are crucial to maximizing their potential. So, prepare your crypto wallets and explore these top digital assets incorporating blockchain technology in their use cases. FAQs: Addressing Your 2025 Crypto Investment Queries What makes Dawgz AI the top new crypto to buy in 2025? Dawgz AI blends meme coin popularity with an AI trading algorithm designed to improve liquidity and returns for users. Its combination of blockchain technology, staking benefits, and clear tokenomics adds credibility in an overcrowded meme market, making it the top new crypto to buy this year. How can I discover new crypto projects early in 2025?

Layer 1 blockchains like Celestia also remain pivotal for scalability. Are meme coins like TRUMP and PEPE sustainable in the long term?

It is always advisable to diversify into utility-based digital assets. What risks are associated with investing in new crypto coins in 2025?

According to a post on X , the disruption caused concern among the cryptocurrency community. The outage disrupted the decentralized network, leading many to question whether XRPL is stable and reliable compared to other blockchain networks. XRP Ledger Has Fixed the Downtime Issues The halt occurred during a routine operation, raising concerns among critics and supporters of the XRP Ledger. Even though the downtime was short, some critics worried that the disruption could damage trust in XRPL as a dependable platform for financial transactions. They highlighted that any interruption, no matter how brief, could have serious consequences for businesses and developers who rely on the network for their services. However, proponents of the XRP Ledger quickly defended the network, stating that outages, while rare, do happen in the blockchain space. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, supported this view in a post on X , affirming that the issue is now fixed and the network is running smoothly again. He reassured users that no funds were lost during the downtime. Meanwhile, the cause of the issue is still being investigated. Ripple’s team is working to understand and fix any problems that may have caused the temporary disruption. In the meantime, crypto enthusiasts will closely watch how XRPL handles such incidents as it continues to develop. Ripple’s CTO Defends the XRP Ledger Value Recall that David Schwartz defended the XRP Ledger in an online debate against those who called it a “zero-sum game.” Schwartz underlined that customers gladly pay transaction fees in exchange for the beneficial services provided by the XRPL. He also emphasized its function in supporting several financial operations and enabling effective asset transfers. Undoubtedly, this explanation highlights the benefits of the XRPL in addition to value transfer, presenting it as a strong foundation for several financial activities. Proposed Governance Reform on XRPL Meanwhile, David Fueling, a renowned engineer connected to RippleX, suggested changes to the XRPL Foundation’s (XRPLF) governance framework . Fueling’s plan will advance democratic and decentralized procedures within the foundation. The advancement aligns with the expanding acknowledgment of the XRPL network’s architecture by different protocols. Notably, the XRP Ledger recently closed its 86 millionth ledger. The current ledger index, provided by XRP Ledger Services, is 86,201,363, indicating continued activity and ledger expansion.

Even though Solana (SOL) might rise to $500, will that be sufficient? Not when other initiatives are taking advantage of unexplored opportunities and resolving pressing issues. With features like scalable smart contracts and practical financial interfaces, the next major cryptocurrency is probably not SOL's concern. One altcoin in particular, Remittix (RTX) , sticks out as having the potential to revolutionize the market. Solana's (SOL) $500 Target A Strong Resurrection, But Not the Best Chance Because of its lightning-fast transactions and reasonable prices, Solana (SOL) has grown to be a formidable rival to Ethereum. Analysts are hopeful; some expect that the price of Solana will hit $500 this cycle. SOL's market capitalization is already substantial, though, so there is little room for growth. Although a 3x or 4x gain is respectable, smaller-cap enterprises yield much higher profits. For investors seeking rapid returns, Solana may not be the best option. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin That Still Moves Markets Due to social media hype and celebrity sponsorships, Dogecoin remains the market leader in joke currencies. Despite some claims that Dogecoin (DOGE) is a fraud, its persistent popularity cannot be dismissed. In terms of gains, Dogecoin (DOGE) may outperform the Solana price prediction if history repeats itself, having climbed above 10,000% during the previous bull run. Dogecoin, on the other hand, lacks the foundations and practical applications of more recent, utility-driven projects. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling Beyond Solana One of the Layer-1 blockchains with the quickest rate of growth, Avalanche provides rapid transactions with less congestion. With the addition of DeFi, gaming, and institutional acceptance, its ecosystem is growing quickly. Avalanche (AVAX) is demonstrating its scalability while SOL is battling congestion. Avalanche (AVAX) may be the next big crypto to keep an eye on as institutional interest in the company grows. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Adoption on the Rise With its distinctive consensus method that offers efficiency, security, and scalability, Hedera (HBAR) is made for businesses. Given the involvement of major corporations like Google, IBM, and Boeing, it has a lot of long-term promise. The slow and steady acceptance of Hedera (HBAR) may make it a surprise outperformer in this cycle's crypto bull run picks, even while Solana is the market leader for retail traders. Remittix (RTX): The Game-Changer for Crypto and Traditional Finance Remittix (RTX) is addressing a significant real-world issue connecting cryptocurrency and conventional banking in contrast to speculative cryptocurrencies. Millions of people throughout the world own cryptocurrency, yet many have trouble converting it into FIAT that can be used. Direct cryptocurrency payments are sometimes rejected by businesses, and consumers find it challenging to cash out due to banking constraints. Remittix alters the rules at this point. The Pain Point: Crypto’s Unfinished Revolution Remittix offers a simple solution by facilitating direct bank transfers or cash withdrawals and smoothly converting cryptocurrency into FIAT. Remittix (RTX) functions as a crypto-to-FIAT payment network, competing with Stripe and Wise, but without centralized control, unlike any other project. Since Remittix (RTX) is still in its infancy, investors have the opportunity to invest before it becomes widely used. Real World Impact: The Future of Finance This is the next major crypto revolution, one that preserves the fundamental principles of anonymity and asset control while bringing about true financial independence. Even if Solana price prediction indicates that solana (SOL) may hit $500, this does not imply that it is the best option for investors seeking high returns. Although there are compelling arguments for altcoins like DOGE, AVAX, and HBAR to exceed SOL, Remittix (RTX) is the true standout. Remittix has positioned itself to be one of the biggest winners in the crypto bull run picks by resolving a real-world issue smoothly transferring crypto to FIAT. Those who want to invest in the next big crypto might want to get in early.

Even if Solana (SOL) hits $500, will it be enough? Not when other projects are tapping into uncharted territories and solving critical problems. With features like scalable smart contracts and convenient financial interfaces, the next big cryptocurrency is probably not Solana's concern. One particular altcoin, Remittix (RTX) , stands out as having the potential to transform the market. Solana's (SOL) $500 Ambition A Robust Comeback, But Not the Ultimate Bet Thanks to its rapid transaction speeds and affordable fees, Solana (SOL) has become a strong competitor to Ethereum. Analysts are optimistic; some foresee Solana's price reaching $500 this cycle. However, with SOL's market cap already significant, the room for growth is limited. A 3x or 4x increase is noteworthy, yet smaller-cap projects can offer much larger returns. For those chasing swift profits, Solana might not be the ideal choice. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin Still Influencing the Market Dogecoin remains the top contender in meme coins due to its viral social media presence and celebrity endorsements. Despite some criticisms labeling Dogecoin (DOGE) as a joke, its ongoing popularity is undeniable. In terms of gains, Dogecoin (DOGE) could surpass Solana's price forecast if history repeats itself, having surged over 10,000% in the last bull market. However, Dogecoin lacks the solid foundations and practical uses seen in newer, utility-focused projects. Avalanche (AVAX): Surpassing Solana's Scale Avalanche is one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 blockchains, offering swift transactions with minimal congestion. Its ecosystem is rapidly expanding with the inclusion of DeFi, gaming, and institutional adoption. While SOL battles congestion, Avalanche (AVAX) is proving its scalability. With increasing institutional interest, Avalanche (AVAX) could be the next major cryptocurrency to watch. Hedera (HBAR): Rising Enterprise Adoption Hedera (HBAR) is tailored for enterprises with its unique consensus mechanism that ensures efficiency, security, and scalability. With major corporations like Google, IBM, and Boeing involved, it holds significant long-term potential. While Solana is a favorite among retail traders, Hedera's steady acceptance may make it a surprising outperformer in this cycle's crypto bull market picks. Remittix (RTX): A Game-Changer for Crypto and Traditional Finance Remittix (RTX) is tackling a major real-world issue by creating a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional banking, unlike speculative cryptocurrencies. Millions own cryptocurrency globally, yet many struggle to convert it into usable FIAT. Businesses often reject direct crypto payments, and banking restrictions make cashing out difficult. This is where Remittix changes the game. The Unresolved Challenge: Crypto's Incomplete Revolution Remittix offers a straightforward solution by enabling direct bank transfers or cash withdrawals and seamlessly converting cryptocurrency into FIAT. Functioning as a crypto-to-FIAT payment network, Remittix (RTX) competes with Stripe and Wise, yet without centralized oversight, setting it apart from other projects. Since Remittix (RTX) is still in its early stages, investors have the chance to get in before it becomes mainstream. Real-World Impact: The Future of Finance This marks the next significant crypto revolution, one that upholds core principles of anonymity and asset control while fostering true financial independence. Even if Solana's price forecast suggests that Solana (SOL) might reach $500, it doesn't mean it's the best choice for those seeking high returns. While there are compelling reasons for altcoins like DOGE, AVAX, and HBAR to outperform SOL, Remittix (RTX) truly stands out. By effectively addressing a real-world issue of smoothly converting crypto to FIAT, Remittix is poised to be one of the biggest winners in the crypto bull market picks.

The fund is expected to be based in Switzerland and BlackRock could begin marketing it as early as this month, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Though, at the time of writing, a BlackRock representative declined to comment on the matter. This listing would mark yet another step in BlackRock's international expansion of its Bitcoin-related offerings, as the firm has already launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in both Canada and Brazil .

The committee is examining allegations that financial institutions have unfairly denied banking services to citizens and businesses associated with the crypto industry. The “Investigating the Real Impacts of Debanking in America” hearing features testimonies from Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley and Davis Wright Tremaine LLP partner Stephen Gannon. Others include Old Glory Bank CEO Mike Ring. Lastly, we have Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Aaron Klein. The committee, chaired by Senator Tim Scott, is focused on uncovering whether banks unilaterally froze accounts tied to crypto. Reports have it that they restricted access to financial services for crypto-related businesses during the Biden administration. Scott, a South Carolina Republican who recently took over leadership of the committee, said such actions represent an abuse of regulatory power. Committee starts ‘debanking’ investigation “ In this country, access to credit is one of the cornerstones of building your American dream. It is disheartening to hear stories about financial institutions cutting off services to digital asset firms, political figures, and conservative-aligning individuals and businesses, ” said Tim Scott in his opening remarks. In attendance was Senator Elizabeth Warren, who echoed Scott’s sentiments, saying that people shouldn’t be denied banking services regardless of their political views. “ My staff identified 11,955 complaints about debanking, and this number only includes people who took the time to file complaints only in the last three years. All of these complaints reported similar things, no warnings, no explanation, and no chance to dispute or appeal ,” remarked Warren. Senator Warren also mentioned that her staff found four banks, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and CitiBank, accounted for half of the complaints her staff received. “ President Donald Trump was onto something when he criticised Bank of America for its debanking practices. ” When Anchorage Digital CEO McCauley was asked to give his testimony, he revealed the grim experience that his company had: “In June 2023, we received a call from the bank asking us to meet with them We were told our account will be closed in 30 days because they were uncomfortable with our crypto clients and transactions [then] they refused to give us any further explanation.” McCauley mentioned that his financial firm is federally approved to operate within the US, but it was ironic how other banks denied them services. When asked by Chairman Scott about the extent of debanking in the crypto industry, he answered, “ To say this is pervasive is an understatement .” In the second testimony, Davis Wright Tremaine partner Stephen Gannon told the committee that banks were closing down accounts wrongfully on “strategically ambigious” grounds. Gannon said that if the problem of regulatory overreach is not solved, “there will be an Operation Chokepoint 3.0.” Senator Katie posed a query to Gannon asking about the law that President Trump introduced in his first term, which was meant to solve the issue of banks preventing individuals from accessing financial services. The attorney confirmed that the legislation was revoked by former President Biden on January 20, 2021, through an executive order. In the hearing, Senator Scott called out the Biden administration’s regulatory approach. The approach to debanking does not sit well with American principles of fairness and equity. “ Debanking is un-American—every legal business deserves to be treated the same regardless of their political beliefs, ” Scott reiterated.

He’s now stuck in the agency’s IT department, buried somewhere under server maintenance and software updates. The transfer happened last week, right as the SEC scrambles to make peace with the same crypto companies it spent years dragging through courtrooms, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. Tenreiro was the guy behind some of the SEC’s biggest legal battles, including lawsuits that could have defined how much power the commission had over the crypto industry. His reassignment comes after months of political pressure from pro-crypto forces. Trump’s White House is in complete support of this after forcing former chairman Gary Gensler to resign on Jan. 20. SEC’s crypto wars take a new direction The commission, now under Republican control, didn’t explain why they pulled Tenreiro off crypto litigation, but the signs are obvious. Companies like Coinbase and Binance pumped millions into political action committees to help elect lawmakers who understand the industry—or at least won’t sue it to death. With Trump’s executive order last month calling for a new crypto-friendly regulatory framework and the assignment of Mark Uyeda as acting chairman, the SEC is changing. Uyeda announced a new task force just yesterday to rethink how the commission deals with crypto, as Cryptopolitan reported . The task force is led by Hester Peirce, a longtime ally of industry nicknamed ‘Crypto Mom.’ Tenreiro first gained attention during the initial Trump administration, when the SEC, under then-Chairman Jay Clayton, cracked down on the wild boom of initial coin offerings (ICOs). Clayton declared most tokens as securities, and Tenreiro was the guy making sure crypto companies felt the weight of that decision. His most recent high-profile win came in September 2024, when the SEC reached a settlement with Mango Markets. The decentralized trading platform had raised $70 million by selling unregistered tokens. Tenreiro said that labeling the project a “DAO” didn’t mean it could dodge securities laws. The case ended with Mango agreeing to a $700,000 fine, the destruction of its MNGO tokens, and delisting requests from exchanges. Mango shut down entirely by January 2025, unable to recover from the legal and financial blows. But not every case worked out so smoothly. In October 2024, Tenreiro’s team launched an appeal against Ripple Labs after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP token sales on exchanges didn’t count as investment contracts. Ripple’s executives, Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen, had reason to celebrate—briefly. Tenreiro’s appeal wanted to expand securities law to cover retail sales of XRP, but it triggered a storm of backlash. Crypto supporters called it regulatory overreach, and Ripple loyalists hit back by filing a bar complaint against Tenreiro just two days later. Tenreiro’s involvement in the SEC’s 2019 case against Veritaseum, a blockchain-based financial technology company, also came back to haunt him. VERI token holders accused him of misrepresenting their tokens as securities and causing financial harm through “wrongful prosecution.” They pointed to the SEC’s embarrassing misstep in the Debt Box case, where the commission admitted to fabricating evidence and had to pay $1.8 million in penalties. Tenreiro’s aggressive tactics had gone too far. SEC task force pivots away from lawsuits Hester Peirce isn’t wasting time dismantling what’s left of the SEC’s enforcement-first approach. “The commission refused to use regulatory tools at its disposal,” she wrote in a statement on Tuesday, ripping apart the litigation-heavy strategy pushed by Gensler and executed by Tenreiro. Peirce said the SEC is now weighing a temporary amnesty program for crypto issuers. Companies that provide basic disclosures to investors could be allowed to trade freely on exchanges without the constant threat of SEC intervention. Uyeda’s decision to withdraw controversial accounting guidance further shows how quickly things are changing. The guidance, which made it nearly impossible for banks to offer custody services for digital assets, was a major pain point for crypto companies. Natasha Guinan, the senior SEC lawyer responsible for that policy, was also reassigned, though her new role is still unknown.

This adds to the growing list of trading platforms that have already added support for the stablecoin, which provides a bullish outlook for the XRP ecosystem. Ripple RLUSD Stablecoin Goes Live On Two Platforms In an X post , Ripple announced that its RLUSD stablecoin is now available on the Zero Hash and Revolut crypto exchanges. ZeroHash also confirmed this development in an X post, stating that it has expanded its stablecoin offering with the addition of Ripple USD. The platform further revealed that this integration will allow customers to access the stablecoin to process transactions on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks. Commenting on this development, Edward Woodford, the founder and CEO at Zero Hash, said, The addition of RLUSD to our ecosystem demonstrates Zero Hash’s commitment to providing our customers with access to the most innovative and regulated stablecoin technologies These listings come just days after the crypto trading platform Margex announced listing the RLUSD stablecoin among other stablecoin offerings. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Ripple’s regulated stablecoin is also available on crypto platforms such as Bitstamp, Uphold, Bullish, Independent Reserve, Moonpay, Bitso, and Coinmena. Ripple CLO Gives Take On The Future Of Crypto In The US In a CNBC interview, Ripple’s CLO Stuart Alderoty gave his take on the future of crypto in the US, stating that the changes made so far under Donald Trump’s administration are “fantastic.” The legal expert also discussed the policy changes made by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the acting Chair, Mark Uyeda, including the creation of the crypto task force. Aldeorty commended these moves, highlighting how it is a significant shift in the regulatory environment from what was attainable under Gary Gensler’s SEC. The Ripple CLO also commended the Crypto Czar David Sacks, stating that he believes he is the right man for the job. He further revealed that Ripple has been in contact with Sacks to assist with implementing the right crypto policies. David Sacks had yesterday revealed that the US was evaluating the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve .

However, the flagship asset encountered strong resistance around the $102,000 threshold, causing its price to retrace toward key support levels. As Bitcoin’s price fluctuates, strong bullish sentiment and activity have been observed among short-term holders. A Notable Shift In Bitcoin Ownership Recent price actions appear to have triggered a notable shift in Bitcoin ownership as short-term holders load up their accumulation of BTC. Alphractal, an advanced data analytics and investment platform identified the change in ownership, suggesting growing confidence among BTC retail investors . Data from the platform shows that long-term holders have sold a significant amount of BTC, while short-term holders step in to absorb the supply. This change typically comes when long-term holders reduce their holdings, allowing short-term holders keen to take advantage of possible gains to buy more coins. The massive sell-offs from long-term investors are considered a profit-taking strategy, indicating pessimism in BTC’s long-term performances among these investors. Meanwhile, the huge accumulation by short-term holders reflects strong optimism about BTC’s short-term potential. After navigating the Bitcoin Supply Age Bands metric, Alphractal highlighted that history might be repeating itself once again as short-term sentiment grows. As seen in past cycles, long-term participants become less interested in holding their previously acquired BTC, causing them to sell their coins. Meanwhile, like in past cycles, these investors are beginning to offload their holdings at a huge scale in the ongoing cycle. On the other hand, short-term holders have shown to be more reactive and make riskier decisions because they purchase precisely during price spikes. Should these investors continue to accumulate BTC, the development could impact market volatility and shape the asset’s next major price move. Short-term holders may be capitalizing on recent pullbacks, but Alphractal highlights that long-term holders tend to be smarter investors. This is due to a higher possibility of growth in the long term. These investors take advantage of the rising BTC prices to sell their positions, with a lower average buy price. BTC’s Market Still Bullish As Profitability Remain At Good Levels Despite significant corrections , BTC’s profitability remains at positive levels. Data shared by Axel Adler Jr., a macro researcher and author shows that Bitcoin’s average realized profit, net average realized profit, and average realized losses are valued at $911 million, $653 million, and $258 million respectively. Considering the profitability levels, Axel Adler claims that the BTC market remains in a bullish phase. According to the expert, the current consolidation will likely come to an end when the Net Realized Profit/Loss (USD) 7DMA inches closer to zero or goes negative. This would imply that most sellers have already left the market, which is common during the final stage of a correction, leaving only panic-driven selling.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|Average Realized Losses|Axel Adler Jr|bitcoin|Bitcoin Average Realized Profit|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|Bitcoin Supply Age Band Metric|btc|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Net Average Realized Profit|Profit-taking,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-05 17:30:30

One coin that once stole the spotlight is PEPE, a meme coin that enjoyed astronomical gains during its early days. However, recent trends show that PEPE's explosive growth is now falling behind another top altcoin that has given early investors a solid 3x return. In this article, we review recent developments in PEPE and then focus on the promising viral altcoin, which many experts now consider one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth. We also look at how the current DeFi coin price trends support these shifts and what they mean for investors. PEPE: A Meme Coin That Once Shook the Market PEPE emerged as a meme coin inspired by the internet-famous frog. It captured the attention of the crypto community with its wild presale gains, at one point boasting returns that reached astronomical levels. Early investors saw unbelievable profits, and PEPE quickly became a symbol of the meme coin craze. PEPE once had a remarkable surge during its initial phase that established it as a top altcoin. Social media buzz and internet hype drove its price to unbelievable heights. However, as the initial frenzy subsided, PEPE encountered a steep decline. Trading volumes have dropped, and several well-known crypto influencers now caution that the coin relies too much on hype rather than sustainable technology or real-world use. PEPE’s value now appears to be unstable. Its price has begun to slide, and the market sentiment surrounding it has turned cautious. Investors have started to view meme coins like PEPE as speculative assets that offer quick gains but lack long-term promise. Many investors now look for tokens that provide tangible value beyond internet memes. Remittix: The Viral Altcoin with 3x Returns for Early Holders The interest in PEPE has lost its momentum while Remittix (RTX) has ascended as a viral altcoin that solves practical problems. The financial industry faces an essential challenge regarding inefficient cross-border payments which Remittix addresses through its solution. The current method of international payment transfers operates at a slow pace while being both costly and difficult to understand. Remittix resolves these payment issues through blockchain technology which links crypto assets to conventional fiat systems to support rapid worldwide transactions at low costs. The investors who bought Remittix shares in early stages achieved substantial profit growth. According to reports the presale investors achieved triple their investment value. The token sale of this project generated more than $10.6 million from investors who demonstrated significant confidence in its potential. RTX DeFi coin maintains a current trading value of $0.0539 which provides an entry point for both beginner and professional investors. Market conditions being favorable could result in RTX reaching up to 50x returns according to analyst predictions. The standout feature of Remittix emerges from its dedicated approach to resolving existing real-world issues. PEPE maintains its existence through social media hype yet Remittix provides a solution to fix global financial inefficiencies. Through its elimination of several financial intermediaries Remittix provides customers with quick transactions along with reduced expenses. The functional benefits of Remittix help millions of people who need remittances and attract institutional players who want to upgrade their payment systems. The project has established a solid infrastructure for security together with transparency measures. The platform operates with complete reliability because it has passed through extensive smart contract audits. Transparency has emerged as a major reason why analysts rate Remittix as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Remittix comes equipped with an interface that makes complicated financial operations more accessible to users. The intuitive design plays a vital role in attracting users ranging from single investors to major corporations. Through its banking system integration feature Remittix enables non-technical users to access its services. The expanding global trade requires efficient, transparent and cost-effective international payment solutions to become increasingly essential. Remittix stands out as an excellent solution among upcoming altcoins because it effectively addresses current market requirements. Meme coin speculators have transitioned their investment attention toward projects that demonstrate sustainable value. The market's fascination with PEPE's rapid growth has faded because its success relied solely on hype which now causes its downfall. The steady growth of Remittix stems from its real-world application basis. The investment potential of this project grows stronger because of its initial success together with its well-defined expansion strategy. Remittix stands to gain more potential through the increasing use of blockchain solutions in global payments.

However, the coin's explosive rise has recently been overshadowed by another leading altcoin that has provided early investors with impressive 3x returns. This article examines PEPE's recent performance and highlights the emerging altcoin that experts believe could be a top choice for long-term investment. We will also discuss how current DeFi coin market trends support these changes and their implications for investors. PEPE: A Meme Coin That Once Captivated the Market Inspired by an internet-famous frog, PEPE launched as a meme coin that quickly grabbed the crypto community's attention with its staggering presale profits. At its peak, it provided investors with returns that seemed almost unbelievable, turning PEPE into a hallmark of the meme coin phenomenon. During its initial boom, PEPE experienced a significant price surge, cementing its status as a leading altcoin. It rode high on social media buzz and online hype, reaching unprecedented price levels. But as the initial excitement waned, PEPE's value took a sharp downturn. Trading volumes have decreased, and several prominent crypto influencers now suggest that the coin's success is driven more by hype than by sustainable technology or practical applications. Now, PEPE's value seems to be on shaky ground. Its price is declining, and market sentiment has turned wary. Investors are beginning to view meme coins like PEPE as risky, offering quick but unreliable profits. More and more, they're seeking tokens that deliver real-world value beyond just internet memes. Remittix: The Trending Altcoin Rewarding Early Investors with 3x Returns While interest in PEPE has waned, Remittix (RTX) has emerged as a buzzworthy altcoin that addresses real-world challenges. A significant issue for the financial industry is the inefficiency of cross-border payments, which Remittix aims to solve. Current international transfer methods are slow, expensive, and complex. Remittix tackles these challenges with blockchain technology, connecting crypto assets to traditional fiat systems for swift, low-cost global transactions. Early investors in Remittix have seen substantial growth in their investments. Reports indicate that those who participated in the presale have tripled their initial investment value. The project's token sale has raised over $10.6 million, reflecting strong investor confidence in its potential. RTX DeFi coin is currently valued at $0.0539, presenting an opportunity for both novice and seasoned investors. Favorable market conditions could potentially lead RTX to deliver up to 50x returns, according to analysts. What sets Remittix apart is its commitment to solving tangible problems. While PEPE thrives on social media hype, Remittix addresses inefficiencies in global finance. By removing several financial middlemen, Remittix offers quick transactions and reduced costs. Its practical benefits appeal to millions who require remittance services and attract institutional players seeking to modernize their payment systems. The project has built a robust security and transparency framework. Having undergone thorough smart contract audits, the platform operates with complete reliability. Transparency is a crucial factor why analysts consider Remittix among the top cryptos to invest in for 2025. Remittix features an interface that simplifies complex financial transactions for users. Its user-friendly design is key in attracting everyone from individual investors to large corporations. With banking system integration, Remittix makes its services accessible to non-technical users. As global trade continues to grow, the need for efficient, transparent, and affordable international payment solutions becomes ever more critical. Remittix is well-positioned among emerging altcoins to meet these market demands effectively. Investors who previously speculated on meme coins are now shifting their focus to projects that offer sustainable value. The excitement surrounding PEPE's rapid rise has diminished, as its success was rooted in hype, which is proving to be its downfall. Remittix's steady growth is anchored in its real-world applications. The project's investment potential is bolstered by its initial success and a clear strategy for expansion. As blockchain solutions gain traction in global payments, Remittix stands to harness significant potential.

Priced at just $0.0539 in presale and expected to be 20x before release, Remittix offers great mass growth potential together with real-world utility. Turning $100 into $60,000, might this be the next success story modeled after SHIB? Shiba Inu’s Past Success and Its Explosive Future Potential The cryptocurrency industry was startled when Shiba Inu (SHIB) jumped from a joke coin to a top-performing digital asset in 2021. What began as a joke suddenly developed into a financial phenomenon, making billionaires overnight. Small sums of investors saw life-changing profits attributable to the token's explosive rise motivated by social media buzz, big exchange listings, and increasing acceptance. Rising an incredible 1,535%, SHIB attracted the attention of crypto aficionados all over in May 2021. The token's momentum drove enthusiasm to an all-time high in October 2021 of $0.000089. One of the most discussed cryptocurrencies in the market, SHIB witnessed billions of dollars flooding in it at the fast climb. But SHIB had strong corrections shortly as it ascended, reminding investors of the great volatility in the crypto sector. Experts now say SHIB is about to undergo another great explosion; some estimate a 20,000% rise by 2025. Should this prediction come true, a $100 investment now may become $20,000, presenting one of the most fascinating prospects in the cryptocurrency realm. Although its already large market capitalization prevents it from reflecting its early stratospheric climb, its expanding ecosystem makes future gains rather exciting. SHIB is now more than simply a joke currency, unlike in 2021. Evolution of the Shiba Inu ecosystem brings token burning, NFT initiatives, and Shibarium—all of which may propel long-term expansion. Should these developments continue to be effective, Shiba Inu might once again shock the market by demonstrating that meme currencies have actual value and endurance.

Could a $100 investment transform into $60,000, echoing the success story of SHIB? Shiba Inu’s Remarkable Rise and Future Prospects The crypto world was left in awe when Shiba Inu (SHIB) transitioned from a meme to a leading digital currency in 2021.

In May 2021, SHIB's impressive 1,535% increase captivated crypto enthusiasts globally. The token's momentum peaked in October 2021, reaching $0.000089. Among the most talked-about cryptocurrencies, SHIB saw billions in investments as it soared. However, its rapid ascent was followed by significant corrections, a stark reminder of the crypto market's volatility. Analysts now forecast another explosive phase for SHIB, predicting a potential 20,000% surge by 2025. Should this happen, a $100 investment today could grow to $20,000, offering one of the most intriguing opportunities in the crypto space. While its current market cap may not allow for the same dramatic climb as before, its expanding ecosystem makes future gains promising. Today, SHIB is far more than just a meme coin. The growth of the Shiba Inu ecosystem includes token burning, NFT projects, and Shibarium development—all factors that may drive long-term growth. If these initiatives succeed, Shiba Inu could once again surprise the market by proving that meme coins can have real value and staying power.

Meanwhile, a new project called Remittix is getting attention. Some believe this new DeFi project is one of the best crypto to buy right now. Why Dogecoin Can’t Reach $20 In This Cycle Dogecoin has shown really notable growth in the past. In many ways, it has had a respectable run in the crypto scene. At its height, DOGE traded at $0.74. This was realized during the crypto frenzy of 2021. Because of its intrinsic inflationary architecture and large market capitalization needed, Dogecoin (DOGE) faces great difficulties obtaining a $20 value. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit; 10,000 more coins are created every minute, therefore gradually diluting value over time. This continuous rise in supply causes the price to be under downward pressure, which makes appreciative change challenging. Furthermore, reaching a $20 price per DOGE would need an immense market capitalization, maybe surpassing that of big worldwide financial institutions given the speculative character of cryptocurrencies and limited use. Although community excitement and celebrity sponsorships have caused major spikes in Dogecoin, its structural economic elements and the enormous market value needed to make a continuous ascent to $20 extremely unlikely. Why Now Is The Best Time To Buy Remittix Combining blockchain technology with currency transactions, Remittix (RTX) is reinventing global payments and providing quick and reasonably priced cross-border solutions. Supported by around forty popular altcoins, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the website provides fast conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, thereby enabling perfect bank account deposits. As a link between crypto and fiat and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet, remittix is the better match to traditional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. Remittixguarantees accessibility and inclusiveness for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and more than 30 fiat currencies, therefore simplifying worldwide trade with its wide range of possibilities. Furthermore notable is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and clarity over the high costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. Remittix is a game-changer in the payments sector since this method ensures that the whole amount transmitted reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical behavior all too often. Currently valued at $0.0539 in its presale, the RTX coin is the best crypto to buy right now since it has great investment value. Forecasts suggest a marked rise; demand for unique cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale period and over 1,500% rise following launch. This positions RTX as one of the best altcoins.

At the same time, a fresh initiative named Remittix is drawing attention. Some suggest this new DeFi project represents one of the top crypto buys at present. Reasons Dogecoin Won’t Hit $20 This Cycle Dogecoin has experienced significant growth before. It has made a notable impact in the crypto world, peaking at $0.74 during the 2021 crypto boom. Due to its inherent inflationary design and the large market cap needed, Dogecoin (DOGE) encounters substantial challenges in reaching a $20 valuation. Unlike Bitcoin's capped supply, Dogecoin generates 10,000 new coins every minute, which gradually reduces its value over time. This continuous increase in supply places downward pressure on the price, making significant appreciation difficult. Moreover, achieving a $20 price per DOGE would demand an enormous market cap, potentially exceeding that of major global financial institutions. Given the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and its limited usage, this is highly improbable. While community enthusiasm and celebrity endorsements have led to significant spikes in Dogecoin’s value, its fundamental economic structure and the large market cap needed make a sustained rise to $20 highly unlikely. Why It's The Ideal Time To Invest In Remittix By integrating blockchain with currency transactions, Remittix (RTX) is transforming global payments with quick and cost-effective cross-border solutions. Backed by approximately forty popular altcoins, such as Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform facilitates swift conversions to fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless bank account deposits.

Noteworthy is the platform's transparent flat-fee model, offering cost savings and clarity over the high fees and poor exchange rates of traditional banks.

Currently priced at $0.0539 during its presale, the RTX coin is considered the best crypto to buy now due to its promising investment potential. Predictions indicate a significant increase; the demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions is driving a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% growth post-launch.

Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as the next big contender in the crypto space, offering a groundbreaking fusion of AI and blockchain. Lightchain AI has already raised over $15.1 million at a presale price of $0.006, signaling strong investor demand. Unlike meme-driven tokens, Lightchain AI provides tangible utility, positioning itself for massive growth in 2025. As trends shift, this presale is capturing serious attention from smart investors. Trump Coins Decline—Where Smart Money Is Moving Next The initial enthusiasm for President Donald Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, has significantly diminished. After launching on January 17, 2025, and peaking at over $70 per token, its value has plummeted by approximately 75%, now trading around $19. This decline is attributed to market reactions following recent U.S. tariff announcements and growing skepticism regarding the coin's speculative nature. In response, investors are shifting focus toward cryptocurrencies with more substantial foundations. Projects that integrate blockchain technology with real-world applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and tokens emphasizing utility, are gaining traction. This trend reflects a broader move towards assets with tangible value propositions, as the market matures and participants seek sustainable investment opportunities. Why Lightchain AI Is Poised to Become a Leading Crypto Contender Lightchain AI is rapidly positioning itself as a top crypto contender, thanks to its robust tokenomics and high-performance infrastructure. Its tokenomics ensures long-term sustainability, with a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens distributed strategically: 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for treasury, and 5% for team allocation. This structured approach promotes ecosystem growth, decentralization, and long-term value appreciation. Additionally, Lightchain AI offers low-latency AI execution through its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). The network optimizes AI workloads with parallelized execution, dynamic resource allocation, and gas-efficient computation, ensuring lightning-fast transaction speeds under 300ms. With efficient scalability and strong tokenomics, Lightchain AI is poised for mass adoption and exponential growth. Lightchain AI- Paving the Way for Market Domination in 2025 Lightchain AI is rewriting the rules of the crypto world by seamlessly blending blockchain with AI—a game-changing combo that sets it miles ahead of the competition. With partnerships already locked in across industries like healthcare, finance, and government, Lightchain AI is poised to bring its platform to life in the real world, driving adoption and setting the stage for market domination. But that’s not all. Lightchain AI isn’t just about tech—it’s about people. With its decentralized governance model, token holders have the power to shape the network’s future, ensuring transparency, community involvement, and sustainable growth.

Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining recognition in the crypto world, combining the innovative fields of AI and blockchain. With over $15.1 million raised at a presale price of $0.006, Lightchain AI has shown significant investor interest. Unlike tokens driven by memes, Lightchain AI offers practical utility, positioning itself for considerable growth in 2025. As market trends evolve, this presale is drawing keen interest from savvy investors. Trump Coins on the Decline—Where Savvy Investors Are Heading Next The excitement around President Donald Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, has notably decreased. After its launch on January 17, 2025, the coin peaked at over $70 per token but has since dropped about 75%, now trading around $19. This downturn is linked to market reactions to recent U.S. tariff announcements and increasing doubts about the coin's speculative nature. Consequently, investors are turning their attention to cryptocurrencies with more solid foundations. Projects that blend blockchain technology with real-world use cases, like decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and utility-focused tokens, are gaining ground. This shift indicates a broader trend towards assets with concrete value propositions as the market becomes more sophisticated and participants seek durable investment opportunities. Why Lightchain AI Is Set to Become a Major Player in Crypto Lightchain AI is quickly establishing itself as a leading contender in the crypto arena, thanks to its strong tokenomics and robust infrastructure. Its tokenomics ensure long-term viability, with a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens allocated strategically: 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for treasury, and 5% for team allocation. This methodical distribution supports ecosystem growth, decentralization, and enduring value growth. Moreover, Lightchain AI provides rapid AI execution through its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). The network enhances AI workloads with parallel execution, dynamic resource distribution, and gas-efficient processing, achieving ultra-fast transaction speeds below 300ms. With its effective scalability and strong tokenomics, Lightchain AI is set for widespread adoption and significant expansion. Lightchain AI—Leading the Charge for Market Leadership in 2025 Lightchain AI is transforming the crypto landscape by seamlessly integrating blockchain with AI—a revolutionary combination that sets it far ahead of the pack. With established partnerships in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government, Lightchain AI is ready to make its platform a reality in the real world, fostering adoption and paving the way for market leadership. But there’s more. Lightchain AI isn’t just about technology—it’s about people. Its decentralized governance model empowers token holders to influence the network’s future, ensuring transparency, community participation, and sustainable development.

Travis Hill, the acting FDIC chairman tapped by President Donald Trump, has thrown open more of the agency's past documents and said the U.S. banking regulator will be reconsidering its previous crypto guidance that deliberately kept banks an arm's length away from what had been seen as the unregulated volatility of crypto. The past letters between the FDIC and bank have been the focus of a court Freedom of Information Act battle between Coinbase and the agency, in which the courts had directed the regulator to share more information. Meanwhile, Hill said the FDIC will be ""providing a pathway for institutions to engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities while still adhering to safety and soundness principles,"" according to a statement issued before the start of a Wednesday hearing in the Senate Banking Committee on this topic. ""I directed staff to conduct a comprehensive review of all supervisory communications with banks that sought to offer crypto-related products or services,"" he said. ""While this review remains underway, we are releasing a large batch of documents today, in advance of a court-ordered deadline of Friday."" Hill, who will run the FDIC until Trump puts forward a permanent candidate, characterized the agency as deliberately making it impossible for banks to handle crypto business. ""Requests from these banks were almost universally met with resistance, ranging from repeated requests for further information, to multi-month periods of silence as institutions waited for responses, to directives from supervisors to pause, suspend, or refrain from expanding all crypto- or blockchain-related activity,"" he said. Read More: U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests When the Senate hearing got underway, Chairman Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, called the situation at the FDIC a ""disgusting and disheartening picture of abuse"" and praised Hill's actions. At the hearing, Nathan McCauley, the co-founder and CEO of federally chartered crypto bank Anchorage Digital, shared his account of Anchorage being severed from banking relationships because of regulatory pressure. ""To say this is pervasive is an understatement,"" he told the senators in his testimony. ""It's been across the entire industry, everybody has dealt with this."" He called it so common that ""it became background noise"" in which it was ""just assumed that if you were a crypto company, you would have trouble getting bank services."" He contended that the pressure from regulators ran counter to what U.S. bankers actually wanted to do in the digital assets sector. ""All of the big banks wanted to work with crypto and were scared away from it by the regulatory apparatus,"" he said. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the committee's ranking Democrat, sought to highlight the other segments of the U.S. population that are routinely blocked from banking services. But she did agree with McCauley's central point. ""I don't think for a second that you should be locked out of our banking system,"" she said. ""In many cases, it is wrong for banks to close accounts and threaten your ability to make payroll or pay rent on time without even providing an explanation, so long as you are following the law."" The congressional review of debanking will continue on Thursday with a House Financial Services Committee hearing with a similar agenda . And that committee's crypto interest will continue next week with a February 11 hearing entitled ""A Golden Age of Digital Assets: Charting a Path Forward.""

The fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg . BlackRock could begin marketing the product as early as this month. Its entry into the European crypto ETP market marks another step in the firm’s growing embrace of digital assets.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Finance is gaining traction, challenging Solana and Pepe coin with its solutions and growth potential. As 2025 progresses, the cryptocurrency market continues to surprise and intrigue investors and enthusiasts alike. Among the frontrunners, Solana (SOL) and Pepe coin (PEPE) have consistently captured attention with their impressive price performances. However, a new contender, Rexas Finance, is quickly gaining traction, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape. This analysis discusses whether Rexas Finance can outpace the established dominance of SOL and PEPE by examining its technological innovations, market adoption, and investor sentiment. Here are the reasons: Rapid growth and market confidence Rexas Finance is capturing the market’s attention as it rapidly ascends through its presale stages, currently at stage 12 with an enticing price of $0.20 per token. Starting at just 3 cents, the token’s value has surged more than eightfold, reflecting robust investor confidence and market demand. This exponential growth not only highlights its potential but also solidifies its standing in the competitive crypto landscape.

This critical review ensures that the platform meets high standards of safety, reducing risks for investors and users. Such measures are crucial for gaining trust and fostering a secure investment environment, particularly important as the platform prepares for upcoming milestones.

This advancement is expected to further propel Rexas Finance’s visibility and attractiveness in the marketplace, potentially leading to increased adoption and investment. Conclusion In conclusion, as the year unfolds, the question remains whether Rexas Finance can surpass industry titans like Solana and Pepe coin. With its significant presale success, substantial fundraising, and robust security measures, Rexas Finance is positioning itself as a formidable competitor in the cryptocurrency industry. Its upcoming launch and the promise of listings on top-tier exchanges may very well catalyze its ascendancy. Investors and market watchers should keep a close eye on this emerging player as it has not only shown promising growth but also the potential to redefine market dynamics and investor portfolios in 2025.

Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal and Fred Thiel, the chief executive of crypto mining giant MARA, will speak at the hearing, which is slated for this Thursday, February 6th. Other witnesses include Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and Shayna Olesiuk, the director of banking policy at the non-profit Better Markets. Grewal recently argued that documents secured by the exchange show that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was attempting to sabotage a wide variety of activity in the crypto industry. Coinbase filed Freedom of Information Act requests related to the FDIC’s letters to banks about crypto services. Grewal says he’s seen clear evidence of a deliberate effort by the government to stifle the growth of crypto in the US. Last month, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said that whistleblowers claimed that the FDIC was destroying materials linked to its digital asset activities in the final days of the Biden Administration. The whistleblowers alleged that FDIC officials were closely monitoring access to the materials so they did not reach the Senate, according to Lummis. They also accused management of threatening some staff with legal action to prevent them from speaking out.

However, Studios are reluctant to get into business with an AI company, wary of how it might use their data. Two reasons why Hollywood is ignoring OpenAI. One; concerns about the use of AI were one of the biggest factors in two labor strikes that paralyzed Hollywood in 2023. Two; screenwriters and actors have been asking Hollywood studios to monitor tech companies. This is to make sure their work is not being used illegally. When it comes to the commercial potential of artificial intelligence, movie studios are off to a much slower start https://t.co/ZtB4f6I6Wf — Bloomberg Technology (@technology) February 5, 2025 OpenAI, worth $157 billion, started pursuing Hollywood after the introduction of Sora in early 2024. OpenAI leaders, including CEO Sam Altman, went to Los Angeles to attend some events in Hollywood. They met with movie companies, media leaders, and talent agencies to show them the technology. However, those talks have yet to produce any deals. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, said, “We’re so early with Sora “I think part of getting these things right is you can’t just say, ‘Okay, we have a model, now we’re going to force a partnership.” The company is engaged with the industry, he said, adding that “their feedback is super valuable.” Film studios are afraid of selling their assets without a plan on how to get paid Talks with studios have become more difficult. There is a lot to be cautious about. For status, companies like Google, Meta, and Netflix take viewers and advertisers often using their content. Therefore, film studios are hesitant to give their valuable assets to another big tech company without getting a lot of money in return. In addition, record labels made billions by owning shares in Spotify. However, major companies did not invest in newer platforms like YouTube or Netflix, where most filmmakers put their content. Some studios have also discussed the possibility of licensing their movie and TV show catalogs to OpenAI. These deals could be worth millions and could help avoid messy copyright fights. The talks are still in the early stages and haven’t moved forward. The companies and OpenAI haven’t agreed on a financial deal that suits both of them. It’s not clear how a company will share profits with filmmakers or actors who are supposed to get a part of the earnings from a project. However, OpenAI said that it might be too soon to quickly enter into business relationships for Sora. The only exception so far is Lionsgate, a mid-sized studio. In September, they made a deal with an AI startup called Runway to create a new AI model using Lionsgate’s collection of films. Lionsgate will use the technology to create videos for its upcoming projects. Lionsgate Vice Chair Michael Burns said, “Several of our filmmakers are already excited about its potential applications to their pre-production and post-production process […] We view AI as a great tool for augmenting, enhancing, and supplementing our current operations.” Still, many film execs believe that AI will lower the costs of animation and visual effects. In addition, a special version of Sora with OpenAI would use their characters for their own internal purposes. OpenAI’s Deep Research bypasses DeepSeek In other news, OpenAI revealed Deep Research.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While PEPE could beat DOGE and be the biggest meme coin in 2025, Rexas Finance is emerging as a new competitor. Table of Contents PEPE’s growth and potential Why investors are choosing Rexas Finance Conclusion Meme coins have seen Dogecoin lead for more than ten years. However, newer competitors like Pepe (PEPE) are proving to be fierce rivals with massive increases in a short period. PEPE’s rising popularity could surpass Dogecoin to become the largest meme coin in 2025. It has already shown its capacity to exceed DOGE in percentage growth. While PEPE has the potential to beat DOGE, the RWA altcoin Rexas Finance (RXS), could also see a massive surge in 2025. PEPE’s growth and potential Since its introduction, PEPE has been among the best-performing assets in the crypto sector, rising astronomically from its all-time low by around 94,631,571%. This kind of expansion has exceeded DOGE , reaching comparable benchmarks over several years. PEPE’s comparatively low market capital value compared to DOGE is one main reason supporting its predominance. The lower cap gives a greater possibility for exponential increases. Should PEPE keep becoming popular via strategic alliances and fresh exchange listings, its price may explode, and it may become the top meme coin. PEPE’s versatility gives it another advantage. PEPE innovates using more recent ideas in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, while Dogecoin mostly depends on its previous branding and community support. As more investors search for the next great idea, Pepe is a prospect for major future expansion. You might also like: New high-growth token at $0.20 gains favor with PEPE and DOGE holders Despite market swings, PEPE has shown tenacity. If this momentum continues, PEPE may surpass DOGE in terms of trading volume and acceptance in 2025. Furthermore, Pepe’s social media presence is growing and regularly attracting new investors. Skilled traders and big whale investors have seen PEPE’s potential and moved money from DOGE to PEPE. Should this migration persist, Dogecoin’s hegemony in the meme coin market could be in jeopardy. Why investors are choosing Rexas Finance More and more investors are focusing on actual asset-backed cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance aims to provide actual value by facilitating real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, including real estate, commodities, and intellectual property. Already exceeding 580% in its presale, RXS is competing with meme coins such as PEPE and DOGE. Its strong ecosystem is drawing investors, with RXS priced in stage 12 at $0.20, up from its original price of $0.030. Notably, there are one billion RXS tokens, and Certik has thoroughly audited the platform to guarantee dependability and security. Since September 2024, the RXS presale has raised over $45,213,059 by selling 446,063,005 tokens. Presale attendees can gain from early adoption, as RXS is planned to launch at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. Analysts project that RXS might reach $39.6, a 19,800% increase from its presale price. This optimistic estimate places RXS ahead in terms of development potential. Conclusion Though knowledgeable investors are seeing past the hoopla, Pepe could be the most popular meme coin in 2025, surpassing Dogecoin. On the other hand, Rexas Finance will offer real-world assets through tokenization, making it potentially more sustainable. Should RXS meet its expected $39.6 target, it could surpass DOGE and PEPE, demonstrating that, over time, actual utility exceeds speculation. To learn more about Rexas Finance, visit their website .

Viewed by experts as a competitor to Solana’s Pump.Fun, Pepe’s Pump Pad leverages the high scalability and network throughput of Pepe Unchained’s layer-2 scaling solution while benefitting from Ethereum’s security and vast, untapped user base. The meme coin launcher bodes well for PEPU’s upside potential. Unlike most meme tokens, the Pepe Unchained price is in the green over the past month. Several smart money investors have included it in their lists of best crypto to buy, considering its strong technicals and the growing demand for the new launchpad. Pepe’s Pump Pad — A Superior Version of Pump.Fun On Ethereum Pump.Fun has been a resounding success. Leveraging the low transaction costs and high scalability on Solana, it has launched several billion-dollar meme coins. Irrespective of the broader market uncertainty, Pump.Fun continues to record hefty revenues, considering meme coin traders continue to hunt for generation gains despite the market downturn. Just yesterday, the Solana meme coin launchpad surpassed USDC’s issuer Circle in 24-hour revenue. JUST IN: @pumpdotfun surpasses @Circle , the issuer of $USDC , in 24-hour revenue. pic.twitter.com/U48V4dsoik — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) February 5, 2025 In fact, Pump.Fun outperformed the Ethereum blockchain in January, recording an all-time high of $121 million in monthly revenue behind the TRUMP meme coin mania. However, the Solana meme coin launcher isn’t without its flaws. Reports reveal the platform has a “dead rate” of 98.5%, suggesting only 1.5% of the meme coins complete their bonding curve and list on Raydium. This is largely because a majority of developers are looking to rug investors on Pump.Fun. Furthermore, there are concerns about the quality of the project being launched on it, considering it has become a hotbed for scammers and fraudsters. In fact, the platform had to ban its streaming service owing to the depraved coins being launched. Pepe’s Pump Pad is aware of these issues and is tackling them head-on. Its meme coins have built-in anti-rug security, ensuring that the token liquidity is locked by default. Additionally, developers cannot implement buy or sell taxes, which avoids a plethora of scams like honeypots and rug-pulls. However, Pepe’s Pump Pad’s key selling point is Ethereum’s untapped user base. While Solana holders have enjoyed and benefitted tremendously from the meme coin mania, ETH holders have watched from the sideline. Considering ETH’s uncertain price action, its holders continue to look for high-upside Ethereum meme coins and Pepe’s Pump Pad could finally fulfil this strong demand. This new launchpad leverages Pepe Unchained’s layer-2 scaling solution, bypassing Ethereum’s poor scalability. This ensures its meme coins also benefit from the similar low-cost trading environment that made Solana the hotbed for the meme coin supercycle.

Experts see it as a potential rival to Solana’s Pump.Fun, with Pepe’s Pump Pad harnessing the impressive scalability and network speed of Pepe Unchained’s layer-2 scaling solution, while also leveraging Ethereum's robust security and expansive, yet largely untapped, user base. This meme coin launcher is boosting optimism for PEPU's potential gains. Unlike many other meme tokens, Pepe Unchained's price has been on the rise over the past month. Many savvy investors have added it to their recommended crypto purchases, citing its solid technical features and the rising interest in the new launchpad. Pepe’s Pump Pad: An Upgraded Version of Pump.Fun on Ethereum Pump.Fun has achieved notable success by capitalizing on Solana’s low transaction fees and high scalability, enabling the launch of several billion-dollar meme coins. Despite broader market uncertainties, Pump.Fun continues to generate substantial revenues, as meme coin traders remain eager for substantial gains regardless of market dips. Just yesterday, the Solana meme coin launchpad outperformed USDC’s issuer Circle in 24-hour revenue. JUST IN: @pumpdotfun surpasses @Circle , the issuer of $USDC , in 24-hour revenue. pic.twitter.com/U48V4dsoik — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) February 5, 2025 Indeed, Pump.Fun outperformed the Ethereum blockchain in January, hitting a peak monthly revenue of $121 million, driven by the TRUMP meme coin craze. However, the Solana meme coin platform has its drawbacks. Reports indicate a “dead rate” of 98.5%, meaning only a small fraction of meme coins successfully complete their bonding curve and list on Raydium. This is largely due to many developers aiming to deceive investors on Pump.Fun. Additionally, there are concerns about the quality of projects launching on the platform, as it has become a popular spot for scammers. The platform even had to suspend its streaming service due to the launch of inappropriate coins. Pepe’s Pump Pad is addressing these issues head-on. Its meme coins come with built-in anti-rug security, ensuring token liquidity is automatically locked. Moreover, developers are prohibited from implementing buy or sell taxes, which helps prevent scams like honeypots and rug-pulls. However, the standout feature of Pepe’s Pump Pad is its access to Ethereum’s untapped user base. While Solana holders have greatly benefited from the meme coin trend, ETH holders have largely been on the sidelines. Given the uncertain price movements of ETH, its holders are eager for high-potential Ethereum meme coins, and Pepe’s Pump Pad might finally meet this demand. This new launchpad utilizes Pepe Unchained’s layer-2 scaling solution, which circumvents Ethereum’s scalability issues. This setup ensures its meme coins enjoy a low-cost trading environment similar to what made Solana a focal point during the meme coin boom. Several meme coins, such as Vitalik, Number23, and Wen Lambo Frog, have already seen massive returns on Pepe’s Pump Pad.

PEPU is also forming a pattern of higher highs and higher lows in the short term, indicating a potential bullish trend continuation. With Pepe Unchained still having a market cap below $100 million, it's no wonder analysts anticipate returns of 10x to 100x from this meme coin, especially given the strong demand for Pepe’s Pump Pad.

In a press release on Feb. 5, the FDIC stated that the 175 documents pertain to the agency’s supervision of banks that “engaged in, or sought to engage in, crypto-related activities.” The report was released on the same day the U.S. Senate Banking Committee began its hearing on the impact of debanking in the country. It also follows a court order that set the deadline for their release as Friday, Feb. 7. You might also like: US Congress starts investigating crypto debanking allegations Crypto debanking, often referred to as Chokepoint 2.0, has been a contentious issue in recent months, with the FDIC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission facing criticism from various industry stakeholders. FDIC acting chairman Travis Hill commented: “I have been critical in the past of the FDIC’s approach to crypto assets and blockchain. As I said last March, the FDIC’s approach ‘has contributed to a general perception that the agency was closed for business if institutions are interested in anything related to blockchain or distributed ledger technology.” The released documents include correspondence with 24 financial institutions regarding their involvement or interest in crypto-related activities. The records reveal that the FDIC largely resisted engagement, frequently requesting additional information, delaying responses for months, and issuing directives instructing banks to pause, suspend, or entirely avoid crypto-related activities.

I want to thank Chairman Hill and POTUS for your commitment to government transparency! We are putting an END to Chokepoint 2.0.” FDIC acting chair Hill has stated that the agency is reevaluating its approach. Key measures moving forward include replacing its Financial Institution Letter (FIL) 16-2022and creating a clearer framework for banks to participate in the crypto sector .

The fund would be based in Switzerland and BlackRock could start marketing it as soon as this month, according to the report. This would be the giant asset manager's first crypto-linked ETP outside of America. Blackrock's U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has been a wild success , accumulating nearly $60 billion in assets in just more than one year since opening for business. BlackRock's move would be the latest in a string of investment firms looking to dive further into providing crypto-backed securities in Europe. Kraken recently secured a license that will enable it to offer derivatives, joining others like Bitstamp and FTX EU. The company's entry into the European crypto ETP ecosystem could further fuel the competitive response that’s been seen among various providers, which include fee waivers on several products, some expense fees for ETP's have been as high as 2.5% . In the U.S., a similar competitive response came after these funds were launched in Jan. 2024. A lot of question marks still occur around this product, including the fee structure, which would have big implications for the performance of the ETP. “Don't know the fee yet, that will be a big variable,"" said Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas . ""U.S. ETFs blow away the rest of the world in cost and liquidity but either way shows commitment from the world's biggest asset manager who has a big presence overseas.""

Ethena’s ( ENA ) decline has mirrored that of most altcoins. For example, Ethereum has dropped by over 32% from its December peak, while Cardano has fallen by 45%. Despite the ongoing token crash, Ethena’s network continues to perform well. The total value locked in the network, or the USDe stablecoin market cap, has surged to over $6.12 billion, nearing its all-time high of $6.2 billion. USDe has now become the fourth-largest stablecoin in the industry, trailing only Tether, USD Coin, and USDS. Its 427,000 holders earn an annual return of approximately 10%, generated from arbitrage opportunities within the network. You might also like: Spark integrates Ethena USDe as ENA forms a risky pattern Ethena price technicals point to a comeback ENA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that ENA formed a double-top pattern at $1.3065 between December and January. This pattern, characterized by two peaks and a neckline, at $0.8470 in this case, explains why ENA has plunged nearly 60% from its highest level this year. Ethena has also dropped below the 50-day moving average, signaling that bears remain in control. However, on the positive side, ENA is slowly forming a falling wedge pattern. The upper boundary of this pattern connects the highest swings since January, while the lower trendline links the lowest points since December. With the two lines nearing their confluence level, a bullish breakout may be imminent. A strong breakout could push the price higher, potentially retesting the double-top level at $1.3062, around 130% above the current price. The bullish outlook is further supported by oscillators approaching oversold levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 35 and is approaching the key oversold threshold of 30. Historically, assets tend to rebound upon reaching oversold conditions. However, a drop below the key support at $0.4425, represnting the lower boundary of the wedge, would invalidate this bullish scenario.

More than 155 million tokens have been sold already with the Stage 2 token price at $0.017. Such overwhelming demand reflects investors' appeal to the YETIO’s meme-game-tied purpose. Why YETIO Stands Out: Play-to-Earn Dominance: Yeti Go, an adrenaline-fueled racing game created on Unreal Engine 5 by veterans from Call of Duty, The Witcher and Spider-Man, rewards players with YETIO tokens for triumphing in PvP battles. Here’s the Level 1 map! Deflationary Mechanics: A 5% token burn and a capped supply of 1 billion tokens enhances scarcity. Institutional Trust: Audited by SolidProof , YETIO prioritizes security—making it attractive to both retail and institutional investors. With predictions of a 10,000% rally to $1.7 by 2025 end, YETIO’s fusion of gaming and finance positions it as a high-reward asset. A picture of Yeti Go game - Level 1 Please note that this image is from a game currently in development. It does not represent the final product. Investment Outlook: SHIB vs. YETIO SHIB’s Strengths: Established community (Shiba Army) and ecosystem maturity. Burn initiatives and Shibarium adoption could drive long-term value. YETIO’s Edge: Explosive Growth Potential: Analysts predict a 1000% increase in post-exchange listings. Gaming integration drives genuine demand, unlike SHIB, which depends on market feelings. The presale buzz is similar to early SHIB excitement, but it has organized tokenomics. The Verdict: Which Coin Holds the Key to 100X Returns? SHIB's $15.3 billion market cap indicates slower growth than YETIO's, which is still in its early stages. YETIO’s future focus will be on creating a framework for the next generation of meme coins instead of chasing trends. With an entry price of $0.017, gaming features, and a contract burn clause, YETIO presents a strong risk-reward opportunity for investors seeking significant returns. If it reaches $1.7, a $1,000 investment in YETIO today could potentially grow to $100,000, eclipsing SHIB’s expected returns.

Whether it will recover from these heavy losses or not is yet unknown. Pepe’s overall market structure looks extremely oversold on the daily chart, although we may see an extension of the sell-off if the meme coin continues to supply. As we can see, it has rejected the $0.000008 level with a bounce and is now looking calm at the time of writing. Such a sharp bounce is typically followed by a buy, and from the look of things, the price will likely go up soon. If that happens, we may see a greener market in the next few days. Otherwise, the crypto may remain calm until it gathers enough momentum for an increase. Reclaiming the closest previous high should pave the way for the bulls and at the same time give them a little control to mount pressure for days. Breaking lower will not just cause another crash but might bring an end to the mid-term bullish run. But for now, there’s still hope for the bulls as Pepe is still within a buying range from a long-term perspective. While this market looks overstretched in the short term, it is noteworthy to say that the recent sudden rejection indicates exhaustion in selling from a technical standpoint. As a result, a bullish move is underway. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If the bulls take advantage of the oversold condition, we may see a climb above the immediate $0.0000114 level. Above it lies the $0.0000147 resistance along with $0.000018. Retaking the $0.000022 resistance should signal a trend shift. The $0.00001 level is holding as support. If the price dips below it, the $0.000008 level would be the next support to consider for drops. Below it lies $0.0000065. Key Resistance Levels: $0.0000114, $0.0000147, $0.000018 Key Support Levels: $0.00001, $0.000008, $0.0000065 Spot Price: $0.00001 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Can it Corner the Perps Market Next?,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/05/raydium-is-solana-s-amm-king-can-it-corner-the-perps-market-next,"Decentralized crypto trading engine Raydium is making a bid for Solana's multibillion dollar perpetuals market – and gaining traction fast. Raydium's weeks-old foray into offering these hyper-popular derivatives contracts – they allow crypto traders to speculate on price swings without holding the actual token – is already racking up $100 million in daily trading volume. It's now Solana's third most popular venue for trading perps, behind Jupiter and Drift, this ecosystem's trading heavyweights. The growth comes despite Raydium perps' nascency; its builders haven't poured marketing capital on promoting a trading tool that's yet to officially launch. ""Raydium brand still packs a punch,"" said InfraRAY, a core contributor to the project. The push caps Raydium's ascendence to the top of Solana's decentralized crypto trading landscape. Its automated market maker (AMM) setup, which enables anyone to spin up a trading pool of any asset, has been a difference-maker in Solana's memecoin era. And yet, most traders who use Raydium's swap rails never visit its website. Instead, they access its services through trading aggregators that split orders across multiple venues. This means potentially less activity for Raydium and, crucially, a weaker relationship with direct users, the traders. In industry parlance, these traders are the ""takers,"" the ones who execute a trade. Makers, meanwhile, are the ones providing liquidity, perhaps by funneling assets into Raydium's AMM. ""Raydium has done well on the maker-side,"" said InfraRAY, ""But greater network effects exist when you own the relationship with the taker."" Behind the scenes, Raydium's perps trading is being supported by Orderly Network, a trading project with roots outside the Solana ecosystem. Orderly allows perps traders working from multiple blockchains to trade assets on a unified order book. This provides smoother sailing for all orders. Orderly's month-old Raydium rollout is proving to be a major boon. Perps traders on Solana are now driving 25 percent of Orderly's total volume. ""We're trading anywhere from $200 to $400 million a day in volumes"" across the couple dozen projects that offer Orderly-supported perps trading, said CEO Ran Yi. Facilitating trades via Orderly – in lieu of executing perps transactions on-chain, as many of Raydium's more entrenched competitors do – can save the protocol money and better ensure transactions process correctly, InfraRAY said. But it also comes with its own cross-chain complexities that he said are still being worked through. Next stop: full launch. In a few weeks Raydium's perps service will be ready for a proper debut and shake off the ""public beta"" training wheels. Once it does, the teams behind it plan to push harder on marketing and outreach. Even at $100 million in daily volumes, Raydium's perps service is far from displacing the Solana DeFi ecosystem's top on-chain perps service, Jupiter. The best-known swaps aggregator's derivatives exchange sees nearly $2 billion in daily volume; the runner-up, Drift, sees double the volume of Raydium. But InfraRAY is confident Raydium can chip away at the bigger protocols' respective leads. For one, its perps service offers trading in vastly more assets than either competitor. Orderly allows for speedy listings of new contracts, meaning Raydium can move fast to capture, and potentially corner, new markets. He thinks the total addressable market for Solana-based perps is only set to grow. ""I expect there to be more competition and innovation. But currently Raydium has a seat at the table.""",Finance,EN,0,0,RAY|TRADING|SOL|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-05 19:08:10

This decision marks a shift in U.S. banking policy under the Trump administration, which has shown increased support for digital assets. Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill confirmed the changes during a Senate hearing, stating that the agency is reassessing its past approach to cryptocurrency regulations. FDIC to Change Crypto Regulations for Banks The FDIC’s decision to revise its crypto guidelines is part of an ongoing review of past regulatory policies that discouraged banks from engaging with crypto assets . Hill stated that banks seeking to enter the sector had faced delays, excessive scrutiny, and resistance from regulators. During his testimony, Hill explained, “Requests from these banks were almost universally met with resistance, ranging from repeated requests for further information to directives from supervisors to refrain from expanding crypto- or blockchain-related activity.” The FDIC has also released a series of internal documents detailing past communications with banks regarding cryptocurrency. These records were disclosed as part of a court order in response to a lawsuit by Coinbase, which had sought transparency on regulatory actions affecting the industry.

In its latest report, the firm warns that Ethereum in particular is showing signs of high volatility. Alphractal’s proprietary Normalized Risk Metric (NRM) for Ethereum currently stands at 0.38, a level that has historically been associated with increased market turbulence. The firm points to past examples in 2019 and 2020 where similar NRM levels preceded strong price swings, both bullish surges and deep corrections. For example, the NRM scale works like this: Close to 1: High risk and overbought conditions. Close to 0: Potential buying opportunities. Considering the current situation, Ethereum could enter a period of aggressive price fluctuations, posing both opportunities and risks for traders and long-term investors, according to the analytics firm. Alphractal also assessed broader market sentiment using its Alpha Crypto Sentiment Gauge, which aggregates multiple sentiment indicators including Twitter discussions and news coverage. According to the firm, the metric is currently positioned in Bearish territory, indicating increased caution among investors. If historical patterns repeat, Ethereum’s current NRM reading could herald a period of intense volatility, according to the analytics firm. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With experts forecasting further drops for Solana and XRP, Agent A.I. emerges as a potential haven. Table of Contents Solana price struggles XRP in 2025 Conclusion Market speculation suggests a possible downturn for Solana and XRP, raising eyebrows among investors. Forecasts hint at Solana potentially hitting $150 and XRP dropping to $0.95. As the market heats up, a new contender named Agent A.I. emerges, promising unique opportunities. Agent A.I., inspired by the rise of PEPE, aims to capture interest with its playful vibe and financial ambitions. During this period of volatility, the intriguing project offers a fresh presale strategy. With crypto enthusiasts on edge, the question looms whether this new player can carve a niche amid market shifts. Agent A.I. to take down AI scams The crypto jungle is now overrun with AI tokens — projects that promise next-gen intelligence. However, Agent A.I. is here to expose the frauds. Unlike many others, this is a 100% meme coin — no gimmicks, no empty AI buzzwords. Just chaos, comedy, and potentially massive gains. Agent A.I. is a Pepe in deep cover. Inspired by PEPE coin’s legendary 22,000% rally, this mission follows the same trajectory. Success isn’t promised — it’s up to the community to make it happen. No VC tricks. No corporate overlords. Agent A.I. is powered by the people — and the stronger the movement, the higher it moonwalks. Stage 1 entry price: $0.003333333 (because threes are magic) Final presale price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-stage discount: 98% (Translation: Buy early, stack more AGNT . ) The presale is just the training phase. Once AGNT goes public, the mission expands — KOL partnerships, AI-powered tools, and meme-fueled takeovers. Agent A.I. tokenomics: Community-first model: 25% of supply locked for staking & rewards. Total supply: 5 billion tokens — no surprise inflation bombs. Presale allocation: 20% of supply at discount. You might also like: Agent A.I. brings intelligence to meme coins Solana price struggles The price of Solana is currently between $190 and $243. Over the past week, it has dropped by 13.55%, with the monthly decrease at 9.58%. Despite recent declines, over the past six months, Solana has grown by 21.85%, showing long-term potential. The RSI stands at 46.09, indicating a neutral market sentiment. This suggests Solana is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for significant price movement. The recent drop might be a temporary correction in an overall upward trend. The nearest resistance level is $265. If Solana breaks above this point, it could rise by about 13% from its current high. The nearest support level is $161.36. A fall to this level would mean a decrease of roughly 12% from its current low. Given its performance over six months, Solana may rebound from recent losses. If it moves toward the resistance level, investors could see substantial gains. However, if the price continues to decline, it may approach the support level. Monitoring these levels can help predict Solana’s next move. You might also like: Pepe’s massive 2030 forecast, Agent A.I. to follow suit XRP in 2025 XRP has seen a sharp price drop in the past week, falling by 20.43%. The current price ranges between $2.25 and $3.04. Despite this recent decline, the coin’s price increased by 1.25% over the past month and surged by 270.51% in the last six months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP is 45.12. This figure suggests that the coin is not currently overbought or oversold. It indicates a balance between buying and selling pressures. The nearest resistance level for XRP is at $3.50. If the price moves above this point, it could signal a trend toward higher values. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $2.00. Falling below this level might lead to further drops in price. Considering the substantial growth over the past six months, XRP has shown strong long-term potential. Monitoring the resistance and support levels will be crucial. Conclusion Agent A.I. stands out as a promising alternative. This meme coin, inspired by the success of PEPE coin, aims to disrupt the market with its authentic approach. With a community-driven presale offering significant early discounts and a capped supply to prevent inflation surprises, Agent A.I. is poised for growth. Its plans for strategic partnerships and AI-powered tools post-presale further enhance its appeal. To find out more about Agent A.I., visit their website , Telegram , or X .

However, their price points have made it difficult for new investors to enter at an early stage. Now, a new altcoin priced under $1 is gaining momentum, with analysts comparing its potential to BNB and SOL. That project is Lightchain AI , which has already raised $15.1 million in its presale, proving that investors are eager to get in early. With its AI-driven blockchain solutions and scalable infrastructure, Lightchain AI could be the next big altcoin to follow in the footsteps of BNB and Solana. How Lightchain AI Stands Out from Other Altcoins Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a high-growth blockchain project by integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized networks. Unlike traditional blockchains that struggle with network congestion and inefficient processing, Lightchain AI leverages AI-powered automation to optimize transaction speeds and enhance scalability. One key feature setting Lightchain AI apart is its AI-driven network optimization, which ensures that computational tasks are dynamically distributed across nodes. This allows for faster transaction processing and lower operational costs, making it an attractive solution for developers and enterprises looking for an efficient blockchain infrastructure. Additionally, Lightchain AI incorporates a decentralized data marketplace, enabling businesses and individuals to securely share and monetize AI-driven datasets. This unique feature provides a new revenue stream for data providers while ensuring decentralized access to high-quality AI resources. Why Lightchain AI Could Be the Next BNB or SOL BNB and Solana have become major players in the crypto space thanks to their scalability and strong use cases, and Lightchain AI is following a similar path with its high-performance blockchain designed specifically for AI applications. While BNB’s success is tied to its role in supporting Binance’s exchange ecosystem, Lightchain AI takes a different approach by focusing on AI-enhanced blockchain functionality, enabling automated transaction validation and decentralized AI computations. Solana, known for its ultra-fast transactions and low fees, set a standard for efficiency, and Lightchain AI aims to match this by ensuring rapid AI model execution without the usual blockchain bottlenecks. With its unique AI-driven capabilities, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as an affordable competitor to BNB and Solana. Potential Investment Opportunity For investors searching for the next major altcoin before it takes off, Lightchain AI presents an opportunity to get in at an early stage while the price remains under $1. With its AI-driven network optimization and decentralized data marketplace, Lightchain AI is proving that blockchain and artificial intelligence can merge to create powerful new solutions. Just as BNB and Solana evolved into industry leaders, Lightchain AI’s strong presale performance and growing investor confidence suggest that it could be one of the best-performing altcoins in the next market cycle. As blockchain and AI integration becomes more essential, Lightchain AI is set to lead the way in this technological revolution. So, for investors looking to diversify their portfolio and take advantage of the growing demand for AI-powered solutions, Lightchain AI could be a promising opportunity to consider Lightchain AI Urls: Website | Whitepaper | X | Telegram Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Qubetics is emerging as one of the most promising altcoins, offering seamless cross-chain functionality and interoperability, while Bitcoin’s historical missed ICO remains an important lesson for investors. With Qubetics rapidly progressing through its presale and Bitcoin’s dominance continuing, let’s explore why Qubetics is among the top altcoins for massive return potential and why Bitcoin’s approach still sparks discussions today. Qubetics: Solving Blockchain Fragmentation Through Interoperability The blockchain industry faces a major challenge—interoperability. Most blockchains operate as isolated ecosystems, making it difficult to share assets and data across platforms. This fragmentation limits the full potential of decentralized technologies and hinders mass adoption. Qubetics is addressing this issue by becoming a Web3-aggregated chain, allowing seamless asset transfers, data exchange, and cross-chain functionality. This makes Qubetics an innovative solution for developers, enterprises, and everyday users, setting it apart from other blockchain projects. With its focus on blockchain unification and seamless collaboration, Qubetics is well-positioned to become a major player in the decentralized economy. Qubetics Presale Nears Completion with Explosive Growth Investor confidence in Qubetics is reaching new heights as its $TICS presale enters its final phase. The project has already raised $11.9 million, with over 18,400 investors acquiring 461 million tokens. Current $TICS Price: $0.0667 Presale Completion Price: $0.25 Projected ROI: 274.71% Post-Mainnet Price Predictions: $10–$15 With its strong roadmap, growing ecosystem, and focus on interoperability, Qubetics is one of the top altcoins for massive return potential. As it moves toward its mainnet launch, early investors could see exponential growth in token value. Bitcoin’s Missed ICO: A Unique Beginning That Still Sparks Debate Unlike many altcoins, Bitcoin never had an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Instead, Bitcoin was gradually mined from its genesis block, allowing early adopters to accumulate BTC without a formal fundraising round. While ICOs have helped many projects raise funds quickly, Bitcoin’s lack of an ICO provided decentralization from the start. However, this also meant that retail investors had no opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a set presale price, unlike projects such as Ethereum or Qubetics. Despite this, Bitcoin’s organic growth and early mining rewards created a different type of investment opportunity—one that rewarded those who believed in its technology from the beginning. While Bitcoin remains the most dominant cryptocurrency, altcoins like Qubetics offer a new generation of early investment opportunities with the potential for even higher returns. Why Qubetics Is One of the Top Altcoins for Massive Return Potential For those who missed out on Bitcoin’s early days, Qubetics presents a rare opportunity to invest before it enters the mainstream market. Innovative Technology: Qubetics is solving blockchain fragmentation through cross-chain interoperability, a major issue in the crypto space. High Presale ROI: With a projected ROI of 274.71% before launch, Qubetics is positioned for substantial gains. Post-Mainnet Growth Potential: Analysts expect $TICS to reach $10–$15, making early investments highly rewarding. Unlike Bitcoin, which never had a structured presale, Qubetics allows investors to get in early before prices surge. Final Thoughts: Qubetics Is the Altcoin to Watch for Massive Returns Bitcoin’s missed ICO is a historic event, but Qubetics offers an early investment opportunity that BTC never did. With interoperability at its core, a growing presale, and major post-launch potential, Qubetics is emerging as one of the top altcoins for massive return potential. With the presale nearing its final milestone, this could be the last chance to secure $TICS at its lowest price before its post-mainnet surge. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. How does Qubetics’ interoperability set it apart from other altcoins? Unlike many altcoins that operate on isolated blockchains, Qubetics unifies multiple networks into a Web3-aggregated chain. This allows seamless asset transfers, data exchange, and cross-chain transactions, making it more versatile and scalable than traditional blockchains. 2. Why is Bitcoin’s missed ICO still discussed today? Bitcoin never had an ICO, which meant no structured early investment opportunity for retail buyers. Instead, BTC was gradually mined from the genesis block, allowing those who participated early to accumulate BTC at incredibly low costs. This is often compared to modern altcoins, where structured presales offer early investment access. 3. Is Qubetics a better investment than Bitcoin for new investors? Bitcoin remains the most dominant cryptocurrency, but its high price and slower growth potential make it harder for new investors to see massive short-term gains. Qubetics, on the other hand, is in its early stages, offering high ROI potential with its $TICS presale and an expected post-mainnet price surge.

However, their price points have made it difficult for new investors to enter at an early stage. Currently, a new altcoin priced below $1 is gaining traction, with experts likening its potential to that of BNB and SOL. This project is Lightchain AI , which has already secured $15.1 million in its presale, indicating a strong interest from investors eager to join early. With its AI-powered blockchain solutions and scalable framework, Lightchain AI might be the next significant altcoin to follow in the footsteps of BNB and Solana. What Makes Lightchain AI Different from Other Altcoins Lightchain AI is carving out a niche as a high-growth blockchain initiative by integrating artificial intelligence within decentralized networks. Unlike traditional blockchains that face issues with network congestion and slow processing, Lightchain AI uses AI-driven automation to enhance transaction speed and scalability. A standout feature of Lightchain AI is its AI-based network optimization, which dynamically distributes computational tasks across nodes. This results in quicker transaction processing and reduced operational expenses, making it an appealing option for developers and businesses seeking an efficient blockchain infrastructure.

This feature offers a new revenue opportunity for data providers while ensuring decentralized access to premium AI resources. Reasons Lightchain AI Might Become the Next BNB or SOL BNB and Solana have secured their positions as major players in the crypto world due to their scalability and robust use cases, and Lightchain AI is on a similar trajectory with its high-performance blockchain tailored for AI applications. While BNB’s rise is linked to its role in the Binance exchange ecosystem, Lightchain AI adopts a different strategy by emphasizing AI-enhanced blockchain functions, facilitating automated transaction validation and decentralized AI computations. Solana is acclaimed for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, setting a benchmark for efficiency, and Lightchain AI seeks to match this by ensuring swift AI model execution without typical blockchain constraints. With its distinctive AI-driven features, Lightchain AI positions itself as an affordable rival to BNB and Solana. An Emerging Investment Prospect For investors aiming to find the next major altcoin before it skyrockets, Lightchain AI offers a chance to invest at an early stage while its price remains under $1. With its AI-driven network optimization and decentralized data marketplace, Lightchain AI is demonstrating how blockchain and artificial intelligence can converge to create formidable new solutions. Just as BNB and Solana have become industry leaders, Lightchain AI’s impressive presale performance and rising investor confidence indicate that it could be one of the top-performing altcoins in the forthcoming market cycle. As the integration of blockchain and AI becomes increasingly vital, Lightchain AI is poised to lead this technological shift. Therefore, for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-powered solutions, Lightchain AI could be a promising option worth considering.

Will Blackrock expansion of Bitcoin ETFs to Europe could sway momentum? Bitcoin (BTC) Consolidates as BlackRock’s ETF Expansion Eyes Europe Bitcoin (BTC) remained tightly range-bound between $95,000 and $100,000 on Wednesday, Feb. 5, as broader markets faced bearish pressures stemming from geopolitical tensions. The renewed escalation in US-China trade disputes triggered uncertainty across global equities, leading to capital flight into safe-haven assets, including Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Action, Feb 5, 2025 | Source: TradingView As seen above, BTC price is consoldiating above the $96,45 level at press time on Feb 5, amid these macroeconomic headwinds, BlackRock’s move to introduce a Bitcoin ETF in Europe could provide a counterbalance or BTC price action in the days ahead. With institutional demand for digital assets surging, the world’s largest asset manager is positioning itself to capitalize on growing investor appetite across international markets. BlackRock Set to Launch Bitcoin ETF in Europe BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to list an exchange-traded product directly tied to Bitcoin in Europe. This move follows the overwhelming success of its US-based Bitcoin ETF, which has already amassed $58 billion in assets under management. According to Bloomberg sources, the fund is likely to be domiciled in Switzerland, a jurisdiction known for its crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Marketing efforts for the European ETF could begin as early as this month, although BlackRock has yet to confirm an official launch date. Blackrock Total Crypto Holdings as of Feb 5, 2025 | Source: ArkhamIntellingence The firm’s growing involvement in the Bitcoin market is underscored by its extensive holdings. Data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that BlackRock currently holds 582,000 BTC, making it the largest known corporate holder of Bitcoin. This figure surpasses MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserves, which stand at approximately 471,200 BTC as of Feb. 5. Beyond Bitcoin, BlackRock maintains significant exposure to other crypto-related assets, reinforcing its long-term commitment to digital finance. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, has increasingly advocated for Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against currency debasement. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Fink emphasized the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s value proposition among institutional investors. The success of the US spot Bitcoin ETF market has set a precedent for expansion, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leading the pack. The fund has shattered records, achieving the most successful ETF debut in history. With $116 billion flowing into the 12 US-based Bitcoin ETFs to date, the European iteration could attract significant institutional capital. BlackRock’s European Bitcoin ETF Could Shape Market Dynamics BlackRock’s strategic expansion into Europe introduces several key implications for Bitcoin’s market trajectory. Beyond unlocking new liquidity streams, the move could influence regulatory frameworks, decentralization trends, and risk mitigation efforts within the crypto ecosystem. Increased Decentralization With a significant share of institutional Bitcoin activity concentrated in the US, BlackRock’s expansion to Europe could further decentralize market influence. European institutions have historically exhibited cautious engagement with crypto assets due to regulatory uncertainties. However, a BlackRock-backed Bitcoin ETF could encourage greater adoption, leading to a broader distribution of Bitcoin’s ownership structure. Regulatory Harmonization The introduction of a European Bitcoin ETF could accelerate global regulatory cooperation on digital assets. Unlike the fragmented regulatory landscape in the US, Europe has made strides toward unified crypto regulations through frameworks such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. BlackRock’s presence in the region may prompt policymakers to refine oversight measures, fostering a more structured institutional investment environment. Mitigation of Political Risk The global cryptocurrency industry remains heavily influenced by US policy decisions. With former President Donald Trump signaling a push for increased American dominance in blockchain and artificial intelligence, potential regulatory shifts could impact Bitcoin’s market stability. By diversifying its Bitcoin exposure beyond North America, BlackRock is positioning itself to hedge against US-centric political and economic risks. Bitcoin’s ability to maintain support at $96,000 amid macroeconomic turbulence will be critical in determining its short-term trajectory. Should BlackRock’s ETF launch gain traction in Europe, Bitcoin’s price resilience could be further reinforced by institutional inflows, potentially setting the stage for the next leg of bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Major rebound ahead of $96k support holds Bitcoin price forecast charts shows BTC is could find crucial support zone at the $96,000 level. Historical on-chain accumulation data from IntoTheBlock shows the largest concentration of BTC acquisition sits between $69,565 and $96,481, with an average buy-in price of $85,515. This suggests a strong buy-wall at $96,481, which could serve as a floor for Bitcoin in the near term. Bitcoin Price Forecast: IOMAP chart | IntoTheBlock On the flip side, next major Bitcoin price resistance zone is located between $96,481 and $100,410. Should Bitcoin breach $100,410, it could open the door to further upside momentum toward the $106,839 level.

The Ethereum Network continues to undergo changes, boosting its scalability amid tight competition from new networks. Meanwhile, the Ethereum gas limit is above 32 million, with the community lauding scalability. However, the ETH price has struggled despite upgrades projected to drive adoption. Buterin Expects Pectra In March In a recent post on X, Ethereum’s co-founder informed the community that Pectra will be deployed next month. The upgrade is expected to increase the blob target to 6, marking a 100% rise to spur devs. This move will double the scaling capacity of layer 2 networks impacting transaction volumes and efficiency. Buterin suggested the blob target be staker voted, citing a need to grow the template without hard forks. Pectra’s anticipation from the community stems from its impact on eight major areas. On wallets, Pectra will aid user experience with programmability like smart contracts. Furthermore, it increased stake limits from 32 to 2,048 ETH, seeking to reduce certain validator challenges. An independent Ethereum educator, Sassal, explained that Pectra is the largest network upgrade in history. Post Pectra will see rising calldata costs with roll-ups utilizing blobs. General purpose execution layer requests with communication between the network’s consensus layer. Smart contracts will interact with the staking layer, removing the need for trusted oracles. “ Set EOA account code. This is probably the most anticipated EIP of the Pectra upgrade as it brings with it major changes to Ethereum user transaction flow via account abstraction. Transaction bundling, gas sponsorship, asset recovery, and more – it’s all coming with EIP-7702! Say goodbye to things like the approve>swap flow – now it can all happen in a single transaction!” What’s Next For Ethereum? Buterin has rolled tipped several network upgrades focusing on decentralization and scalability. Despite improvements to community core values paving the way for developer and user integration, the network has struggled to attain projected growth. Ethereum is the largest smart contract network, hosting various decentralized applications that lead to new users. According to several commentators, the network stands to gain from increased DeFi adoption and a spike in transactions. At press time, ETH price trades below $3K amid frequent dips sparked by low sentiments. The asset is expected to lead the next altcoin season as momentum soars in the United States.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|FORKS|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-05 19:18:23

The occurrence prompted an immediate investigation. “It looked like consensus was running, but validations were not being published, causing the network to drift apart,” Ripple technology chief David Schwartz said on X. “Very few UNL operators actually made any changes, as far as I can tell, so it’s possible the network spontaneously recovered.” Schwartz further noted that validator operators had to manually intervene to “choose a sane starting point” to create enough consensus to pull the network to a coordinated ledger stream. While XRPL has since resumed normal operations, Schwartz indicated that Ripple was still investigating the root cause of the network halt as his observations were merely preliminary. https://twitter.com/XamanWallet/status/1886913213779894586 According to the Ripple CTO, very few Unique Node List validators were forced to make changes to reboot the network, “so it’s possible the network spontaneously recovered.” No User Funds Lost The XRPL failure also sparked concerns about the safety of user funds, as approximately 80,000 transactions were delayed due to the incident. However, Schwartz quickly clarified that customer assets were not affected. “It just caused ledgers not to be seen as trusted for about an hour,” Schwartz postulated. “The servers knew the network wasn’t working correctly and so did not report any ledgers as trusted during the incident.” The XRP Ledger’s network failure comes as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse advocates for XRP to be included as a US strategic reserve asset, which President Trump’s crypto czar, David Sacks, will explore . According to CoinGecko data, XRP slumped to as low as $2.45 on the heels of the XRPL’s halt on Tuesday. The industry’s third-largest token has since recovered slightly to $2.53 as of publication time. XRP is still 25.5% away from its all-time high of $3.40, registered back in January 2018.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|WALLET|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-05 19:28:01

FDIC to Revise Crypto Guidelines Marking Huge Shift This development is part of the broader shift in the U.S. under the pro-crypto Trump administration, which aims to overhaul policies toward digital assets. Now, the FDIC may be ready to change how banks engage with the crypto sector. According to a Barron’s report, the agency aims to enable institutions to operate within the sector without needing prior regulatory approval. This includes potential “tokenized deposits” that could put some checking accounts on blockchains. The FDIC is revising its crypto guidelines as part of a review of past regulations that prevented banks from getting involved with crypto assets. Acting Chairman Travis Hill mentioned that banks wanting to enter the sector faced delays, excessive scrutiny, and resistance from regulators. FDIC Released Internal Documents Hill explained that most of these banks’ requests were met with obstacles, such as repeated requests for more information and orders to pause or limit crypto activities. The FDIC also released internal documents about past communications with banks on crypto, following a court order from a lawsuit filed by Coinbase, seeking transparency on regulatory actions. If the rules are updated, banks would quickly jump into the crypto space. Just two weeks ago, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan confirmed this saying that once the legal framework allows it, banks will actively participate in crypto transactions.

The rebranding comes just as the fund stopped its series of Bitcoin (BTC) purchases, though it still sits on the largest corporate BTC treasury. Retaining the same ticker (NASDAQ: MSTR), the company reiterated its status as the first and largest company dedicated to building a BTC treasury. The brand simplification aims for a broader appeal and recognition, and an image for a business intelligence company. “Strategy is one of the most powerful and positive words in the human language. It also represents a simplification of our company name to its most important, strategic core,” explained Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of the company in the rebranding announcement . MicroStrategy made its latest BTC purchase on January 27, with no signs of new fundraising. | Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The rebranding comes after MSTR had already accumulated 471,107 BTC, with the last purchase on January 27. MicroStrategy rebrands as BTC slides to a lower range The last purchase, completed in the price range above $100,700, was followed by a volatile period when BTC slid as low as $91,000. The market managed to recover close to $100,000 again even after more than a week with no new purchases. Despite this, the effect of the regular purchases was one of the major bullish factors for the market. Following the pivot to an AI analytics company with a BTC treasury, the coin continued to trade at $97,289.13, quickly losing the recent trek to $100,000. One of the few companies that partially offset the freeze in new purchases is Mara Digital (MARA), which expanded its treasury to 45,659 BTC, still under 10% of the MSTR purchases. The series of purchases depended on seemingly endless demand for convertible securities. The slower BTC price moves meant MSTR buyers also needed extra nudging, placing the latest fundraising round at a 20% discount . Despite expectations of a 2025 bull market, the MSTR purchases finally ran out of enthusiasm, as traders questioned the fundamentals of BTC. Michael Saylor’s fund pivots to AI analytics The rebranding follows the end of long months of regular and relatively predictable weekly BTC purchases, which happened during the latest bull market. As of February, the newly named company is also pivoting into AI-based business analytics. Strategy’s new approach hinges on Auto, its new mobile AI assistant with a focus on business and trading knowledge. The Auto assistant will be part of the wider Strategy One platform, aimed at business leaders and mobile users aiming for more streamlined answers. The new Strategy One platform bears little mention of BTC purchases, except for the general consensus of holding onto the coins acquired to date. Strategy aims for a more active outreach, already setting up a conference in Orlando, FLA, on May 5-8, 2025. The firm is also trying to engage the crypto community with the rebrand. The visuals of Strategy are closely tied to Bitcoin’s imagery and brand colors. However, the rebrand has not mentioned anything about extending the convertible bond sales to acquire more BTC. Following the news today, MSTR shares remained relatively unchanged. The shares traded at $343.56, near the lower range for the past month. MSTR peaked at above $473 in November 2024, despite some of its most active BTC purchases. The rebrand invited some skepticism, as traders questioned the role of Michael Saylor as a dedicated buyer of BTC in all market conditions. The Bitcoin-first identity aimed at signaling maximalism, but gave no indications of potential ongoing purchases. Previously, Saylor sparked controversy by leaving his role as CEO and becoming an Executive Chairman in 2022. Since then, he showed he had no plans of abandoning the company, and made his comeback story through the BTC bull market. The rebranding comes after the firm already established itself as the 195th most valuable US public company. As with all crypto events, the Strategy rebrand was reflected in the meme token market. Immediately, new Strategy tokens were created on Solana, as well as new volatile assets based on the MSTR ticker.

Notably, the Solana blockchain demonstrated exceptional performance in Q4 2024 and January 2025, with several key metrics showing significant growth. However, the Solana price is caught within a bearish phase, aligning with the prevailing negative trend in the crypto market. Solana Price Plunges Below $200: What’s Next? Despite SOL trading below the $200 level, the Solana price is poised for a significant breakout. According to an X post shared by Bitcoin enthusiast Lark Davis, Solana is nearing an “inflection point.” This means that the Solana price is approaching a critical level where it could either surge or drop. A breakout above the descending resistance line, marked around $200, could spark a price surge. At the same time, a drop below the $189 support level, marked by the 200 EMA, may trigger further downward momentum for Solana. As of press time, the SOL price is trading at around $198, marking a daily decline of 7.88%. Over the last week and month, SOL experienced a decline of 13.3% and 9.7%, respectively. With a market cap of $97.54 billion, Solana is ranked 5 th on CoinMarketCap. Notably, the token’s daily trading volume has fallen by a significant 31.5%, currently at $5.17 billion, highlighting changing investor sentiment. Will Solana Surge Past $280? Analyst Weighs In Bitcoin investor Castillo Trading deems Solana a strong cryptocurrency that has shown remarkable performance throughout this cycle. As per his analysis, the Solana price has successfully retested the lower limit of $180. $SOL looks strong. Great re-test of Lower Limit on flush. Holding well, first target is Median ML then Upper Limit $SOL has been a clear winner throughout thee cycle. Some say its because the meme ecosystem, regardless I'm sure $SOL stays volatile here. Need to keep eyes on it pic.twitter.com/kZbQQF7VQQ — Castillo Trading (@CastilloTrading) February 5, 2025 Solana’s next target is to break above the median line at approximately $230, followed by a possible rally to the upper limit of $280. However, the analyst warns of potential volatility in Solana’s price in the near term, advising investors to closely monitor its movement. Messari Unveils Solana’s 2024 Q4 Growth Messari, a prominent blockchain analytics platform, unveiled the Solana ecosystem’s remarkable growth during the fourth quarter of 2025. By the end of the quarter, Solana had secured the second spot in DeFi TVL rankings, boasting an impressive $8.6 billion, up 64% QoQ. In addition, Solana saw a staggering 213% QoQ growth in Chain GDP, increasing from $268 million to $840 million. The protocol’s applications raked in a whopping $367 million in November alone, marking the highest monthly revenue. Solana’s stablecoins also saw a massive growth of 36% QoQ. With a $5.1 billion market cap, the stablecoins on Solana ranked 5 th among the networks. Meanwhile, Solana’s liquid staking rate surged by 33% QoQ to 11.2%. During Q4, the Solana price saw significant upticks, with the token reaching an all-time high of $257 in November. January Marks New ATHs for Key Metrics According to Blockworks Research, “Solana saw unprecedented on-chain activity in January, leading to all-time highs on several fronts.” These include Real Economic Value (REV), app revenue, DEX Volume, and Stablecoin Supply. Notably, Solana’s REV hit a new ATH of $552 million in January, capturing a dominant 62% share of global on-chain transaction demand. Real Economic Value (REV) is a metric that gauges user demand for blockchain transactions, capturing the total value paid for executing transactions. Similarly, applications on Solana had a record-breaking revenue of $517 million in the last month. The decentralized exchange (DEX) volume also hit a new ATH and a staggering 80% MoM growth, amounting to $339 billion. The stablecoin supply on Solana also increased by 128%, reaching $11.4 billion. Interestingly, the Solana price reached a new all-time high of $261.87 in January, coinciding with the blockchain’s appreciable journey. Despite the current downtrend, analysts and traders remain optimistic that the Solana price will see an imminent rebound, surging past $200. As analysts remarked, if SOL surges past the resistance level, it could reach a new ATH.

As capital continues to flow into Bitcoin at the expense of alternative cryptocurrencies, many investors are now questioning the future of the altcoin market in the near term. Bitcoin dominance—measuring BTC’s market cap as a percentage of the total crypto market—has steadily climbed, reinforcing its position as the preferred digital asset for investors. The shift has coincided with a broader sell-off in altcoins, many of which have failed to sustain their gains from earlier in the year. Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that “altseason is over,” pointing to the sharp decline in altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. “The market is cycling back into Bitcoin, and historically, when BTC dominance nears these levels, altcoins struggle to gain traction,” the analyst stated. The term “altseason” refers to periods when altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin, typically driven by speculative enthusiasm and capital rotation. However, this trend often reverses as market conditions shift, leading investors to consolidate their holdings back into Bitcoin, widely considered the safest bet in the crypto space. Historically, Bitcoin dominance has fluctuated depending on investor sentiment and macroeconomic conditions. During the last major altseason in 2021, BTC dominance fell below 40% as Ethereum and other altcoins saw significant gains. However, the current market cycle has seen Bitcoin reclaim a commanding share, reflecting cautious investor behavior amid regulatory uncertainty and shifting liquidity conditions. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, has also struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin in recent weeks. While ETH remains a key player in the crypto ecosystem, its market share has declined as BTC continues to attract institutional interest, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year. The altcoin market, which includes thousands of smaller cryptocurrencies, has experienced increased volatility as Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. Many smaller projects have faced sharp declines, leading some analysts to warn of a prolonged period of underperformance for altcoins. Rekt Capital also highlighted that while individual altcoins may still see occasional breakouts, the overall trend suggests a prolonged phase of Bitcoin dominance. “Historically, when BTC dominance reaches these levels, it takes a significant shift in market structure to bring back altcoin momentum,” the analyst explained. Bitcoin’s growing dominance is also tied to macroeconomic factors, including inflation concerns, central bank policies, and increased institutional adoption. With the next Bitcoin halving event scheduled for 2024, many investors anticipate continued strength for BTC, potentially extending the altcoin downturn. Despite the current market trend, some traders remain optimistic that altcoins could see a resurgence later in the year if Bitcoin stabilizes and capital begins rotating back into smaller assets. However, for now, Bitcoin’s dominance remains firmly in place, signaling a more challenging environment for altcoin investors.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-05 19:36:00

In a new press release, the FDIC – the government agency that insures deposits in US banks – says it is unveiling 175 documents revealing how it supervised banks that participated in or were interested in crypto-related services. Travis Hill, Acting Chairman of the FDIC, said in the press release that the documents revealed today show the FDIC made it so difficult for banks to expose themselves to digital assets and blockchain services, that many of them gave up trying. “I have been critical in the past of the FDIC’s approach to crypto assets and blockchain. As I said last March, the FDIC’s approach ‘has contributed to a general perception that the agency was closed for business if institutions are interested in anything related to blockchain or distributed ledger technology’… The documents that we are releasing today show that requests from these banks were almost universally met with resistance, ranging from repeated requests for further information, to multi-month periods of silence as institutions waited for responses, to directives from supervisors to pause, suspend, or refrain from expanding all crypto or blockchain-related activity. Both individually and collectively, these and other actions sent the message to banks that it would be extraordinarily difficult – if not impossible – to move forward. As a result, the vast majority of banks simply stopped trying.” Last December, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Coinbase found dozens of instances where the FDIC asked banks to freeze crypto-related services. At the time, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the information all but confirmed the notion that the US government was attempting to undermine the digital assets industry was not a conspiracy theory.

The SEC Office of Inspector General completed the report more than a year ago, but the agency has yet to release it despite repeated Freedom of Information Act requests, according to the lawsuit . The lawsuit seeks to compel the SEC to disclose findings related to former SEC Division of Corporate Finance Director William Hinman. The investigation focuses on potential conflicts of interest involving Hinman’s ties to his previous law firm, Simpson Thacher, which had financial interests in promoting Ethereum ( ETH ). You might also like: Kraken may know Satoshi’s identity: Coinbase director SEC’s ‘silent treatment’ Empower Oversight has pursued SEC transparency since August 2021, filing multiple FOIA requests and lawsuits seeking documents related to agency communications with crypto entities. The watchdog argues that the SEC’s delays suggest a pattern of avoiding accountability in its enforcement actions. “The SEC’s silent treatment is old and tired, and its refusal to release these records is, quite frankly, suspicious,” said Tristan Leavitt, president of Empower Oversight. Leavitt emphasized that transparency is essential to addressing concerns over regulatory bias and ensuring accountability in the crypto sector. The SEC has faced mounting criticism for its regulatory approach, with industry leaders, including Coinbase, accusing the agency of selective enforcement.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While XRP’s path to $50 remains uncertain even post-lawsuit, WallitIQ emerges as a promising alternative. Table of Contents XRP WallitIQ Conclusion XRP investors have long hoped that the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC would drive the token to new heights. However, some believe that even if Ripple wins, the XRP price will likely face considerable market resistance, making a $50 target highly unrealistic. On the other hand, a new Ethereum token called WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a compelling alternative. Priced at $0.0420, early investors are capitalizing on its growth capacity to potentially gain significant returns. XRP Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC has been a defining factor in XRP price movement. The Ripple case, which centers around whether XRP should be classified as a security, has been ongoing since 2020, causing massive uncertainty for investors. While some believe a favorable outcome for Ripple could lead to a surge in XRP price, market trends suggest otherwise. Even after Ripple’s key wins in court, the XRP price has struggled to break past resistance levels, showing that regulatory clarity alone won’t fuel a massive rally.

The app will also allow users to simulate crypto transfers for everyday purchases, such as coffee at Starbucks or paying for Spotify subscriptions. This feature bridges the gap between crypto and real-world usability, enabling users to use crypto in their daily lives. Unlike most wallets that provide only basic transaction logs, this crypto wallet will offer a detailed breakdown of all transactions, allowing users to track their spending accurately. This Ethereum token platform also boasts a sleek, user-friendly interface that guarantees smooth control. WallitIQ has solidified its reputation by undergoing a rigorous audit by SolidProof, which guarantees that the platform is free from vulnerabilities. Adding to its momentum, the project has announced the upcoming launch of its beta platform, which will offer advanced tools and services designed to improve user experience and simplify crypto transactions even further. Currently priced at $0.0420, this is a low entry point for a project that can potentially transform early investors’ modest investments. Conclusion While the future of the XRP price remains uncertain, WallitIQ offers an alternative with potential and lower entry price.

The retail trading giant Robinhood announced on Monday that it planned to roll out a prediction market for the Super Bowl on Kalshi. The company walked back that announcement the following day, noting that the CFTC had requested that the firm “not permit customers to access” sports events contracts. Explains Robinhood, “While we continue to work with the CFTC to understand their concerns, we are suspending the rollout of the Pro Football Championship market. We have rolled this product out to roughly 1% of our customers, and for those who already placed trades, we plan on providing the option to close their positions or take them to resolution. We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product. We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts. Robinhood Derivatives will continue to collaborate with the CFTC as we work to roll out a more comprehensive event contracts platform later this year.” The CFTC also announced last month that it was probing two of Crypto.com’s sports contracts, noting the contracts could involve gaming activity that is prohibited by commodity regulations .

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) have caught the eye of investors. Many speculative traders show a preference for SHIB. Meanwhile, YETIO is charting a unique course with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) features. Analyzing these coins highlights their potential value and the reasons behind the growing interest in these projects. Shiba Inu Price Forecast: A Hub for Whale Activity A noticeable influx of large crypto investors is creating new trends in Shiba Inu’s market dynamics. Although the price dipped last month, an increase in substantial transactions suggests a potential market turnaround for SHIB. Several analysts believe that if Shiba Inu's price crosses $0.000017 as shown on CoinMarketCap, it could progress towards $0.001, a milestone eagerly anticipated by supporters. Source: CoinMarketCap The fluctuations in price are linked to major holders influencing rapid market changes. The active SHIB community remains optimistic about future profits despite market skepticism. This backing, combined with short-term trading, positions SHIB for rapid growth if it continues to captivate both large investors and everyday buyers. Yeti Ouro: Leading the Way with P2E Innovations Yeti Ouro distinguishes itself with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) offering, Yeti Go. The game, developed using Unreal Engine 5, provides an immersive experience where players earn YETIO tokens as rewards. This blend of gaming and blockchain technology not only adds value but also enhances the token's utility for players. Investors are now strategically shifting their focus towards security, utility, and decentralized financial systems as the future of crypto innovation. This makes YETIO a strong contender in the crypto landscape. A video of Yeti Go game - Level 1 The financial outlook for YETIO appears promising. The positive response to the Yeti Ouro token presale indicates investor confidence in the project. The token is priced at $0.017, with a 10% bonus for all buyers. These presale details reflect market trust in the project's future. With the second stage of the presale reaching 58% of its target, the approach of Stage 3 brings potential price increases. The project's presale achievements are noteworthy, with over 155,000,000 tokens sold, enhancing its long-term sustainability. Tokenomics and Strategic Investment Potential Yeti Ouro's tokenomics are crafted to encourage long-term holding and participation. The project includes a strategic burn mechanism to diminish supply and encourage token scarcity. This strategy, along with a total supply cap of 1 billion tokens, establishes a strong basis for price growth. The financial framework of Yeti Go allows players to convert their gaming success into tangible value through in-game purchases and token staking. This system keeps players engaged and increases the value of YETIO for investors who foresee future gains from the project. Why Yeti Ouro Might Surpass Rivals by 2025 Comparing Yeti Ouro with major cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu highlights a unique blend of potential profitability and practical value. YETIO's Play-to-Earn platform offers tangible returns for user engagement in games, setting it apart from typical meme coins reliant on market sentiment. These characteristics suggest a potential rise in market value as new updates or the complete launch of Yeti Go unfolds. Conclusion: Blending Opportunity with Innovation Yeti Ouro positions itself as a compelling choice for investors looking to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios. The combination of quick profit opportunities and practical features makes it stand out. SHIB and YETIO are shaping the future of investment and trading in the crypto market. There's a clear distinction between these options: Shiba Inu targets quick gains through price volatility, while Yeti Ouro fosters value through its P2E game, enabling users to earn as they play. As the crypto sector continues to evolve, tokens offering both entertainment and profit are gaining the attention of those seeking better returns. Yeti Ouro emerges as a token that prudent investors should consider closely, with its presale indicating increasing demand. YETIO is poised for significant growth, with even top traders predicting it could achieve a remarkable 10,000% increase.

This move follows the rapid growth of Ethereum-based investment products and could lead to increased liquidity and price stability. Analysts suggest that expanded derivatives trading could influence ETH price, driving it toward $4,000 in the coming weeks. Cboe Proposes Rule Change for Ethereum ETF Options In a recent filing , the Cboe BZX Exchange submitted a proposal to amend Rule 19.3. The amendment would allow the exchange to list and trade options on spot Ethereum ETFs. The filing specifically mentions the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. It also extends to any trust that holds ether. The proposal follows a similar filing by NYSE American, which is currently awaiting approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, Ethereum ETF options trading could become a new financial tool for investors, similar to the options available for spot Bitcoin ETFs since November 2024. The Cboe BZX filing stated, “Offering options on the Ethereum Funds will benefit investors by providing them with an additional, relatively lower cost investing tool to gain exposure to spot ether as well as a hedging vehicle to meet their investment needs in connection with ether products.” More so, the crypto ETF industry has been growing rapidly. Notably, last week, the US SEC granted accelerated approval for the dual Bitcoin and Ethereum Bitwise ETFs. This decision marks a significant step in expanding regulated crypto investment options. However, the ETF still requires S-1 registration approval before trading can begin. Ethereum ETFs See Record Trading Volume Ethereum ETFs have experienced growing investor interest since their launch in July 2024. On Monday, the nine spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total trading volume of $1.5 billion. This surpassed the previous record of $1.22 billion set on December 19. The surge in activity came during a broader crypto market decline. The increased trading volume reflects heightened institutional interest in Ethereum-based products. It also signals a growing demand for exposure to Ethereum through regulated investment vehicles. The Cboe’s proposal for options trading could further increase market activity by providing additional hedging and investment strategies. Options Trading Could Boost Liquidity The introduction of options trading on Ethereum ETFs may lead to greater liquidity in the market. Options allow investors to hedge their positions and manage risk, making them a valuable tool for institutional traders. Increased derivatives trading could also reduce price volatility over time by improving price discovery mechanisms. Options on spot Bitcoin ETFs have been available since November 2024. Their launch provided institutional investors with additional exposure to Bitcoin while offering retail traders new opportunities. If Ethereum ETF options gain approval, they will follow a similar path, contributing to Ethereum price rally. Ethereum Price Action and Potential for $4,000 Target Ethereum is currently trading at approximately $2,741, with a 24-hour trading volume of $38.8 billion. Crypto analysts have suggested that Ethereum could reach $4,000 in the coming weeks, citing increased ETF inflows and broader adoption. The potential approval of Ethereum ETF options could further strengthen ETH price market momentum. However, a recent CoinGape analysis highlighted the importance of reclaiming the $2,800 level for Ethereum to maintain its bullish outlook. Failing to do so could trigger increased selling pressure, pushing ETH into a deeper bearish trend.

Dogecoin continues to thrive thanks to its strong community-driven support, while Cronos gains momentum through strategic partnerships and expanding its ecosystem. Amid these developments, Lightchain AI is emerging as a new contender that could join the rally. With over $15.2 million raised during its Stage 14 presale at $0.006 per token, Lightchain AI is poised to capture the attention of investors as a potential disruptor in the blockchain space. Could it become the next major player in the crypto world this cycle? Dogecoin – Original Meme Coin Still Leading the Pack Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a lighthearted joke in December 2013, created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a parody of the cryptocurrency craze. Featuring the iconic Shiba Inu from the famous ""Doge"" meme, it quickly gained attention as a playful logo and a humorous take on the crypto world. What began as a meme experiment has evolved into a dominant force in the market. Thanks to a loyal community and high-profile endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, Dogecoin has defied its origins and established itself as a key player in the crypto world. As of January 14, 2025, Dogecoin holds strong at approximately $0.34, continuing to prove its staying power in an ever-changing digital currency market. Cronos – Building an Ecosystem Beyond Payments Cronos, an open-source blockchain platform designed for energy efficiency, has been expanding its focus beyond just payments. The platform now incorporates decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, and the metaverse, alongside its payment-centric solutions. By integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Cosmos SDK, Cronos facilitates seamless interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems, enabling smooth migration for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This forward-thinking design supports applications such as yield farming, liquidity provision, and other DeFi services. Additionally, Cronos is advancing metaverse development, incorporating blockchain technology into virtual environments to enhance both user experience and virtual economies. These strategic initiatives are enabling Cronos to develop a comprehensive ecosystem that goes beyond traditional blockchain functionalities. Lightchain AI – New Contender for the Spotlight Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a revolutionary blockchain platform built for scalability, efficiency, and real-world application. Unlike Dogecoin’s meme-based success or Cronos’ ecosystem-focused growth, Lightchain AI integrates cutting-edge technology with practical solutions, addressing inefficiencies present in existing blockchain platforms. A standout feature of Lightchain AI is its ability to seamlessly scale, making it ideal for high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). The platform also integrates off-chain systems like IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave, providing secure storage for AI models and datasets. The blockchain itself stores metadata, cryptographic proofs, and access controls, ensuring data traceability and integrity throughout the process. The presale’s success, with over $15.2 million raised, demonstrates investor confidence in Lightchain AI’s potential to disrupt the blockchain landscape. By offering real solutions to developers and enterprises, it is positioning itself as a project with long-term promise in a rapidly evolving space.

Web3Bay is adopting a methodical, transparent method for its token presale with a well-planned 28-stage strategy that efficiently manages supply and demand. This systematic approach not only gathers the essential funding but also elevates the project as a promising Top Crypto for Long-Term Growth. The current phase of the presale (Stage 4) demonstrates this deliberate progression. Web3Bay has successfully garnered $1 million and sold 285 million tokens, indicating strong investor interest and belief. With tokens priced at $0.004562625 each, there’s still a chance for participants to invest at an attractive rate. Anticipated returns on investment at launch are over 6,400%, showcasing the tangible potential of this organized model. Supply and Demand Equilibrium for Sustained Growth Web3Bay’s presale stands out by managing token availability thoughtfully. Each phase progressively decreases the tokens available, fostering natural scarcity to help stabilize the initial market price. Early stages provide more tokens, whereas later stages reduce the amount gradually. This scaling back not only rewards early investors who support the project’s mission but also prevents market oversaturation. By the concluding stages, the scarcity is meant to sustain demand and price stability—key attributes in top crypto for long-term growth. This staged approach offers a contrast to typical “all-at-once” token offerings that might disrupt the market with abrupt price changes. Instead, Web3Bay implements a phased strategy that brings about a steady, manageable market introduction, favoring a balanced ecosystem instead of a sudden token influx which could destabilize the market. Establishing a Solid Foundation for Success Fundraising and token distribution mark the starting phase. Web3Bay’s structured presale is a key element of a larger strategy aimed at achieving long-term objectives. Through incremental price increases, Web3Bay focuses on steady development rather than merely initial excitement. This tactic ensures the team has the resources to fulfill commitments while building trust among investors and future users. Each phase of the presale builds upon the last, generating steady progress. As prices climb, they mirror the increasing trust and interest in the project. This phased approach allows Web3Bay to keep its community updated and involved consistently. By the launch, the project will have established a robust foundation, a committed community, and a price truly reflecting its market value. This careful strategy enhances Web3Bay’s potential as a top crypto for long-term growth. Enhancing Trust with Transparent Practices At the core of Web3Bay’s presale strategy lies transparency. By detailing each phase and maintaining open communication about pricing, token availability, and progress, Web3Bay builds a trusting relationship with its supporters. Investors have a clear picture of the project’s status, upcoming steps, and how their participation drives the overarching goals. The thoughtful release of tokens and regular updates help avoid the misinformation or confusion typical of rapid token sales. Instead of speeding through the process, Web3Bay ensures all stakeholders are well-informed, which boosts confidence and minimizes uncertainty. This transparency, coupled with a structured presale, strengthens its status as a top crypto for long-term growth. Charting a Path to Confidence and Stability Web3Bay’s 28-stage presale is more than just a fundraising mechanism; it’s a strategic roadmap crafted to promote sustained growth and market stability. The gradual decrease in token availability maintains price integrity, while systematic price increases build momentum and trust. Continuous transparency fosters community confidence. With $1 million already raised, 285 million tokens sold, and a consistently rising token price, Web3Bay’s presale model proves its efficacy. Early investors are poised for substantial returns, and the project is on course for a launch price that reflects real market interest rather than short-term speculation. This organized, transparent approach to fundraising and token distribution not only paves the way for a successful launch but also lays a solid foundation for future success. With a clear vision and a deliberate strategy, Web3Bay is establishing itself as a top crypto for long-term growth , benefiting early supporters and the wider community alike.

According to a crypto analyst, this new development could present an attractive buying opportunity for investors, especially as the market consolidates. XRP Price Golden Support Could Trigger Rebound A crypto analyst, known as “ColdBloodedCharter’ on TradingView, has presented a detailed technical chart analysis of XRP, discussing its current position, potential future trends, and key buying levels. The analyst disclosed that XRP is currently inside a Golden Pocket, supported by a 50-day Moving Average (MA) directly below it. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Shake Off Crash, Target This Major Resistance On The Road To $3.85 The analyst noted that his previous analysis from the day before was playing out exactly as planned, with the new Golden Pocket acting as a resistance level when approached from below. On a short-term outlook, the TradingView crypto expert expects no immediate breakout for the XRP price. This bleak forecast is attributed to the possible selling pressure fueled by the recent 500 million XRP escrow unlocks initiated by Ripple Labs earlier this week. The analyst also cited XRP’s current consolidation phase, which started 19 days after hitting a cycle high, as a barrier to an immediate bullish price breakout. The last consolidation phase lasted as long as 39 days after XRP had reached $2.91 on December 3, 2024. Looking at the analyst’s price chart, XRP formed a Bullish Pennant pattern, which led to an earlier breakout in 2024 before its consolidation phase. Based on this past trend, the TradingView analyst predicts that XRP could experience another two to three weeks of choppy price action before initiating its next big move. The triangle pattern on the XRP price chart suggests a strong rebound towards a bullish price target at $3.43 if the cryptocurrency can hold its Golden Pocket support. Key Buy Levels To Watch While ColdBloodedCharter projects a rally to $3.43 for the XRP price, the TradingView analyst has also outlined key buy-the-dip levels investors can watch out for in preparation for this potential surge. The $2.50 level will be a primary support area for XRP, offering investors a 6-7% discount from current low prices. Related Reading: XRP Long Term Potential Remains Extremely Bullish Possibility Of Price At $20 If XRP plunges further, the analyst expects it to reach the support levels between $2.25 and $2.30. He reveals that this price level is a much safer entry point and accumulation zone for investors, especially if Bitcoin (BTC) remains above $95,000. The analyst has also highlighted a steeper support zone between $1.9 and $2.00. This support presents a significant dip-buy opportunity and is expected to occur if Bitcoin experiences a sharp pullback to new lows around $91,000. While further market declines will serve as a buying opportunity for many investors, they also pose a risk to those who purchased XRP during price highs. The TradingView analyst has revealed that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is cooling down, suggesting weakening market momentum. However, he remains optimistic, predicting a strong reversal soon.

SUI Price Analysis Signals Market Shifts & Dogecoin Expands into Gaming,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-350-bonus-goes-live-sui-price-analysis-signals-market-shifts-dogecoin-expands-into-gaming/,"The cryptocurrency market is witnessing significant developments as investors search for the best crypto for 2025. The latest SUI price analysis highlights notable fluctuations in trader sentiment, while the Dogecoin ecosystem is expanding its reach into gaming. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has launched its most enticing incentive yet, offering a 350% FINALCALL700 bonus, setting it apart from the competition. With the BlockDAG mainnet launch approaching, whales are making their move, leveraging this limited-time opportunity before prices rise. As SUI traders monitor crucial price levels and Dogecoin integrates into online gaming, BlockDAG’s presale momentum is accelerating. SUI Price Analysis: Market Sentiment Shifts Amidst Volatility The SUI price analysis reveals a turbulent period following the release of 80.14 million new tokens into the market. This sudden surge in supply initially triggered a 30% price drop, shaking investor confidence. However, a 24% rebound quickly followed, with SUI stabilizing at $3.36 at the time of writing. The volatility surrounding SUI has drawn considerable attention, as traders assess whether these price swings are a temporary market reaction or a sign of a larger trend. Some analysts suggest that the recent decline was influenced by trade tariffs impacting transactions with Canada, while others believe that broader market conditions are playing a role. Amidst the uncertainty, traders are watching key price levels that could determine the coin’s next move. The $2.00 level is seen as a critical support zone, while $3.20 now acts as resistance. If SUI maintains support above $2.00, it could establish a new floor for stability. Conversely, breaking through $3.20 could indicate bullish momentum, paving the way for potential gains. Dogecoin Ecosystem Expands Into Online Gaming The Dogecoin ecosystem is evolving as developers explore innovative ways to integrate DOGE into the gaming industry. This expansion presents an exciting opportunity for Dogecoin to transition from a meme-based cryptocurrency to a functional digital asset with real-world utility. The latest initiative aims to enable DOGE payments within online gaming platforms, allowing users to make in-game purchases, earn rewards, and participate in community-driven gaming events. The expansion into gaming holds significant implications for Dogecoin’s future. Increased adoption could lead to greater transaction volumes, strengthening DOGE’s position as a viable digital asset beyond just speculative trading. Furthermore, the gaming industry’s multi-billion-dollar market presents a substantial opportunity for Dogecoin to establish itself as a preferred cryptocurrency for microtransactions. As more gaming platforms explore crypto payments, Dogecoin’s role in this ecosystem is likely to grow. BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 Bonus: The 350% Offer That’s Changing the Game As market dynamics continue to shift, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making headlines with its most exciting presale bonus yet. The FINALCALL700 offer provides investors with a staggering 350% extra BDAG coins, making it one of the most lucrative opportunities in the crypto space today. Since the launch of its presale, BlockDAG has raised over $192 million, with more than 18.3 billion BDAG coins sold. Early backers have already seen a 2,380% return on investment, and with this new bonus, even greater potential gains are on the horizon. The impact of this bonus is particularly striking when examining its financial implications. A buyer investing $100,000 at this stage would typically acquire 4,031,451.61 BDAG coins at the current price of $0.0248. However, with the 350% bonus applied, the total jumps to 18,145,161.29 BDAG coins. If BlockDAG reaches its projected post-launch price of $1, that same investment could be worth over $18 million. With whales doubling down on BDAG while the FINALCALL700 bonus is still active, the project is experiencing rapid batch turnover, and batch 27 is moving swiftly. Analysts predict that $600 million in presale funds is well within reach, signaling strong investor confidence in BlockDAG’s future. The mainnet launch, confirmed for this year, adds further excitement, as investors anticipate a potential price surge once BDAG enters the broader market. BlockDAG’s strong community engagement, innovative incentive structure, and expanding market presence make it a compelling choice for those looking to invest in the best crypto for 2025. With the presale gaining traction and demand surging, many believe this is a pivotal moment to accumulate BDAG before prices inevitably rise. Make Your Move Before It’s Too Late The cryptocurrency market continues to experience rapid shifts as SUI’s price volatility keeps traders on edge, Dogecoin’s gaming expansion brings new possibilities, and BlockDAG’s 350% bonus fuels presale demand. Each of these developments represents a key trend in the evolving crypto landscape, as investors seek to capitalize on emerging opportunities. SUI’s recent price swings highlight the unpredictable nature of the market, with traders closely monitoring support and resistance levels. Dogecoin’s entry into the gaming world introduces a fresh use case that could drive long-term adoption. Meanwhile, For those looking to secure a strong position in the crypto market, the FINALCALL700 bonus represents an unparalleled chance to multiply BDAG holdings before the mainnet launch. As the presale accelerates and demand intensifies, investors aiming to make their move should do so before the bonus expires and prices climb further.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) plans to overhaul banking rules to allow banks to engage in certain crypto activities, such as custody services and “tokenized deposits,” without prior regulatory approval, according to Barron’s. During the last major crypto market crash, regulators ensured that major banks had minimal exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets, which protected them from financial repercussions. However, this dynamic could change in the near future. After years of regulatory hurdles under the Biden administration, banks could soon get the green light from former President Donald Trump and his team to integrate crypto services. Trump, who has launched his own digital token, appears to be shaping a pro-crypto government, potentially allowing traditional financial institutions to compete with industry majors like Coinbase Global, Robinhood Markets, and BlackRock. Related News: JUST IN: MicroStrategy Decides to Change its Name - Here is the New Name and Logo The FDIC’s planned revisions aim to loosen restrictions that previously required banks to seek regulatory approval before entering the crypto market. Some financial institutions have already begun discussions with policymakers to advocate for offering crypto asset custody and integrating blockchain-based tokenized deposits, according to people familiar with the matter. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan signaled strong interest in the move, telling CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that banks would embrace the opportunity if regulatory clarity was provided. Banks currently have a limited presence in the crypto space, but expanding their role to include a broader range of services, such as depositing on blockchains, would be a sharp departure from Biden-era policies. The previous administration actively discouraged banking from having ties to crypto, citing concerns about illicit activity and financial stability risks. *This is not investment advice.

This bearish outlook is further supported by intraday traders, who seem to be strongly betting on short positions, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm CoinGlass. Traders’ Strong Bets on Short Positions Today, February 6, 2024, the on-chain metric XLM exchange liquidation map revealed that traders holding long positions are exhausted and currently over-leveraged at the $0.3057 level, with $2.26 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, traders holding short positions are dominating, as they are over-leveraged at $0.355, with $5.25 million worth of short positions at this level. Source: Coinglass However, these millions of dollars worth of positions will be liquidated if market sentiment shifts and the price moves in either direction. This on-chain data clearly shows that there is no power on the bull’s side, and the bears are the ones leading the XLM. The potential reason behind this negative perception is the bearish price action and the current economic tensions between the United States, Mexico, Canada, and China. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XLM has formed a bearish inverted cup and handle price action pattern on the daily time frame and is on the verge of a support or neckline breakdown. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if XLM fails to hold this level or breaches the neckline and closes a daily candle below the $0.32 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 40% to reach the $0.20 level in the future. Despite this bearish price action, the asset is still trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, indicating that XLM is in an uptrend. Current Price Momentum XLM is currently trading near $0.33 and has experienced a price decline of over 7.50% in the past 24 hours.

The Ethereum tracking website, ultrasound.money, reported that the total supply of Ether (ETH) currently is 120,521,523 ETH, an increase of 383 ETH since the Merge. It is worth noting that analysts say that this increase in supply is due to the Dencun upgrade, which happened in 2023. Ethereum System Changes Steadily The Merge marked an essential change for Ethereum from a Proof of Work (PoW) system to a more energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) system. One main goal of the Merge was to lower Ethereum’s inflation rate. It introduced a deflationary mechanism with EIP-1559 , which burns part of the transaction fees. This move reduced the overall increase in ETH supply, representing a significant change for the network’s long-term economics. However, the Dencun upgrade changed the trend. This update made several changes to Ethereum’s system, including new features that may have unintentionally caused an increase in ETH issuance. Meanwhile, this situation raises questions about how Ethereum’s deflationary methods balance the risk of inflation if future upgrades continue producing more ETH. The Process of Burning Ether Ether burning refers to the act of eliminating or withdrawing Ethereum from circulation. This can be accomplished in several ways, including sending Ethereum to an invalid address, bright contract burns, and proof of burn. Interestingly, burning Ether can have various benefits for the network, including lowering inflation and boosting scarcity. However, there are also negative implications, such as decreased network liquidity. Recall that in 2023, Ethereum volume in circulation was reduced by 100,000 coins after the merge. As reported by TheCoinRise, Ethereum’s coin supply has been reduced by 0.146% per year since the Merge. If the Merge had not occurred, the amount of Ether in circulation would have increased to over 2.52 million coins, or $4.9 billion. Ethereum Positioned as a Universal Tool Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted Ethereum’s founding philosophy . At first, he compared the Ethereum address to the principle of “text as a universal interface.” By this analogy, he positioned the ETH address as a universal tool for authorization across the blockchain ecosystem. Then, he called it the philosophy behind the main alternative blockchain. Furthermore, Buterin proposed a few solutions via some dedicated enhancements that could improve Ethereum’s future potential. So far, he has discussed The Merge, The Scourge , The Surge, The Verge, and the Purge. Meanwhile, Buterin acknowledged that the network is working on alternatives, including grants that allow recipients to stake ETH independently. Recall that the visionary co-founder revealed a comprehensive strategy to fortify Ethereum’s defense against threats posed by quantum computers. Also, he outlined a potential recovery plan in a quantum emergency.

Arca CIO Jeff Dorman says on the social media platform X that memecoins may fall out of popularity once tokens tied to real-world assets start being issued on a wide scale. “When every company, university, municipality and sports team inevitably issues tokens (sooner than you think), the long and short theses become pretty obvious: Long: SOL, DeFi (RAY, AERO, HYPE, JUP, AAVE), AI agents, anything powering wallet/stablecoin growth. Short: Memecoins.” Dorman notes that billionaire and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban asked him last month to explain what value and use such tokens could have. Said Cuban, “If Harvard or any of the entities you gave as an example minted and sold a coin, what is the value proposition to the buyer? What is the utility for the buyer?” Dorman outlined a variety of potential uses for tokens issued by companies, universities and governments that may give the digital assets value. “Parent buys Harvard coin when a kid is born. Can use it for tuition in 18 years, or trade it for a Yale or Pitt or IU token. Donors and boosters get token, and can participate in the growth of the school via partial revenues from sporting events, or a sliver of endowment returns. Many possibilities… NYC token: discounts on subway, fast pass through JFK/LGA, first dibs on renting Central Park for b-day parties. Can participate in the upside of NYC through surplus-based dividends. Replaces GO bonds and revenue bonds. No longer need real estate to bet on the growth of a city… Disney token: discount for Disney plus+, early access to content releases, fast pass at the park. Disney gives 10% of top-line revenue to holders to turn customers into evangelists (customers don’t care about DIS stock – this model of loyalty + quasi-equity token aligns). See BNB. Amazon: The first Amazon Prime user didn’t get Amazon stock even though she helped fuel its growth. Amazon shareholders don’t even have to be Amazon customers. McDonald’s – same thing.

Table of Contents Cardno’s potential for a comeback 1Fuel’s DeFi transformation Final thoughts Cardano (ADA) investors have been on a rollercoaster ride, watching prices tumble. With geopolitical tensions like the North American tariff war shaking up the market, ADA holders wonder if the dip is a golden buying opportunity or the start of a prolonged slump. Meanwhile, a new player is making waves, 1Fuel (OFT). With its security, cross-chain capabilities, and growth potential, 1Fuel is emerging as a project that could provide ADA holders with the acceleration they need. Cardno’s potential for a comeback Despite Cardano’s 21.05% price drop over the past week, some analysts remain optimistic, arguing that the current price signals a substantial buying opportunity. Nevertheless, a broader crypto selloff driven by geopolitical concerns such as the North American tariff war is still having an impact on the ADA price. Investors are watching for signs of a turnaround because Cardano’s price is currently below its major support levels.

This upcoming wallet stands out due to its cross-chain interoperability, robust security, smooth transactions, and smart privacy. Its one-click cross-chain transactions will enable asset swaps across multiple networks without requiring third-party services, allowing users to concentrate on their financial targets while 1fuel handles all the technological complexities with its AI-powered technology. Because of the constant cyber risks and the lack of adequate protection offered by many wallets, 1Fuel will employ cold storage, which shields assets from hackers by keeping them offline. Additionally, the wallet’s integrated privacy mixer will allow users to maintain complete anonymity by making each transaction untraceable. 1Fuel will also provide a P2P exchange, enabling users to trade directly with one another in quicker, safer, and less expensive ways. 1Fuel is currently in its presale phase making a strong buzz. Phase 1 and 2 of 1Fuel’s presale have already sold out, showing exceptional success. Stage 3 is currently underway at $0.017 per token, translating to 70% ROI for those who jumped in at the first stage. The presale has collected over $1.8 million in funding so far. Investors are offered a 20% bonus for early participation. Additionally, staking 1Fuel tokens will offer a 30% annual percentage rate (APR), allowing users to earn passive revenue while holding tokens. Final thoughts As ADA holders look for a way out of the market lull, 1Fuel is emerging as a fresh opportunity with real utility, high security, and massive growth potential. The presale is selling out fast, with 70% ROI already locked in for early adopters. To find out more about 1Fuel, visit their, website , Telegram , or X .

39963909,https://blockworks.co/news/congress-crypto-regulation-updates,1738789200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,The view from Capitol Hill,https://blockworks.co/news/congress-crypto-regulation-updates,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Congress has been busy (by its standards, at least) on the crypto front. First, David Sacks — the country’s first AI and crypto “czar” — hosted an inaugural press conference, during which he declared a commitment to keeping digital asset innovation in the US. House and Senate Committee leadership also took this opportunity to unveil a new bicameral crypto working group. If this sounds like a committee of committees, it’s because that’s pretty much exactly what it is. Meanwhile, Sen. Bill Hagerty introduced a new stablecoin bill. The language is pretty similar to text we saw last Congress, focusing on reserve requirements and audits. It also allows non-banks to issue stablecoins, and has at least some bipartisan support, thanks to longtime crypto advocate Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Then, today, we got the first crypto-related hearing of the session. The Senate Banking Committee this morning gathered to discuss debanking and so-called “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 .” The hearing coincides with reports that the FDIC plans to adjust its crypto guidelines and allow banks to participate in some crypto activities. It started out mellow enough. Chair Tim Scott talked about a life-changing loan he got from a community bank in the 90s. Ranking Member Elizabeth Warren said her office has identified more than 11,000 cases of individuals complaining of limited access to banking services. It seems both parties emphatically agree that debanking is happening , and it’s a problem. But what’s causing it and how to stop it are points of contention. It didn’t take long for the party lines to show. Being stripped of banking privileges for having a few bounced checks is unfair, said Warren, who focused most of her statements on individual customers vs. companies. Not so fast, Sen. Thom Tillis countered. Banks shouldn’t be forced to service all customers. “That’s called managing a risk,” he said. Whether or not banks that refuse services to certain businesses and customers are doing so out of risk management or at the direction of federal regulators was also a point of contention. “The CFPB is the one agency that is actively working to stop unfair debanking,” Warren said. “Right now, the agency has five different rules — either in place or in progress — that would help prevent debanking by addressing some of the root causes, from overdraft fee practices to religious discrimination.” The comment comes on the heels of the CFPB’s new acting chair, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ordering the agency to halt virtually all pending operations. Several Republicans argued the opposite. The issue of debanking is only exacerbated by federal agencies. “Under the Biden administration, we’ve seen the rise of what many are calling Operation Chokepoint 2.0 where federal regulators exploited their power, pressuring banks to cut off services to individuals and businesses with conservative dispositions, or folks aligned with industries they just didn’t like,” Scott said. Other Democrats took the hearing as an opportunity to voice concerns about DOGE, the new task force led by Elon Musk, and its access to the Treasury’s payments system. “The DOGE crowd, there is one person [who] maybe has clearance, and the others, we have no freaking idea,” Sen. Mark Warner said. He declined to use his allotted time to ask witnesses any questions. Like I said, politics is getting in the way.

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 348,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum ( ETH ) may soon regain $3,000 as support after bouncing off of a low of around $2,100. “Overall, the smart money bought this thing up pretty damn hard. It’s hit all the targets now down to 150%, so that’s $2,100 to $2,200… We are now looking for closes above $2,900. Another massive thing about this bar is that it had huge volume, and it closed back above all these previous tops at $2,700. That was the previous support area… It’s got to get back above this swing low here at $2,950 and then ideally above that 50% level at around $3,100.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube He also says that ETH in its Bitcoin pair (ETH/ BTC ) on the weekly chart may be forming a double-bottom pattern, which is typically considered a bullish reversal pattern. “ETH/BTC pairing, it needs to get back above these swing bottoms… Potential double bottom here with the December 2020 low, that’s back at around 2.2%, so we could be in for some sort of double bottoming here.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube ETH/BTC is trading for 0.02750 BTC ($2,663) at time of writing, down 2.83% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ripple’s XRP may print a bullish higher-low price pattern on the daily chart after bouncing from $1.80. “Maybe you got a little more downside here into a higher low with more fear coming into the sentiment.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube XRP is trading for $2.51 at time of writing, down 7.3% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, he says that Ethereum competitor Solana ( SOL ) may reclaim $235 as support after bouncing off a “panic” low. “We’re seeing another panic low [at $176.]. Typically from these panics, they are reversal points. So we could be in for a reversal here. And then you would just look to your next levels at the 50%, so $235 – so some close above $235, $250 ideally, that’s going to be a nice, stronger position for Solana moving forward.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Solana is trading for $205 at time of writing, down 5.2% in the last 24 hours. ?

Will LINK Overcome Market Resistance?,https://thecoinrise.com/explosive-growth-in-web3-adoption-1m-for-web3bay-new-shibos-unleashed-will-link-overcome-market-resistance/,"Chainlink is currently wrestling with market forces, with its price hovering around $27.41. The latest Chainlink (LINK) price forecast suggests that failing to maintain crucial support levels could see LINK prices fall to $20. The rise in Web3 adoption is significantly influenced by projects like Shiba Inu and Web3Bay. Shiba Inu has recently introduced ShibOS, equipped with 36 innovative features to tackle the scalability problems faced by Ethereum-based projects. Web3Bay (3BAY) , aiming at the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector, incorporates blockchain technology fundamentally. The platform offers token holders exclusive benefits such as governance rights, earnings from staking, and a 5% discount on purchases, attracting a large number of investors and pushing its presale past the $1 million mark. Investors from stage 4 have witnessed a potential return of 4,200%, with a launch price of $0.1959. Chainlink (LINK) Price Forecast: Could It Hit $33? Currently, Chainlink (LINK) trades around $27.41, with significant resistance and support from buyers and sellers. The latest Chainlink price forecast shows that breaking above $27.41 could trigger a rally toward $31 and possibly reach $33.36. Should sellers push the price below essential support, LINK might decline towards $20, where it anticipated buyers will re-emerge. The price movements depend heavily on the 4-hour chart’s symmetrical triangle pattern, showcasing the ongoing tug-of-war between bulls and bears. ShibOS Debuts with 36 New Features: A Leap Forward in Web3 Adoption? The Shiba Inu community has significantly advanced Web3 adoption by launching ShibOS, a sophisticated blockchain-based operating system designed to bridge the gap from Web2 to Web3. ShibOS offers an array of functionalities such as zero-cost transactions, identity management, NFT capabilities, and a ticketing system, providing developers a robust platform to manage large transaction volumes and address Ethereum’s scalability challenges. Web3Bay Unveils Exclusive Benefits & 4200% ROI for Token Investors Web3Bay initially captured attention by integrating blockchain technology into e-commerce. From its inception, it was clear the platform had potential, which has led to a gradual shift from traditional e-commerce solutions. This web3 crypto’s presale launched recently and has already gathered over $1 million, with upwards of 285 million 3BAY tokens sold. The first three stages of the presale sold out quickly, and stage 4—with tokens priced at $0.004562625 each—is almost fully subscribed. The integration of blockchain sparked initial interest, but it’s the unique advantages of the 3BAY token that have maintained user engagement. Holders of Web3Bay tokens not only access a decentralized marketplace but also enjoy a 5% discount on purchases. Additionally, owning tokens confers governance rights, empowering users to influence the future direction of Web3Bay. After the presale, the platform’s smart contract will be renounced, transferring full control over policies and future updates to the holders of the 3BAY web3 crypto. Other benefits include earning passive income through staking rewards, which supports the ecosystem. The most attractive prospect is the potential 4,200% ROI, expected for investors buying at stage 4 with a projected launch price of $0.1959. With such compelling benefits, the demand for 3BAY is increasing rapidly. As stage 4 nears completion and stage 5 approaches with a higher token price, the window for optimal investment returns is closing. For prospective investors, acting now could be the most advantageous move. Final Say From the Chainlink (LINK) price forecast to ShibOS’s Web3 tools, and Web3Bay’s innovative approach to e-commerce—each initiative showcases a different trajectory for the future of blockchain. The LINK price forecast is at a pivotal juncture. A break above $27.41 could lead to a rise to $31, but if the market tilts in favor of sellers, LINK might drop to $20. ShibOS is advancing Web3 adoption by facilitating the transition from Web2 to Web3. Its offerings, such as zero-fee transactions and NFT functionality, provide a seamless way for developers and enterprises to adopt decentralized technologies. Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce with web3 technology . Upon renouncing its smart contract, 3BAY token holders will enjoy a 5% purchase discount and obtain full governance rights, enabling complete community-driven governance. Investors who join Web3Bay before stage 4 concludes are poised to achieve up to a 4,200% return on investment, given the anticipated launch price of $0.1959.

However, in 2024, the narrative changed. Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, recently revealed that ransomware payments dropped 35% to $813 million. This marks a sharp decline, signaling a potential shift in the war against cyber extortion. A Promising Yet Unexpected Drop For context, ransomware payments are money victims pay cybercriminals to regain access to locked or encrypted files, systems, or data. This happens when ransomware, a malicious software, takes control of their information. In 2023, Evolve Bank, a prominent case in 2023 Attackers demand a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for a decryption key that restores access. This was seen in the case of Evolve Bank , which was targeted in a cyber-attack by the Russian ransomware group Lockbit in 2023 According to Chainalysis’ 2025 crypto crime report, the beginning of 2024 seemed poised for another record payday for cybercriminals. Ransomware attacks were rising, and payments were up 2.4% in the first half of the year compared to 2023. Reportedly, one undisclosed victim paid $75 million to the Dark Angels group. However, as the year progressed, ransomware payments took an unexpected nosedive. By the second half of 2024, fewer victims were paying up, driving down overall extortion numbers. Law Enforcement and Sanctions Disrupt Ransomware Laundering Bad actors have traditionally used centralized exchanges to convert stolen cryptocurrency into fiat currency. However, in 2024, this process became more difficult due to sanctions against the Russia-based Cryptex exchange. Additionally, the German police seized 47 Russian-language crypto exchanges that lacked KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. This move disrupted important money laundering channels. With these roadblocks, many ransomware groups hesitated to cash out their earnings. They feared that blockchain analysis tools would expose them, dampening their ability to profit from attacks. In late October, Ryuki Hayashi, a 25-year-old from Japan, landed in legal trouble for crypto ransomware offenses. He was sentenced to three years in prison for his involvement in creating a crypto asset extortion tool using generative AI. This case serves as a warning for bad actors that developing tools for crypto extortion can lead to severe legal consequences. Fewer Victims Are Paying Up Even though ransomware attacks increased, fewer victims met the attackers’ demands. Chainalysis reported a growing gap between the ransoms demanded and the actual amounts paid. In the second half of 2024, this gap widened to 53%, meaning that while more organizations were targeted, many refused to pay. Those who did settle typically sent between $150,000 and $250,000, far less than attackers initially demanded. While ransomware remains a significant threat, the drop in extorted funds signals that the tide may turn against cyber criminals. If the current trend continues, 2025 could bring even more pressure on attackers and fewer payouts for their schemes.

In 2020, Solana’s ICO launched at just $0.22 per token. Back then, it seemed like another risky bet in the crowded crypto space. But fast forward to 2021, and Solana’s price skyrocketed to an all-time high of $294.81. That’s over a 1,300x return. Imagine tossing in just $100—that modest investment would’ve turned into more than $130,000. For those who hesitated, it was a tough pill to swallow. What felt like a gamble at the time became one of the most significant wealth-building opportunities in the crypto world. The worst part? The only thing standing between many people and life-changing money was hesitation. Now, here’s the thing—opportunities like that don’t come around often, but when they do, they rarely knock twice. Enter Qubetics ($TICS ), a project that’s gearing up to be the next big crypto to explode. This isn’t some recycled idea or a knockoff riding the coattails of past giants. Qubetics is carving its own path with groundbreaking technology, and it’s giving people a second chance to catch a wave that could potentially be as massive as Solana’s rise—or maybe even bigger. If you missed Solana’s rocket, Qubetics might just be your redemption shot. Why Missing the Qubetics Presale Could Be a Huge Loss Let’s be real—missing out on Solana was painful, but missing the Qubetics presale could hurt even more, especially when you realize how many chances you’ve already let slip by. First off, there was the Qubetics whitelist, an exclusive early access period where smart investors got the inside scoop before anyone else. No upfront investment was needed—just a simple sign-up to secure a spot. Then came the presale at an unbelievable price of $0.01 per token, but only for those who were quick enough to jump on board. That’s long gone now, and so are the first 19 presale stages where prices were dramatically lower than they are today. But here’s the good news—you’re not out of the game yet. Qubetics is currently in its 20th presale stage, with tokens priced at $0.0667. Sure, it’s higher than the early bird prices, but compared to where it’s projected to go, it’s still incredibly affordable. Each presale stage lasts only seven days, wrapping up every Sunday at midnight. The kicker? With every new stage, there’s an automatic 10% price increase. This isn’t just a marketing gimmick; it’s a structure designed to reward early investors and build momentum. Every week you wait means you’re literally paying more for the same thing. Qubetics presale has already raised over $11.9 million, with more than 461 million $TICS tokens sold to over 18,400 holders. These aren’t just random numbers—they represent real people who saw the opportunity and jumped in while the price was still within reach. The question is, are you going to be one of them, or will you be the person reading about Qubetics in a year, wishing you’d gotten in early? Now, let’s talk potential. Analysts predict that by the time the presale wraps up, $TICS could hit $0.25, offering a staggering 274.70% return on investment (ROI). But it doesn’t stop there. Post-presale, $TICS could soar to $1, translating to a 1,398.82% ROI. Imagine it climbing to $5—that’s a 7,394.11% ROI. And if projections hold true, with Qubetics hitting $15 after its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, you’d be looking at an astronomical 22,382.34% ROI. Let’s put that into perspective. If someone invests $100 right now at the current price of $0.0667, and Qubetics reaches $10 after its mainnet launch, that small investment could balloon to over $14,888.23. That’s not just a win—that’s life-changing money. What makes Qubetics stand out isn’t just its token price; it’s the tech behind it. Enter the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

It simplifies what was once complicated, making the benefits of blockchain accessible to everyone. How Solana Went from Risky Bet to Millionaire Maker Solana’s story is the kind of crypto fairy tale people love to talk about. Back in March 2020, Solana launched its ICO with tokens priced at just $0.22. At the time, crypto enthusiasts were skeptical. Ethereum dominated the space, and many thought there was no room for another smart contract platform. Fast forward to 2021, and Solana hit its all-time high of $294.81. That’s a mind-blowing return of over 1,300x. If someone had invested just $500 in Solana’s ICO, they’d have been sitting on over $650,000 at its peak. The crazy part? Solana’s success wasn’t just dumb luck. It solved real problems. Its blazing-fast transaction speeds, ultra-low fees, and scalability made it a favorite for developers and investors alike. While Ethereum struggled with congestion and sky-high gas fees, Solana kept things smooth, fast, and cheap. But here’s the kicker—despite all that potential, plenty of people still hesitated. Maybe they thought it was too risky, or maybe they just didn’t believe another Ethereum rival could make waves. Those who waited on the sidelines watched as Solana transformed from an underdog to a crypto powerhouse. And now, they’re left wondering, “What if?” The lesson here? Sometimes, the biggest risk is not taking one at all. The Final Word on Why You Shouldn’t Miss Qubetics If there’s one thing history has taught crypto investors, it’s that early opportunities don’t wait around. Solana was once just a name on an obscure ICO list, and now it’s a multi-billion-dollar project. Qubetics is standing at that same crossroads right now, with the potential to be the next big crypto to explode . The Qubetics presale is your shot to get in early, before the world catches on. Each stage lasts only seven days, with prices jumping 10% every week. The clock’s ticking, and hesitation could cost more than just a few dollars—it could mean missing out on life-changing returns. Don’t be the person reading about Qubetics’ success story a year from now, wishing you’d acted sooner. Join the Qubetics presale today and secure your chance at a future you’ll thank yourself for.

However, the HBAR price is poised for a notable upsurge, primarily driven by the platform’s major developments. HBAR Price To Reach $1.9: Analyst Insights Crypto enthusiast Merlijn The Trader shared an X post , predicting the HBAR price’s potential upswing. Positing that a higher move is imminent, the trader wrote, “HBAR is ready for liftoff.” According to his analysis, the HBAR price will reach a high of $0.3 in the near future. Notably, Merlijn The Trader’s analysis highlighted HBAR’s robust retest of a crucial resistance level, maintaining its parabolic structure and gaining momentum for a potential upward move. Meanwhile, another prominent figure, Solberg Invest, provided a more ambitious forecast. According to the crypto aspirant, the HBAR price could reach even the $0.9 mark. Is History Being Repeated? In his X post, analyst Rekt Capital, HBAR’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed overbought signs, similar to those seen in 2021. Thus, HBAR’s price has pulled back to a specific area, marked as an orange circle within the graph. In 2021, when HBAR’s price stabilized around $1.5, it sparked a significant bullish rally. The rally pushed the token to a high of around $5. With HBAR currently hovering around the same level as in 2021, the analyst predicts a potential repeat of the previous rally, driving the token’s price even higher. Meanwhile, CryptoELITES, a well-known analyst, has set an even more bold target of $75 for HBAR. As of press time, the HBAR is trading at $0.2442, marking a dip of 3.8% in a day . Over the last week and month, the token has seen massive declines of 21.4% and 22.6%, respectively. Only time will tell if the token can reach this lofty goal. What Drives HBAR Price Surge? “I think for this cycle, for example, a lot of people have been talking about the dinosaur altcoins, for example, that have caught a bid,” stated David Duong, head of research at Coinbase. Duong highlighted the surprising return of “dinosaur” altcoins, including HBAR, XRP, and Solana. According to him, the recent crypto crash has resulted in the rally of these tokens. Duong stated, I think that money is going to finally go into an XRP, into a Cardano, into an HBAR. Hedera is great. It’s a great protocol, and I think anybody who goes in, especially right now, they’ll reap the benefits of it six to eight months down the line. Similarly, Hedera has announced its first-ever HederaCon taking place on February 25, 2025, at The Arch in Denver, Colorado. These developments have significantly contributed to the HBAR price’s journey despite the current dip.

Tenreiro, who played a key role in shaping the SEC’s legal stance against crypto platforms, was transferred last week along with another top attorney involved in crafting controversial accounting policies that complicated banks’ ability to protect crypto assets. The SEC declined to comment on the reassignments. The agency’s softening stance on cryptocurrencies comes after political changes in Washington. With President Donald Trump back in office and the SEC now under Republican control, the agency appears to be making peace with the crypto industry. A staunch supporter of digital assets, Trump recently launched his own token worth $3.5 billion and issued an executive order on Jan. 23 calling for a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Related News: Unusual Move by the Gigantic Whale - Withdraws $10 Million from Binance, Converts It All to This Altcoin Tenreiro’s tenure was not a political appointment, making his reappointment a notable departure from standard agency transitions. Tenreiro’s tenure began under former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee who thwarted the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, and continued under Gary Gensler, who stepped up the agency’s enforcement of crypto firms. Under Gensler’s leadership, Tenreiro led the SEC’s special crypto enforcement unit and was promoted to head of civil litigation in December. His approach relied on litigation to assert the SEC’s jurisdiction over digital assets, arguing that many crypto tokens function as unregistered securities. While some cases have resulted in settlements, major cases, including a lawsuit against Coinbase Global, remain unresolved at the end of the Biden administration. With the SEC’s leadership change, industry observers expect ongoing crypto lawsuits to be resolved or dismissed outright rather than continued legal battles. Crypto firms have long argued that current SEC regulations are impractical for digital assets given their decentralized nature. *This is not investment advice.

New documents reveal new details of the so-called “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” Table of Contents What’s inside the new batch of the FDIC correspondence An unexpected ally What’s next? Following Trump’s inauguration, a pro-crypto team took the FDIC over and sided with Coinbase in the battle against the alleged debanking of the companies working with cryptocurrency. In 2024, Coinbase sued the FDIC. The move allowed the company to use the Freedom of Information Act to force the agency to release some of its correspondence with financial institutions. The FDIC released a portion of heavily redacted documents now known as the “pause letters.” Read more: Coinbase CLO: FDIC was trying to cover up its actions aimed to debank crypto clients Those letters showed that the FDIC was pressing financial institutions to pause all the operations of the companies using cryptocurrencies, effectively stripping them of the right to use banking services without a proper cause. This practice cemented the growing concerns of the ongoing “Operation Choke Point 2.0” under the Democratic administration. The new FDIC team is critical of their predecessors and released the new documents voluntarily, without relation to Coinbase exercising the FOIA. What’s inside the new batch of the FDIC correspondence Another 175 documents from the FDIC were compiled for release after the review made under the new chair, Travis Hill. The release date coincides with the start of the Senate hearing entitled “Investigating the Real Impacts of Debanking in America.” The documents may serve as additional evidence of the Biden-era FDIC’s efforts to block businesses dealing with cryptocurrency out of banking services. The newly released documents revealed that the FDIC pressed on more companies to debank the crypto clients. The efforts of the banks to resist or ask additional questions were met with silence from the FDIC that could last for months. On some occasions, the FDIC sent directives to suspend or refrain from all crypto- or blockchain-related activity altogether. The Coinbase CLO, Paul Grewal, who has been active and vocal in the battle against the debanking of crypto clients, took to X to demonstrate and comment on several excerpts from the published documents. He compared the actions of the FDIC to execution and called them “regulation by exhaustion.” One bank had allowed BTC purchases, but @FDICgov paused expansion, then an exam effectively killed the whole thing. pic.twitter.com/KhRypNVuiS — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) February 5, 2025 The documents illustrate that in the cases when banks and the FDIC made agreements that limited the services for the crypto clients, the Corporation made efforts to cancel such agreements and achieve wider restrictions. The FDIC was consistent in demanding the banks restrain from supporting the clients involved in crypto transactions despite all the efforts by financial institutions to convince the agency of the safety and soundness of such transactions. Judging from the available documents, banks were losing in this battle and halted all operations with the companies dealing with crypto. The refusal to make crypto transactions didn’t mean the clients were regaining banking services. This one is particularly interesting. It's an April 2022 @FDICgov internal note describing info learned from a meeting with a bank after sending them a pause letter in March 2022. Despite indicating that the bank performed due diligence and the customers' BTC would not be on the… pic.twitter.com/YtbLGAWgPq — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) February 5, 2025 The FDIC cited reputation risks, crypto volatility, and consumer protection as the reasons to deny some clients their right to use banks. An unexpected ally In the Feb. 5 hearing, both Democrats and Republicans agreed that the cases they investigated saw unfair denials of banking on political grounds. Surprisingly, even Sen. Elisabeth Warren, who is often seen as an outright enemy of cryptocurrencies, stepped in to investigate the unfair debanking and take action. Warren sent a letter to President Trump in which she expressed her willingness to work with the president, chairman Tim Scott, and Congress to stop debanking. In the letter, she shares some of her findings. According to her analysis, in three years, there were thousands of cases of unfair debanking, and over half of the complaints are related to four banks: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. It is indicative that her letter does not mention cryptocurrencies at all, meaning that Warren uses the crypto community agenda while not explicitly expressing her attitude towards cryptocurrency. What’s next? Now that the FDIC and the government become Coinbase allies, the anti-crypto operations of the previous FDIC iteration will probably be stopped. The bipartisan animosity towards the debanking initiatives is a strong signal of the change. Based on the press release, we can picture an approximate image of the future relationships between the FDIC and the crypto industry. According to Travis Hill, the FDIC is going to “reevaluate [their] supervisory approach to crypto-related activities.” It includes several points. First off, the Corporation is going to replace the Financial Institution Letter (FIL) 16-2022 . This letter obliges all the institutions supervised by the FDIC to notify it about any engagement with cryptocurrency activity and provide information for review. As we can see now, following these reviews, banks have been forced to stop working with crypto clients. The FDIC will work closely with the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Hill stresses that the FDIC will continue to adhere to safety and soundness principles.

Today, February 6, 2024, blockchain-based transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale transferred 1.239 trillion SHIB tokens, worth $20.136 million, from the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. 1,239,940,928,235 #SHIB (20,136,020 USD) transferred from #Kraken to unknown wallet https://t.co/PxsHyZ8BcD — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) February 5, 2025 Whale Moves 1.23 Trillion SHIB However, the wallet address for this transaction remains unknown, and such significant transactions following a massive price decline suggest potential accumulation. The current market sentiment appears bearish, as SHIB, along with major cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price drops in recent days. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Amid this market crash, SHIB has witnessed a price drop of over 35% and has reached the crucial support level of $0.000015, which has a history of price reversal. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if SHIB holds this support level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach the $0.000020 level in the coming days. However, the current sentiment seems unfavorable for the predicted level due to the ongoing economic tensions between the US, China, Canada, and Mexico. Nevertheless, this level appears to be an ideal buying opportunity. SHIB is currently trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, indicating that it is in a downtrend. Major Liquidation Levels With this price action, traders are over-leveraged at the $0.0000155 level on the lower side and the $0.0000165 level on the upper side, according to Coinglass data. Source: Coinglass If the market sentiment remains unchanged and the price falls below the $0.0000155 level, nearly $350k worth of long positions will be liquidated. Conversely, if the sentiment shifts and the price rises to the $0.0000165 level, approximately $625k worth of short positions will be liquidated. When combining these on-chain metrics with the technical analysis it appears that traders holding short positions are dominating the asset. Current Price Momentum As of now, the meme coin is trading near $0.0000158 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.80% in the past 24 hours.

After the end of the NFT and Web3 season, Ethereum is no longer the crypto casino, as traffic shifted to Solana tokens. One of the reasons for the outflow of Ethereum (ETH) users and a depressed market price may be due to the fact that the network is no longer the main ‘crypto casino’. After the slowdown of NFT trading and the shift of memes to Solana, Ethereum saw an outflow of small-scale users, though remaining a chain for large-volume DeFi activity. Uniswap remained the biggest market by volumes, but Raydium quickly took up around 30% of all DEX activity. The ratio of DEX to centralized trading is also at an all-time high, showing demand for highly speculative bets. Ethereum token launches slow down Ethereum lost some of its DEX shares to L2 chains, especially Arbitrum and Base. ETH led in terms of volumes, but not when it came to betting on new token launches. Ethereum carried between 10K and 15K new token launches per month in the last quarter of 2024. At that time, Base launches exceeded 250K tokens per month. Most token launches in the Ethereum ecosystem shifted to L2 chains. | Source: Dune Analytics All of that activity was still smaller than Solana’s Pump.fun launches, which exceeded 1.2M tokens per month. In January, Pump.fun extended the trend, creating over 1.71M new tokens. The lower and more accessible fees meant the cheaper chains could serve like casinos, where traders and bots allocated a few dollars to thousands of tokens, hoping one would break out. Betting on meme tokens requires minimal fees to be viable. Solana still requires priority fees and bribes to make sure a transaction is approved. However, the chain does not go through the fee spikes of Ethereum, where a simple swap has cost hundreds of dollars during busy times. Solana expands token bets outside Pump.fun Solana’s share of tokens launched outside Pump.fun is also increasing. The chain started carrying external project launches that do not go through the Pump.fun bonding curve. The infrastructure on Solana, with Raydium, Orca, and Meteora, allows for projects to build liquidity fast and gain more exposure for their token. In January, Solana benefitted from a wave of ‘official’ tokens, spearheaded by Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania (MELANIA). Other token launches followed, showing a trend of moving away from Ethereum and picking Solana as the default chain. Solana carried more tokens from outside Pump.fun, with a steady trend for more transactions not related to the launch platform. In December and January, Solana DEX carried higher volumes for tokens outside of Pump.fun. More tokens on Solana came from outside Pump.fun, including cult memes and AI agent assets. | Source: Dune Analytics Those external tokens are tied to meme cults, general launches, and even some utility assets. The tokens also came from the recent trend for tokenized AI agents, which launched on other platforms. Solana continues to tap small-scale traders, with the biggest cohorts carrying transactions under $100 and those trading amounts between $100 and $1,000. DEX activity allows for those relatively small traders to test multiple markets and liquidity pools without fees eating into their gains. Solana meme tokens delayed the altcoin market Solana was among the chains with the biggest count of daily active addresses. In December and January, active wallets moved between 5M and 6M daily , while Ethereum still carried under 700K active daily wallets. The shift to new meme and AI agent launches also delayed the shift to an altcoin season. One of the expectations was for funds to flow back into Ethereum tokens, including DeFi assets. However, traders switched to holding SOL and trying to bet on the next token to make it big. As a result of the increased Solana activity, the chain retained higher economic activity, with up to $30M in daily fees from the protocol and the leading apps and exchanges. Solana itself produced $4.33M in fees , with just $1.57M for Ethereum. Solana traffic is still heavily subsidized with new SOL issuance. The current price of SOL just under $200 reflects the constant inflows. However, based on the increased DEX activity and fees produced by top apps, SOL is seen as undervalued and overdue for catching up with ETH.

Speaking on Thursday, Hoskinson addressed questions about Hydra’s next steps, providing insights into its development, collaborations, and future plans. Launched in May 2023, Hydra, a layer-2 off-chain scaling solution is designed to improve transaction capacity and performance on the Cardano blockchain significantly. Since its launch, it has made impressive progress, attracting interest from various sectors. Hoskinson notes that one of the key milestones in Hydra’s evolution has been the ongoing Hydra Doom initiative, an ambitious experiment launched last year to stress-test Hydra’s capabilities under extreme conditions. The initiative, which is taking place in Las Vegas, pushed Hydra to its limits through a competitive video game environment. “ We chose a video game because video games are universally understood and have historically pushed the boundaries of what computers are capable of.” Hoskinson explained According to the crypto mogul, the results of the Hydra Doom experiment have been promising, with the Hydra protocol proving its capacity to perform in high-stakes environments. He also highlighted that the success of Hydra Doom has sparked significant interest from investors and partners eager to integrate Hydra’s technology into their blockchain projects. Independent companies like Anastasia and Sunday Labs are already starting to develop their own Hydra infrastructure, further accelerating the protocol’s growth. According to him, these companies will join the Input Output Innovation Group for several months of R&D, contributing to the continued development and integration of Hydra into Cardano’s ecosystem. “The goal here is an iterative one, not a threshold one where we achieve some magic new level of capability,” Hoskinson explained. The emphasis will be on continuous improvements, making Hydra increasingly applicable to gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and micro-payments. He also noted that Hydra has already shown significant value within Cardano, especially with the Midnight project, which has dramatically helped reduce costs. However, Hoskinson is particularly excited about Hydra’s potential in gaming, where he believes the protocol could unlock new opportunities for blockchain-based gaming experiences . “Hydra has proven it can do a lot of really cool and interesting things… and there’s a long road ahead,” he added. That said, Hoskinson’s comments also follow an update he provided last month, outlining his vision for Cardano’s growth in the coming years. In a video, he outlined plans to enhance Cardano’s interoperability with other blockchains and expand its core infrastructure. He also teased innovations like the Midgard and Gummy Worm protocols, which he sees as critical to scaling Cardano’s capabilities. As Cardano enters the era of zero-knowledge proofs and partner chains, Hoskinson’s vision for Hydra remains a cornerstone of the ecosystem’s roadmap.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|SPONSORED|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-05 21:29:31

To read full editions, subscribe . About two weeks after the SEC formed a crypto task force , unit leader Hester Peirce checked in. The rough message: We’re working on a bunch of things, but please be patient. Peirce (no surprise) criticized the previous path taken by the SEC. It “incessantly slammed on the enforcement brakes as it lurched along a meandering route with a destination not discernible to anyone.” Further, its handling of crypto “has been marked by legal imprecision and commercial impracticality” (in case you didn’t already know how Peirce felt). It’ll take time to “disentangle all these strands,” she noted several times — ongoing litigation included. Seemingly related, the SEC plans to scale back staff focused on crypto enforcement actions, the New York Times reported . Among 10 listed priorities, Pierce notes the status of crypto assets under the securities laws as “fundamental to resolving many other questions.” This jibes with what Bitwise general counsel Katherine Dowling told me about the “dolphins in the fish nets” — alluding to assets the SEC has previously labeled as securities . Another priority is to identify areas that fall outside the SEC’s jurisdiction — a signal the agency intends to stay in its lane. Other focuses include creating a framework for custodying client assets; offering clarity on if and how crypto lending and staking programs are covered by securities laws; and creating some sort of cross-border sandbox for crypto projects. On crypto ETFs, the task force will be clear about its approach when approving/disapproving planned products, Peirce promises. As issuers look to add staking and in-kind creations/redemptions to existing products, she added, the SEC may first need to make progress on custody (and other) issues. The SEC is working toward these goals “in an orderly, practical and legally defensible way,” Peirce made clear. And so, she reminds those eager for change: “It took us a long time to get into this mess, and it is going to take us some time to get out of it.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Despite the uncertainty, Solana remains one of the strongest assets in the crypto market, sustaining its bullish momentum that has been in place since 2023. Investors and analysts are closely watching this key level, as maintaining support above $200 is essential to confirm further upside potential. Related Reading: Bitcoin Looks Stronger Compared To Altcoins – Demand Remains Strong As Price Consolidates In A Range Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana’s current position. He noted that SOL is holding the key support level so far and emphasized the importance of a bounce from this region to sustain short-term bullish momentum. According to Jelle, reclaiming $220 is the first mission for bulls, as it would set the stage for another rally toward recent highs. However, failure to hold above $200 could spell trouble, potentially leading to further downside and a more extended consolidation period. With the market experiencing high volatility, this week will be crucial in determining Solana’s short-term trajectory. If bulls defend key support levels and reclaim resistance zones, SOL could be on track for another push higher, continuing its impressive run from last year. Solana at a Critical Juncture: Can Bulls Take Control? Solana has retraced 40% from its all-time high, sparking concerns among investors who fear a prolonged correction. While SOL has been one of the strongest assets in this cycle, recent price action has left market participants uncertain about its short-term direction. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target Despite institutional interest and a pro-crypto U.S. administration, the market remains plagued by doubt, with altseason narratives struggling to gain traction. The level of uncertainty surrounding crypto markets is unprecedented compared to past bull runs, leading to increased hesitation among retail investors. However, some analysts remain bullish on Solana’s long-term prospects. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana is holding the key support level around $200 so far. He emphasized that for SOL to remain short-term bullish, a bounce from this region is necessary. If bulls step in and defend this level, Jelle expects a surge above $220 in the near future, which could pave the way for a broader recovery. If Solana holds above $200 and reclaims key resistance levels, it would signal renewed strength and confirm a potential rally back toward all-time highs. However, if SOL breaks below support, further downside could follow, reinforcing bearish sentiment across the market. The coming days will be crucial in determining the next phase of Solana’s price action. SOL Price Holds Key Support At $200 Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $205, maintaining a crucial support level at $200. This price point is critical for short-term momentum, as holding above it strengthens the bullish case for another leg higher. If bulls can sustain this level and push above $220, a strong breakout could follow, potentially taking SOL back into all-time high (ATH) territory. However, if $200 fails to hold, SOL could face a deeper correction, with the next major demand zone around $180. A drop to this level could signal a longer consolidation phase, delaying the anticipated bullish continuation. For now, Solana remains in a decisive phase, where market structure and buying pressure will determine the next major move. If SOL reclaims $220, a rally back toward $250-$260 becomes increasingly likely. On the other hand, losing $200 would shift sentiment bearish, putting downward pressure on price action.

With a jaw-dropping 50,000% growth potential, this token has already raised $1.5 million in minutes during its presale. With Bitcoin (BTC) crossing $100,000 and XRP’s recent 500% surge might seem impressive, but none can rival the explosive potential and exclusivity driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN forward. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines XRP and Others 1. Massive Growth Potential: XRP’s 500% returns pale in comparison to the staggering 50,000% potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Early investors are already seeing the impact of this token’s high demand and limited availability, making it the standout choice for transformative returns. 2. Exclusive Sale Creates High Demand: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN. This strategic exclusivity has heightened interest and secured its place as one of the most sought-after tokens. 3. Strong Community Support: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN thrives on a loyal and engaged community, driving organic growth and market demand. This strong backing amplifies its visibility and positions it as a top choice for long-term success. How It Stacks Up Against Other Cryptos Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi leader, but its growth has plateaued compared to early-stage tokens like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability, but SOL can’t match the exclusivity and skyrocketing demand of this new token. Optimism (OP): A Layer-2 solution with promise, but its gains are modest compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s potential. Injective Protocol (INJ): A promising DeFi player, but it hasn’t generated the same overwhelming excitement. The Crypto Everyone’s Talking About THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already set new standards in the market.

The uptick came after CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared a photo of himself with the President-elect, sparking renewed interest in the crypto. Notably, XRP’s impressive performance over the past few months, especially in November when it surged roughly 300%, has reignited interest in the crypto asset, with analysts predicting even higher prices in the near future. On Wednesday, popular analyst “Charting Guy” stated that XRP remains on track for a potential repeat of the extraordinary 63,000% surge it saw in 2017. “ For those wondering, $XRP is still technically on track for 2017 if we manage to close the week in the green,” the pundit remarked . His optimism was rooted in XRP’s ability to recover earlier losses and the potential for a strong weekly candle close. Notably, the 2017 XRP bull run remains one of the most significant in cryptocurrency history. At the start of 2017, XRP traded around $0.006, but by early January 2018, it had reached its all-time high of $3.84, marking an astonishing gain of nearly 64,000%. The rise was driven by intense market speculation and the euphoric atmosphere that characterized the cryptocurrency market then. Meanwhile, earlier on Tuesday, veteran trader Peter Brandt weighed in on XRP’s price potential, sharing his view that the current market conditions may indicate another significant rise. Brandt pointed out the formation of a “flag pattern,” a technical indicator suggesting a temporary pause in an asset’s price before continuing the previous trend. According to Brandt, if the flag pattern is completed within six weeks, XRP’s market capitalization could soar to $500 billion, nearly quadrupling its current valuation of $139.72 billion. However, he cautioned that the outlook could change dramatically if the pattern fails to materialize. Beyond technical factors, analysts point to several other key drivers fueling XRP’s surge. In a Wednesday interview with FOX Business, David Stryzewski, CEO of Sound Planning Group, disclosed that Bank of America now processes 100% of its internal transactions using Ripple’s technology. This revelation has sparked significant optimism within the XRP community, further solidifying the cryptocurrency’s growing momentum. “Ripple is the second-largest coin, and before the SEC investigation, Ripple is going to be the track that everything runs on in the future,” Stryzewski said. “They even created their own stablecoin, and as I mentioned, Bank of America is doing 100% of its transactions with them.” Last Sunday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed optimism about the Trump presidency, stating, “2025 is here, and the Trump bull market is real.” He also highlighted Ripple’s renewed presence in the U.S., noting that 75% of the company’s jobs have returned to the country, signaling a positive shift in crypto regulations. Furthermore, with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stepping down, there is anticipation within the crypto community that the XRP securities lawsuit and other crypto-related lawsuits may be dropped, which could boost XRP prices. As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.42, reflecting a 2.38% drop over the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-05 21:35:24

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Shiba Inu struggles, PEPE and Rexas Finance gain attention for their potential to surge in 2025. Table of Contents Shiba Inu Pepe Rexas Finance: A utility-driven contender Conclusion Shiba Inu (SHIB) once enthralled the crypto community with its explosive ascent, making early adopters overnight millionaires. But in 2025, the winds have changed, and SHIB is finding it challenging to stay its ground in a growingly competitive market. On the other hand, two rising candidates — Pepe (PEPE) and Rexas Finance (RXS) — are claiming their place as the next significant crypto opportunity. As optimism for a SHIB revival hangs among its devoted audience, these tokens are becoming popular. Shiba Inu Meme currency buzz, clever marketing, and a loyal community labeling Shiba Inu the “Dogecoin Killer” drove its 2021 success. For a coin that began as a joke, SHIB’s peak saw it rank among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization — a stunning success. However, the crypto market is merciless, so significance requires more than just buzz. Though programs like ShibaSwap and SHIB: The Metaverse help increase its value, SHIB’s price has continuously dropped. The issue is the lack of notable creativity to keep long-term interest. SHIB’s attraction decreases when more fresh and fascinating ventures develop. Although its devoted supporters, the SHIB Army, remain hopeful about a possible comeback, many investors are seeking substitutes. Pepe Currently running with the meme coin torch is Pepe . Inspired by the internet-famous Pepe the Frog, PEPE uses the same social media-driven buzz that drove SHIB to popularity. Unlike SHIB, PEPE has shown flexibility and resilience by using the inventiveness of its community to stay current. Pepe attracts people seeking rapid gains and thrives in the fast-paced, meme-driven crypto culture. Its long-term viability, however, rests on maintaining momentum — a challenging chore in the erratic crypto market. You might also like: PEPE could beat DOGE and be the biggest meme coin in 2025 Rexas Finance: A utility-driven contender Rexas Finance is paving its path by stressing real-world utility. At $0.20 in its last presale stage, RXS presents a potential substitute for investors looking for a mix of low cost and creativity. The Rexas Finance ecosystem, which comprises a token builder and launchpad that will streamline blockchain project creation, appeals to companies and developers. The project has already drawn the interest of retail investors and whales, with almost $43.9 million raised in its presale and a planned launch on June 19, 2025, at a listing price of $0.25. Its Certik-audited system guarantees openness and security, reinforcing its reputation in a crowded market. What distinguishes Rexas Finance: Robust ecosystem: RXS is proving to be a pillar of blockchain solutions. Its token constructor and launchpad address genuine market demand, guaranteeing the token’s demand. Early entry potential: A presale price of $0.20 and a listing price of $0.25 let RXS present notable early investor upside potential. Those who missed SHIB’s early rise have RXS as an option. Certik audit: RXS distinguishes itself from many speculative ventures with its dedication to security and openness, providing investors with peace of mind. Conclusion Shiba Inu’s ascent and fall remind investors of how ephemeral hype-driven investments are. While its devoted membership dreams of a comeback, the crypto scene has changed to give younger initiatives the stage. Pepe and Rexas Finance represent the two sides of the 2025 crypto narrative — one motivated by meme culture and the other by actual utility. With its creative ecosystem, low entrance price, and market interest, Rexas Finance presents a new opportunity for investors impatiently waiting for SHIB to recover.

The stablecoin issuer is targeting a launch by the end of March 2025. Tether’s AI Push The latest initiative – known as Tether Data – will introduce applications such as AI Translate, AI Voice Assistant, and an AI Bitcoin Wallet Assistant. As per Ardoino’s announcement , the platform is built on Bare, Holepunch’s JavaScript runtime. It ensures compatibility across a wide range of devices, from embedded systems and budget smartphones to high-performance laptops and server clusters. A key component of this initiative is Tether’s open-source AI SDK, which is also built on Bare and is designed to run seamlessly across all hardware types. Tether Data’s applications will prioritize local device operation, in a bid to ensure full privacy and self-custody of both data and funds. Its AI ambitions were evident as early as 2023 when it acquired a stake in Northern Data, a firm specializing in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. This was followed by December’s announcement when Ardoino revealed receiving the draft of the website for Tether’s AI platform. The exec had previously stated , “Artificial intelligence stands poised to revolutionize nearly every facet of our lives, both in the real and digital worlds. Our investment in Northern Data Group, known for resilient and high-performance technologies, aligns perfectly with our vision.” While Tether is primarily recognized for issuing USDT, the world’s leading stablecoin with a market cap of over $140 billion, the company has been actively diversifying its business under Ardoino’s leadership. It has made strategic investments in several industries besides artificial intelligence. This included energy, payments, and telecommunications. Additionally, Tether expanded into commodities trade financing and restructured its corporate framework last year to align with its goals. T3 Financial Crime Unit Beyond its AI ambitions, Tether collaborated with Tron, and TRM Labs to work with Spain’s Guardia Civil and froze $26.4 million in cryptocurrency tied to an international money laundering operation. The criminal network provided cash-to-crypto laundering services across multiple European jurisdictions. This was T3 FCU’s largest coordinated freeze since its inception and came after the crime unit hit a milestone , which resulted in the seizure of more than $100 million in criminal assets across the world.

BTFD Is The Best New Meme Coins with 100x Potential,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-your-chance-with-pepe-coin-btfd-is-the-best-new-meme-coins-with-100x-potential/,"Meme coins have exploded onto the cryptocurrency scene in recent years, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu setting the stage for what is now one of the most exciting sectors in crypto. Investors who managed to get in on these coins early saw significant returns as the meme coin market boomed. However, many missed the chance to jump on those early presales and ICOs, watching as early investors made serious profits while they were left in the dust. Now, with the rise of new meme coins like BTFD Coin, there’s another golden opportunity to cash in on that same potential for huge returns. This is your chance to learn from past mistakes and get in early before it’s too late. Just like how people regretted missing out on Pepe Coin in its early stages, missing the boat on BTFD Coin could mean leaving serious money on the table. With its aggressive presale strategy and exclusive Referral Program, BTFD Coin is set to reach new heights in the coming months. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin could be your best chance to make up for those missed opportunities and why it’s quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins with 100x potential. 1. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Opportunity You Don’t Want to Miss BTFD Coin is arguably the most exciting new meme coin in the market right now. If you’re familiar with the gains made by early investors in other meme coins like Pepe coin, BTFD Coin offers a similar (if not better) opportunity for incredible returns. Starting at just $0.000004 during its presale, the coin is now sitting at $0.00016 in Stage 14, with projections pointing to a price of $0.0006 after the presale ends. That’s a huge potential increase for early investors—so don’t wait around too long to jump in. BTFD’s Referral Program is one of the key features that sets it apart from other meme coins. By referring friends and family to the presale, investors can earn a percentage of the coins bought by their referrals, making it easier to build a significant holding of $BTFD coins without necessarily having to buy them all yourself. That’s a win-win situation for anyone looking to get involved in this presale. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $5.93 million, with more than 69 billion $BTFD coins sold and 10,300 bulls now holding the coin. Analysts are predicting that this could just be the start of something massive, with prices potentially soaring once the coin hits exchanges. Investors who get in now have the chance to earn some seriously sweet profits, just like the ones who jumped on Pepe Coin during its presale and watched it skyrocket. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin offers a compelling combination of low entry cost, huge upside potential, and a strong community-driven referral program. If you want to make sure you don’t miss out on the next big thing in the meme coin space, this is your chance to get in early. 2. Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin That Made Waves Pepe Coin took the crypto world by storm when it launched, and early investors are now reaping the rewards.

Pepe Coin had all of these and more, from memes to partnerships with influencers that helped push its value even higher.

But here’s the good news: with BTFD Coin, you still have a chance to make up for that missed opportunity.

But savvy traders know that dips can be golden opportunities. Lower prices mean you can strategically build your position. Right now, BlockDAG (BDAG), Movement (MOVE), Lido DAO (LDO), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are looking strong. They’re showing real resilience and potential, which puts them on the radar as top cryptos to buy now. These digital assets are showing promising signs as development continues. With positive momentum building, now could be the perfect time to jump in before the next price surge. Don’t miss out on this potential upward trend. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Poised for Explosive Growth BlockDAG (BDAG) is revolutionizing blockchain technology. Its Layer 1 network offers high speed, scalability, and security. Using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, BDAG bypasses network congestion. This allows for faster transactions and smooth smart contract operation. It combines Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s flexibility. This provides a powerful tool for both developers and traders. BDAG’s presale has been incredibly successful. It has raised over $192 million and sold more than 18.2 billion coins. The value has jumped by 2380% since the presale began. With major exchange listings on the horizon, experts predict the price could reach $1. This makes BDAG a top altcoin choice. The rapid presale success shows huge demand. BDAG’s current price of $0.0248 per coin won’t last after its official launch. This is a unique chance to acquire BDAG coins before the next price explosion. Momentum continues to grow. BDAG’s strong fundamentals and increasing market interest position it as a major altcoin success story, and the top crypto to buy today. Over 15,500 miners have been sold, generating over $6.2 million in sales. 2. Movement (MOVE): Institutional Interest Fuels Growth Movement (MOVE) is the core digital asset of the Movement Network. This blockchain system connects Move-based technology with Ethereum’s EVM. World Liberty Finance recently purchased $2 million worth of MOVE. This highlights strong institutional interest. Integration with Alchemy Pay improves accessibility. The launch of its developer mainnet increases adoption. MOVE currently trades around $0.57. Its recent price activity and growing large-scale purchases make it a top altcoin to watch. Further price increases are possible. 3. Lido DAO (LDO): The Future of Ethereum Staking Lido DAO (LDO) governs Lido. Lido is the largest liquid staking platform for Ethereum. As Ethereum staking becomes clearer from a regulatory perspective, Lido’s position strengthens. This makes LDO a strong contender among top altcoins. Recent positive sentiment regarding potential U.S. approval of Ethereum staking has boosted interest in LDO. Increased staking activity could drive demand for the platform. LDO is currently trading around $1.72. Technical indicators suggest positive momentum. This positions it as a top crypto to buy now for those looking at long-term crypto opportunities. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE): Capitalizing on Government Initiatives Wrapping up this list of the best cryptos to buy now is Dogecoin (DOGE). DOGE started as a joke cryptocurrency. It has become a significant digital asset. Recent developments have increased its importance. The formation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) highlights this. This initiative has brought attention to Dogecoin. Grayscale Investments has launched a Dogecoin Trust. This gives institutional investors access to DOGE. These factors make Dogecoin a compelling altcoin. They reflect its growing acceptance and potential for future expansion. As of February 3, 2025, DOGE is trading at around $0.25. Top Crypto to Buy Now: Which Is The Right Pick For You? The crypto market may be shifting. BlockDAG (BDAG), Movement (MOVE), Lido DAO (LDO), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are excellent altcoin choices right now. MOVE attracts institutions. LDO is well-positioned for Ethereum staking growth. DOGE benefits from significant developments. BlockDAG, however, stands out. Its advanced technology, record-breaking $192 million presale, and strong momentum make it exceptional. Analysts suggest a potential jump to $1 this year. Early participants have a short window to join before BDAG demand skyrockets. This could be the last opportunity for crypto traders to get into this project before it takes off.

Experts note that the previously identified corrective bullish structure has materialized, leading to another decline in an impulsive wave (c). While a recovery is already underway, key resistance levels need to be broken for a sustained rise. According to MakroVision, the overall downtrend remains corrective in the (A)-(B)-(C) structure, suggesting that a short-term bottom may be forming. However, it remains crucial to determine whether a strong bullish impulse will follow or if the recovery is merely corrective. Graphic analysis shared by MakroVision. Related News: The Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Development Wall Street CEOs Have Been Waiting For Is Allegedly About to Happen Analysts cited the following areas as key resistance and support levels: $223: A key resistance level with high liquidity. A break above this level would be the first positive signal for a sustained recovery. $246: The next hurdle that needs to be cleared for the upside potential to continue towards $270. $198 (0.5 Fibonacci) and $193 (0.618 Fibonacci): These levels could act as short-term supports in case of a pullback. $188: A very important level.
