Recent data provides a compelling look at the competitive dynamics in the enterprise AI space, highlighting a clear leader: OpenAI. This surge in OpenAI Enterprise Adoption signals a significant shift in how businesses are integrating AI into their operations and where their investment is flowing. What Does the Data Show About OpenAI Enterprise Adoption? According to the AI Index compiled by fintech firm Ramp, which analyzes corporate spending data, OpenAI is rapidly pulling ahead of its rivals in securing enterprise customers. The index estimates the business adoption rate of AI products by drawing on Ramp’s extensive card and bill pay data from approximately 30,000 U.S. companies. The numbers paint a clear picture of accelerating adoption: In January, 18.9% of U.S. businesses using Ramp were paying for OpenAI subscriptions. By March, this figure had risen to 28%. As of April, a substantial 32.4% of U.S. businesses were utilizing OpenAI’s AI models, platforms, and tools. This consistent upward trend demonstrates a powerful momentum for OpenAI within the business sector. As Ramp Economist Ara Kharzian noted, “OpenAI continues to add customers faster than any other business on Ramp’s platform.” This rapid growth underscores the increasing role of OpenAI’s offerings in driving Business AI Spending across various industries. How Does OpenAI’s Growth Compare in the AI Competition? While OpenAI’s numbers show robust growth, the data indicates that competitors are struggling to keep pace. The AI Competition landscape, at least based on this specific dataset, appears increasingly tilted in OpenAI’s favor. Consider the figures for two key rivals: Anthropic: Adoption grew from 4.6% of businesses in January to 8% in April. While showing growth, it’s significantly slower and from a much smaller base compared to OpenAI. Google AI: Subscriptions saw a notable decline, dropping from 2.3% in February to a mere 0.1% in April. This sharp decrease suggests potential challenges for Google in capturing this segment of the market via direct subscriptions tracked by Ramp. This comparison highlights the widening gap in AI Market Share among these leading providers, with OpenAI currently enjoying a considerable lead in securing direct business subscriptions tracked by Ramp. Understanding the Drivers Behind Business AI Spending Why are businesses flocking to OpenAI? Several factors likely contribute to this surge in Generative AI Adoption and subsequent spending: Brand Recognition: OpenAI’s ChatGPT brought generative AI into the mainstream consciousness, giving the company a significant first-mover advantage in public and business perception. Accessibility and APIs: OpenAI’s platform and APIs are widely accessible and well-documented, making it relatively straightforward for developers and businesses to integrate their models into existing workflows and applications. Perceived Capability: For many common tasks and initial explorations into AI, OpenAI’s models are often perceived as highly capable and versatile, meeting immediate business needs. Enterprise Focus: OpenAI has been actively courting enterprise clients, developing specific products and support structures aimed at larger organizations. The company reported having over 2 million business users as of April, a doubling from the 1 million reported in September, indicating a strong focus on this segment. This focus on the enterprise market is strategic. OpenAI expects revenue from business users to contribute significantly to its financial growth. Projections reportedly place OpenAI’s revenue at $12.7 billion this year, potentially climbing to $29.4 billion in 2026, although the company does not anticipate being cash-flow positive until 2029. Caveats and the Future of Enterprise AI It is important to note the limitations of the data. The Ramp AI Index provides valuable insights but is based on a sample of around 30,000 companies and specifically tracks spend via Ramp’s platform. It may not capture all AI-related spending, particularly if it’s bundled into broader IT contracts or other cost centers not identified by merchant names or line items. Therefore, while highly indicative, these figures represent a specific slice of the overall market. Despite these caveats, the data strongly suggests that OpenAI is solidifying its position in the burgeoning enterprise AI market. Looking ahead, OpenAI is reportedly exploring new revenue streams, including charging businesses thousands of dollars for specialized AI “agents” designed for complex tasks like software engineering and research. Such offerings could further drive Business AI Spending among large corporations seeking highly tailored solutions. Conclusion: OpenAI Leads the Pack, For Now The data from Ramp provides a compelling snapshot of the current state of enterprise AI adoption. OpenAI is clearly demonstrating significant momentum, rapidly increasing its footprint within businesses and outpacing key competitors like Anthropic and Google AI in this specific dataset. While the overall AI Market Share is still fluid and the competitive landscape will undoubtedly continue to evolve, OpenAI’s current trajectory in securing enterprise customers is a powerful indicator of its present market strength and the accelerating trend of Generative AI Adoption in the business world.

According to data from the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, the country acquired an additional seven BTC in the last seven days, bringing its total holdings to 6,173 BTC, valued at over $637 million. El Salvador's Bitcoin Office has continued its steady pace of Bitcoin acquisitions months after the IMF agreement was signed and shows no sign of halting its Bitcoin purchases. The Central American country is one of the only nations actively purchasing Bitcoin in open market operations, and its national Bitcoin treasury strategy will serve as a blueprint for other countries also considering Bitcoin strategic reserves, according to crypto industry executives. El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings and acquisitions since March 13. Source: El Salvador Bitcoin Office Related: El Salvador works with Nvidia to develop sovereign AI infrastructure El Salvador remains defiant against IMF pressure El Salvador signed a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF in December 2024. As part of that agreement, the government of the country agreed to rescind its Bitcoin legal tender law and make Bitcoin payments voluntary. The agreement also stipulated that El Salvador must scale back its Bitcoin accumulation, refraining from using public funds to finance Bitcoin purchases. Additionally, the deal required the government privatize the Chivo Wallet, which was publicly funded but saw little use among residents. In January 2025, lawmakers in the Central American country repealed the Bitcoin legal tender law in a 55-2 Congressional vote, although this did nothing to pause or slow Bitcoin acquisitions. The IMF issued another request to the country to halt Bitcoin buys in March 2025, reiterating the original terms of the agreement. However, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele pushed back against the requests . Bukele emphasized that the country would not stop its Bitcoin purchases or slow down its accumulation of BTC in the face of mounting pressure from the supranational financial institution. ""No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most 'Bitcoiners' abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future,"" Bukele wrote in a March 4 X post .

Senate Democrats cite Trump’s financial conflicts as a reason for blocking the stablecoin bill. $TRUMP coin’s surge raises concerns of a “pay-for-play scheme” linked to the president. Donald Trump’s direct involvement in the cryptocurrency world is leading to major hurdles towards the realization of his crypto agenda. This week, the GENIUS Act , a significant piece of legislation to set up federal regulations for stablecoins, could not pass through the Senate. The reason for disagreement is the fear of conflicts of interest, especially concerning Trump’s crypto businesses, such as his meme coins. Bipartisan Support Undermined by Meme Coin Controversy The GENIUS Act had received bipartisan support, with both Democrats and Republicans acknowledging the need for stablecoin regulation. However, the support began to fade because of the $TRUMP meme coin, which had surged in value following Trump’s endorsement and controversial promotions.

Deeper integration with Mastercard and Kraken leads analysts to predict a 400% rise for ADA that could take the coin price to $3 in 2026. Since their presale kickoff, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained significant investor attention by earning $7,900,000 while distributing over 450 million tokens across 9,700 different holder addresses. The presale’s fourth phase shows 65% sell-out status at $0.025 with expectant returns of 140% toward its market launch. Cardano’s Ascending Path ADA projects future success through its development of practical use cases in the market. Users can now convert ADA into fiat currency for store payments through Mastercard and Kraken’s platform so ADA gains real-world adoption capabilities. By welcoming institutional trust through this move the platform attracts investors who seek long-term growth potential. The developers behind Leios have spent six years developing an upcoming upgrade that will decrease network load and increase transaction speed. ADA acquisition potential would rise sharply when the network becomes scalable enough to attract developers building decentralized applications for gaming or decentralized finance (DeFi). The price analysis draws a positive outlook due to an RSI of 58 and an ascending triangle pattern that suggests ADA will break through the $0.78 resistance level. Keeping current price levels ADA could reach $1.40 in 2025 yet a downward move will challenge the $0.62 area. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts intense investment interest during its fourth presale phase where tokens sell for $0.025 compared to $0.01 during the initial launch. The ongoing Phase 4 sale of MUTM tokens stands at 65% sold out with plans to boost prices 20% upon the launch of Phase 5 at $0.03 providing existing purchasers instant monetary benefits. MUTM tokenomics provide investors with 140% capital return at $0.06 during the listing then forecast a $2.50 value post-launch resulting in a 9,900% ROI. The company’s smart contract audit with Certik has produced results which will soon appear on social channels to enhance trustworthiness. The platform extends bonus token rewards through its new dashboard to holders who stay within the top 50 positions in order to build dedicated fanbases. The Mutuum’s lending framework uses overcollateralization to stabilize investments thereby allowing users to lock ETH for mtETH token generation with accruing interest features. DeFi utility combined with a token distribution system that rebroadcasts tokens to stakers drives continuous demand in the market. Mutuum’s DeFi Edge The public interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to rise as Phase 4 moves toward completion. Mutuum provides complete freedom through its dual-lending model which unites peer-to-peer collateralized and contract-to-contract lending solutions for all borrowers and lenders. Users with $7,000 worth of ETH can secure a $5,000 USDT loan after locking in their collateral which reduces their potential for defaulting on payments. Platform revenue stream enables the buy-and-distribute buying mechanism which buys back MUTM tokens while rewarding staking participants and preventing token market sell-offs. Among crypto tokens, Mutuum differs because it emphasizes generating passive income for users through mtTokens along with its planned stablecoin feature. The presale’s quick success reflects strong market interest because it has reached $7.9 million in funding with 9,700 token holders. Due to upcoming token price increases investors must buy tokens quickly from the Phase 5 period. Weighing the Crypto Clash ADA operates in a robust ecosystem yet its predicted 400% price growth will only materialize when system upgrades align with positive market conditions leading to extended development schedules. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers definite 140% listing profits while projecting a 9,900% post-launch boost thus providing investors with a simpler faster route to financial gains.

Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision investors attempt to rekindle lawsuit against Binance A group of Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision ( BSV ) investors is attempting to rekindle a 2019 lawsuit against Binance , alleging that the crypto exchange caused price damage to the altcoin by delisting BSV in 2019. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a previous ruling from the United Kingdom Competition Appeal Tribunal, throwing out the claims of undue damage from the delisting, should be examined again, according to legal outlet Law360 . BSV has experienced a long-term price decline since 2021. Source: TradingView If successful, the litigants could demand up to 10 billion British pounds (GBP), or roughly $13 billion, in damages from the exchange. BSV continues to suffer from a multitude of issues, including a long-term price decline, several 51% attacks that compromised the blockchain network's security, and criticism from the crypto community. Robert Kiyosaki says ditch ‘fake money’ for Bitcoin, gold, and silver Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin , gold, and silver. In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul. Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed , described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control. Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns. “Fake money leads to dishonest money, dishonest statistics, dishonest accounting, dishonest balance sheets, dishonest compensation, dishonest relations, dishonest leaders, and corruption in everyday life,” Kiyosaki wrote. He called on Americans to “fight back” by opting out of fiat systems and instead embracing decentralized stores of value like Bitcoin (BTC) and precious metals.

According to Schwartz, cryptographic advancements can trigger significant shifts in the blockchain space. Users Revisit Ripple CTO’s Vision for Private Ledger Integration In what could be considered a journey back in time, the Ripple CTO proposed a system in 2019 in which private ledgers utilize XRP for low-cost transactions. The reference to Schwartz’s 2019 post occurred after a user on X asserted that it was practically impossible to integrate private ledgers into XRPL functionality. Another user on the social media platform responded to Schwartz’s post. According to Schwartz, private ledgers can be bridged to the public XRP Ledger as required to address scalability issues. This could also tackle concerns that border on cost for institutional users. The idea is to significantly reduce transaction fees while retaining the ability of the private ledger to interact with the public ledger. This will make for broader liquidity in the space. ZK Proofs Could Bridge Public and Private Blockchain Worlds Interestingly, Schwartz joined the revived conversation and clarified how ZK proofs could make this a reality. He noted that ZK proof could make the vision more practical and secure. According to him, it is possible to mirror the security and decentralization that is obtainable of Layer-1 chains. While acknowledging that the use case is yet to be realized, Schwartz expressed optimism that it might happen someday with ZK proofs. For perspective, ZK proof protocols allow a user to authenticate the actuality of a statement without disclosing more details than necessary. That is, they preserve the anonymity that blockchain transactions provide. Schwartz suggests that, in the future, ZK proofs might close the gap between public chains and private transaction systems. Buenos Aires Highlight ZK Proof Potential In the broader society, Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital, launched QuarkID in the last quarter of 2024. The project, a digital identity service that utilizes ZK proof, enhances the privacy and security of the city’s 3.6 million residents. The development enables residents to verify essential documents without revealing other personal details. QuarkID allows users to upload as many as 60 papers without the government or any third party accessing them.

Market Expert Says BTC Broke Out Since Nov. 2024,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-heading-to-137000-market-btc-broke-out/,"After a somewhat sluggish start to 2025, the Bitcoin price has begun to impress in the year’s second quarter. The premier cryptocurrency reclaimed the $100,000 mark earlier this week and seems to be making a play for its all-time high price at $108,786 over this weekend. The price of BTC appears to have flipped the switch in the market, with investors feeling that the world’s largest crypto market is back to where it was at the end of 2024. According to a popular crypto expert, the sell-side pressure experienced in the first few months of the year is all part of a broader price breakout. Is BTC Following This Cup And Handle Pattern? In a May 9 post on X, chartered market technician (CMT) Aksel Kibar shared an interesting update on his recent Bitcoin price analysis. The market expert revealed, in a late November 2024 post on the social media platform, a long-term breakout signal for the BTC price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Following the election victory of Donald Trump as United States President, the Bitcoin and crypto markets witnessed a significant amount of bullish momentum. Kibar highlighted that BTC, as a result of the post-election rally, was breaking above a significant price level on a large (monthly) timeframe. As shown in the chart above, the Bitcoin price broke above its “minor high” around the former all-time high of $73,737 in November. Based on historical patterns, Kibar highlighted in his chart that the flagship cryptocurrency goes on a parabolic run whenever it surpasses the minor high in the cycle. Interestingly, this November 2024 breakout has formed a cup and handle pattern, a technical analysis pattern that resembles a cup in the shape of the letter “u,” and the handle has a slight downward drift. The cup and handle is considered a bullish pattern, which signals the continuation of an upward trend. In this particular iteration of this pattern, the price of BTC continued to rally after breaking the $73.737 till it reached a six-figure valuation. However, the Bitcoin price witnessed a severe correction to around $74,000 after reaching its current all-time high in January. However, it appears that Bitcoin only witnessed a minor pullback to the “minor high” before resuming its primary upward trend. In this scenario, Kibar put the cup and handle target for the market leader at around $137,000, which represents an over 33% rally from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,071, reflecting a nearly 1% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is up by more than 6% on the weekly timeframe.

As the market heats up, investors are keen to know if this upward trend will keep its momentum through May. This piece delves into the potential growth of these digital coins and what may lie ahead. Celestia Price Update: Bullish Week Amid Half-Year Slump TIA past month gains of 22.66% and weekly jumps of 22.86% contrast with a six-month drop of 43.96%. Price action has shown rapid short-term strength despite significant long-term backsliding. Recent surges hint at renewed momentum even as the coin weathers a broader downturn. Mixed performance highlights a recovery effort that remains challenged by extended losses. Current trading occurs between $2.15 and $3.23, with bulls testing a resistance at $3.77 and a support near $1.61. Despite minor upward energy indicated by oscillators, no clear trend emerges. Trading strategies could include targeting support areas for entry while remaining watchful for decisive moves above resistance. Polkadot Surge and Setback: A Mixed Timeline of Rally and Consolidation Last month DOT recorded a strong rally with a 40% boost and a notable weekly gain of 23%. The six-month period, however, closed with a modest decline of 3%. Price history shows robust bursts and brief pullbacks, highlighting reactive market behavior and significant shifts over different time frames. Current prices fluctuate between $3.41 and $4.54, facing immediate resistance at $5.03 and support at $2.77. Additional resistance is seen near $6.16 and support around $1.64. Indicators like an RSI of 74 and momentum reading suggest short-term bullish energy with some near-term caution, creating opportunities for trades to capture potential upward moves or temporary pullbacks within these levels. Conclusion The recent surge in TIA and DOT hints at strong market interest. Both coins have shown significant growth alongside Bitcoin. This upward trend suggests sustained investor confidence. If the broader crypto market remains positive, TIA and DOT could continue to see gains. However, market conditions are always fluid, so it is essential to stay updated on developments. For now, the rally seems promising, with potential for further momentum in the coming weeks. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While some analysts see potential for a rebound of support at $10.69 holds, others warn that the most explosive gains may be over, especially with ongoing token unlocks and bearish technical signals. Despite strong media attention, many traders believe Trump Coin’s parabolic upside is largely priced in, leaving limited room for new investors seeking big returns.

Known for its robust and scalable blockchain architecture that enables lightning fast transactions, Avalanche is a shining example of innovation in the crypto space. But while Avalanche is dominating parts of the blockchain ecosystem, another contender Ruvi is positioning itself as the future leader by combining the power of blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI). Can Ruvi be the next big thing and give early investors the same kind of returns Avalanche gave in its early days? Let’s find out. Avalanche’s Rise and Investor Takeaways Avalanche’s growth is a testament to its adaptability and infrastructure. Built to handle 6,500 transactions per second , the network has attracted developers and projects to its ecosystem by offering speed and versatility. Early investors in AVAX made life changing returns, from $2.79 in late 2020 to over $146 in 2021. The lesson here? Early adoption is key. If you spot a project before the masses, the growth potential is huge. That’s why Ruvi, with its innovative vision of combining blockchain and AI, is getting the attention of forward thinking investors. Why Ruvi Stands Out in a Crowded Market Ruvi is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a next gen platform to disrupt markets through the power of AI and blockchain. By offering real world applications, Ruvi will reshape industries like logistics, predictive healthcare and decision making analytics. Here’s what makes Ruvi unique: AI Powered Applications : Ruvi integrates machine learning to optimize processes and offer predictive insights, a game changer across industries. Scarcity for Value Creation : Token supply is capped at 5 billion tokens , ensuring long term scarcity and setting the stage for price appreciation. Generous Presale Bonuses : Early investors can get up to 100% presale bonuses to maximize their holdings even before the token launches.If Avalanche taught us anything, it’s that getting in early on innovative projects can give you huge returns. Ruvi is in presale now and tokens are available at $0.01 . Act now and not only will you get the lowest price but also bonus tokens to multiply your investment. Ruvi ROI Potential To give you a better idea of Ruvi’s earning potential, here’s an example of returns for investors at different tiers: Entry-Level Investor ($500) Tokens Bought: 50,000 Bonus Tokens (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 70,000 Potential Value (at $2 per token): $140,000 Mid-Tier Investor ($3,000) Tokens Bought: 300,000 Bonus Tokens (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 540,000 Potential Value (at $2.50 per token): $1.35 million High-End Investor ($10,000) Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Bonus Tokens (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 2,000,000 Potential Value (at $3 per token): $6 million These numbers show just how much of a presale investment in Ruvi could be. The Avalanche and Ruvi Parallels Avalanche solved the trilemma of decentralization, security and scalability. Ruvi is addressing the growing demand for data driven efficiency across industries by combining AI and blockchain. Both projects have a focused vision, strategic scalability and are targeting a critical gap in the market. Get Your Spot in Ruvi Today Avalanche’s growth proved one thing – timing is everything. Those who got in early made life changing returns and the same could happen with Ruvi. Ruvi’s presale is an opportunity to be part of something new and potentially revolutionary all while getting bonus incentives. Conclusion Ruvi is not just a crypto project; it’s a full scale ecosystem to define the intersection of AI and blockchain. Its capped token supply, early bonuses and real world applications make it one of the most promising projects in the crypto space today.Act now.

Solana (SOL) continues its upward trend with strong institutional interest and technical signals suggesting a move toward $160. Litecoin (LTC) is gaining support from growing speculation around an upcoming U.S. spot ETF approval, which could open the door to fresh capital inflows. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is delivering results through an active presale model that’s already generated over $233.5 million in funding. At $0.0019 per coin until May 13 and with a projected listing at $0.05, BlockDAG’s potential ROI sits at 2520%. Its Buyer Battles feature, which distributes 100 million BDAG daily, adds a competitive layer that directly rewards buyer participation. In today’s market where timing and mechanics matter more than ever, these three cryptos stand out for the value they bring to different buyer strategies. Solana Holds Steady with Technical Support & $160 Breakout Potential Solana remains a standout performer in 2025. The project has maintained consistent momentum throughout Q2, with its current position setting up a possible push above the $160 mark. Market analysts continue to highlight Solana’s solid support levels and strong buyer demand, which suggest favorable conditions for a breakout. Institutional sentiment is also strengthening as Solana expands its ecosystem across DeFi and NFT applications. Continued upgrades to speed and scalability are reinforcing its appeal, especially as other Layer 1 competitors face congestion issues. A close above $160 could open the door to further upside. With its ability to process high transaction volumes efficiently, Solana’s performance is reflecting long-term investor confidence. Litecoin Sees Increased Demand as ETF Expectations Rise Litecoin is attracting renewed interest following commentary from Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who identified LTC as the cryptocurrency with the strongest chance of landing the next spot ETF approval in the U.S. This optimism comes from Litecoin’s structural similarities to Bitcoin, including capped supply, predictable issuance, and a strong security history. Although an ETF hasn’t yet been approved, mounting pressure and favorable analyst sentiment are keeping expectations high. The possibility of ETF approval is prompting increased buying, especially from institutional investors looking for regulated crypto exposure. If confirmed, a Litecoin ETF could unlock major inflows and contribute to longer-term price stability and growth. BlockDAG Stands Out with $233.5 Presale & Daily Buyer Battles Rewards Unlike speculative moves seen with Solana and Litecoin, BlockDAG is offering buyers a measurable path to growth. Its presale has now raised more than $233.5 million, backed by strong community participation and clear mechanics. For now, BDAG coins are available at $0.0019 until May 13. With an expected listing price of $0.05, early buyers are looking at a 2520% potential return. What makes BlockDAG unique is its Buyer Battles feature. This system allocates 100 million BDAG coins each day, with every participant receiving a share. The highest buyer of the day claims all remaining unclaimed coins. This structure turns regular purchases into a reward-driven competition. These mechanics don’t just boost engagement, they reinforce commitment from participants and build stronger buyer networks. Alongside its favorable price point and transparent milestones, BlockDAG is positioning itself as the top crypto to buy now based on execution rather than speculation. Final Thoughts Solana continues to build on strong technical setups and institutional interest, while Litecoin is gaining traction on ETF speculation that could reshape its investor base. Both projects benefit from established reputations and ongoing market narratives. But BlockDAG is already delivering. With its $0.0019 pricing valid through May 13, a 2520% ROI potential based on its $0.05 target, and daily Buyer Battles that actively reward buyers, BlockDAG is setting a different standard. Having already raised $233.5 million and with daily momentum building, it is proving itself as one of 2025’s strongest early-stage performers. For investors watching closely, this isn’t just about timing, it’s about participation. With structure, incentives, and traction already in place, BlockDAG is more than a presale, it’s the top crypto to buy now .

Dogecoin jumps fast when whales move. Chainlink keeps gaining due to network use. Both show how fast the market can shift based on updates or activity. But being quick isn’t easy, and Web3 ai ($WAI) solves this issue using artificial intelligence to read charts, scan blockchain activity, and track market mood live. Instead of chasing news, users get clear, fast insights. Many see Web3 ai as a top crypto pick for 2025. It doesn’t just react; it prepares users before the next move even starts. Dogecoin (DOGE) Surges After $165M Whale Wallet Shift Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped after whales moved over $165 million worth of DOGE in just 24 hours. These transfers from large holders often spark activity, sending traders rushing in or out based on the action. Following this movement, DOGE gained 1.90%, showing how reactive this market is. While headlines grab attention, the wallet flows often shape real price changes. This recent surge shows how one big event, like massive wallet shifts, can wake up the meme coin crowd. With major players moving large sums, the DOGE chart becomes one to watch closely. The excitement proves that Dogecoin still holds a strong influence in crypto circles. Chainlink (LINK) Gains Strength as Bulls Eye $26 Chainlink (LINK) is showing steady progress. It broke past $15 and is now aiming higher. Experts are watching $26 as the next big target. The rise in price shows growing belief in its role in keeping smart contracts secure with real-time data feeds. Behind the price jump is a boost in network activity. More users mean more demand, which supports price. Technical tools like RSI are also flashing signs of continued strength. Holding the line at key support levels will matter. If LINK stays strong, buyers could push it further, and we might see another run-up. That’s why Chainlink is becoming a regular on many trader watchlists. Track Smarter, Not Harder: Web3 ai’s AI-Powered Tools Crypto markets move fast; prices change, headlines shift, and blockchain data never stops flowing. For many, this constant information stream is too much to follow. Web3 ai was designed to solve this problem by converting raw market data into clear, real-time insights. Using advanced AI models, Web3 ai scans activity across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon. It monitors on-chain movements, social sentiment, and exchange trends and detects suspicious activity. Whether it’s identifying early whale actions, spotting scams, or flagging sentiment shifts, the platform delivers relevant alerts before markets react. At the center of this ecosystem is the $WAI token. Currently available in stage 3 of its presale at $0.000331, $WAI provides access to all of Web3 ai’s features. The final stage price is $0.003267, with a projected listing at $0.005242, offering early buyers up to 1747% ROI. So far the presale has raised more than $2.4 million with over $500,000 invested in just 24 hours. Rather than juggling multiple tools or dashboards, users get a single streamlined interface. This makes Web3 ai a practical solution in a crowded market. While others rely on promises, Web3 ai already functions, offering working products and real-time value at an early-stage price. This delivery-focused approach positions it as a serious contender for 2025’s top crypto platforms. Why Web3 ai Wins While Others React When DOGE surges due to whales or LINK builds slow momentum, traders need speed and accuracy. Most tools can’t keep up, but Web3 AI gives real-time information before markets shift. For serious users, instincts aren’t enough. As 2025 nears, Web3 ai gives traders the upper hand.

XRP Price Squeezes Below $2.22 & SHIB Recovers,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-presale-hits-2-6m-in-just-a-few-days-xrp-price-squeezes-below-2-22-shib-recovers/,"With mixed signals from leading altcoins, another project is drawing strong interest. The current XRP price update indicates a squeeze within a triangle pattern, with markets watching closely for either an upward breakout or downward slide. At the same time, a fresh sentiment check on Shiba Inu (SHIB) reveals strengthening long-term signals even as it weathers short-term dips. In the midst of this, Unstaked is gaining notice. Now priced at $0.007535 in Stage 6 of its crypto presale, it stands out by promising actual working features post-launch, something rare across today’s crypto launches. XRP Price Update: Facing Tight Resistance at $2.22 XRP remains under pressure between two key price levels, trading near $2.16 with resistance at $2.22 and support around $2.05. Analysts are noting a descending triangle on the chart, a setup that historically suggests downside risk. Should the price break below the $2.00 mark, it could head toward $1.85 or possibly even $1.70. Technical indicators mirror this caution. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47, reflecting neutral but fading momentum. On Coinglass, the long/short ratio remains under 1 for the second straight week, hinting that bearish views are prevailing. Still, trade volume tells a more layered story. Despite a drop in open interest for XRP derivatives, overall trading remains active, mainly due to short positions. Market watchers are waiting for a definitive price move, though its direction remains uncertain. As this XRP price update continues to evolve, speculation remains on whether resistance will break or lower supports will give way. SHIB Sentiment Analysis Reflects Growing Optimism SHIB’s price is around $0.00001295, down 7.4% over the past week, but technicals suggest a longer-term setup is forming. Analyst Javon Marks has kept his forecast intact, eyeing a target of $0.000081, a possible 528% surge from its current position. Supporting this are several patterns, including higher lows and a hidden bullish divergence, indicating accumulation under the surface. On-chain data adds weight: more long-term holders have entered since 2022, while short-term traders have dropped by 36%, hinting at increasing confidence in the asset’s future. Burn rates have also picked up, with over 313 million SHIB removed from circulation in just a week. This supply cut reinforces scarcity, helping to form a stronger foundation for any future gains. In short, the latest SHIB sentiment analysis points to a coin that’s quietly laying the groundwork for an upward move. Unstaked at $0.007535: Functional AI Tools Launch Right After Presale Ends As XRP and SHIB struggle with resistance and market signals, Unstaked is moving forward with a clearer roadmap. At $0.007535 in Stage 6 of its AI crypto presale , and with a projected launch price of $0.1819, it brings forward an offering not often seen in this space, usable tools ready from the start. Once the presale ends, users will be able to launch AI agents designed to run on social platforms like Telegram and X. These tools respond to community interactions, manage engagement 24/7, and build reach, all without needing manual oversight. Unlike traditional bots, these agents adapt based on real-time input, making them much more than scripted responders. All agent activity is tracked via Proof of Intelligence, a system that logs performance data on-chain. This not only ensures transparency but also ties real utility directly to $UNSD rewards, setting a clear link between user effort and outcome. With no private allocations or exclusive access deals, all participants begin equally. And with tools set to activate the moment the platform goes live, Unstaked offers more than promises, it offers actual usability. For those seeking high-performing crypto with practical utility, Unstaked is no longer flying under the radar. Final Thoughts! This XRP price update and the improved SHIB sentiment both reflect how legacy coins are navigating technical and market pressures. XRP hovers between resistance and support with downside risk increasing, while SHIB shows signs of quiet strength driven by long-term accumulation and burn data. But the outlook for both remains uncertain until confirmed by price action. In contrast, Unstaked provides a project where functionality is central. At $0.007535 with AI agents going live post-launch, no behind-the-scenes privileges, and a projected 2700% ROI at launch price, Unstaked delivers early access to a utility-based system that’s ready to engage from day one.

Experts Suggest it Will Skyrocket by 20,000% During the Bull Run",https://timestabloid.com/can-ruvi-ai-ruvi-build-on-trons-momentum-for-the-next-big-move/,"Tron (TRX) has been making headlines once again, climbing 2.98% in the past 24 hours to a current price of $0.2628 . Known for its blazing transaction speeds and decentralized governance, Tron continues to solidify its position as a top blockchain network. However, while Tron focuses on its ecosystem’s expansion, a new contender, Ruvi , is quietly creating waves in the crypto world. Ruvi’s innovative integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to capture investor attention, offering unique opportunities during its presale phase. Lessons from Tron’s Continued Success Launched in 2017, Tron emerged as a decentralized platform for content creators, later expanding to support DeFi, stablecoins like USDT, and NFT applications. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees has been a magnet for developers and investors alike. Tron’s strategic updates and partnerships have propelled it to become a robust ecosystem with over 94 billion TRX in circulation . The lesson here is clear. Early investors in projects like Tron, which solve real-world problems and scale effectively, can benefit from significant financial gains. Ruvi offers a similar opportunity, positioning itself as the next transformational force in blockchain by introducing AI-powered solutions for industries spanning logistics, healthcare, and predictive analytics. What Sets Ruvi Apart? Ruvi blends blockchain technology with the predictive capabilities of artificial intelligence, setting it apart from most crypto projects. Its main goal is to increase efficiency in industries plagued by data management challenges, offering real-time analytics and smarter decision-making tools. Ruvi’s presale phase marks a golden opportunity for investors. Tokens are currently priced at $0.01 , with generous bonuses of up to 100% available for early participants. Additionally, the project’s total token supply is capped at 5 billion , ensuring long-term scarcity and value appreciation. Timing Is Everything Tron’s early adopters reaped huge rewards as the value of TRX surged over the years. Similarly, Ruvi offers an investment opportunity at its inception, where the cost is low and the potential for exponential growth is high. Investors who act now could benefit as Ruvi gains market traction and visibility within the blockchain community. Ruvi’s Investment Potential Below are potential scenarios showcasing the returns investors could achieve at different entry points: Entry-Level Investor ($500) Tokens Purchased: 50,000 Bonus Tokens (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 70,000 Potential Value (if Ruvi hits $2): $140,000 Mid-Tier Investor ($3,000) Tokens Purchased: 300,000 Bonus Tokens (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 540,000 Potential Value (if Ruvi reaches $2.50): $1.35 million High-End Investor ($10,000) Tokens Purchased: 1,000,000 Bonus Tokens (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 2,000,000 Potential Value (if Ruvi climbs to $3): $6 million These examples highlight Ruvi’s ability to deliver life-changing financial returns, offering a compelling case for early adoption. Ruvi’s Strategic Advantage While Tron has excelled in content distribution, DeFi, and supporting stablecoins, Ruvi is targeting multi-industry applications that could redefine business processes. The integration of AI into blockchain allows Ruvi to offer solutions like supply chain optimization, healthcare data automation, and financial forecasting, making it a broader and more versatile platform. Furthermore, Ruvi’s presale is designed to incentivize participation. With up to 100% token bonuses , early investors gain additional leverage at minimal risk. This strategy not only attracts retail investors but also aligns with the interests of institutional players seeking next-gen projects. Don’t Miss the Opportunity Tron teaches us that acting early on promising technologies often pays off handsomely. Now, Ruvi presents a fresh opportunity to be part of a project with immense growth potential. The blend of blockchain and AI gives Ruvi a competitive edge that could make it a leader in the next wave of crypto innovation. Final Thoughts Ruvi is carving a new path in the blockchain world, bringing practical AI applications that solve real-world problems. With its token presale currently underway, early investors have the chance to get in on the ground floor of a project that could rival the success of Tron and other top cryptocurrencies. This is the moment to act. Secure your stake in Ruvi today, and join a project poised to revolutionize industries and deliver exceptional returns for those who invest wisely.

As May 2025 unfolds, crypto investors are keeping a close eye on Cardano (ADA) , Solana (SOL) , Ethereum (ETH) , and XRP —each showing signs of movement but delivering mixed signals. While established assets remain important pillars, capital is increasingly rotating toward early-stage entries like MAGACOINFINANCE , which is attracting attention with significantly higher growth forecasts. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Cardano (ADA): Stable, But Struggling to Break Out Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.7031 , showing slight momentum but still stuck within a narrow trading band. A rise toward $0.78–$0.80 remains possible with improved sentiment, but no major technical breakout has occurred. Despite ecosystem expansion and loyal developer support, ADA’s near-term upside is seen as modest— +10% to +15% , barring unexpected catalysts. Solana (SOL): Solid Metrics, But Resistance Stalls the Climb Solana (SOL) is now trading at $171.55 , with slight gains in recent days. However, the $175–$180 resistance zone remains a challenge. While its transaction speed and network usage are unmatched, analysts believe most of its short-term upside is already priced in . Only a strong break above resistance could push SOL toward $190 , representing a +10% to +14% upside through mid-May. Ethereum (ETH): Holding Ground at $2,402.26 Ethereum (ETH) continues to defend the $2,400 level, currently trading at $2,402.26 . The latest upgrade has stabilized investor sentiment, but questions remain about short-term growth potential. With ETH being the most mature smart contract platform, its long-term appeal remains intact, yet near-term expectations cap out around +8% to +12% , unless a strong volume-driven breakout emerges. XRP: A Quiet Rebound Gathering Steam XRP trades at $2.39 , with slow but visible recovery underway. A close above $2.50 could signal a breakout, with some projections suggesting a +15% to +22% gain if institutional volume returns. Regulatory clarity and global payment infrastructure remain XRP’s tailwinds, even if its recent moves have been more muted than headline-making. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE: Under $0.07 With a Projected 3200% Upside While ADA, SOL, ETH, and XRP each offer incremental upside, MAGACOINFINANCE is rapidly gaining traction as the high-risk, high-reward asset of the moment. Still trading below $0.07 , it’s gathering attention thanks to its transparent rollout, VC-free tokenomics, and roadmap already in motion. Analyst forecasts remain aggressive: ROI Potential: 3000%–3250% Price Multiples: 30x–32x expected upon listing Access: Not yet on major exchanges—perfect for early positioning Unlike overleveraged large caps, MAGACOINFINANCE offers entry before mass listings—ideal for those seeking asymmetric reward profiles in a shifting market. With over 14,000 holders and growing traction, it may be the best opportunity for aggressive ROI in Q2.

On May 8, 2025, investors pumped new money in, taking the total to $40 billion. That number indicates that individuals continue purchasing Bitcoin using regulated funds. It also reflects increased confidence from everyday savers as well as large companies. Related Reading: Trump Trade News Ignites Bitcoin Mania—$100K Coming? Spot ETF Inflows Hit New High The leap to $40.33 billion followed recent inflows on May 8. Funds alone totaled more than the previous record on that single day. Investors have been putting money into the products since their launch early in 2024. Their firm hand has kept ETF flows rising even as prices fluctuated. After yesterdays inflows, the spot Bitcoin ETFs are now at a new high water market for lifetime flows. Currently at $40.33 billion according to Bloomberg data h/t @EricBalchunas pic.twitter.com/0GKPNlmprs — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 9, 2025 Growth Since Launch When US spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in about March 2024, total lifetime inflows was approximately $12 billion. Through August 2024, that figure had increased to about $18 billion. Fast-forward to March 2025, and all-time flows were at nearly $35 billion. They broke the $40 billion barrier in only two more months. That steady increase indicates that interest continues unabated in Bitcoin exposure in the form of a plain-vanilla fund, or no-frills investment vehicle. Institutional Investors Push Demand Big money investors are piling in. Asset managers and hedge funds are now using ETFs to invest in Bitcoin rather than chasing coins individually. It adds a safety layer and hedging for large portfolios, say analysts. It also introduces more scrutiny from regulators, as these ETFs will have to be strictly regulated. Some predict that this change might make Bitcoin seem more like a normal asset. Fans Have Their Say Social media responses were hot following the milestone. “Bitcoin is dominating,” posted one user, a line of slang that indicates Bitcoin is overwhelming other assets. Others complimented the ability to achieve buy‑in through regulated channels. None expressed any concerns, although some fear Bitcoin price slowdowns could decelerate ETF flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling The rise above $40 billion is a definite indicator that such ETFs have gained a piece of the market. However, they’re only one of the means through which Bitcoin is held. Miners, open exchange traders, and off-exchange trades all transfer bigger amounts. In the future, observers will eye ETF flows as a sentiment gauge. If more money streams in, it might be an indication of new confidence. If the tide goes out, it might indicate that buyers are finding alternatives.

An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money,” McGregor wrote to X on May 9. The former UFC champion said he would discuss his plans in more detail in an upcoming X spaces, prompting responses from some of the Bitcoin industry’s most prominent leaders.

One of US President Donald Trump’s crypto advisors, David Bailey, also reached out, to which McGregor responded: “David message me, let’s discuss your ideas!” McGregor announced his independent candidacy for the Irish presidency in late March 2025, centering his campaign on anti-immigration policies and combating crime. Ireland’s next presidential election must take place by Nov. 11, 2025, as the term of the current President, Michael D. Higgins, is set to end the day after. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve — let alone one coming from a minor, independent party — would be no easy feat. Despite recent regulatory progress, the US, El Salvador and Bhutan are among the few countries that have established a Bitcoin reserve to date. Related: US has ‘countless’ ways to bolster Bitcoin reserve: Bo Hines McGregor’s political visibility was recently boosted by a trip to the White House, where he met Trump and received his support. However, McGregor is facing intense scrutiny in Ireland, having recently been found guilty of sexual assault in a civil case — a conviction which he has since appealed — while also previously being investigated for hate speech crimes. McGregor’s last crypto endeavor failed McGregor’s push for a Bitcoin reserve comes a little over a month after the McGregor-backed REAL project failed to attract sufficient funding in its token launch pre-sale, prompting a full refund to all token bidders. The team behind the project, Real World Gaming, only raised $392,315 over a 28-hour presale on April 5 and 6, less than half of the $1 million minimum requirement that it initially set.

Although they remain dominant in terms of social reach and brand recognition, their current market structures show hesitation — and that’s driving attention to new altcoins like MAGACOINFINANCE , which recently crossed $8 million in early funding and is being flagged by analysts as a serious 2025 contender. Dogecoin Stalls Near Key Resistance DOGE surged over 15% in late April, riding the wave of Bitcoin’s jump past $90,000 . However, it now faces resistance at the $0.20 level. While Dogecoin continues to enjoy high-profile support and viral engagement, trading volume has slowed, and near-term projections show a tight range unless broader meme sector momentum reignites. Forecasts that suggest a climb to $0.22 or even $0.65 later in 2025 remain highly dependent on external catalysts and overall crypto sentiment. SHIBA INU’s Path Remains Volatile Shiba Inu (SHIB) has posted strong gains in recent weeks, but its outlook is anything but stable. Price volatility continues to challenge both short- and mid-term forecasts. While some technical models still predict 100%–125% upside in an ideal scenario, this hinges on sustained traction for Shibarium , SHIB’s layer-2 solution, and other ecosystem milestones yet to materialize.

With over $8M raised and early momentum building, it’s attracting retail and analyst interest alike for its clear fundamentals, grassroots traction, and departure from meme-driven hype. Rather than trying to imitate existing trends, MAGACOINFINANCE is crafting its own category — one built on clean tokenomics, no VC overhang, and a transparent growth roadmap.

CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion: A New Focal Point for Smart Investors Dogecoin and SHIBA INU will always have their place in the meme coin hierarchy—but as the current cycle matures, investor attention is clearly expanding to include more strategic early opportunities.

The foundation stone of decentralized applications Ethereum displays uncertain future prospects that professionals predict will reach $15,575 by 2030. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to make waves through its successful presale which has brought in $7,900,000 and attracted 9,700 token owners for over 450 million tokens. The current phase 4 presale has reached 65% completion and offers investors impressive token value at $0.025 per token. Ethereum’s Long-Term Outlook Investors active today closely monitor Ethereum’s future direction through market price analysis. Professional usage and network improvements could drive Ethereum’s value to reach $15,575 by 2030 according to extended forecasting models. Placing $5000 into ETH at today’s market price of $1800 will provide approximately 2.78 coins. At a valuation of $15,575 per ETH the potential future worth amounts to $43,298 based on 2030 estimates. Analyzing short-term price predictions shows a wide range between $1,368 and $2,550 during 2025 while indicating potential market risks. Market analysis shows both optimistic technical patterns from bull flags and Elliott Waves while forecasted bearish scenarios point to $1,050 drops. Ethereum’s future depends on solving scalability issues while managing exposure from multiple markets despite facing some uncertain risks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Through decentralized lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to create its distinctive market position. The ongoing Phase 4 of the 11-phase MUTM presale features token prices that started at $0.01 during phase 1 and currently sell at $0.025. A high level of investor interest exists because phase 5 will elevate MUTM token prices to $0.03 from $0.025 while current holders stand to gain 20% in value. At the scheduled $0.06 listing price investors can expect 140% token value appreciation. Professional analysts project MUTM tokens will reach $2.50 in the market by 2025 turning phase 4 investments into earnings of 9,900%. All contributors to MUTM phase 4 receive 200,000 tokens for their $5,000 investment which promises future valuation at $500,000 based on $2.50 per token and eventually could be worth $13,000,000 if prices reach $65 in 2030. The initial phase experienced a quick sell-out pattern because investors showed a strong need for acquisition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Innovative Features Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself by implementing a dual-lending system. Peer-to-contract technology runs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) through smart contracts which take control of liquidity pools while adjusting interest rates automatically. Mutuum Finance provides lenders with yields alongside borrowers who obtain secured loans through overcollateralization which decreases default probability. Future versions of the peer-to-peer lending system will introduce direct user agreements to provide extra operational flexibility. Certik smart contract auditing is underway by the team before social platform results are published to enhance confidence in the system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently introduced a framework showing the top 50 token holders which awards bonus tokens when users maintain their current positions to strengthen user loyalty. A clear framework operates as a primary factor in building investor trust. Weighing Future Gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates superior investment potential compared to Ethereum due to its projected ROI of $13,000,000 worth of tokens versus Ethereum’s calculated $43,298 value by 2030 at current investment amounts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) implements a buy-and-distribute model which utilizes platform earnings to repurchase tokens thereby retaining market demand despite Ethereum’s ongoing market volatility. The platform’s phase 4 presale has reached 65% completion which suggests a growing sense of immediacy among investors. Before phase 5 implementation, investors interested in high-yield DeFi must join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale to maximize their investment returns.

SUI has drawn eyes after jumping past $3.50, backed by growing total value locked and fresh partnerships. Stellar continues its steady move up, with bullish signals on the charts, but remains sensitive to larger market shifts. Kaspa is still making waves with its strong technicals and the speed of its BlockDAG design, which is being adopted across several use cases. But one name is gaining attention for a very different reason. Web3 ai ($WAI) is not just following market waves; it’s changing the game. The platform includes 12 live AI agents for smart trading, portfolio tracking, scam alerts, and pricing insights. While coins like SUI, Stellar, and Kaspa are building momentum, Web3 ai brings a ready-to-use ecosystem designed to shape how people trade in the AI-driven crypto future. 1. Web3 ai: Built-In AI Tools With 1,747% ROI Potential Web3 ai is quickly rising as a smart pick for those seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Its suite of 12 AI tools sets it apart, each made to manage specific parts of the crypto journey. From live trade alerts to scam detection, price forecasting, portfolio balancing, and market sentiment tracking, these AI agents work together using data from exchanges, social media, blockchain, and news sites. While the backend is fully built, these AI tools will activate after the token goes live. At Stage 1, $WAI is priced at just $0.0003, with the next level set to rise to $0.000315. The final presale stage of Web3 ai ($WAI) will reach $0.003267 before listing at $0.005242, giving early users a projected ROI of 1,747%. It’s not just numbers; this project offers tools people can use. Web3 ai isn’t following hype; it’s preparing for what comes next. With the full platform ready and just waiting on launch, early backers can now secure access. In a market leaning toward automation, Web3 ai’s approach puts it far ahead. That’s why many now consider it the best crypto to buy in 2025 . 2. SUI: Leading The Charge With Ecosystem Growth SUI has become one of the market’s top gainers this week, climbing more than 70% to hit around $3.55 as of April 25, 2025. This jump is supported by major progress in its ecosystem. SUI’s total value locked surged by 40%, reaching $1.645 billion, while trading activity on DEX platforms shot up 177%. Additional news like the Grayscale SUI Trust launch and partnerships with xPortal and xMoney for a virtual Mastercard have fueled the rally. Analysts are watching the Relative Strength Index, which is nearing overbought territory and showing strong buyer interest. With ongoing growth in the ecosystem, price targets between $5.00 and $6.50 seem possible soon. As momentum builds, SUI is recognized as one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 , especially for those tracking ecosystem-based performance. 3. Stellar: Steady Climb Backed by Technicals Stellar Lumens (XLM) has grown gradually, currently trading at about $0.287 as of April 29, 2025. A short-term gain of 3.7% is projected by the end of April, and key technical levels are being tested. XLM is trying to move past resistance areas marked by the 50-day and 200-day SMAs; currently at $0.264 and $0.275, respectively. Its RSI now sits at 61.28, reflecting steady buying pressure. If Stellar breaks through the $0.30–$0.35 zone, it could aim for the $0.50 mark in the coming months. While larger market trends will impact this path, Stellar still holds its place as a solid contender. For those seeking dependable setups, Stellar is still considered one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 , primarily for mid-term holding strategies. 4. Kaspa: Fast, Scalable, and Gaining Use Cases Kaspa (KAS) maintains strong market support in April 2025, trading near $0.0963 with a 6.4% increase over the week. A recent 13% jump placed it among the top weekly gainers, signaling strong momentum. Weekly charts show a bullish engulfing candle, pointing to more possible upside. Price targets in the short term are set between $0.198 and $0.273. Its DAG setup, known for fast speeds and high scalability, is winning attention from developers and enterprises alike. Use cases like real-time invoicing and supply chain automation add practical value. KAS is also being integrated into the CryptoTax Calculator, boosting its appeal to users. With solid tech and rising demand, Kaspa ranks as one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 , especially for those who value speed and scalability in their holdings. Final Verdict: Web3 ai’s Utility Makes It a Breakout Pick SUI’s rally, Stellar’s solid base, and Kaspa’s strong fundamentals support their standing in the current market. From DeFi boosts to technical momentum, these coins make a strong case for being held in a diverse portfolio. But if the goal is to find the best crypto to buy in 2025 , Web3 ai deserves serious attention. Its platform is fully built, and it offers AI-driven infrastructure that solves real-world crypto problems; like slow trading decisions and fraud risks. It’s not just an idea or a whitepaper; it’s a live system waiting for activation post-launch. As crypto shifts toward smarter automation, Web3 ai is leading the charge. That’s why it keeps popping up in discussions about the best crypto to buy in 2025 .

While Solana captures attention with its 2030 targets and Ethereum faces near-term stress, the difference between buzz and real delivery is becoming clear. These two remain under watch, one for future growth, the other for liquidity risks, but neither ties its on-chain activity directly to user engagement in a meaningful, traceable way. Unstaked sets itself apart in this context. Rather than leaning on hype or market moods, it applies a Proof of Intelligence model that links output to actual performance data. For those weighing real impact over speculative talk, Unstaked could be the best crypto to buy right now. AI That Delivers Results: How Unstaked Solves Web3’s AI Problem AI is used widely across Web3, but often without accountability. Many crypto projects add the term just for attention, offering basic scripts or bots with little real function. Unstaked takes a different approach. Its autonomous AI agents are built to evolve, interact, and support communities, all while leaving behind on-chain data. This is enabled by Unstaked’s own Proof of Intelligence tech that logs every AI action transparently for users to verify. What matters most, this isn’t a concept waiting for execution. These AI tools are being built now and will go live after the presale concludes. Over $1 million was raised in 24 hours, and $2 million has already been gathered just weeks into the presale. The project is now in stage 6, priced at $0.007535, with a launch price set at $0.1819, pointing to a 2700% potential return. Those searching for the best crypto to buy right now won’t find hollow claims here. Unstaked is building an ecosystem where users are rewarded for interaction and where influence is earned, not given. As experts begin suggesting a $5 long-term value, Unstaked is proving that Web3 AI can be practical, traceable, and meaningful, without the usual noise. Solana Long-Term Prediction: Will SOL Hit $1,000 by 2030? The idea of Solana reaching $1,000 by 2030 is gaining traction. Some forecasts predict an average of $1,033 and a high of $1,351 if the network keeps expanding. (Coinpedia Fintech News) However, some outlooks are more cautious, expecting a price closer to $186.61, which reflects moderate growth. These expectations depend on Solana maintaining fast, affordable transactions and drawing in more dApps and users. The chain’s unique Proof of History method and strong scaling ability remain key strengths. But future outcomes will still be influenced by market swings, changes in regulations, and ongoing tech upgrades. Ethereum Update: Liquidity Worries Point to Short-Term Weakness Ethereum’s charts are showing signs of downward pressure. Analysts believe ETH may be heading toward zones with more liquidity, signaling more short-term dips before a possible rebound. The data comes from patterns that highlight price movement toward these high-liquidity areas. In Q1 2025, Ethereum’s network activity slowed, with just three days of deflation and around $293 million worth of ETH issued. The increase in supply, mixed with weaker activity, has caused concern about ETH’s performance. This situation may cause further dips in the near future. Market watchers suggest keeping an eye on critical support zones and staying alert to broader news that could affect price trends. To Sum Up! Speculation fades, but utility endures. While Solana carries hopes of adoption and Ethereum navigates structural hurdles, neither provides a fully trackable model that rewards users for active involvement. Unstaked puts the outcome ahead of price forecasts. With every move by its AI agents recorded on-chain, the focus is on what’s delivered, not what’s promised. For those who value purpose and output over headlines, this is what makes Unstaked different. While others focus on building noise, Unstaked is focused on building results, and that difference may be why it’s the best crypto to buy right now .

While XRP and Trump Coin are rallying off key catalysts, it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s quietly building toward what some analysts believe could be one of the most rewarding setups of the year. Let’s break down why these three are dominating investor watchlists right now. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! 1. MAGACOINFINANCE – The Emerging ROI Leader MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly distinguishing itself as a rising small-cap contender. With a strong thematic identity and carefully designed tokenomics, the project is resonating with traders seeking both relevance and structure. Key Strengths: Smart Contract Readiness: Deployed and verified for full transparency. Security Audit Completed: Passed comprehensive audit by blockchain security leader HashEx . Token Allocation Model: 45% to public sale 25% for extended marketing 15% for staking/community 10% for liquidity 4% for partnerships 1% reserved for the team High Demand Pressure: Rapid interest has triggered multiple price tier increases in a short period. ROI Outlook: With projections ranging between 25x–35x returns , MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining momentum on both the visibility and valuation fronts. Its smart launch structure, audit-backed credentials, and limited supply design are pushing it forward just as investor appetite for new narratives grows. In short, it’s the kind of early-stage play that serious altcoin watchers look for before the major wave hits. 2. Trump Coin ($TRUMP) – Latest Price: $10.12 | YTD ROI: +60% Trump Coin has rebounded sharply following a surge in media attention and a high-profile May 22 private gala dinner for its top 220 holders. The exclusive nature of the event, combined with a new treasury partnership from a U.S. logistics firm pledging $20 million in $TRUMP purchases, has revived bullish sentiment. Though highly speculative and sensitive to news flow, the token continues to attract strong community engagement, making it one of the most volatile—but intriguing—plays of the season. 3. XRP (Ripple) – Price: $2.22 | ETF Catalyst: $5–$12 Forecast XRP is now trading around $2.22 , fresh off a major SEC settlement that saw the regulator drop its final appeal. The resolution included a reduced $50 million fine and removed the last regulatory cloud from Ripple’s future. With an 85% ETF approval probability projected for this year, many see XRP heading toward $5 , with extended targets reaching up to $12 , depending on broader market conditions. Infrastructure strength and institutional appeal remain key drivers.

The flagship cryptocurrency jumped as high as $103,800, its highest price level since January 2025. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the BTC price might be in a make-or-break season. Is A BTC Parabolic Rally On The Horizon? Crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci took to the social media platform X to reveal that the Bitcoin Advanced Network Value to Transaction (NVT) metric has surpassed a critical threshold. According to the online pundit, this on-chain development suggests a potential shift in market dynamics, which could ultimately impact the price of BTC. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The Advanced NVT metric is a refined version of the traditional NVT indicator, which calculates the ratio of Network Value (market cap) by the volume (in USD) transferred through the blockchain daily. This Advanced Network Value to Transaction metric helps to better capture extreme valuation conditions. Hence, when the Advanced NVT metric surges above its long-term moving average by more than two standard deviations (2xSD), it implies that the BTC market cap growth does not correlate with its blockchain volume. Historically, this phenomenon often precedes either an extended price rally or sometimes a severe market correction. According to the data shared by Kesmeci, the Bitcoin Advanced NVT is above the 2xSD threshold, even though it might not persist above this level. The analyst mentioned that the indicator does not spend an extended period above 2xSD unless Bitcoin is on the verge of a parabolic price rally. Kesmeci noted: However, with a parabolic rally, it is possible that it could move much higher than 4xSD. This has happened before with the ETF rally after the approval of Spot ETFs. Furthermore, Kesmeci highlighted that while history suggests that Bitcoin Advanced NVT being above 2xSD is an anomaly that often precedes a rally, it is not set in stone that the indicator must lose the 2xSD level. Hence, investors might want to closely watch this BTC metric above this, as the premier cryptocurrency is currently at a critical juncture, which could define its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Over the past week, the price of BTC regained a six-figure valuation for the first time since losing the $100,000 level in February. As of this writing, the market leader sits just above the $103,100 mark, reflecting 0.5% jump in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, though, Bitcoin’s value is up by more than 6%.

Analysts Highlight Its Distinctive Role Among Altcoins,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-magacoinfinance-the-smartest-buy-for-2025-analysts-highlight-its-distinctive-role-among-altcoins/,"MAGACOINFINANCE: A Standout in the New Cycle As the altcoin market prepares for another wave of narrative-driven growth, MAGACOINFINANCE has entered the spotlight—not just as a meme project, but as a politically aligned token gaining rapid traction. Positioned at the crossroads of digital assets and cultural relevance, it’s being closely followed by analysts looking for the next cycle’s breakout candidate. Political Themes and Crypto Performance Historically, political-themed coins have outperformed during election seasons. Tokens tied to prominent figures—especially those aligned with Donald Trump or MAGA branding—have seen price surges driven by retail energy, media exposure, and broader social trends. MAGACOINFINANCE is building on this proven template, launching during a critical election year with an identity that resonates deeply across ideological and online communities. Much like its predecessors, its timing and theme give it an edge in capturing viral and speculative capital at once. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Market Structuring and Momentum from the Ground Up While many meme coins live or die by hype alone, MAGACOINFINANCE is approaching its growth with structure. The project’s ongoing token sale has drawn widespread interest, with investors engaging early due to a tiered pricing model and limited supply allocation. Strong early participation, combined with disciplined tokenomics, is generating growing demand without overexposing the asset. For early buyers, this creates a feeling of exclusivity and long-term value. The traction MAGACOINFINANCE is receiving is not simply due to social sentiment—it’s rooted in how it’s being built. Perfect Timing in a Narrative-Driven Cycle Altcoin booms often align with narrative shifts—and 2025 is shaping up to be such a moment. With the convergence of key events like ETF speculation , protocol upgrades, and election-related developments, the stage is set for alternative coins with storytelling appeal. MAGACOINFINANCE lands at this precise moment. It brings political relevance, meme coin familiarity, and early-market entry all together during a period of resurging speculative energy—creating ideal conditions for sustained growth if momentum holds. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Analyst Sentiment: Early Signals Point to Strong Setup Analysts are increasingly comparing MAGACOINFINANCE to early political meme tokens that later delivered exceptional ROI. While risk is inherent in all new projects, the structural design, macro timing, and branding alignment give it real upside potential. With its token sale accelerating and investor sentiment turning positive, many believe this could be one of the last meaningful early-stage altcoin entries before larger caps dominate headlines again. Final Thoughts More than a novelty, MAGACOINFINANCE taps into something deeper: the intersection of culture, timing, and crypto speculation. It brings a focused structure to a market often flooded with low-effort clones—and does so during a season where political attention is likely to fuel digital asset narratives. As the world heads deeper into a pivotal election year and altcoin rotations intensify, MAGACOINFINANCE may be uniquely positioned to ride that wave.

While these established giants remain in the spotlight, the analyst singles out MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout contender with the potential to surpass them all heading into 2025. With early investor momentum, rapid sales growth, and forecasts suggesting exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a top altcoin to watch this year LISTINGS COULD DROP ANY MOMENT –ACT NOW Bitcoin: Institutional Momentum Drives New Highs Bitcoin has surged past $100,000, fueled by institutional inflows and ETF approvals. Analysts forecast targets up to $250,000 as adoption accelerates. Policy support and growing demand make BTC the market’s top performer. Ethereum: Uptrend Fueled by Upgrades and ETF Prospects Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade and rising validator activity have reignited bullish sentiment. A potential U.S. spot ETH ETF could push prices to $2,800–$3,500 by early 2025. As Web3 infrastructure, ETH’s growth remains steady and reliable. Cardano: Bullish Reversal as Ecosystem Expands Cardano has broken above $0.80, signaling a bullish reversal after months of consolidation. DeFi growth and ecosystem expansion support a move toward $1.00–$1.10 by year-end. ADA’s focus on scalability keeps investor confidence high. XRP: Legal Clarity Unlocks Institutional Capital XRP’s legal victories have cleared the path for institutional investment and new XRPL integrations. With ETF approval likely, a breakout above $2.46 could see XRP target $5. Regulatory clarity positions XRP for a top-three comeback. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Altcoin With 25x Potential While major coins might double or triple, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to multiply far beyond that. With over 50,000 community members and viral demand driving daily presale inflows, it’s now being tracked as one of the top altcoins to watch this year. Backed by narrative momentum, structured tokenomics, and strong early engagement, MAGACOINFINANCE has what Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP no longer offer: a low entry point with massive upside still ahead . The project is featured by major crypto publishers , trending across social platforms , and has a CMC listing around the corner — all while still being priced under $0.0003 . 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Final Word: Big names are moving.

BTC. The government continues its Bitcoin strategy despite strict conditions in a loan deal signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in late 2024. Currently, the country’s holdings are worth more than $641 million. The figures were reported by El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, which monitors and announces the country’s Bitcoin purchases. President Nayib Bukele’s government wants to stay the course of its Bitcoin policy. President Nayib Bukele is betting even bigger on Bitcoin. Even with international pushback and IMF advisories, he insists there will be no going back for the country’s Bitcoin strategy. On March 4, 2025, on X, he wrote : No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘Bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. President Nayib Bukele The Bukele government has been buying at least one Bitcoin a day. This has been going on since late 2023 and has continued in abundance into 2025. There are days when the government purchases more than a single BTC, depending on market prices and how much money is available. The buys are carried out via the Bitcoin Office, a special unit created to deal with crypto stuff for the government. This office is also in the habit of making routine media announcements and posting information regarding the government of El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings through its website and social media. IMF pressures El Salvador to restrict Bitcoin In December 2024, El Salvador signed a $1.4 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose public policy aims to stabilize the economy, encourage foreign investment, and reorganize national debt. But the offer was not without strings. The country agreed to halt any voluntary public sector accumulation of Bitcoin as part of a technical memorandum of understanding. This included activities such as purchasing and mining BTC. However, the agreement clarified that Bitcoin obtained through forfeiture, seizure, custody, or similar legal actions against individuals or companies would be exempt from this restriction. The memorandum of understanding further pointed out that the public sector included all hot and cold wallets under the governance of any government-owned entity. Some of the entities listed included the Chivo Wallet, La Agencia Administradora de Fondos Bitcoin, Comision Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa, and Oficina Nacional del Bitcoin. El Salvador’s lawmakers responded in January 2025 with a 55 to 2 vote to repeal the Bitcoin legal tender law. The law was later reversed; Bitcoin was still legal in the country, but it was no longer compulsory to use in transactions. Easing these strict regulations did not mean that the government stopped believing in the wonders of crypto. Bitcoin purchases continued, and by March 2025, the IMF reiterated its advice for El Salvador to stop buying the digital asset. But President Nayib Bukele resisted, rejecting the IMF’s request. This defiance has frightened international economists and investors. El Salvador is opening itself to gratuitous financial risk, many believe. Even the IMF has cautioned that continued Bitcoin purchases with public money could make the country’s fiscal outlook more volatile. Bukele expands Bitcoin reserves despite IMF deal El Salvador’s Bitcoin buying spree is not showing any signs of slowing. The Central American nation remains among the rare few actively acquiring Bitcoin through open market operations. Crypto industry leaders believe its national Bitcoin treasury approach could become a model for other countries exploring the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves. Some analysts think Bukele’s plan may encourage other small or emerging nations to consider Bitcoin a national reserve asset. El Salvador is the only country in the world taking public money in real-time and daily to generate purchases in Bitcoin. Critics call the move risky, while its supporters say it is visionary.

He says the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, led to a “total reset” in the two countries’ economic relationship. This comes after months of rising tensions and a damaging tariff war. The US trade representative , Robert Lighthizer, met with his Chinese counterpart Liu He in Geneva over the weekend. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent headed the US team, and Vice Premier He Lifeng led China’s team. The discussions occurred after the United States escalated a trade war by imposing tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese goods in April. China swiftly retaliated with 125 percent tariffs on American goods. Trump, who has adopted a tough stance toward China since re-entering office, wrote about the meeting on Truth Social. “Many things discussed, much agreed to,” he wrote. He noted that it is a total reset, negotiated in a friendly but firm way that allows the two countries to move forward on things they can do together. Trump added that they wanted to see China open up to American business for the benefit of both China and the United States and emphasized that great progress had been made. Negotiations in Geneva were more upbeat than many had anticipated. Both delegations characterized the meeting in reports as “frank” and “productive.” Trump signals possible tariff compromise as trade talks progress For some time, President Trump had insisted that he would not reduce tariffs without major concessions from China. He said the United States had been losing a trillion dollars a year—or more—in trade with China but added that they were no longer losing anything, which he considered a positive change. And yet, somehow, now he’s hinting that maybe he’s flexible. On Friday, Trump said an 80% tariff was “probably the correct number,” suggesting perhaps some compromise. By Saturday evening, people familiar with the talks said that negotiators discussed dropping tariffs between 50% and 60%, or as low as 34% for some sectors. Markets have responded cautiously. Investors are hoping an agreement will bring relief to industries hurt by the trade war — and those prospects are probably highest for agriculture, electronics, and logistics. The decline in China’s exports to the United States was steep, falling by more than 21% in April. American farmers and small businesses have also said they face higher costs and reduced sales because of the trade standoff. Negotiators plan to continue trade talks despite global concerns These conversations are expected to resume on Sunday. Both sides should delve even deeper into lingering issues. That includes intellectual property rights, opening markets in China for American companies, and closer tracking of restrictions of fentanyl in the class of drugs known as opioids. Officials have said they aim to reach a clear, stable trade agreement. That would enable businesses on each side to plan for the future, invest, and know that they would not suddenly face rule changes. Observers say the US wants China to agree to purchase more US products and open its market to outside companies. For its part, China has longed for some relief from the heavy tariffs and more predictable rules from Washington. Experts caution that while progress this weekend is promising, the road ahead is unclear. A final agreement could be weeks, if not months, away. Yet many consider the Geneva discussions a hopeful breakthrough after months of tension. With success, a deal could potentially reset not just trade but the larger relationship between the United States and China. BTC price is once again approaching a breakout to new all-time highs (ATHs), with a potential US-China trade agreement likely acting as the catalyst.

With the emergence of new technologies and ever-increasing adoption of blockchain, the industry is on the brink of revolutionizing global financial systems. As major cryptos show promising partnerships and technological advancements, the question arises: which are the top cryptos to join this week? Among the flood of options, three blockchain projects— Qubetics , Cosmos, and Binance Coin (BNB)—have come to the forefront. Each offering unique solutions, these coins strategically position themselves in the market. However, as more tokens and blockchain ecosystems enter the scene, only a few can offer innovative solutions to real-world problems. At the intersection of traditional financial systems and decentralized finance (DeFi), Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a standout contender with the potential to create a lasting impact. As blockchain technology rapidly advances, top cryptos to join this week are scrutinized by experts and investors alike. Qubetics is leading the charge as one of the most promising contenders. Qubetics: Transforming Cross-Border Transactions with Blockchain Technology With global commerce growing exponentially, the demand for efficient and cost-effective cross-border transactions has reached unprecedented levels. Traditional financial systems and banks often take days to process international payments and charge high fees, creating an urgent need for innovation. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a project designed to address these issues by offering businesses, professionals, and individuals a faster, cheaper alternative. The $TICS token powers the Qubetics ecosystem, which leverages blockchain to create seamless cross-border payments. With the increasing global reliance on decentralized finance, Qubetics’ presale has already made significant strides in raising over $16.8 million, selling 511 million tokens to more than 26,000 holders in its 33rd crypto presale stage. This highlights the growing interest in blockchain solutions that reduce friction and enhance transaction transparency. As Qubetics continues to flourish, top cryptos to join this week, like $TICS have caught the attention of investors looking for high ROI opportunities. Key Benefits of Qubetics for Cross-Border Transactions: Faster Transactions: Traditional cross-border transactions take several days to process. Qubetics promises near-instant transfers, dramatically improving speed. Lower Fees: By eliminating intermediaries, Qubetics significantly reduces transaction fees compared to conventional systems. Greater Security: Blockchain’s inherent security features protect transactions from fraud, offering users greater peace of mind. Global Accessibility: Qubetics is a decentralized system that allows users worldwide to transact without relying on centralized financial institutions. Qubetics is now well-positioned to address one of the biggest challenges in global finance—cross-border payments—providing businesses and individuals a way to transfer funds quickly, securely, and affordably. As a result, it’s undoubtedly one of the top cryptos to join this week for those looking to be part of the next wave of blockchain innovation. Analysts’ Predictions: As the crypto presale continues, analysts predict significant growth for the $TICS token. After the presale ends, projections show a remarkable ROI for early adopters: $TICS at $1 After the Presale: 334% ROI $TICS at $5 After the Presale: 2071% ROI $TICS at $6 After Mainnet Launch: 2505% ROI $TICS at $10 After Mainnet Launch: 4243% ROI $TICS at $15 After Mainnet Launch: 6414% ROI With such strong predictions, Qubetics ($TICS) presents an exciting opportunity for those seeking a promising blockchain project in the cross-border payment space and is certainly one of the top cryptos to join this week. Sei Network to Abandon Cosmos Support, Eyes Full EVM Transition with SIP-3 Proposal Sei Network is poised to undergo a major architectural overhaul as it considers dropping Cosmos support to become an EVM-only blockchain, per the SIP-3 proposal introduced by core developer Philip Su. Set for community discussion on May 14, this shift would phase out CosmWasm contracts, cease native Cosmos messaging, and introduce “EVM Pointers” to bridge existing Cosmos assets into the Ethereum-compatible layer. The move follows mounting technical complexity and a clear user preference for EVM protocols after the network’s v2 upgrade. Developers and users will face asset migrations and code rewrites. Still, proponents argue the transition will streamline infrastructure, enhance toolset compatibility, and align Sei with the broader Ethereum ecosystem for long-term scalability and adoption. BNB Price Eyes $1,110 Breakout as Cup-and-Handle Pattern Aligns with Potential Trump Pardon for CZ Binance Coin (BNB) is poised for a major breakout as it forms a textbook cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart, signaling a potential rally toward $1,110—especially if former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao secures a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. Currently trading around $615, BNB has shown resilience amid market consolidation, and technical analysts point to the bullish continuation pattern—formed since its 2021 peak at $662—as a key driver of upcoming momentum. A pardon could serve as a powerful catalyst, boosting investor sentiment and clearing the path for CZ to re-engage with U.S. crypto markets, potentially reviving Binance US. With historical rallies tied to favorable CZ developments and renewed institutional optimism, analysts forecast a breakout past $740 could ignite a surge first toward $1,000 and eventually to $1,110, while a drop below $485 would nullify the bullish outlook. Conclusion: Why Qubetics is a Game-Changer As the cryptocurrency market progresses, the demand for faster, more affordable, and secure blockchain solutions is greater than ever. While projects like Cosmos and Binance Coin have made substantial contributions to the industry, Qubetics ($TICS) stands poised to take advantage of a critical gap in the market: efficient cross-border transactions. With its impressive crypto presale performance, growing adoption, and bold vision for the future, Qubetics has positioned itself as a project to watch closely. For those searching for the top cryptos to join this week, Qubetics presents an exciting opportunity. As blockchain technology continues transforming financial systems, Qubetics is paving the way for businesses and individuals to experience the future of payments today. For those looking to be part of the blockchain revolution, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the top cryptos to join this week with immense growth potential.

Surprisingly, it’s not just retail buyers jumping in—whales from the XRP and Cardano (ADA) communities are beginning to reposition into this rising asset. After securing $8 million in early funding, MAGACOINFINANCE is making waves—not because of hype, but due to its structured launch, transparent mechanics, and increasing analyst attention. While ADA and XRP remain technically solid but stuck in neutral, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging with real upside potential and near-term actionability. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! XRP and ADA Hold Ground—But Lack Momentum In May 2025, both Cardano and XRP are in the spotlight—but for very different reasons: Cardano (ADA) shows signs of a bullish reversal thanks to growing speculation around a possible Cardano ETF , plus real-world adoption ahead of the LAOS upgrade. Still, ADA is hovering between $0.70–$0.72 , with resistance near $0.81 and $1.17 yet to break. XRP , now priced around $2.22 , has been volatile due to delays in ETF filings and softened trading volume. Though Bloomberg analysts still assign an 85% probability to an ETF greenlight in 2025, the mood remains cautious following the SEC’s latest stall. Both remain credible long-term holds—but the lack of immediate catalysts is steering attention toward emerging high-ROI assets like MAGACOINFINANCE . Over 3,000% ROI Potential + 50% Bonus Fuel the Surge MAGACOINFINANCE is currently delivering what some analysts call a textbook early-stage investment scenario. Here’s why: Projected returns above 3,000% from presale to listing 50% bonus tokens available during the active round Fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale Bonuses dropping and prices climbing steadily as demand builds With a well-calibrated structure and no open-ended timelines or vague ambitions, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out from the flood of meme tokens circulating today. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Positioned for a 25x–35x Climb Before Year-End Analysts forecast MAGACOINFINANCE hitting its listing target of $0.007 , translating to an expected return of 25x to 35x from current levels. What supports that projection? A global-scale marketing campaign is already planned Influencer and agency partnerships are underway Exchange listing conversations are active Unlike most token sales that lean on hype without delivery, MAGACOINFINANCE is already executing—a fact not lost on XRP and ADA holders now rotating capital in. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Watched Closely by Analysts More than a narrative token, MAGACOINFINANCE is now being cited as one of the few high-potential early-stage plays. For those who missed out on ETH , SHIBA INU , or DOGE in their early days, this may be the next serious contender. While ADA and XRP continue to trade within well-defined ranges, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in price discovery mode—and gathering momentum fast. With institutional-grade branding, expanding community traction, and over 20,000 active holders , it’s rapidly climbing the altcoin radar for 2025. This is no longer about “if”—it’s about when .

The cryptocurrency stablecoin almost ended its smooth business in the US, with several Senate Republicans and possibly some Democrats pushing to bring it under U.S. jurisdiction. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act was far from radical. In fact, it was one of the more sensible crypto bills we’ve seen in years. Designed to bring transparency and accountability to stablecoin issuers, it laid out basic safeguards: licensing requirements, mandatory reserve disclosures, and federal oversight. Not exactly revolutionary, just responsible. Luckily for Tether, the Senate failed to advance a vote to initiate formal debate on the newly revised GENIUS Act. The revised GENIUS Act provisions raised questions among DeFi players If you’ve followed the digital asset space for more than five minutes, you know Tether is everywhere — powering most crypto trades , providing liquidity to DeFi, and even acting as a quasi-central bank for some offshore markets. Yet, Tether has long been criticized for its lack of transparency and murky reserve practices. This bill could have forced Tether and other issuers to play by clearer, safer rules. But instead, the Senate blinked. Originally introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) in February, the GENIUS) Act was co-sponsored by Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) and Subcommittee on Digital Assets Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY). After receiving bipartisan support, Hagerty’s legislation fell 48-49 on the Senate floor on Thursday Before the vote, Republican lawmakers revised the bill, adding a few provisions that some lawmakers claimed they had not read or reviewed beforehand. Some even claimed the Republicans rushed the vote on the legislation and even called off negotiations prematurely. These factors and sentiments affected the vote, with several Democrats pulling their support for the bill. Moreover, the revised bill does leave out the names of the two Democratic co-sponsors, Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks. The new bill is now solely sponsored by Republicans, including only Senators. Bill Hagerty, Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, and Sen. Dan Sullivan. However, the bill stands a better chance of advancing in the Senate if at least one Democrat signs on as a co-sponsor. The new bill includes “extraterritoriality,” which would obligate foreign stablecoin issuers to follow U.S. regulations when offering their services to American customers. Unfortunately for Tether, this provision could mean the end of its regulatory gray area and the beginning of stricter oversight. However, per previous stipulations, the bill supports stablecoin providers expanding to other types of assets, which could benefit the company in the long run. Unlike the old version, the new bill also widens the scope of what constitutes a digital asset service provider, including developers, validator nodes, and operators of self-custodial wallets. Nonetheless, the definition change raises concerns about its possible effect on different facilitators of DeFi protocols and whether they would need to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and AML laws. Not to mention, Digital asset service providers can now be charged for using unauthorized like decentralized stablecoins. Additionally, the new GENIUS Act allows the Treasury Secretary to ease regulations for smaller or pilot projects and to act alone in ‘exigent circumstances,’ raising questions about possible executive overreach. Nevertheless, now that the bill is open to the public, the crypto community can gauge its advantages, possible impact on the industry, and how it differs from the bill approved by the Senate Committee in March. The stablecoin bill could be up for discussion again While the stablecoin bill failed to advance, some analysts believe it’s only a temporary stalemate, and the bill may eventually pass. Kara Calvert, vice president of U.S. policy at Coinbase, even commented, “It’s going to live to fight another day. Would I have liked to see the vote pass? Absolutely. Would that have made the day better? Absolutely. But I didn’t walk away thinking this bill is going to die, or this issue is going away.” Senator Ruben Gallego, the top Democrat on the Senate’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, had sought to postpone the vote until Monday to give lawmakers additional time to evaluate the bill. However, his request was denied, and the bill failed to proceed. Meanwhile, Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto advocacy group The Digital Chamber, acknowledged the bill’s vote-down on Thursday as a setback but believes it is still “far from a defeat.” Some analysts have also argued that there could be another vote to commence discussions on the stablecoin bill by the end of May. If lawmakers are serious about protecting consumers, fostering innovation, and reclaiming leadership in financial technology, they can’t allow personal politics to derail essential legislation. The GENIUS Act wasn’t just about Tether. It was about creating a blueprint for how digital dollars should operate in the world’s largest economy. That blueprint needs to be drawn soon, whether through this bill or another.",OP-ED|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-11 02:30:19

Bullish momentum in the past five days has caused Ethereum’s price action to surge past the $2,200 level with conviction, rising more than 32% in the past seven days alone. The breakout comes as Bitcoin crossed the six-figure mark again, lifting the broader crypto market along with it. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling According to technical analysis of Ethereum’s daily candlestick chart, this rally is more than just a reaction to Bitcoin; it is the start of a new long-term uptrend. $2,200 Breakout Confirms Strength, Analyst Declares End Of Bear Market The recent surge has lifted Ethereum well beyond $2,000, a price level that acted as a ceiling in late March and early April. According to technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MasterAnanda, Ethereum’s bear market is finally over. This comment was made in light of what the analyst called a real bullish action, coupled with really high volume in the past few days. This, in turn, confirms a very strong high in the coming weeks and days, where Ethereum will grow daily non-stop for months. The recent rally has taken the price above the August 5, 2024, and February 3, 2025 lows, highlighted on a chart posted by the analyst on TradingView. The chart also shows that Ethereum broke free convincingly from a steep descending channel pattern that had trapped its price for months. The breakout is convincing because a large green candle accompanied by unusually high trading volume marked the breakout, lending credibility to the view that the bear phase is now over. “This is only the start,” the analyst wrote, adding that Ethereum’s path toward reclaiming its all-time highs is already underway. $5,791 An ‘Easy’ Target, $10,000 Before 2026 ‘Doable’ According to MasterAnanda’s analysis, the current rally could easily carry Ethereum to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level near $5,791.78. He describes this target as “easy”, given the strength of the breakout and the capital inflow that appears to be building behind it. Reaching the $5,791 price target would translate to a breakout to uncharted price territories above Ethereum’s current all-time high of $4,878. However, the prediction doesn’t stop there. A $10,000 Ethereum is not only possible but likely before the end of 2025 due to institutional money and retail sentiment flooding into the market. The chart illustrates Ethereum’s recovery path with various Fibonacci levels mapped out, showing resistance and retracement points ranging from $2,421 at the 0.382 extension up to $5,791 at the 1.618 extension. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy The analyst noted that around $250 billion in capital could eventually flow into the crypto market during this wave, with $10 to $15 billion already in play. He argues that the euphoric phase will begin once the remaining capital enters. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,395.

XRP is hovering around $2.20 , supported by continued ETF anticipation and strong institutional sentiment. SHIB is staying active with frequent token burns and increased on-chain traffic. Meanwhile, SUI has risen to become one of the top-performing Layer-1 blockchains , now trading near $3.50 and benefitting from growing DeFi momentum. But while these assets maintain visibility, many forward-looking traders are making a move — redirecting their capital into MAGACOINFINANCE , a rising altcoin that’s still early and packed with growth potential. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Attracting Savvy Traders Right Now The reasons behind this shift are clear: MAGACOINFINANCE offers early access, rising demand, and a narrative that fits perfectly within 2025’s trading environment. Its ongoing token sale is progressing rapidly, with multiple rounds closing out fast and new buyers entering with urgency. What makes it different? Unlike heavily traded coins like XRP, SHIB, and SUI, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers pre-market entry — giving investors the chance to participate before major exchange listings and price discovery take hold. High Demand, Scarcity, and Early Incentives Are Fueling Momentum The project’s structured token release, rising participation rate, and well-defined brand are combining to create sustained investor interest. As each pricing tier closes, the value proposition increases — early entrants are already benefiting from deeper positioning before visibility goes mainstream. With future upgrades, partnerships, and listings in development, many believe the current window is the ideal time to move — not after media headlines begin driving crowd behavior. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Final Insight: The Rotation Has Already Begun XRP , SHIBA INU , and SUI will likely remain solid portfolio components. But for those actively rotating into high-upside opportunities, MAGACOINFINANCE is where the spotlight is shifting. With its fast-moving sale and growing traction, this could be the early-phase investment that traders look back on as their smartest play of the year.

Armstrong said the Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy could have risked the company’s cash position and potentially killed the crypto exchange. “We made a conscious choice about risk,” he added. Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas, who also attended the video call, added that the firm didn’t want to be seen as directly competing against its customers over which cryptocurrencies would outperform. “Rest assured, we are not stopping there,” Haas said, as Coinbase reported purchasing another $153 million worth of crypto assets in its first quarter results statement on May 8, which was primarily concentrated in Bitcoin. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net , Coinbase holds 9,480 Bitcoin — worth $988 million at current market prices — which makes up the majority of its $1.3 billion crypto asset holdings. Armstrong’s crypto exchange is the ninth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing the likes of Strategy, Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and Tesla. Related: $45 million stolen from Coinbase users in the last week — ZachXBT Several companies have begun copying Saylor’s Bitcoin playbook, funding purchases through stock and debt sales on the bet that Bitcoin’s price appreciation will boost their share prices.

The acquisition will expand Coinbase’s footprint in the crypto derivatives market immensely, which previously had been limited to its Bermuda-based platform. Coinbase noted that Deribit facilitated over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024 and has around $30 billion of current open interest.

Analysts say this rise could be linked to recent comments by the U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced a major breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade talks. If this reset is real, it could lift investor confidence across global markets. Experts believe that this positive news might remove economic uncertainty and push markets even higher. As global liquidity increases, risk assets like cryptocurrencies are expected to follow. Bitcoin Dominance Falling, Altcoins Rising Bitcoin’s dominance—its share of the total crypto market—is dropping, which often signals a shift toward altcoins. A similar pattern happened in late 2024, just before a major altcoin rally. If the trend continues, May and June could be very bullish months for crypto investors. Ethereum has already climbed nearly 40% in just a week and is trading above $2,500. Altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s movement, and with BTC on the rise, many believe altcoins are about to surge as well. At the same time, USDT dominance (how much of the market is held in the Tether stablecoin) is decreasing. This means more investors are moving their money from stablecoins into crypto assets—another positive sign for the market. XRP Could Be Ready for a Big Move Technical analysts are paying close attention to XRP, which recently broke out of a 112-day downtrend. If the rally continues, XRP could hit $2.80 soon, and potentially even set a new all-time high. Some bullish price targets suggest it could go as high as $5.65, especially if it continues to hold above key support levels. The XRP/BTC trading pair also looks promising. It’s currently trying to break out of a “falling wedge” pattern—often a sign of a big move to the upside. Preparing for a Potential Crypto Surge Some analysts are predicting a local market top in June or July, with Bitcoin possibly reaching $120,000 to $130,000. If that happens, Ethereum could return to $4,000, and XRP might approach $4.00.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-11 03:48:22

These legacy assets are once again dominating watchlists across institutional desks and retail communities. But quietly, a new name is being added to the conversation. MAGACOIN FINANCE , an early-stage presale token, is emerging as a contender that could rival — and possibly outperform — even the biggest names in the next breakout wave. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength Meets Real Utility Solana is back above $150 , rebounding from its April lows and trading with renewed strength. With resistance at $153–$155 , analysts believe a breakout could send SOL toward $175 or higher . Solana has also solidified its position in payments and stablecoin settlement, shedding its memecoin-chain reputation and delivering real infrastructure value. RSI: Hovering near 61, suggesting moderate momentum with room for a breakout Price Prediction: $175 short term; $212 possible if ETF speculation materializes Cardano (ADA): Quiet But Consistent Cardano has long played the long game — and it’s beginning to pay off. The blockchain’s focus on sustainability, scalability, and academic rigor is once again drawing investor attention. Trading near $0.68 , ADA has room to climb, with analysts citing a potential move to $1.10–$1.20 if current momentum holds through Q2. RSI: Currently at 57, signaling accumulation phase Price Prediction: Targets range from $0.95 to $1.20 by late Q2 XRP: Post-Rally Consolidation with More to Come XRP has held steady above $2 , following a wave of institutional interest and expanding utility in cross-border settlements. With legal overhangs now largely behind it, XRP’s upside is tied to real adoption — and many believe it could reclaim past highs if market sentiment continues to improve. RSI: Near 64, slightly overbought but maintaining bullish structure Price Prediction: $2.40–$2.65 short term; potential for $3+ with volume confirmation MAGACOIN FINANCE: Still Early, Still Undervalued While the big three command the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly attracting early-stage investors looking for meaningful upside. Trading below $0.001 and available only via magacoinfinance.com , the project is entering Stage 7 with strong momentum. With a projected listing target of $0.007 , built-in scarcity, and a 50% token bonus via promo code MAGA50X , analysts say this setup mirrors the early conditions of breakout projects like SHIB and PEPE. Coins launched from similar structures have delivered 18,500%+ gains in previous cycles — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is building under those same principles. This isn’t the end. It’s just the beginning.

The broader ETF market now holds over 6% of total supply, yet BRRR has not benefited from that inflow. I continue to see BTC as a 'buy' following a technical breakout and a return of investor demand. BRRR will work fine as a long Bitcoin product, though I still prefer FBTC personally. Back in early December, I wrote about the declining dominance of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) within the digital asset market. My thinking then was that we could be at the beginning of an 'alt season' in crypto. That turned out to be a poor assessment, as Bitcoin Dominance has continued higher through the five months since that piece was published. The metric has moved from 55% up to 62%: Bitcoin Dominance 5/9/25 (CoinMarketCap) The performance of alts against Bitcoin was so bad that at one point in April, CryptoMarketCap's 'Altcoin Season Index' fell all the way to 12. That number has since reversed higher up to 33 and is now at its highest level in nearly 3 months. In the past, we've seen altcoin out-performance be an indicator of bull market exhaustion. Given that, let's explore some historical cycle top indicators for Bitcoin to see if we should be concerned about a deeper market pullback. Or, is the BTC price now more a product of traditional market capital flows through ETFs like the CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (NASDAQ: BRRR ). Historical Indicators & Performance There are several ratios and models that can be used to assess when Bitcoin's price is at or approaching profit-taking levels. Personally, I don't think it's prudent to use these indicators as forecasts or price targets. Rather, they can help investors/traders assess when price is perhaps getting out of hand relative to its past performance. One such metric that I find useful is the Pi Cycle Top Indicator. This utilizes price with the 111 DMA as well as a 2x multiple on the 350 DMA: Bitcoin Magazine PRO When price gets close to or even well above the 350 DMA multiple, it has historically been an indication that the cycle top has been achieved, and the rally is extended. As of May 9th, the green band on the indicator - which is the 2x 350 DMA - is at $157k per coin. This would imply BTC could rally another 50% from current levels before a sell signal would be triggered. Another metric to consider is the MVRV, or market value to realized value ratio: MVRV Ratio (IntoTheBlock) This is another way of showing when BTC is 'overvalued' based on the premium the market is willing to pay for BTC over the average price paid for each address. Bitcoin is historically 'cheap' when the MVRV is less than 100%. It is currently at 212%. Which I wouldn't say is 'cheap' by any means, but also far from the 435% MVRV Ratio in 2017 and the 373% MVRV Ratio in 2021. More recently, the ratio has eclipsed 260% on two separate occasions going back to March 2024. The question is whether or not Bitcoin holders should expect lower highs in these types of ratios as halving cycles progress. We do know the price performance gains have generally exhibited lower returns each halving epoch: BTC Price Gain By Halving Epoch (IntoTheBlock) The first halving epoch generated a return that eclipsed over 7,000%. The second was about 3,000%. The third was roughly 1000%. Clearly, there should be an expectation of diminishing returns in the price performance if history is a guide. Again, the question is what is a reasonably expected price performance high level for this current halving cycle. I think it would be wise to expect well below half the prior cycle. Frankly, I think even a 200% gain this time around would be ambitious, as that would put the price of BTC close to $190k per coin. But even if we split that and call it 100%, that would put BTC in the $130k per coin range and somewhat close to the Pi Cycle Top Indicator. I think this is a far more reasonable expectation. ETFs & a Capital-Driven Market Ultimately, price comes down to capital flows and demand from products like ETFs as well as companies like Strategy ( MSTR ). There, we're seeing a strong surge in demand, with $5.5 billion in digital asset inflows in the last three weeks: Capital Flows By Asset (CoinShares) Compared with the broader digital asset investment market, Bitcoin is clearly the favorite here, nearly 99% of the total year to date flows coming from Bitcoin alone. If 'altcoin season' is ever going to happen, it certainly doesn't look like it's anywhere close. It's difficult for me to see how the lack of a fresh 'altseason' wouldn't ultimately benefit Bitcoin. Especially since we're still only looking at two assets available through the spot ETF wrapper in the United States - though that could certainly change this year. Regardless, the trend in aggregate BTC held through US-based ETFs is positive: BTC Held Through ETFs/Funds ( Bitcoin Treasuries ) At just shy of 1.4 million BTC, the ETF/CEF funds have grown substantially through the years and now hold over 6% of total supply. Interestingly, BRRR is not a fund that is benefiting from this, as the fund's BTC is lower than where it was a year ago. Admittedly, there are some conflicting third-party numbers pertaining to what BRRR actually holds. The Block has BRRR Bitcoin holdings at 3,250 BTC while Bitcoin Treasuries has the fund at 6,554 BTC: BRRR Assets ( Bitcoin Treasuries ) CoinShares' own website cites 6,093 BTC as of May 9th. Regardless, it does appear as though assets held through this ETF have declined while other funds like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) continue to see inflow generally speaking. At a 0.25% expense ratio, BRRR is far from the most expensive spot fund, but it's also not the cheapest; which might explain why the fund hasn't meaningfully grown its stack in the last year. Closing Summary I've been making the argument for some time through Seeking Alpha pieces and elsewhere that Bitcoin's price appreciation is more narrative-driven than fundamentally driven. There are some who might take issue with that framing, but I'm separating Bitcoin the decentralized ledger system from Bitcoin the digital asset. Meaning, Bitcoin's price may go up - but at least to this point in time, that appreciation in price has been more about capital flows into an anti-fiat currency thesis rather than from actual utility of the ledger system by a growing base of users. Fundamentally, the network has been experiencing declining usage since 2023 . To be clear, I have no issue with Bitcoin the digital asset appreciating because of capital flows. Longer term, the math may stop working if miners have no incentive to validate transactions, but that's a problem for a different day. Given the price breakout , investor interest, and the lack of overheated cycle indicators, I think Bitcoin remains a buy and BRRR is a fine way to express that trade. Though I do still prefer FBTC as my spot ETF of choice.",BTC-USD|BRRR,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-11 03:59:00

After struggling to find direction for the first few days of May, the XRP price has now returned to test the $2.25 mark, a resistance that has consistently held since January and is beginning to define XRP’s broader macrostructure. This latest price action comes after a sharp rebound from the $2.08 zone, and reclaiming the ensuing resistance at $2.25 could open the door to much higher targets. $2.25 Resistance Defines The Battle Zone Despite the rally, technical analysis suggests that XRP could battle with resistance near $2.25, or reverse to retest this level even when there’s a breakout. Price movements are becoming increasingly reactive, and there could be a potential breakout or breakdown, depending on how this level resolves. According to a technical analysis shared on social media platform X, the $2.25 level is going to be important for XRP, given that the price has now tested this resistance level multiple times since early 2025. At the time of the analysis, the XRP price is showing hesitation under the breakout point on the hourly candlestick timeframe, with intraday wicks repeatedly failing to close convincingly above $2.249 to $2.273. Notably, this level is clustered with Fibonacci levels, like the 0.392 retracement level from the January 2025 peak, and close to the Fibonacci retracement zone at 0.118 (near $2.27) from the April peak price. So far, XRP buyers have held the line after bouncing off $2.077, which aligns with the 0.382 retracement level. However, the relative strength index (RSI) near 72 shows that XRP is approaching overbought conditions on the hourly timeframe, which adds another layer of complexity. Although the RSI hasn’t given a definitive reversal signal, the market’s sensitivity around this level means a rejection could send the price quickly toward $2.00 or even $1.90, where the 0.5 and 0.618 retracements lie as marked support zones. What Happens If XRP Reclaims $2.25 The broader structure of XRP is currently bullish, with the hourly price chart showing formations of higher lows since the April bottom just above $1.60. Should XRP successfully reclaim and close above $2.25, the resistance could flip into support and open up higher targets with little friction ahead. The next key level is around $2.36, which marks the local April top. A breakout toward that region would signal a strong continuation of the macro bullish trend and an eventual return to $2.7 and beyond. Interestingly, the buying volume surrounding XRP has provided early confirmation of this bullish trend. At the time of writing, XRP has since broken above the $2.25 level on the hourly chart, although it needs to close above it on the daily timeframe. XRP is currently trading at $2.37.

SHIBA INU and XRP , while still household names in crypto, are beginning to show signs of flattening trajectories. In their place, a rising contender is making waves: MAGACOINFINANCE , a low-cap token that’s rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in the space. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Traction With Real Backing CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT What’s setting MAGACOINFINANCE apart isn’t just its meme relevance—it’s the foundation it’s been built on. The project is gaining attention thanks to fast-moving presale demand, a strong on-chain presence, and clear alignment with the cultural and political narratives defining this year’s crypto discussions. Why Traders Are Watching MAGACOINFINANCE Closely: Smart Contract Already Live : The contract is deployed and operational on-chain, offering transparency from the start. Audit Completed by HashEx : This provides additional trust, especially among cautious investors.

Combined, these elements make MAGACOINFINANCE a standout among smaller-cap projects poised for a strong performance. SHIBA and XRP Still Matter—But Are They Slowing Down? SHIBA INU , currently priced around $0.00001340 , is experiencing more sideways movement. Without major ecosystem updates, explosive movement may be delayed. XRP , hovering near $2.22 , has clarity post-SEC case and ETF discussions in motion. However, its large market cap may limit further exponential moves. Both are solid holdings, but for traders seeking the type of early-stage leverage that defined the 2021 and 2017 cycles, the next breakout may lie elsewhere.

Here are the steps you need to follow to buy and sell Pi Coins. How To Buy Pi Coin? Choose an Exchange: Pick a well-known and trusted exchange that supports Pi Coin trading. As of May 2025, you can find Pi Coin (PI) on platforms like OKX, MEXC, BitMart, Bitget, KuCoin, and Bybit. Sign Up and Complete KYC: Register on the exchange and complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, depending on the region, by submitting necessary identification documents. Deposit funds in your account using available methods or other payment options supported by the exchange. Next, search for “Pi Coin” or “PI” on the exchange platform. Select the appropriate trading pair (e.g., PI/USD, PI/USDT, or PI/ETH). Place an Order: Choose your order type (market or limit), enter the amount of Pi Coin you want to purchase, and confirm the transaction. For extra security, you can transfer your Pi Coins to a personal wallet and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your account. How To Sell Pi Coins? If you have a Pi account and have migrated your coins to the Mainnet, you are ready to sell the coins. You’ll also need the Pi Browser app to create a Pi Wallet and complete your KYC verification. Further, if you plan to hold the funds after selling, you can move them to a non-custodial wallet for better security. Create an Account – Sign up on a trusted exchange that supports Pi and complete the KYC verification process. Make sure to avoid the exchanges that Pi Network community has not recognised officially. Find Your Trading Pair – Search for the particular Pi trading pair like PI/USDT, PI/EUR, or PI/BTC. Place A Sell Order – Next, place a sell order. In case of a market order, you can sell instantly at the current market price. In a limit order, you can set a specific price and wait for it to be matched. Withdrawal – Once your order is complete, the balance will usually be updated in USDT or the base currency. You can then choose to withdraw to a crypto wallet, convert to fiat, or swap to another crypto. Tips When Choosing an Exchange Look for low trading fees and small price spreads (difference between buy and sell prices). Pick platforms with high trading volume and strong liquidity, so trades go through quickly and at good prices.

That stash is valued at roughly $52.66 million across multiple exchange platforms. When so much enters exchanges all at once, it can trigger massive price movements and increased volatility.

Combined with previous deposits, over $24 million worth of TRUMP tokens flowed onto exchanges in recent days. Chain observers noted the timing, as the activity preceded a high-profile political reception on May 22. Some investors are concerned it is a sign of a group exit strategy among large holders. Others point out that market makers will frequently swap tokens to hedge against risk and balance order books. Either situation keeps eyes fixed on the next giant transfer. WLFI Increases Crypto Holdings Meanwhile, a wallet associated with World Liberty Financial purchased 1,587 ETH for approximately $3.5 million.

It jumped to a high of $180 on Saturday, and is hovering at its highest level since March this year. It has spiked by almost 90% from its lowest point this year. This article explores why the SOL price may be a coiled spring ready to pounce. Solana meme coins are rebounding One of the top reasons why the SOL price is about to surge is that Solana meme coins have gone parabolic in the past few days. Official Trump Coin price has surged by 29% in the last seven days, while Bonk, Fartcoin, Dogwifhat , Pudgy Penguins, and Popcat have all soared by double digits. This recovery has brought the market cap of all Solana meme coins to $13.1 billion, up from $6 billion a few weeks ago. It is a sign that these tokens will always do well when there is a rally in the crypto market. The surge in these meme coins helps to boost Solana’s sentiment, and boosting its ecosystem revenue and fees. Data shows that the volume handled by decentralized exchange protocols on Solana rose by 7% in the last seven days to over $21.7 billion, bringing th 30-day figure to $80 billion. Solana’s network handled more assets than Ethereum and BSC, which handled $51 billion and $35 billion, respectively. SOL stablecoin market cap is soaring Stablecoins are the currencies that people use in the cryptocurrency industry since one cannot use fiat currencies like the US dollar and the euro. Therefore, one of the top metrics to look at when evaluating a cryptocurrency’s growth is the stablecoin market cap. Solana has one of the most active stablecoin presence, with their market cap jumping to over $12 billion. While this figure is smaller than Ethereum’s $215 billion and Tron’s $73 billion, it is a sign that it is growing. Similarly, the total value locked (TVL) in th Solana ecosystem has jumped to almost $10 billion today. All these factors have contributed to the robust fees that Solana has made this year. Data shows that Solana has made $710 million this year, making it the third-most profitable network in the crypto industry after Tether and Tron. It has beaten Ethereum, which has made $616 million. Staked Solana inflows is rising Further, investors have pumped over 7 million SOL tokens worth $1 billion to Solana staking pools, bringing the total staking market cap to almost $70 billion. This growth has brought the staking ratio to 65%. The rising demand is a sign that investors will also allocate money to spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) when they are approved by the SEC. JPMorgan analysts predicts that these funds will attract over $6 billion in inflows in the first year. A key driver for this ETF inflow is that the SEC may approve staking in these ETFs, making them more viable than the existing Ethereum funds. Solana price prediction SOL price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the SOL price has staged a strong comeback in the past few weeks, rising from a low of $94 to $180 today. Solana has already moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has also jumped above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Also, the MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have continued rising. Therefore, the coin will likely keep rising as bulls target the 61.8% retracement point at $220. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to $300.

The cryptocurrency community is celebrating, with massive trading volume, bullish sentiment, and hints of major developments on the brink. The next resistance levels for Pi are set at $1.00, followed by $1.40, while support currently sits around $0.80. Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin shared that the Pi Network team will make a big announcement on May 14, 2025. This date is important because it’s the same day the Consensus Summit 2025 begins in Toronto, where Pi’s founder, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, will be speaking. The analyst believes this news could be very good for Pi’s price. He predicts that Pi could reach $1 by May 14, go up to $2 by the end of August, and maybe reach $2 to $5 by the end of the year. Binance Listing Soon? According to on-chain data, a mysterious wallet made a massive purchase of 70 million PI from OKX, pushing its total holdings to 155 million PI—more than any other wallet on active exchanges. This activity has sparked speculation that a big centralized exchange (CEX) might be preparing to list Pi Coin. These patterns mirror previous movements seen before major exchange listings, and the timing aligns with increased activity on the Pi Blockchain and preparations for KYB (Know Your Business) compliance—a requirement for official listings. Community Excitement and Expansion The Pi Network ecosystem is also expanding, and community hype is at an all-time high.

On a daily scale alone, the asset is up by more than 30%, begging the question what’s driving this spectacular pump. It was just over a month ago when PI plunged to $0.4, which became the aforementioned ATL, amid massive token unlocks, market uncertainty, and FUD against the project behind it. It bounced off in the following weeks but still remained in a tight range around $0.6. PI finally shot above that level at the end of last week, gaining 20% daily on Friday. Naturally, such moves attract people’s attention, and analysts and popular commentators started providing big price predictions of $1 and all the way to $5. Interestingly, the smaller target was reached earlier today when PI soared by 35% at one point and tapped $1 for the first time in close to two months. On a weekly scale, the asset has soared a mind-blowing 64%. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko There’s no evident reason behind this surge besides a possible hype growing from an upcoming announcement set for next week (May 14). As reported before, there are speculations about a big exchange listing, perhaps on Binance. Another possibility could again be linked to a hype rally as one of Pi Network’s founders, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, is expected to speak at this years large crypto conference – Consensus, which is also taking place next week (May 14 – 16) in Toronto. Moon Jeff, an analyst frequently talking about PI, noted that many “unknown entities,” including BANXA, continue to accumulate Pi Network’s token, which could also be a culprit for price increases.

The tweet reads, “I PREDICT A MASSIVE $XRP CRASH TO $10 IN 2025,” accompanied by a video in which Farina explained, citing historical market behavior, current trends in Bitcoin dominance, and ongoing developments in institutional adoption. I PREDICT A MASSIVE $XRP CRASH TO $10 IN 2025 pic.twitter.com/np1v5kmWYv — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 9, 2025 Early XRP Performance Signals Market Shift In the video, Farina addresses the speculative nature of the current crypto market and emphasizes that this cycle has unfolded differently than previous ones. He pointed out that XRP has already reached over $2 at a time when Bitcoin dominance remains high, indicating what he sees as an early performance surge for XRP. According to Farina, historically, altcoin rallies begin when Bitcoin dominance drops to around 30% to 40%. He argued that despite his skepticism of the term “alt season,” the data indicates XRP has performed uniquely early compared to previous cycles. Legal Clarity and Institutional Momentum Farina explained that XRP’s position in this market cycle signals a broader transition, where speculation increasingly overlaps with real-world financial adoption. He noted that XRP is no longer under legal uncertainty, referring to the conclusion of the SEC lawsuit and a recent injunction that allows Ripple to sell XRP to financial institutions. He believes this development lays the groundwork for a substantial increase in XRP’s value, potentially leading to a 4x growth from current levels. ETF Growth and Ripple’s Strategic Acquisitions Edo Farina projected that such an increase would push XRP to at least $10 in 2025. However, Farina stressed that exceeding that level would require widespread adoption by financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He attributed the potential for this outcome to several factors, including Ripple’s expanding involvement in traditional finance, its acquisition of players like Hidden Road , and rumors of a possible acquisition of Circle . Additionally, he referenced the growing demand for XRP-backed ETFs as a significant signal of market interest and institutional confidence. Looking Ahead to 2025 and Beyond According to Farina, combining legal clarity, institutional involvement, and the accelerating tokenization of real-world assets is central to XRP’s future valuation. He mentioned that financial infrastructure developments, including Ripple’s involvement in digital currency rollouts like the Digital Euro, should be monitored closely. In addressing his followers directly, Farina asked, “How much will 1000 XRP coins be worth in 2025?” He stated that if XRP reaches $10, a holder of 1000 coins would have $10,000. He also speculated that if XRP reached $100, the same holding would be worth $100,000, which he described as potentially life-changing. Farina concluded by encouraging XRP holders to target higher accumulation levels, suggesting that holding 10,000 XRP would provide greater strategic flexibility in taking profits. Farina ended his video with a light-hearted note, stating that he plans to throw a yachting party in Mykonos when XRP hits $10 and invited followers to submit their names to be included on the guest list. While his predictions remain speculative, his analysis reflects a strong belief in XRP’s potential based on emerging financial adoption trends and institutional developments.

The trend is led by none other than the largest of them all – Ethereum, which has soared by another 8% in the past day, and trades well above $2,500. ETH’s Roll Continues ETH’s price plunged hard just over a month ago as it dropped to its lowest levels in over a year on April 9 at $1,400. It managed to bounce off in the following weeks but still struggled to reclaim $1,800 decisively. After the latest positive macro developments and the Pectra upgrade , its price finally started to climb hard. On a daily scale, ETH has soared by nearly 9%, but its weekly surge is a lot more impressive – almost 40%. This has put its price tag at well above the psychological resistance of $2,500. Many altcoins have followed suit with notable price increases as well. DOGE is in a league of its own from the larger ones, having surged by over 16% and now trading above $0.24. ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, HBAR, TON, and PEPE are other impressive examples. PI , UNI, and NEAR have also had double-digit price pumps over the past day, while LEO is among the few in the red. The total crypto market cap has added another $70 billion and is up to $3.470 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview. Source: QuantifyCrypto Bitcoin Back to $104K Although BTC is still in the green on a daily scale, its increase is a lot more modest. BTC has jumped by less than 1% and trades above $104,000 after it was stopped at $105,000 earlier. On a weekly scale, though, bitcoin has jumped by almost 9%. It finally managed to break through the $100,000 barrier this week for the first time in over three months. However, its dominance over the alts has taken a big hit. Recall that the metric was riding high at roughly 62% just until several days ago but has dropped to under 60% as of now. Its market cap, on the other hand, continues to increase and is up to $2.070 trillion on CG. BTCUSD.

The token jumped to a high of $0.97, up by 145% from its lowest level in April. It is now hovering at its highest point since March 25. So, why is the Pi Coin price rising and how high can it go? Why Pi Network price is rising There are three main reasons why the Pi Network price has gone parabolic this weekend. The most important one is that the crypto fear and greed index continues rising and is now at the greed zone of 75. A rising greed index is always a sign of a risk-on sentiment among investors, which leads to higher prices. This sentiment has led to higher Bitcoin and altcoin prices. Bitcoin has jumped above $104,000 and is within touching distance of hitting its all-time high of $109,300. Similarly, Ethereum rose above $2,500 for the first time since February on Saturday. Consensus event and key announcement Second, the Pi Coin price is surging because of the upcoming Consensus event in Toronto, where senior executives and policymakers will gather. Nikolas Kokkidis, Pi Network’s co-founder, will be one of the speakers. In an X post last week, the developers promised a major announcement during the Consensus event. As the news is yet to be revealed, analysts are speculating that this announcement will be a listing by one or more centralized exchanges like Binance or HTX. Pi Network @PiCoreTeam · Follow A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14. Tune in to find out what’s coming next! 2:48 AM · May 8, 2025 20.5K Reply Copy link Read 2.7K replies An exchange listing would be a good thing as it would make it more available to millions of investors from around the world. Historically, cryptocurrency prices go parabolic when large centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Upbit list them. The other likely scenario is where Pi Network’s developers announce a major partnership with a big company, which would also be a positive thing. Another potential Pi Network news will be the launch of an ecosystem fund to incentivize developers to build applications on its network. That would be an encouraging thing since most of the existing Pi Network dApps have not gained traction among users. Read more: Solana price prediction: is SOL a coiled spring ready to pounce? Key challenges remain Pi Network price road to recovery faces several obstacles. The first one is that it is a highly centralized coin that the Core Team fully controls. This likely explains why most centralized exchanges have avoided it this year. The risk is that a highly centralized coin can crash as Mantra did in April. Mantra’s price crashed by over 90% within a 24-hour period. While the developers blamed forced liquidations for this, analysts pointed to increased token dumps by insiders, who made billions of dollars. The other potential risk it is facing is the growing supply as token unlocks continue. Pi Network will unlock over 1.4 billion tokens in the next 12 months, adding to its supply, and diluting existing holders.

It found a strong bottom at $0.5572, a level it failed to drop below since April this year. Pi Coin price formed a double-bottom pattern and has now moved above the neckline at $0.79. It has also jumped above the 50-period moving average, a sign that bulls are coming back online. Most notably, Pi Coin has been in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, pointing to an eventual rebound. It will initially jump to $1, and then continue its recovery to the next key resistance level at $1.80. It will eventually soar to $3.

Crypto enthusiast and market analyst Edo Farina recently made a compelling case for why holding just 1,000 XRP could be one of the most impactful financial moves an investor can make. Farina’s prediction, grounded in data and market dynamics, highlights why XRP may soon emerge as a game-changer. A Unique Market Cycle Farina says the current crypto market cycle stands out from previous ones. Unlike past cycles, when Bitcoin’s dominance rapidly declined, this time, Bitcoin’s dominance remains unusually high. Farina points out that when Bitcoin’s dominance eventually drops to around 40%, the much-anticipated alt season will kick off. In this phase, XRP is expected to surge, potentially outpacing many other assets due to its performance during the current cycle. Holding just 1,000 $XRP might be the best financial decision of your lifetime. How Much Will 1,000 XRP be worth in 2025? Full Video: https://t.co/ecm1WbyDBh pic.twitter.com/mtnac1YMMi — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 9, 2025 XRP’s Promising Position XRP has already shown strong bullish momentum this cycle, distinguishing itself as one of the top performers despite market uncertainties. Farina emphasizes that this cycle represents a unique intersection of speculative trading and financial adoption. The recent regulatory clarity around XRP, especially following the settlement agreement filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), adds to its appeal. This clarity reaffirms that XRP is not a security and opens the door for Ripple to sell XRP to financial institutions. The Road to Institutional Adoption One of the most promising factors driving XRP’s potential is its path to mainstream adoption. Farina notes that the next big catalyst for XRP’s price movement is the decline of Bitcoin’s market dominance below 40%. When that threshold is crossed, it could ignite a new wave of altcoin enthusiasm, placing XRP at the forefront. The asset’s status as the only fully regulated cryptocurrency in the United States makes it particularly attractive for institutional adoption. Additionally, there is increasing interest in XRP ETFs, significantly boosting their investment profile. The potential for XRP to be incorporated into financial products could expand its utility and, by extension, its market valuation. Farina also highlights Ripple’s strategic acquisitions, including purchasing established financial entities like Hidden Road . Should Ripple acquire Circle and secure further ETF approvals, it would mark a pivotal moment, drastically impacting XRP’s price trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Calculating the Future Value The numbers presented by Farina are compelling. If XRP achieves a price of $10 by 2025, a modest holding of 1,000 tokens would be worth $10,000 . However, if institutional adoption accelerates and XRP reaches $100, the same 1,000 tokens could be valued at $100,000. Such a scenario would undoubtedly be life-changing for early adopters and long-term holders. Why 1,000 XRP Matters The idea of holding 1,000 XRP as a strategic move stems from its combination of affordability and potential for exponential growth. As XRP becomes increasingly integrated into financial systems and more ETFs are approved, the demand for XRP could skyrocket. Holding a modest number of tokens now could yield substantial financial returns in just a few years. Farina’s analysis underscores the potential of XRP as not just a speculative asset but a cornerstone in the evolving financial landscape. With regulatory clarity, increasing institutional interest, and strategic acquisitions by Ripple, XRP’s future looks increasingly promising. While no investment is without risk, holding 1,000 XRP today could be a defining financial decision for many investors.

Analysts see echoes of 2020 boom,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/11/is-mutm-the-sleeper-hit-of-2025-analysts-see-echoes-of-2020-boom/,"Back in 2020, the crypto world saw quiet, undervalued tokens explode seemingly overnight — often after months of development with little fanfare. Analysts who had their eye on these projects early ended up spotting some of the most impressive growth stories in recent years. Fast forward to now, and that same energy is starting to build around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a new project that’s not in the spotlight yet, but is gaining growing interest among those who recognize early potential. Trading at just $0.025, MUTM is still flying under the radar. As its presale gains momentum, core features continue to take shape, and future price projections remain promising, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most quietly compelling cryptocurrency opportunities on the market right now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is now progressing through Phase 4 of its 11-stage presale, and the pace of participation continues to accelerate. With over 66% of this round already completed, momentum is clearly building. The project has already raised $7.8 million and attracted more than 9,600 holders, pointing to growing interest even before launch. Once Phase 4 wraps up, the token price rises to $0.03, and will continue increasing in later stages until it hits a launch price of $0.06. But that’s just the beginning. Analysts are forecasting that shortly after launch, MUTM could surge to $0.28, based on projected demand and protocol usage. That’s more than a 1,000% increase from its current price — a gain that naturally drives FOMO among early investors. For those searching for the next big crypto, the opportunity to enter before the market catches on is getting narrower by the day. Part of the reason analysts are watching Mutuum so closely is its focus on building real infrastructure — not just spinning up another token with vague promises. The project is centered around decentralized lending and borrowing, allowing users to either earn yield on deposited crypto or unlock liquidity through overcollateralized loans. But beyond the basics, Mutuum is building for the future by integrating with Layer 2 solutions. This gives the protocol a key advantage: low transaction costs and faster processing, especially important as on-chain activity grows. By launching directly on a Layer 2 network like Arbitrum, Mutuum positions itself as a faster, more efficient alternative to legacy DeFi platforms still struggling with gas fees and congestion. What adds a deeper level of utility to the Mutuum ecosystem is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which plays a central role in how the protocol operates. Users who borrow from the platform can mint this stablecoin by locking up collateral, ensuring that every token issued is backed by more value than it represents. This stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar algorithmically, with its supply constantly adjusted based on minting and burning activities. When users repay their loans or when positions are liquidated, the stablecoin is burned — helping keep its value steady and its circulation under control. What makes this model more than just a standard borrowing tool is that the interest paid on these loans flows directly back into the protocol, strengthening its treasury and funding broader operations. This type of self-sustaining model is what draws attention from seasoned analysts — where platform activity generates value, and that value, in turn, fuels continued expansion. What further strengthens MUTM’s long-term outlook is its built-in token acquisition model, which uses a share of the platform’s revenue to consistently repurchase MUTM from the open market and cycle it back to active participants. Those tokens are then distributed to users who participate in the system by staking their deposit tokens. This creates an ongoing cycle of buy pressure, reinforcing token demand over time. As the platform’s adoption grows and more users participate in lending and borrowing, this mechanism has the potential to consistently push MUTM’s price upward — especially in the early months after launch, when usage spikes and liquidity flows into the ecosystem. MUTM isn’t a token built around buzz — it’s a developing ecosystem backed by working mechanics, smart incentives, and real growth potential. With its presale progressing rapidly and a projected post-launch price surge to $0.28, the numbers alone are enough to draw attention. But it’s the combination of stablecoin integration, Layer 2 scalability, and token-driven yield that makes it a standout among current DeFi entrants. For those wondering what crypto to invest in, this could be the kind of early-stage opportunity that doesn’t come around often. Just like in 2020, some of the biggest wins came from recognizing real value before it became obvious. MUTM might be one of those tokens — and the market is starting to notice.

Recently, crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto has raised alarms about a potential seismic shift, forecasting a significant drop in Bitcoin’s market dominance. According to EGRAG, this upcoming downturn could mark the beginning of one of the most explosive altseasons in crypto history. The Imminent Fall of Bitcoin Dominance EGRAG Crypto’s analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency market is on the verge of a major realignment. The chart patterns he observes indicate a drastic reduction in Bitcoin’s dominance, which has historically been a precursor to a massive rally among altcoins. Bitcoin Dominance — The Coming Mega Dump! YOU ARE NOT #BULLISH ENOUGH The chart signals we’re about to witness the greatest drop in #BTC Dominance! This move will be so huge, your wildest dreams can’t fully imagine the profits in this #AltSeason that you will make.… pic.twitter.com/cMnpdHuGsp — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 9, 2025 As Bitcoin’s influence wanes, altcoins like XRP often see a surge in capital inflow, leading to significant price movements. According to EGRAG, the scale of this impending drop is unprecedented, and the ensuing altseason could generate profits that even seasoned traders might find hard to envision. The Bubble Will Burst: Strategic Profit-Taking While bullish sentiment dominates the discussion, EGRAG warns investors to remain cautious and strategic. Every market bubble, no matter how promising, eventually bursts. He emphasizes the importance of locking in profits during the peak moments of the altseason to avoid the inevitable downturn that follows. In his view, the so-called “blow-off top” is on the horizon, and traders must step back before the crash takes hold. When the bubble does pop, EGRAG advises seizing the opportunity to buy assets that will survive the market purge. Among his recommended picks are cryptos with strong use cases, operating assets like real estate, and commodities like gold. This diversified approach aims to mitigate risk while capitalizing on post-bubble recovery phases. Gold as a Strategic Investment EGRAG also shares his perspective on gold, predicting that the precious metal will play a pivotal role in the economic landscape during the next financial downturn. He sets a strategic buying target for gold when its price dips below $2,300, specifically aiming for a range between $1,850 and $2,000. This calculated move aligns with his broader strategy of acquiring assets with long-term value once speculative bubbles burst. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Preparing for the Market Shift As the crypto market braces for this predicted upheaval, EGRAG’s advice centers on being proactive rather than reactive. He stresses the importance of remaining alert and flexible, ready to capitalize on both the upside of altseason and the downside of a market correction. For seasoned traders and newcomers alike, the key takeaway is to secure profits during bullish runs and prepare for the subsequent market cooldown. EGRAG Crypto’s warning about the coming mega dump in Bitcoin dominance serves as both a caution and an opportunity. While the allure of massive altcoin gains is undeniable, it is essential to remain vigilant and strategically positioned. By balancing speculative moves with sound investments in tangible assets like gold and real estate, traders can navigate the impending volatility more confidently. As always, a well-thought-out approach can make the difference between capitalizing on market movements and getting caught in the crash.

A decisive break and sustained move above this long-term indicator could signal a significant trend reversal, effectively marking the end of BONK’s prolonged bearish phase. CryptoS6 emphasizes that reclaiming this level would validate bullish momentum and reestablish buyer dominance, setting the stage for an extended rally. Breaking The Long-Term SMA: Why This Level Matters In a recent update on X, popular crypto analyst CryptoS6 pointed out that BONK is flashing signs of a significant technical shift. The price is currently testing the 200-day SMA at $0.0000238, an area widely regarded as a major trend-defining level. Reclaiming this zone would mark BONK’s first serious bullish reversal since early Q1, signaling that buyers are regaining control after months of sideways or bearish pressure. Such a shift in control could ignite renewed investor interest and set the stage for an extended rally. Related Reading: BONK Symmetrical Triangle Squeeze: Is A Mega Breakout Imminent? What makes the setup even more interesting is the minimal resistance standing between the current price and the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0000348. According to CryptoS6, this area often becomes a magnet for breakout-driven momentum, creating room for swift upward moves. If BONK can firmly close above the 200-day SMA, the probability of a stronger rally increases dramatically, as traders are likely to pile in behind the move. CryptoS6 didn’t hold back from making a bold projection either. He suggested that BONK’s chart is setting the stage for what could be a “God Candle” explosive move, a vertical price move that would rapidly push he token from $0.000025 to $0.00004. BONK 3-Way Confirmation: Volume, Trend & History Say ‘Go’ CryptoS6 firmly emphasized that a combination of growing volume, strong trend alignment, and striking historical pattern symmetry reinforces the case for a major breakout in BONK. The recent surge in volume is not just noise; it reflects increasing market participation and suggests that accumulation is underway, often a precursor to a significant price move. Meanwhile, BONK’s price action is aligning with key moving averages, particularly as it eyes a reclaim of the 200-day SMA, a critical indicator of long-term trend shifts.

In conclusion, CryptoS6 described the setup as “clean,” meaning the chart offers a well-defined structure and reliable levels for both entry and risk management.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed to a peak of $104,900 on Saturday evening—just about 4% below its all-time high—following President Donald Trump’s announcement of progress in U.S.-China trade talks during a meeting in Switzerland. “A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,” Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform. “Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” Bitcoin rallied on the heels of the news. Source: CoinGecko By early Sunday morning, the top cryptocurrency by volume hovered around $103,985. And yet, altcoins managed to grab the spotlight as well. At last check, Ethereum marked one of its strongest daily performances in recent weeks, while meme coins roared back to life. See below.

Analysts interpret this as a sign of capital rotation into altcoins, suggesting the onset of an “altcoin season.” The ETH/BTC ratio has rebounded from its lowest levels since 2020, further supporting this trend. Meanwhile, top U.S. and Chinese economic officials are expected to meet in Geneva for a second round of high-stakes trade talks to ease tensions from Trump’s escalating trade war. The conflict has already led to steep tariffs—145% on Chinese goods and 125% on U.S. exports—disrupting global supply chains and prompting companies to seek alternatives. According to the New York Times, economists warn the ongoing dispute could slow global growth, raise inflation, and push the U.S. toward a recession.

Let’s break it down. On March 2, 2025, President Trump posted a statement on social media announcing his support for the U.S. “crypto strategic reserve” that would include XRP, Solana, and Cardano. In the post, he criticized the Biden administration’s handling of crypto and pledged to make the U.S. the global crypto leader. However, less than 24 hours later, the post was deleted. According to a various reports, Trump may have been misled into making the announcement by a lobbyist named Brian Ballard, who reportedly gave Trump the wording for the post. Ballard is said to have ties to Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP. Once Trump found out about the connection, he was reportedly furious and cut ties with Ballard. Despite this incident, there is no official statement or evidence that Trump has “blacklisted” XRP or that the digital asset is under any kind of ban or restriction from Trump or his team. It appears more like a misunderstanding and personal frustration rather than a formal policy stance. For the unversed, Ripple has had past political connections, including donations to Trump-aligned political committees. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer and CEO have both reportedly met with Trump in the past. So, while the deleted post and Trump’s reaction have caused a stir, XRP is not blacklisted, and there is no sign of a formal fallout. In fact, the coin continues to perform in the market, and some analysts still see it as a strong contender in the current crypto cycle. You are on top of things. The SEC agreed for the fine to be reduced from $125 million to $50 million and the SEC agreed to the permanent injunction being lifted. Yep, Trump is furious https://t.co/aBRL4R6pr3 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 10, 2025 To add to the drama, attorney Bill Morgan reacted to the news on X (formerly Twitter) and laughed it off. He wrote, “You are on top of things. The SEC agreed for the fine to be reduced from $125 million to $50 million and the SEC agreed to the permanent injunction being lifted. Yep, Trump is furious.” Conclusion: Trump may have been upset about being associated with XRP without his full understanding, but there is no evidence he has blacklisted or banned XRP. The situation also shows the growing influence of crypto lobbyists — and the risks of political entanglement in the fast-moving digital asset world.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-11 06:10:17

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-buy-signal-flashes-heres-the-implication/,"The XRP community is abuzz with excitement as the SuperTrend indicator has recently flashed a buy signal for the digital asset. This development was highlighted by prominent crypto analyst Ali, who shared the news on X, emphasizing the potential for a bullish momentum in the coming days. The SuperTrend indicator is a popular tool among traders, designed to identify the prevailing market trend and signal potential buy or sell opportunities. It works by calculating average price movements over a specified period and overlaying the results on the chart. When the indicator turns green, it signals a buying opportunity, while a red signal indicates a potential downtrend. The SuperTrend indicator just flashed a buy signal for $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/I6X7crn1zE — Ali (@ali_charts) May 10, 2025 In the case of XRP, the appearance of the buy signal indicates that the asset may be entering a new upward phase , sparking optimism among investors. Historically, the SuperTrend indicator has proven effective in capturing trend reversals, making it a key tool for both retail and institutional traders. The Significance of a Buy Signal A buy signal from the SuperTrend indicator is considered a positive sign, as it suggests that buying pressure is increasing and that the asset could experience further price appreciation. In the case of XRP, this signal comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is experiencing heightened volatility, making it a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset. Ali’s post on X underscores the importance of this signal, as it could encourage both short-term traders and long-term holders to consider increasing their positions. Given the SuperTrend’s track record in forecasting price movements, this buy signal could indicate that XRP is poised for a rally, especially if broader market conditions remain favorable. Factors Supporting XRP’s Bullish Outlook Several factors could amplify XRP’s potential upswing following this signal. First, the ongoing positive sentiment surrounding Ripple’s legal case against the SEC has boosted investor confidence. Additionally, increased adoption and strategic partnerships continue to enhance XRP’s utility as a bridge asset in cross-border transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, with the cryptocurrency market in a state of flux, assets like XRP that demonstrate resilience and positive technical indicators are drawing attention from traders looking for promising opportunities. If XRP manages to sustain buying pressure, it could solidify its position as one of the leading altcoins during the next market cycle. Caution Amid Optimism While the buy signal is promising, traders are advised to remain cautious. Market dynamics can shift rapidly, and relying solely on one indicator may lead to misleading conclusions. It is essential to consider other technical factors and fundamental news that could influence XRP’s price trajectory. Monitoring support and resistance levels, as well as keeping an eye on market sentiment, will provide a more comprehensive trading strategy. The SuperTrend buy signal for XRP, as highlighted by Ali, is undeniably a development worth noting. It reflects a shift towards bullish sentiment, at least in the short term. However, prudent trading practices, such as diversifying indicators and staying updated on news affecting Ripple and XRP, will help investors navigate the potential volatility ahead. As always, thorough research and cautious optimism remain essential in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading.
