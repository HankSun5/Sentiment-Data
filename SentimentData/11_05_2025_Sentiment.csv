44443472,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159324,1746913804,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"OpenAI Enterprise Adoption Surges, Dominating AI Market Share",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-enterprise-adoption-surges/,"In the fast-evolving landscape of technology, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence that resonate deeply with the innovative spirit of the crypto world, understanding which players are gaining traction is crucial. Recent data provides a compelling look at the competitive dynamics in the enterprise AI space, highlighting a clear leader: OpenAI. This surge in OpenAI Enterprise Adoption signals a significant shift in how businesses are integrating AI into their operations and where their investment is flowing. What Does the Data Show About OpenAI Enterprise Adoption? According to the AI Index compiled by fintech firm Ramp, which analyzes corporate spending data, OpenAI is rapidly pulling ahead of its rivals in securing enterprise customers. The index estimates the business adoption rate of AI products by drawing on Ramp’s extensive card and bill pay data from approximately 30,000 U.S. companies. The numbers paint a clear picture of accelerating adoption: In January, 18.9% of U.S. businesses using Ramp were paying for OpenAI subscriptions. By March, this figure had risen to 28%. As of April, a substantial 32.4% of U.S. businesses were utilizing OpenAI’s AI models, platforms, and tools. This consistent upward trend demonstrates a powerful momentum for OpenAI within the business sector. As Ramp Economist Ara Kharzian noted, “OpenAI continues to add customers faster than any other business on Ramp’s platform.” This rapid growth underscores the increasing role of OpenAI’s offerings in driving Business AI Spending across various industries. How Does OpenAI’s Growth Compare in the AI Competition? While OpenAI’s numbers show robust growth, the data indicates that competitors are struggling to keep pace. The AI Competition landscape, at least based on this specific dataset, appears increasingly tilted in OpenAI’s favor. Consider the figures for two key rivals: Anthropic: Adoption grew from 4.6% of businesses in January to 8% in April. While showing growth, it’s significantly slower and from a much smaller base compared to OpenAI. Google AI: Subscriptions saw a notable decline, dropping from 2.3% in February to a mere 0.1% in April. This sharp decrease suggests potential challenges for Google in capturing this segment of the market via direct subscriptions tracked by Ramp. This comparison highlights the widening gap in AI Market Share among these leading providers, with OpenAI currently enjoying a considerable lead in securing direct business subscriptions tracked by Ramp. Understanding the Drivers Behind Business AI Spending Why are businesses flocking to OpenAI? Several factors likely contribute to this surge in Generative AI Adoption and subsequent spending: Brand Recognition: OpenAI’s ChatGPT brought generative AI into the mainstream consciousness, giving the company a significant first-mover advantage in public and business perception. Accessibility and APIs: OpenAI’s platform and APIs are widely accessible and well-documented, making it relatively straightforward for developers and businesses to integrate their models into existing workflows and applications. Perceived Capability: For many common tasks and initial explorations into AI, OpenAI’s models are often perceived as highly capable and versatile, meeting immediate business needs. Enterprise Focus: OpenAI has been actively courting enterprise clients, developing specific products and support structures aimed at larger organizations. The company reported having over 2 million business users as of April, a doubling from the 1 million reported in September, indicating a strong focus on this segment. This focus on the enterprise market is strategic. OpenAI expects revenue from business users to contribute significantly to its financial growth. Projections reportedly place OpenAI’s revenue at $12.7 billion this year, potentially climbing to $29.4 billion in 2026, although the company does not anticipate being cash-flow positive until 2029. Caveats and the Future of Enterprise AI It is important to note the limitations of the data. The Ramp AI Index provides valuable insights but is based on a sample of around 30,000 companies and specifically tracks spend via Ramp’s platform. It may not capture all AI-related spending, particularly if it’s bundled into broader IT contracts or other cost centers not identified by merchant names or line items. Therefore, while highly indicative, these figures represent a specific slice of the overall market. Despite these caveats, the data strongly suggests that OpenAI is solidifying its position in the burgeoning enterprise AI market. Looking ahead, OpenAI is reportedly exploring new revenue streams, including charging businesses thousands of dollars for specialized AI “agents” designed for complex tasks like software engineering and research. Such offerings could further drive Business AI Spending among large corporations seeking highly tailored solutions. Conclusion: OpenAI Leads the Pack, For Now The data from Ramp provides a compelling snapshot of the current state of enterprise AI adoption. OpenAI is clearly demonstrating significant momentum, rapidly increasing its footprint within businesses and outpacing key competitors like Anthropic and Google AI in this specific dataset. While the overall AI Market Share is still fluid and the competitive landscape will undoubtedly continue to evolve, OpenAI’s current trajectory in securing enterprise customers is a powerful indicator of its present market strength and the accelerating trend of Generative AI Adoption in the business world.

According to data from the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, the country acquired an additional seven BTC in the last seven days, bringing its total holdings to 6,173 BTC, valued at over $637 million. El Salvador's Bitcoin Office has continued its steady pace of Bitcoin acquisitions months after the IMF agreement was signed and shows no sign of halting its Bitcoin purchases. The Central American country is one of the only nations actively purchasing Bitcoin in open market operations, and its national Bitcoin treasury strategy will serve as a blueprint for other countries also considering Bitcoin strategic reserves, according to crypto industry executives. El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings and acquisitions since March 13. Source: El Salvador Bitcoin Office Related: El Salvador works with Nvidia to develop sovereign AI infrastructure El Salvador remains defiant against IMF pressure El Salvador signed a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF in December 2024. As part of that agreement, the government of the country agreed to rescind its Bitcoin legal tender law and make Bitcoin payments voluntary. The agreement also stipulated that El Salvador must scale back its Bitcoin accumulation, refraining from using public funds to finance Bitcoin purchases. Additionally, the deal required the government privatize the Chivo Wallet, which was publicly funded but saw little use among residents. In January 2025, lawmakers in the Central American country repealed the Bitcoin legal tender law in a 55-2 Congressional vote, although this did nothing to pause or slow Bitcoin acquisitions. The IMF issued another request to the country to halt Bitcoin buys in March 2025, reiterating the original terms of the agreement. However, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele pushed back against the requests . Bukele emphasized that the country would not stop its Bitcoin purchases or slow down its accumulation of BTC in the face of mounting pressure from the supranational financial institution. ""No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most 'Bitcoiners' abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future,"" Bukele wrote in a March 4 X post .

Senate Democrats cite Trump’s financial conflicts as a reason for blocking the stablecoin bill. $TRUMP coin’s surge raises concerns of a “pay-for-play scheme” linked to the president. Donald Trump’s direct involvement in the cryptocurrency world is leading to major hurdles towards the realization of his crypto agenda. This week, the GENIUS Act , a significant piece of legislation to set up federal regulations for stablecoins, could not pass through the Senate. The reason for disagreement is the fear of conflicts of interest, especially concerning Trump’s crypto businesses, such as his meme coins. Bipartisan Support Undermined by Meme Coin Controversy The GENIUS Act had received bipartisan support, with both Democrats and Republicans acknowledging the need for stablecoin regulation. However, the support began to fade because of the $TRUMP meme coin, which had surged in value following Trump’s endorsement and controversial promotions.

Deeper integration with Mastercard and Kraken leads analysts to predict a 400% rise for ADA that could take the coin price to $3 in 2026. Since their presale kickoff, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained significant investor attention by earning $7,900,000 while distributing over 450 million tokens across 9,700 different holder addresses. The presale’s fourth phase shows 65% sell-out status at $0.025 with expectant returns of 140% toward its market launch. Cardano’s Ascending Path ADA projects future success through its development of practical use cases in the market. Users can now convert ADA into fiat currency for store payments through Mastercard and Kraken’s platform so ADA gains real-world adoption capabilities. By welcoming institutional trust through this move the platform attracts investors who seek long-term growth potential. The developers behind Leios have spent six years developing an upcoming upgrade that will decrease network load and increase transaction speed. ADA acquisition potential would rise sharply when the network becomes scalable enough to attract developers building decentralized applications for gaming or decentralized finance (DeFi). The price analysis draws a positive outlook due to an RSI of 58 and an ascending triangle pattern that suggests ADA will break through the $0.78 resistance level. Keeping current price levels ADA could reach $1.40 in 2025 yet a downward move will challenge the $0.62 area. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts intense investment interest during its fourth presale phase where tokens sell for $0.025 compared to $0.01 during the initial launch. The ongoing Phase 4 sale of MUTM tokens stands at 65% sold out with plans to boost prices 20% upon the launch of Phase 5 at $0.03 providing existing purchasers instant monetary benefits. MUTM tokenomics provide investors with 140% capital return at $0.06 during the listing then forecast a $2.50 value post-launch resulting in a 9,900% ROI. The company’s smart contract audit with Certik has produced results which will soon appear on social channels to enhance trustworthiness. The platform extends bonus token rewards through its new dashboard to holders who stay within the top 50 positions in order to build dedicated fanbases. The Mutuum’s lending framework uses overcollateralization to stabilize investments thereby allowing users to lock ETH for mtETH token generation with accruing interest features. DeFi utility combined with a token distribution system that rebroadcasts tokens to stakers drives continuous demand in the market. Mutuum’s DeFi Edge The public interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to rise as Phase 4 moves toward completion. Mutuum provides complete freedom through its dual-lending model which unites peer-to-peer collateralized and contract-to-contract lending solutions for all borrowers and lenders. Users with $7,000 worth of ETH can secure a $5,000 USDT loan after locking in their collateral which reduces their potential for defaulting on payments. Platform revenue stream enables the buy-and-distribute buying mechanism which buys back MUTM tokens while rewarding staking participants and preventing token market sell-offs. Among crypto tokens, Mutuum differs because it emphasizes generating passive income for users through mtTokens along with its planned stablecoin feature. The presale’s quick success reflects strong market interest because it has reached $7.9 million in funding with 9,700 token holders. Due to upcoming token price increases investors must buy tokens quickly from the Phase 5 period. Weighing the Crypto Clash ADA operates in a robust ecosystem yet its predicted 400% price growth will only materialize when system upgrades align with positive market conditions leading to extended development schedules. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers definite 140% listing profits while projecting a 9,900% post-launch boost thus providing investors with a simpler faster route to financial gains.

According to Schwartz, cryptographic advancements can trigger significant shifts in the blockchain space. Users Revisit Ripple CTO’s Vision for Private Ledger Integration In what could be considered a journey back in time, the Ripple CTO proposed a system in 2019 in which private ledgers utilize XRP for low-cost transactions. The reference to Schwartz’s 2019 post occurred after a user on X asserted that it was practically impossible to integrate private ledgers into XRPL functionality. Another user on the social media platform responded to Schwartz’s post. According to Schwartz, private ledgers can be bridged to the public XRP Ledger as required to address scalability issues. This could also tackle concerns that border on cost for institutional users. The idea is to significantly reduce transaction fees while retaining the ability of the private ledger to interact with the public ledger. This will make for broader liquidity in the space. ZK Proofs Could Bridge Public and Private Blockchain Worlds Interestingly, Schwartz joined the revived conversation and clarified how ZK proofs could make this a reality. He noted that ZK proof could make the vision more practical and secure. According to him, it is possible to mirror the security and decentralization that is obtainable of Layer-1 chains. While acknowledging that the use case is yet to be realized, Schwartz expressed optimism that it might happen someday with ZK proofs. For perspective, ZK proof protocols allow a user to authenticate the actuality of a statement without disclosing more details than necessary. That is, they preserve the anonymity that blockchain transactions provide. Schwartz suggests that, in the future, ZK proofs might close the gap between public chains and private transaction systems. Buenos Aires Highlight ZK Proof Potential In the broader society, Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital, launched QuarkID in the last quarter of 2024. The project, a digital identity service that utilizes ZK proof, enhances the privacy and security of the city’s 3.6 million residents. The development enables residents to verify essential documents without revealing other personal details. QuarkID allows users to upload as many as 60 papers without the government or any third party accessing them.

The premier cryptocurrency reclaimed the $100,000 mark earlier this week and seems to be making a play for its all-time high price at $108,786 over this weekend. The price of BTC appears to have flipped the switch in the market, with investors feeling that the world’s largest crypto market is back to where it was at the end of 2024. According to a popular crypto expert, the sell-side pressure experienced in the first few months of the year is all part of a broader price breakout. Is BTC Following This Cup And Handle Pattern? In a May 9 post on X, chartered market technician (CMT) Aksel Kibar shared an interesting update on his recent Bitcoin price analysis. The market expert revealed, in a late November 2024 post on the social media platform, a long-term breakout signal for the BTC price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Following the election victory of Donald Trump as United States President, the Bitcoin and crypto markets witnessed a significant amount of bullish momentum. Kibar highlighted that BTC, as a result of the post-election rally, was breaking above a significant price level on a large (monthly) timeframe. As shown in the chart above, the Bitcoin price broke above its “minor high” around the former all-time high of $73,737 in November. Based on historical patterns, Kibar highlighted in his chart that the flagship cryptocurrency goes on a parabolic run whenever it surpasses the minor high in the cycle. Interestingly, this November 2024 breakout has formed a cup and handle pattern, a technical analysis pattern that resembles a cup in the shape of the letter “u,” and the handle has a slight downward drift. The cup and handle is considered a bullish pattern, which signals the continuation of an upward trend. In this particular iteration of this pattern, the price of BTC continued to rally after breaking the $73.737 till it reached a six-figure valuation. However, the Bitcoin price witnessed a severe correction to around $74,000 after reaching its current all-time high in January. However, it appears that Bitcoin only witnessed a minor pullback to the “minor high” before resuming its primary upward trend. In this scenario, Kibar put the cup and handle target for the market leader at around $137,000, which represents an over 33% rally from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,071, reflecting a nearly 1% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is up by more than 6% on the weekly timeframe.

As the market heats up, investors are keen to know if this upward trend will keep its momentum through May. This piece delves into the potential growth of these digital coins and what may lie ahead. Celestia Price Update: Bullish Week Amid Half-Year Slump TIA past month gains of 22.66% and weekly jumps of 22.86% contrast with a six-month drop of 43.96%. Price action has shown rapid short-term strength despite significant long-term backsliding. Recent surges hint at renewed momentum even as the coin weathers a broader downturn. Mixed performance highlights a recovery effort that remains challenged by extended losses. Current trading occurs between $2.15 and $3.23, with bulls testing a resistance at $3.77 and a support near $1.61. Despite minor upward energy indicated by oscillators, no clear trend emerges. Trading strategies could include targeting support areas for entry while remaining watchful for decisive moves above resistance. Polkadot Surge and Setback: A Mixed Timeline of Rally and Consolidation Last month DOT recorded a strong rally with a 40% boost and a notable weekly gain of 23%. The six-month period, however, closed with a modest decline of 3%. Price history shows robust bursts and brief pullbacks, highlighting reactive market behavior and significant shifts over different time frames. Current prices fluctuate between $3.41 and $4.54, facing immediate resistance at $5.03 and support at $2.77. Additional resistance is seen near $6.16 and support around $1.64. Indicators like an RSI of 74 and momentum reading suggest short-term bullish energy with some near-term caution, creating opportunities for trades to capture potential upward moves or temporary pullbacks within these levels. Conclusion The recent surge in TIA and DOT hints at strong market interest. Both coins have shown significant growth alongside Bitcoin. This upward trend suggests sustained investor confidence. If the broader crypto market remains positive, TIA and DOT could continue to see gains. However, market conditions are always fluid, so it is essential to stay updated on developments. For now, the rally seems promising, with potential for further momentum in the coming weeks. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While some analysts see potential for a rebound of support at $10.69 holds, others warn that the most explosive gains may be over, especially with ongoing token unlocks and bearish technical signals. Despite strong media attention, many traders believe Trump Coin’s parabolic upside is largely priced in, leaving limited room for new investors seeking big returns. Why This New Token Still Holds Massive Upside Potential In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is still priced under $0.001 , offering enormous upside as it moves through the advanced stages of its presale.

Key features include: Narrative-aligned virality with political meme energy Referral-powered expansion via reward-based promotion Presale-only access , ensuring controlled token distribution Stage-by-stage scaling , creating urgency and buyer momentum Tokens launched under similar mechanics — like DOGE and SHIBA in past cycles — have delivered up to 18,500% gains , according to analysts tracking early-stage altcoin ROI patterns.

Known for its robust and scalable blockchain architecture that enables lightning fast transactions, Avalanche is a shining example of innovation in the crypto space. But while Avalanche is dominating parts of the blockchain ecosystem, another contender Ruvi is positioning itself as the future leader by combining the power of blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI). Can Ruvi be the next big thing and give early investors the same kind of returns Avalanche gave in its early days? Let’s find out. Avalanche’s Rise and Investor Takeaways Avalanche’s growth is a testament to its adaptability and infrastructure. Built to handle 6,500 transactions per second , the network has attracted developers and projects to its ecosystem by offering speed and versatility. Early investors in AVAX made life changing returns, from $2.79 in late 2020 to over $146 in 2021. The lesson here? Early adoption is key. If you spot a project before the masses, the growth potential is huge. That’s why Ruvi, with its innovative vision of combining blockchain and AI, is getting the attention of forward thinking investors. Why Ruvi Stands Out in a Crowded Market Ruvi is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a next gen platform to disrupt markets through the power of AI and blockchain. By offering real world applications, Ruvi will reshape industries like logistics, predictive healthcare and decision making analytics. Here’s what makes Ruvi unique: AI Powered Applications : Ruvi integrates machine learning to optimize processes and offer predictive insights, a game changer across industries. Scarcity for Value Creation : Token supply is capped at 5 billion tokens , ensuring long term scarcity and setting the stage for price appreciation. Generous Presale Bonuses : Early investors can get up to 100% presale bonuses to maximize their holdings even before the token launches.If Avalanche taught us anything, it’s that getting in early on innovative projects can give you huge returns. Ruvi is in presale now and tokens are available at $0.01 . Act now and not only will you get the lowest price but also bonus tokens to multiply your investment. Ruvi ROI Potential To give you a better idea of Ruvi’s earning potential, here’s an example of returns for investors at different tiers: Entry-Level Investor ($500) Tokens Bought: 50,000 Bonus Tokens (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 70,000 Potential Value (at $2 per token): $140,000 Mid-Tier Investor ($3,000) Tokens Bought: 300,000 Bonus Tokens (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 540,000 Potential Value (at $2.50 per token): $1.35 million High-End Investor ($10,000) Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Bonus Tokens (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 2,000,000 Potential Value (at $3 per token): $6 million These numbers show just how much of a presale investment in Ruvi could be. The Avalanche and Ruvi Parallels Avalanche solved the trilemma of decentralization, security and scalability. Ruvi is addressing the growing demand for data driven efficiency across industries by combining AI and blockchain. Both projects have a focused vision, strategic scalability and are targeting a critical gap in the market. Get Your Spot in Ruvi Today Avalanche’s growth proved one thing – timing is everything. Those who got in early made life changing returns and the same could happen with Ruvi. Ruvi’s presale is an opportunity to be part of something new and potentially revolutionary all while getting bonus incentives. Conclusion Ruvi is not just a crypto project; it’s a full scale ecosystem to define the intersection of AI and blockchain. Its capped token supply, early bonuses and real world applications make it one of the most promising projects in the crypto space today.Act now.

Solana (SOL) continues its upward trend with strong institutional interest and technical signals suggesting a move toward $160. Litecoin (LTC) is gaining support from growing speculation around an upcoming U.S. spot ETF approval, which could open the door to fresh capital inflows. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is delivering results through an active presale model that’s already generated over $233.5 million in funding. At $0.0019 per coin until May 13 and with a projected listing at $0.05, BlockDAG’s potential ROI sits at 2520%. Its Buyer Battles feature, which distributes 100 million BDAG daily, adds a competitive layer that directly rewards buyer participation. In today’s market where timing and mechanics matter more than ever, these three cryptos stand out for the value they bring to different buyer strategies. Solana Holds Steady with Technical Support & $160 Breakout Potential Solana remains a standout performer in 2025. The project has maintained consistent momentum throughout Q2, with its current position setting up a possible push above the $160 mark. Market analysts continue to highlight Solana’s solid support levels and strong buyer demand, which suggest favorable conditions for a breakout. Institutional sentiment is also strengthening as Solana expands its ecosystem across DeFi and NFT applications. Continued upgrades to speed and scalability are reinforcing its appeal, especially as other Layer 1 competitors face congestion issues. A close above $160 could open the door to further upside. With its ability to process high transaction volumes efficiently, Solana’s performance is reflecting long-term investor confidence. Litecoin Sees Increased Demand as ETF Expectations Rise Litecoin is attracting renewed interest following commentary from Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who identified LTC as the cryptocurrency with the strongest chance of landing the next spot ETF approval in the U.S. This optimism comes from Litecoin’s structural similarities to Bitcoin, including capped supply, predictable issuance, and a strong security history. Although an ETF hasn’t yet been approved, mounting pressure and favorable analyst sentiment are keeping expectations high. The possibility of ETF approval is prompting increased buying, especially from institutional investors looking for regulated crypto exposure. If confirmed, a Litecoin ETF could unlock major inflows and contribute to longer-term price stability and growth. BlockDAG Stands Out with $233.5 Presale & Daily Buyer Battles Rewards Unlike speculative moves seen with Solana and Litecoin, BlockDAG is offering buyers a measurable path to growth. Its presale has now raised more than $233.5 million, backed by strong community participation and clear mechanics. For now, BDAG coins are available at $0.0019 until May 13. With an expected listing price of $0.05, early buyers are looking at a 2520% potential return. What makes BlockDAG unique is its Buyer Battles feature. This system allocates 100 million BDAG coins each day, with every participant receiving a share. The highest buyer of the day claims all remaining unclaimed coins. This structure turns regular purchases into a reward-driven competition. These mechanics don’t just boost engagement, they reinforce commitment from participants and build stronger buyer networks. Alongside its favorable price point and transparent milestones, BlockDAG is positioning itself as the top crypto to buy now based on execution rather than speculation. Final Thoughts Solana continues to build on strong technical setups and institutional interest, while Litecoin is gaining traction on ETF speculation that could reshape its investor base. Both projects benefit from established reputations and ongoing market narratives. But BlockDAG is already delivering. With its $0.0019 pricing valid through May 13, a 2520% ROI potential based on its $0.05 target, and daily Buyer Battles that actively reward buyers, BlockDAG is setting a different standard. Having already raised $233.5 million and with daily momentum building, it is proving itself as one of 2025’s strongest early-stage performers. For investors watching closely, this isn’t just about timing, it’s about participation. With structure, incentives, and traction already in place, BlockDAG is more than a presale, it’s the top crypto to buy now .

Dogecoin jumps fast when whales move. Chainlink keeps gaining due to network use. Both show how fast the market can shift based on updates or activity. But being quick isn’t easy, and Web3 ai ($WAI) solves this issue using artificial intelligence to read charts, scan blockchain activity, and track market mood live. Instead of chasing news, users get clear, fast insights. Many see Web3 ai as a top crypto pick for 2025. It doesn’t just react; it prepares users before the next move even starts. Dogecoin (DOGE) Surges After $165M Whale Wallet Shift Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped after whales moved over $165 million worth of DOGE in just 24 hours. These transfers from large holders often spark activity, sending traders rushing in or out based on the action. Following this movement, DOGE gained 1.90%, showing how reactive this market is. While headlines grab attention, the wallet flows often shape real price changes. This recent surge shows how one big event, like massive wallet shifts, can wake up the meme coin crowd. With major players moving large sums, the DOGE chart becomes one to watch closely. The excitement proves that Dogecoin still holds a strong influence in crypto circles. Chainlink (LINK) Gains Strength as Bulls Eye $26 Chainlink (LINK) is showing steady progress. It broke past $15 and is now aiming higher. Experts are watching $26 as the next big target. The rise in price shows growing belief in its role in keeping smart contracts secure with real-time data feeds. Behind the price jump is a boost in network activity. More users mean more demand, which supports price. Technical tools like RSI are also flashing signs of continued strength. Holding the line at key support levels will matter. If LINK stays strong, buyers could push it further, and we might see another run-up. That’s why Chainlink is becoming a regular on many trader watchlists. Track Smarter, Not Harder: Web3 ai’s AI-Powered Tools Crypto markets move fast; prices change, headlines shift, and blockchain data never stops flowing. For many, this constant information stream is too much to follow. Web3 ai was designed to solve this problem by converting raw market data into clear, real-time insights. Using advanced AI models, Web3 ai scans activity across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon. It monitors on-chain movements, social sentiment, and exchange trends and detects suspicious activity. Whether it’s identifying early whale actions, spotting scams, or flagging sentiment shifts, the platform delivers relevant alerts before markets react. At the center of this ecosystem is the $WAI token. Currently available in stage 3 of its presale at $0.000331, $WAI provides access to all of Web3 ai’s features. The final stage price is $0.003267, with a projected listing at $0.005242, offering early buyers up to 1747% ROI. So far the presale has raised more than $2.4 million with over $500,000 invested in just 24 hours. Rather than juggling multiple tools or dashboards, users get a single streamlined interface. This makes Web3 ai a practical solution in a crowded market. While others rely on promises, Web3 ai already functions, offering working products and real-time value at an early-stage price. This delivery-focused approach positions it as a serious contender for 2025’s top crypto platforms. Why Web3 ai Wins While Others React When DOGE surges due to whales or LINK builds slow momentum, traders need speed and accuracy. Most tools can’t keep up, but Web3 AI gives real-time information before markets shift. For serious users, instincts aren’t enough. As 2025 nears, Web3 ai gives traders the upper hand. It filters the noise, keeps users ahead, and helps them act smarter, not just faster.

XRP Price Squeezes Below $2.22 & SHIB Recovers,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-presale-hits-2-6m-in-just-a-few-days-xrp-price-squeezes-below-2-22-shib-recovers/,"With mixed signals from leading altcoins, another project is drawing strong interest. The current XRP price update indicates a squeeze within a triangle pattern, with markets watching closely for either an upward breakout or downward slide. At the same time, a fresh sentiment check on Shiba Inu (SHIB) reveals strengthening long-term signals even as it weathers short-term dips. In the midst of this, Unstaked is gaining notice. Now priced at $0.007535 in Stage 6 of its crypto presale, it stands out by promising actual working features post-launch, something rare across today’s crypto launches. XRP Price Update: Facing Tight Resistance at $2.22 XRP remains under pressure between two key price levels, trading near $2.16 with resistance at $2.22 and support around $2.05. Analysts are noting a descending triangle on the chart, a setup that historically suggests downside risk. Should the price break below the $2.00 mark, it could head toward $1.85 or possibly even $1.70. Technical indicators mirror this caution. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47, reflecting neutral but fading momentum. On Coinglass, the long/short ratio remains under 1 for the second straight week, hinting that bearish views are prevailing. Still, trade volume tells a more layered story. Despite a drop in open interest for XRP derivatives, overall trading remains active, mainly due to short positions. Market watchers are waiting for a definitive price move, though its direction remains uncertain. As this XRP price update continues to evolve, speculation remains on whether resistance will break or lower supports will give way. SHIB Sentiment Analysis Reflects Growing Optimism SHIB’s price is around $0.00001295, down 7.4% over the past week, but technicals suggest a longer-term setup is forming. Analyst Javon Marks has kept his forecast intact, eyeing a target of $0.000081, a possible 528% surge from its current position. Supporting this are several patterns, including higher lows and a hidden bullish divergence, indicating accumulation under the surface. On-chain data adds weight: more long-term holders have entered since 2022, while short-term traders have dropped by 36%, hinting at increasing confidence in the asset’s future. Burn rates have also picked up, with over 313 million SHIB removed from circulation in just a week. This supply cut reinforces scarcity, helping to form a stronger foundation for any future gains. In short, the latest SHIB sentiment analysis points to a coin that’s quietly laying the groundwork for an upward move. Unstaked at $0.007535: Functional AI Tools Launch Right After Presale Ends As XRP and SHIB struggle with resistance and market signals, Unstaked is moving forward with a clearer roadmap. At $0.007535 in Stage 6 of its AI crypto presale , and with a projected launch price of $0.1819, it brings forward an offering not often seen in this space, usable tools ready from the start. Once the presale ends, users will be able to launch AI agents designed to run on social platforms like Telegram and X. These tools respond to community interactions, manage engagement 24/7, and build reach, all without needing manual oversight. Unlike traditional bots, these agents adapt based on real-time input, making them much more than scripted responders. All agent activity is tracked via Proof of Intelligence, a system that logs performance data on-chain. This not only ensures transparency but also ties real utility directly to $UNSD rewards, setting a clear link between user effort and outcome. With no private allocations or exclusive access deals, all participants begin equally. And with tools set to activate the moment the platform goes live, Unstaked offers more than promises, it offers actual usability. For those seeking high-performing crypto with practical utility, Unstaked is no longer flying under the radar. Final Thoughts! This XRP price update and the improved SHIB sentiment both reflect how legacy coins are navigating technical and market pressures. XRP hovers between resistance and support with downside risk increasing, while SHIB shows signs of quiet strength driven by long-term accumulation and burn data. But the outlook for both remains uncertain until confirmed by price action. In contrast, Unstaked provides a project where functionality is central. At $0.007535 with AI agents going live post-launch, no behind-the-scenes privileges, and a projected 2700% ROI at launch price, Unstaked delivers early access to a utility-based system that’s ready to engage from day one.

Experts Suggest it Will Skyrocket by 20,000% During the Bull Run",https://timestabloid.com/can-ruvi-ai-ruvi-build-on-trons-momentum-for-the-next-big-move/,"Tron (TRX) has been making headlines once again, climbing 2.98% in the past 24 hours to a current price of $0.2628 . Known for its blazing transaction speeds and decentralized governance, Tron continues to solidify its position as a top blockchain network. However, while Tron focuses on its ecosystem’s expansion, a new contender, Ruvi , is quietly creating waves in the crypto world. Ruvi’s innovative integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to capture investor attention, offering unique opportunities during its presale phase. Lessons from Tron’s Continued Success Launched in 2017, Tron emerged as a decentralized platform for content creators, later expanding to support DeFi, stablecoins like USDT, and NFT applications. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees has been a magnet for developers and investors alike. Tron’s strategic updates and partnerships have propelled it to become a robust ecosystem with over 94 billion TRX in circulation . The lesson here is clear. Early investors in projects like Tron, which solve real-world problems and scale effectively, can benefit from significant financial gains. Ruvi offers a similar opportunity, positioning itself as the next transformational force in blockchain by introducing AI-powered solutions for industries spanning logistics, healthcare, and predictive analytics. What Sets Ruvi Apart? Ruvi blends blockchain technology with the predictive capabilities of artificial intelligence, setting it apart from most crypto projects. Its main goal is to increase efficiency in industries plagued by data management challenges, offering real-time analytics and smarter decision-making tools. Ruvi’s presale phase marks a golden opportunity for investors. Tokens are currently priced at $0.01 , with generous bonuses of up to 100% available for early participants. Additionally, the project’s total token supply is capped at 5 billion , ensuring long-term scarcity and value appreciation. Timing Is Everything Tron’s early adopters reaped huge rewards as the value of TRX surged over the years. Similarly, Ruvi offers an investment opportunity at its inception, where the cost is low and the potential for exponential growth is high. Investors who act now could benefit as Ruvi gains market traction and visibility within the blockchain community. Ruvi’s Investment Potential Below are potential scenarios showcasing the returns investors could achieve at different entry points: Entry-Level Investor ($500) Tokens Purchased: 50,000 Bonus Tokens (40%): 20,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 70,000 Potential Value (if Ruvi hits $2): $140,000 Mid-Tier Investor ($3,000) Tokens Purchased: 300,000 Bonus Tokens (80%): 240,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 540,000 Potential Value (if Ruvi reaches $2.50): $1.35 million High-End Investor ($10,000) Tokens Purchased: 1,000,000 Bonus Tokens (100%): 1,000,000 Total Tokens Acquired: 2,000,000 Potential Value (if Ruvi climbs to $3): $6 million These examples highlight Ruvi’s ability to deliver life-changing financial returns, offering a compelling case for early adoption. Ruvi’s Strategic Advantage While Tron has excelled in content distribution, DeFi, and supporting stablecoins, Ruvi is targeting multi-industry applications that could redefine business processes. The integration of AI into blockchain allows Ruvi to offer solutions like supply chain optimization, healthcare data automation, and financial forecasting, making it a broader and more versatile platform. Furthermore, Ruvi’s presale is designed to incentivize participation. With up to 100% token bonuses , early investors gain additional leverage at minimal risk. This strategy not only attracts retail investors but also aligns with the interests of institutional players seeking next-gen projects. Don’t Miss the Opportunity Tron teaches us that acting early on promising technologies often pays off handsomely. Now, Ruvi presents a fresh opportunity to be part of a project with immense growth potential. The blend of blockchain and AI gives Ruvi a competitive edge that could make it a leader in the next wave of crypto innovation. Final Thoughts Ruvi is carving a new path in the blockchain world, bringing practical AI applications that solve real-world problems. With its token presale currently underway, early investors have the chance to get in on the ground floor of a project that could rival the success of Tron and other top cryptocurrencies. This is the moment to act. Secure your stake in Ruvi today, and join a project poised to revolutionize industries and deliver exceptional returns for those who invest wisely.

As May 2025 unfolds, crypto investors are keeping a close eye on Cardano (ADA) , Solana (SOL) , Ethereum (ETH) , and XRP —each showing signs of movement but delivering mixed signals. While established assets remain important pillars, capital is increasingly rotating toward early-stage entries like MAGACOINFINANCE , which is attracting attention with significantly higher growth forecasts. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Cardano (ADA): Stable, But Struggling to Break Out Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.7031 , showing slight momentum but still stuck within a narrow trading band. A rise toward $0.78–$0.80 remains possible with improved sentiment, but no major technical breakout has occurred. Despite ecosystem expansion and loyal developer support, ADA’s near-term upside is seen as modest— +10% to +15% , barring unexpected catalysts. Solana (SOL): Solid Metrics, But Resistance Stalls the Climb Solana (SOL) is now trading at $171.55 , with slight gains in recent days. However, the $175–$180 resistance zone remains a challenge. While its transaction speed and network usage are unmatched, analysts believe most of its short-term upside is already priced in . Only a strong break above resistance could push SOL toward $190 , representing a +10% to +14% upside through mid-May. Ethereum (ETH): Holding Ground at $2,402.26 Ethereum (ETH) continues to defend the $2,400 level, currently trading at $2,402.26 . The latest upgrade has stabilized investor sentiment, but questions remain about short-term growth potential. With ETH being the most mature smart contract platform, its long-term appeal remains intact, yet near-term expectations cap out around +8% to +12% , unless a strong volume-driven breakout emerges. XRP: A Quiet Rebound Gathering Steam XRP trades at $2.39 , with slow but visible recovery underway. A close above $2.50 could signal a breakout, with some projections suggesting a +15% to +22% gain if institutional volume returns. Regulatory clarity and global payment infrastructure remain XRP’s tailwinds, even if its recent moves have been more muted than headline-making. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE: Under $0.07 With a Projected 3200% Upside While ADA, SOL, ETH, and XRP each offer incremental upside, MAGACOINFINANCE is rapidly gaining traction as the high-risk, high-reward asset of the moment. Still trading below $0.07 , it’s gathering attention thanks to its transparent rollout, VC-free tokenomics, and roadmap already in motion. Analyst forecasts remain aggressive: ROI Potential: 3000%–3250% Price Multiples: 30x–32x expected upon listing Access: Not yet on major exchanges—perfect for early positioning Unlike overleveraged large caps, MAGACOINFINANCE offers entry before mass listings—ideal for those seeking asymmetric reward profiles in a shifting market. With over 14,000 holders and growing traction, it may be the best opportunity for aggressive ROI in Q2.

On May 8, 2025, investors pumped new money in, taking the total to $40 billion. That number indicates that individuals continue purchasing Bitcoin using regulated funds. It also reflects increased confidence from everyday savers as well as large companies. Related Reading: Trump Trade News Ignites Bitcoin Mania—$100K Coming? Spot ETF Inflows Hit New High The leap to $40.33 billion followed recent inflows on May 8. Funds alone totaled more than the previous record on that single day. Investors have been putting money into the products since their launch early in 2024. Their firm hand has kept ETF flows rising even as prices fluctuated. After yesterdays inflows, the spot Bitcoin ETFs are now at a new high water market for lifetime flows. Currently at $40.33 billion according to Bloomberg data h/t @EricBalchunas pic.twitter.com/0GKPNlmprs — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 9, 2025 Growth Since Launch When US spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in about March 2024, total lifetime inflows was approximately $12 billion. Through August 2024, that figure had increased to about $18 billion. Fast-forward to March 2025, and all-time flows were at nearly $35 billion. They broke the $40 billion barrier in only two more months. That steady increase indicates that interest continues unabated in Bitcoin exposure in the form of a plain-vanilla fund, or no-frills investment vehicle. Institutional Investors Push Demand Big money investors are piling in. Asset managers and hedge funds are now using ETFs to invest in Bitcoin rather than chasing coins individually. It adds a safety layer and hedging for large portfolios, say analysts. It also introduces more scrutiny from regulators, as these ETFs will have to be strictly regulated. Some predict that this change might make Bitcoin seem more like a normal asset. Fans Have Their Say Social media responses were hot following the milestone. “Bitcoin is dominating,” posted one user, a line of slang that indicates Bitcoin is overwhelming other assets. Others complimented the ability to achieve buy‑in through regulated channels. None expressed any concerns, although some fear Bitcoin price slowdowns could decelerate ETF flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling The rise above $40 billion is a definite indicator that such ETFs have gained a piece of the market. However, they’re only one of the means through which Bitcoin is held. Miners, open exchange traders, and off-exchange trades all transfer bigger amounts. In the future, observers will eye ETF flows as a sentiment gauge. If more money streams in, it might be an indication of new confidence. If the tide goes out, it might indicate that buyers are finding alternatives.

An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money,” McGregor wrote to X on May 9. The former UFC champion said he would discuss his plans in more detail in an upcoming X spaces, prompting responses from some of the Bitcoin industry’s most prominent leaders. Source: Conor McGregor “We need the greatest minds for this BTC Reserve. Message me and lets chat on my space,” McGregor said in response to Bitcoiner and host of The Pomp Podcast, Anthony Pompliano. One of US President Donald Trump’s crypto advisors, David Bailey, also reached out, to which McGregor responded: “David message me, let’s discuss your ideas!” McGregor announced his independent candidacy for the Irish presidency in late March 2025, centering his campaign on anti-immigration policies and combating crime. Ireland’s next presidential election must take place by Nov. 11, 2025, as the term of the current President, Michael D. Higgins, is set to end the day after. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve — let alone one coming from a minor, independent party — would be no easy feat. Despite recent regulatory progress, the US, El Salvador and Bhutan are among the few countries that have established a Bitcoin reserve to date. Related: US has ‘countless’ ways to bolster Bitcoin reserve: Bo Hines McGregor’s political visibility was recently boosted by a trip to the White House, where he met Trump and received his support. However, McGregor is facing intense scrutiny in Ireland, having recently been found guilty of sexual assault in a civil case — a conviction which he has since appealed — while also previously being investigated for hate speech crimes. McGregor’s last crypto endeavor failed McGregor’s push for a Bitcoin reserve comes a little over a month after the McGregor-backed REAL project failed to attract sufficient funding in its token launch pre-sale, prompting a full refund to all token bidders.

Although they remain dominant in terms of social reach and brand recognition, their current market structures show hesitation — and that’s driving attention to new altcoins like MAGACOINFINANCE , which recently crossed $8 million in early funding and is being flagged by analysts as a serious 2025 contender. Dogecoin Stalls Near Key Resistance DOGE surged over 15% in late April, riding the wave of Bitcoin’s jump past $90,000 . However, it now faces resistance at the $0.20 level. While Dogecoin continues to enjoy high-profile support and viral engagement, trading volume has slowed, and near-term projections show a tight range unless broader meme sector momentum reignites. Forecasts that suggest a climb to $0.22 or even $0.65 later in 2025 remain highly dependent on external catalysts and overall crypto sentiment. SHIBA INU’s Path Remains Volatile Shiba Inu (SHIB) has posted strong gains in recent weeks, but its outlook is anything but stable. Price volatility continues to challenge both short- and mid-term forecasts. While some technical models still predict 100%–125% upside in an ideal scenario, this hinges on sustained traction for Shibarium , SHIB’s layer-2 solution, and other ecosystem milestones yet to materialize. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE Gains Ground With Solid Momentum As the meme coin titans fluctuate, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly positioning itself as a more calculated play in the altcoin rotation cycle. With over $8M raised and early momentum building, it’s attracting retail and analyst interest alike for its clear fundamentals, grassroots traction, and departure from meme-driven hype. Rather than trying to imitate existing trends, MAGACOINFINANCE is crafting its own category — one built on clean tokenomics, no VC overhang, and a transparent growth roadmap. LIMITED TIME OFFER – GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Market Eyes Altcoin Rotation as Momentum Builds What separates MAGACOINFINANCE right now is timing. As investors look to rotate capital out of fatigued meme tokens, early-stage assets with strong backing and narrative clarity are gaining favor.

CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion: A New Focal Point for Smart Investors Dogecoin and SHIBA INU will always have their place in the meme coin hierarchy—but as the current cycle matures, investor attention is clearly expanding to include more strategic early opportunities.

The foundation stone of decentralized applications Ethereum displays uncertain future prospects that professionals predict will reach $15,575 by 2030. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to make waves through its successful presale which has brought in $7,900,000 and attracted 9,700 token owners for over 450 million tokens. The current phase 4 presale has reached 65% completion and offers investors impressive token value at $0.025 per token. Ethereum’s Long-Term Outlook Investors active today closely monitor Ethereum’s future direction through market price analysis. Professional usage and network improvements could drive Ethereum’s value to reach $15,575 by 2030 according to extended forecasting models. Placing $5000 into ETH at today’s market price of $1800 will provide approximately 2.78 coins. At a valuation of $15,575 per ETH the potential future worth amounts to $43,298 based on 2030 estimates. Analyzing short-term price predictions shows a wide range between $1,368 and $2,550 during 2025 while indicating potential market risks. Market analysis shows both optimistic technical patterns from bull flags and Elliott Waves while forecasted bearish scenarios point to $1,050 drops. Ethereum’s future depends on solving scalability issues while managing exposure from multiple markets despite facing some uncertain risks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Through decentralized lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to create its distinctive market position. The ongoing Phase 4 of the 11-phase MUTM presale features token prices that started at $0.01 during phase 1 and currently sell at $0.025. A high level of investor interest exists because phase 5 will elevate MUTM token prices to $0.03 from $0.025 while current holders stand to gain 20% in value. At the scheduled $0.06 listing price investors can expect 140% token value appreciation. Professional analysts project MUTM tokens will reach $2.50 in the market by 2025 turning phase 4 investments into earnings of 9,900%. All contributors to MUTM phase 4 receive 200,000 tokens for their $5,000 investment which promises future valuation at $500,000 based on $2.50 per token and eventually could be worth $13,000,000 if prices reach $65 in 2030. The initial phase experienced a quick sell-out pattern because investors showed a strong need for acquisition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Innovative Features Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself by implementing a dual-lending system. Peer-to-contract technology runs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) through smart contracts which take control of liquidity pools while adjusting interest rates automatically. Mutuum Finance provides lenders with yields alongside borrowers who obtain secured loans through overcollateralization which decreases default probability. Future versions of the peer-to-peer lending system will introduce direct user agreements to provide extra operational flexibility. Certik smart contract auditing is underway by the team before social platform results are published to enhance confidence in the system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently introduced a framework showing the top 50 token holders which awards bonus tokens when users maintain their current positions to strengthen user loyalty. A clear framework operates as a primary factor in building investor trust. Weighing Future Gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates superior investment potential compared to Ethereum due to its projected ROI of $13,000,000 worth of tokens versus Ethereum’s calculated $43,298 value by 2030 at current investment amounts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) implements a buy-and-distribute model which utilizes platform earnings to repurchase tokens thereby retaining market demand despite Ethereum’s ongoing market volatility. The platform’s phase 4 presale has reached 65% completion which suggests a growing sense of immediacy among investors. Before phase 5 implementation, investors interested in high-yield DeFi must join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale to maximize their investment returns.

SUI has drawn eyes after jumping past $3.50, backed by growing total value locked and fresh partnerships. Stellar continues its steady move up, with bullish signals on the charts, but remains sensitive to larger market shifts. Kaspa is still making waves with its strong technicals and the speed of its BlockDAG design, which is being adopted across several use cases. But one name is gaining attention for a very different reason. Web3 ai ($WAI) is not just following market waves; it’s changing the game. The platform includes 12 live AI agents for smart trading, portfolio tracking, scam alerts, and pricing insights. While coins like SUI, Stellar, and Kaspa are building momentum, Web3 ai brings a ready-to-use ecosystem designed to shape how people trade in the AI-driven crypto future. 1. Web3 ai: Built-In AI Tools With 1,747% ROI Potential Web3 ai is quickly rising as a smart pick for those seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Its suite of 12 AI tools sets it apart, each made to manage specific parts of the crypto journey. From live trade alerts to scam detection, price forecasting, portfolio balancing, and market sentiment tracking, these AI agents work together using data from exchanges, social media, blockchain, and news sites. While the backend is fully built, these AI tools will activate after the token goes live. At Stage 1, $WAI is priced at just $0.0003, with the next level set to rise to $0.000315. The final presale stage of Web3 ai ($WAI) will reach $0.003267 before listing at $0.005242, giving early users a projected ROI of 1,747%. It’s not just numbers; this project offers tools people can use. Web3 ai isn’t following hype; it’s preparing for what comes next. With the full platform ready and just waiting on launch, early backers can now secure access. In a market leaning toward automation, Web3 ai’s approach puts it far ahead. That’s why many now consider it the best crypto to buy in 2025 . 2. SUI: Leading The Charge With Ecosystem Growth SUI has become one of the market’s top gainers this week, climbing more than 70% to hit around $3.55 as of April 25, 2025. This jump is supported by major progress in its ecosystem. SUI’s total value locked surged by 40%, reaching $1.645 billion, while trading activity on DEX platforms shot up 177%. Additional news like the Grayscale SUI Trust launch and partnerships with xPortal and xMoney for a virtual Mastercard have fueled the rally. Analysts are watching the Relative Strength Index, which is nearing overbought territory and showing strong buyer interest. With ongoing growth in the ecosystem, price targets between $5.00 and $6.50 seem possible soon. As momentum builds, SUI is recognized as one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 , especially for those tracking ecosystem-based performance. 3. Stellar: Steady Climb Backed by Technicals Stellar Lumens (XLM) has grown gradually, currently trading at about $0.287 as of April 29, 2025. A short-term gain of 3.7% is projected by the end of April, and key technical levels are being tested. XLM is trying to move past resistance areas marked by the 50-day and 200-day SMAs; currently at $0.264 and $0.275, respectively. Its RSI now sits at 61.28, reflecting steady buying pressure. If Stellar breaks through the $0.30–$0.35 zone, it could aim for the $0.50 mark in the coming months. While larger market trends will impact this path, Stellar still holds its place as a solid contender. For those seeking dependable setups, Stellar is still considered one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 , primarily for mid-term holding strategies. 4. Kaspa: Fast, Scalable, and Gaining Use Cases Kaspa (KAS) maintains strong market support in April 2025, trading near $0.0963 with a 6.4% increase over the week. A recent 13% jump placed it among the top weekly gainers, signaling strong momentum. Weekly charts show a bullish engulfing candle, pointing to more possible upside. Price targets in the short term are set between $0.198 and $0.273. Its DAG setup, known for fast speeds and high scalability, is winning attention from developers and enterprises alike. Use cases like real-time invoicing and supply chain automation add practical value. KAS is also being integrated into the CryptoTax Calculator, boosting its appeal to users. With solid tech and rising demand, Kaspa ranks as one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 , especially for those who value speed and scalability in their holdings. Final Verdict: Web3 ai’s Utility Makes It a Breakout Pick SUI’s rally, Stellar’s solid base, and Kaspa’s strong fundamentals support their standing in the current market. From DeFi boosts to technical momentum, these coins make a strong case for being held in a diverse portfolio. But if the goal is to find the best crypto to buy in 2025 , Web3 ai deserves serious attention. Its platform is fully built, and it offers AI-driven infrastructure that solves real-world crypto problems; like slow trading decisions and fraud risks. It’s not just an idea or a whitepaper; it’s a live system waiting for activation post-launch. As crypto shifts toward smarter automation, Web3 ai is leading the charge. That’s why it keeps popping up in discussions about the best crypto to buy in 2025 .

Solana Eyes $1,000 While Ethereum Struggles",https://thecoinrise.com/with-a-5-price-projection-unstaked-is-stealing-crypto-whales-attention-solana-eyes-1000-while-ethereum-struggles/,"With Liquidity, it’s easy to stir excitement, but showing results is harder. While Solana captures attention with its 2030 targets and Ethereum faces near-term stress, the difference between buzz and real delivery is becoming clear. These two remain under watch, one for future growth, the other for liquidity risks, but neither ties its on-chain activity directly to user engagement in a meaningful, traceable way. Unstaked sets itself apart in this context. Rather than leaning on hype or market moods, it applies a Proof of Intelligence model that links output to actual performance data. For those weighing real impact over speculative talk, Unstaked could be the best crypto to buy right now. AI That Delivers Results: How Unstaked Solves Web3’s AI Problem AI is used widely across Web3, but often without accountability. Many crypto projects add the term just for attention, offering basic scripts or bots with little real function. Unstaked takes a different approach. Its autonomous AI agents are built to evolve, interact, and support communities, all while leaving behind on-chain data. This is enabled by Unstaked’s own Proof of Intelligence tech that logs every AI action transparently for users to verify. What matters most, this isn’t a concept waiting for execution. These AI tools are being built now and will go live after the presale concludes. Over $1 million was raised in 24 hours, and $2 million has already been gathered just weeks into the presale. The project is now in stage 6, priced at $0.007535, with a launch price set at $0.1819, pointing to a 2700% potential return. Those searching for the best crypto to buy right now won’t find hollow claims here. Unstaked is building an ecosystem where users are rewarded for interaction and where influence is earned, not given. As experts begin suggesting a $5 long-term value, Unstaked is proving that Web3 AI can be practical, traceable, and meaningful, without the usual noise. Solana Long-Term Prediction: Will SOL Hit $1,000 by 2030? The idea of Solana reaching $1,000 by 2030 is gaining traction. Some forecasts predict an average of $1,033 and a high of $1,351 if the network keeps expanding. (Coinpedia Fintech News) However, some outlooks are more cautious, expecting a price closer to $186.61, which reflects moderate growth. These expectations depend on Solana maintaining fast, affordable transactions and drawing in more dApps and users. The chain’s unique Proof of History method and strong scaling ability remain key strengths. But future outcomes will still be influenced by market swings, changes in regulations, and ongoing tech upgrades. Ethereum Update: Liquidity Worries Point to Short-Term Weakness Ethereum’s charts are showing signs of downward pressure. Analysts believe ETH may be heading toward zones with more liquidity, signaling more short-term dips before a possible rebound. The data comes from patterns that highlight price movement toward these high-liquidity areas. In Q1 2025, Ethereum’s network activity slowed, with just three days of deflation and around $293 million worth of ETH issued. The increase in supply, mixed with weaker activity, has caused concern about ETH’s performance. This situation may cause further dips in the near future. Market watchers suggest keeping an eye on critical support zones and staying alert to broader news that could affect price trends. To Sum Up! Speculation fades, but utility endures. While Solana carries hopes of adoption and Ethereum navigates structural hurdles, neither provides a fully trackable model that rewards users for active involvement. Unstaked puts the outcome ahead of price forecasts. With every move by its AI agents recorded on-chain, the focus is on what’s delivered, not what’s promised. For those who value purpose and output over headlines, this is what makes Unstaked different. While others focus on building noise, Unstaked is focused on building results, and that difference may be why it’s the best crypto to buy right now .

While XRP and Trump Coin are rallying off key catalysts, it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s quietly building toward what some analysts believe could be one of the most rewarding setups of the year. Let’s break down why these three are dominating investor watchlists right now. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! 1. MAGACOINFINANCE – The Emerging ROI Leader MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly distinguishing itself as a rising small-cap contender. With a strong thematic identity and carefully designed tokenomics, the project is resonating with traders seeking both relevance and structure. Key Strengths: Smart Contract Readiness: Deployed and verified for full transparency. Security Audit Completed: Passed comprehensive audit by blockchain security leader HashEx . Token Allocation Model: 45% to public sale 25% for extended marketing 15% for staking/community 10% for liquidity 4% for partnerships 1% reserved for the team High Demand Pressure: Rapid interest has triggered multiple price tier increases in a short period. ROI Outlook: With projections ranging between 25x–35x returns , MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining momentum on both the visibility and valuation fronts. Its smart launch structure, audit-backed credentials, and limited supply design are pushing it forward just as investor appetite for new narratives grows. In short, it’s the kind of early-stage play that serious altcoin watchers look for before the major wave hits. 2. Trump Coin ($TRUMP) – Latest Price: $10.12 | YTD ROI: +60% Trump Coin has rebounded sharply following a surge in media attention and a high-profile May 22 private gala dinner for its top 220 holders. The exclusive nature of the event, combined with a new treasury partnership from a U.S. logistics firm pledging $20 million in $TRUMP purchases, has revived bullish sentiment. Though highly speculative and sensitive to news flow, the token continues to attract strong community engagement, making it one of the most volatile—but intriguing—plays of the season. 3. XRP (Ripple) – Price: $2.22 | ETF Catalyst: $5–$12 Forecast XRP is now trading around $2.22 , fresh off a major SEC settlement that saw the regulator drop its final appeal. The resolution included a reduced $50 million fine and removed the last regulatory cloud from Ripple’s future. With an 85% ETF approval probability projected for this year, many see XRP heading toward $5 , with extended targets reaching up to $12 , depending on broader market conditions. Infrastructure strength and institutional appeal remain key drivers. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion: MAGACOINFINANCE Leading the ROI Race Among these three, MAGACOINFINANCE clearly holds the early-stage edge. With a proven audit, structured rollout, and ROI forecasts as high as 35x , it’s attracting increased investor positioning before listings roll out. Trump Coin delivers on attention and event momentum, while XRP brings regulatory clarity and ETF-driven upside. But for investors seeking asymmetric reward and early access, MAGACOINFINANCE may offer the most compelling setup of 2025 .

The flagship cryptocurrency jumped as high as $103,800, its highest price level since January 2025. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the BTC price might be in a make-or-break season. Is A BTC Parabolic Rally On The Horizon? Crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci took to the social media platform X to reveal that the Bitcoin Advanced Network Value to Transaction (NVT) metric has surpassed a critical threshold. According to the online pundit, this on-chain development suggests a potential shift in market dynamics, which could ultimately impact the price of BTC. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The Advanced NVT metric is a refined version of the traditional NVT indicator, which calculates the ratio of Network Value (market cap) by the volume (in USD) transferred through the blockchain daily. This Advanced Network Value to Transaction metric helps to better capture extreme valuation conditions. Hence, when the Advanced NVT metric surges above its long-term moving average by more than two standard deviations (2xSD), it implies that the BTC market cap growth does not correlate with its blockchain volume. Historically, this phenomenon often precedes either an extended price rally or sometimes a severe market correction. According to the data shared by Kesmeci, the Bitcoin Advanced NVT is above the 2xSD threshold, even though it might not persist above this level. The analyst mentioned that the indicator does not spend an extended period above 2xSD unless Bitcoin is on the verge of a parabolic price rally. Kesmeci noted: However, with a parabolic rally, it is possible that it could move much higher than 4xSD. This has happened before with the ETF rally after the approval of Spot ETFs. Furthermore, Kesmeci highlighted that while history suggests that Bitcoin Advanced NVT being above 2xSD is an anomaly that often precedes a rally, it is not set in stone that the indicator must lose the 2xSD level. Hence, investors might want to closely watch this BTC metric above this, as the premier cryptocurrency is currently at a critical juncture, which could define its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Over the past week, the price of BTC regained a six-figure valuation for the first time since losing the $100,000 level in February. As of this writing, the market leader sits just above the $103,100 mark, reflecting 0.5% jump in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, though, Bitcoin’s value is up by more than 6%.

Analysts Highlight Its Distinctive Role Among Altcoins,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-magacoinfinance-the-smartest-buy-for-2025-analysts-highlight-its-distinctive-role-among-altcoins/,"MAGACOINFINANCE: A Standout in the New Cycle As the altcoin market prepares for another wave of narrative-driven growth, MAGACOINFINANCE has entered the spotlight—not just as a meme project, but as a politically aligned token gaining rapid traction. Positioned at the crossroads of digital assets and cultural relevance, it’s being closely followed by analysts looking for the next cycle’s breakout candidate. Political Themes and Crypto Performance Historically, political-themed coins have outperformed during election seasons. Tokens tied to prominent figures—especially those aligned with Donald Trump or MAGA branding—have seen price surges driven by retail energy, media exposure, and broader social trends. MAGACOINFINANCE is building on this proven template, launching during a critical election year with an identity that resonates deeply across ideological and online communities. Much like its predecessors, its timing and theme give it an edge in capturing viral and speculative capital at once. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Market Structuring and Momentum from the Ground Up While many meme coins live or die by hype alone, MAGACOINFINANCE is approaching its growth with structure. The project’s ongoing token sale has drawn widespread interest, with investors engaging early due to a tiered pricing model and limited supply allocation. Strong early participation, combined with disciplined tokenomics, is generating growing demand without overexposing the asset. For early buyers, this creates a feeling of exclusivity and long-term value. The traction MAGACOINFINANCE is receiving is not simply due to social sentiment—it’s rooted in how it’s being built. Perfect Timing in a Narrative-Driven Cycle Altcoin booms often align with narrative shifts—and 2025 is shaping up to be such a moment. With the convergence of key events like ETF speculation , protocol upgrades, and election-related developments, the stage is set for alternative coins with storytelling appeal. MAGACOINFINANCE lands at this precise moment. It brings political relevance, meme coin familiarity, and early-market entry all together during a period of resurging speculative energy—creating ideal conditions for sustained growth if momentum holds. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Analyst Sentiment: Early Signals Point to Strong Setup Analysts are increasingly comparing MAGACOINFINANCE to early political meme tokens that later delivered exceptional ROI. While risk is inherent in all new projects, the structural design, macro timing, and branding alignment give it real upside potential. With its token sale accelerating and investor sentiment turning positive, many believe this could be one of the last meaningful early-stage altcoin entries before larger caps dominate headlines again. Final Thoughts More than a novelty, MAGACOINFINANCE taps into something deeper: the intersection of culture, timing, and crypto speculation. It brings a focused structure to a market often flooded with low-effort clones—and does so during a season where political attention is likely to fuel digital asset narratives. As the world heads deeper into a pivotal election year and altcoin rotations intensify, MAGACOINFINANCE may be uniquely positioned to ride that wave.

While these established giants remain in the spotlight, the analyst singles out MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout contender with the potential to surpass them all heading into 2025. With early investor momentum, rapid sales growth, and forecasts suggesting exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a top altcoin to watch this year LISTINGS COULD DROP ANY MOMENT –ACT NOW Bitcoin: Institutional Momentum Drives New Highs Bitcoin has surged past $100,000, fueled by institutional inflows and ETF approvals. Analysts forecast targets up to $250,000 as adoption accelerates. Policy support and growing demand make BTC the market’s top performer. Ethereum: Uptrend Fueled by Upgrades and ETF Prospects Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade and rising validator activity have reignited bullish sentiment. A potential U.S. spot ETH ETF could push prices to $2,800–$3,500 by early 2025. As Web3 infrastructure, ETH’s growth remains steady and reliable. Cardano: Bullish Reversal as Ecosystem Expands Cardano has broken above $0.80, signaling a bullish reversal after months of consolidation. DeFi growth and ecosystem expansion support a move toward $1.00–$1.10 by year-end. ADA’s focus on scalability keeps investor confidence high. XRP: Legal Clarity Unlocks Institutional Capital XRP’s legal victories have cleared the path for institutional investment and new XRPL integrations. With ETF approval likely, a breakout above $2.46 could see XRP target $5. Regulatory clarity positions XRP for a top-three comeback. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Altcoin With 25x Potential While major coins might double or triple, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to multiply far beyond that. With over 50,000 community members and viral demand driving daily presale inflows, it’s now being tracked as one of the top altcoins to watch this year. Backed by narrative momentum, structured tokenomics, and strong early engagement, MAGACOINFINANCE has what Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP no longer offer: a low entry point with massive upside still ahead . The project is featured by major crypto publishers , trending across social platforms , and has a CMC listing around the corner — all while still being priced under $0.0003 . 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Final Word: Big names are moving.

BTC. The government continues its Bitcoin strategy despite strict conditions in a loan deal signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in late 2024. Currently, the country’s holdings are worth more than $641 million. The figures were reported by El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, which monitors and announces the country’s Bitcoin purchases. President Nayib Bukele’s government wants to stay the course of its Bitcoin policy. President Nayib Bukele is betting even bigger on Bitcoin. Even with international pushback and IMF advisories, he insists there will be no going back for the country’s Bitcoin strategy. On March 4, 2025, on X, he wrote : No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘Bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. President Nayib Bukele The Bukele government has been buying at least one Bitcoin a day. This has been going on since late 2023 and has continued in abundance into 2025. There are days when the government purchases more than a single BTC, depending on market prices and how much money is available. The buys are carried out via the Bitcoin Office, a special unit created to deal with crypto stuff for the government. This office is also in the habit of making routine media announcements and posting information regarding the government of El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings through its website and social media. IMF pressures El Salvador to restrict Bitcoin In December 2024, El Salvador signed a $1.4 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose public policy aims to stabilize the economy, encourage foreign investment, and reorganize national debt. But the offer was not without strings. The country agreed to halt any voluntary public sector accumulation of Bitcoin as part of a technical memorandum of understanding. This included activities such as purchasing and mining BTC. However, the agreement clarified that Bitcoin obtained through forfeiture, seizure, custody, or similar legal actions against individuals or companies would be exempt from this restriction. The memorandum of understanding further pointed out that the public sector included all hot and cold wallets under the governance of any government-owned entity. Some of the entities listed included the Chivo Wallet, La Agencia Administradora de Fondos Bitcoin, Comision Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa, and Oficina Nacional del Bitcoin. El Salvador’s lawmakers responded in January 2025 with a 55 to 2 vote to repeal the Bitcoin legal tender law. The law was later reversed; Bitcoin was still legal in the country, but it was no longer compulsory to use in transactions. Easing these strict regulations did not mean that the government stopped believing in the wonders of crypto. Bitcoin purchases continued, and by March 2025, the IMF reiterated its advice for El Salvador to stop buying the digital asset. But President Nayib Bukele resisted, rejecting the IMF’s request. This defiance has frightened international economists and investors. El Salvador is opening itself to gratuitous financial risk, many believe. Even the IMF has cautioned that continued Bitcoin purchases with public money could make the country’s fiscal outlook more volatile. Bukele expands Bitcoin reserves despite IMF deal El Salvador’s Bitcoin buying spree is not showing any signs of slowing. The Central American nation remains among the rare few actively acquiring Bitcoin through open market operations. Crypto industry leaders believe its national Bitcoin treasury approach could become a model for other countries exploring the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves. Some analysts think Bukele’s plan may encourage other small or emerging nations to consider Bitcoin a national reserve asset. El Salvador is the only country in the world taking public money in real-time and daily to generate purchases in Bitcoin. Critics call the move risky, while its supporters say it is visionary.

He says the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, led to a “total reset” in the two countries’ economic relationship. This comes after months of rising tensions and a damaging tariff war. The US trade representative , Robert Lighthizer, met with his Chinese counterpart Liu He in Geneva over the weekend. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent headed the US team, and Vice Premier He Lifeng led China’s team. The discussions occurred after the United States escalated a trade war by imposing tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese goods in April. China swiftly retaliated with 125 percent tariffs on American goods. Trump, who has adopted a tough stance toward China since re-entering office, wrote about the meeting on Truth Social. “Many things discussed, much agreed to,” he wrote. He noted that it is a total reset, negotiated in a friendly but firm way that allows the two countries to move forward on things they can do together. Trump added that they wanted to see China open up to American business for the benefit of both China and the United States and emphasized that great progress had been made. Negotiations in Geneva were more upbeat than many had anticipated. Both delegations characterized the meeting in reports as “frank” and “productive.” Trump signals possible tariff compromise as trade talks progress For some time, President Trump had insisted that he would not reduce tariffs without major concessions from China. He said the United States had been losing a trillion dollars a year—or more—in trade with China but added that they were no longer losing anything, which he considered a positive change. And yet, somehow, now he’s hinting that maybe he’s flexible. On Friday, Trump said an 80% tariff was “probably the correct number,” suggesting perhaps some compromise. By Saturday evening, people familiar with the talks said that negotiators discussed dropping tariffs between 50% and 60%, or as low as 34% for some sectors. Markets have responded cautiously. Investors are hoping an agreement will bring relief to industries hurt by the trade war — and those prospects are probably highest for agriculture, electronics, and logistics. The decline in China’s exports to the United States was steep, falling by more than 21% in April. American farmers and small businesses have also said they face higher costs and reduced sales because of the trade standoff. Negotiators plan to continue trade talks despite global concerns These conversations are expected to resume on Sunday. Both sides should delve even deeper into lingering issues. That includes intellectual property rights, opening markets in China for American companies, and closer tracking of restrictions of fentanyl in the class of drugs known as opioids. Officials have said they aim to reach a clear, stable trade agreement. That would enable businesses on each side to plan for the future, invest, and know that they would not suddenly face rule changes. Observers say the US wants China to agree to purchase more US products and open its market to outside companies. For its part, China has longed for some relief from the heavy tariffs and more predictable rules from Washington. Experts caution that while progress this weekend is promising, the road ahead is unclear. A final agreement could be weeks, if not months, away. Yet many consider the Geneva discussions a hopeful breakthrough after months of tension. With success, a deal could potentially reset not just trade but the larger relationship between the United States and China. BTC price is once again approaching a breakout to new all-time highs (ATHs), with a potential US-China trade agreement likely acting as the catalyst. The leading cryptocurrency surged past \$104,000 after Donald Trump’s comments on the “good meeting” between the two economic giants.

With the emergence of new technologies and ever-increasing adoption of blockchain, the industry is on the brink of revolutionizing global financial systems. As major cryptos show promising partnerships and technological advancements, the question arises: which are the top cryptos to join this week? Among the flood of options, three blockchain projects— Qubetics , Cosmos, and Binance Coin (BNB)—have come to the forefront. Each offering unique solutions, these coins strategically position themselves in the market. However, as more tokens and blockchain ecosystems enter the scene, only a few can offer innovative solutions to real-world problems. At the intersection of traditional financial systems and decentralized finance (DeFi), Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a standout contender with the potential to create a lasting impact. As blockchain technology rapidly advances, top cryptos to join this week are scrutinized by experts and investors alike. Qubetics is leading the charge as one of the most promising contenders. Qubetics: Transforming Cross-Border Transactions with Blockchain Technology With global commerce growing exponentially, the demand for efficient and cost-effective cross-border transactions has reached unprecedented levels. Traditional financial systems and banks often take days to process international payments and charge high fees, creating an urgent need for innovation. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a project designed to address these issues by offering businesses, professionals, and individuals a faster, cheaper alternative. The $TICS token powers the Qubetics ecosystem, which leverages blockchain to create seamless cross-border payments. With the increasing global reliance on decentralized finance, Qubetics’ presale has already made significant strides in raising over $16.8 million, selling 511 million tokens to more than 26,000 holders in its 33rd crypto presale stage. This highlights the growing interest in blockchain solutions that reduce friction and enhance transaction transparency. As Qubetics continues to flourish, top cryptos to join this week, like $TICS have caught the attention of investors looking for high ROI opportunities. Key Benefits of Qubetics for Cross-Border Transactions: Faster Transactions: Traditional cross-border transactions take several days to process. Qubetics promises near-instant transfers, dramatically improving speed. Lower Fees: By eliminating intermediaries, Qubetics significantly reduces transaction fees compared to conventional systems. Greater Security: Blockchain’s inherent security features protect transactions from fraud, offering users greater peace of mind. Global Accessibility: Qubetics is a decentralized system that allows users worldwide to transact without relying on centralized financial institutions. Qubetics is now well-positioned to address one of the biggest challenges in global finance—cross-border payments—providing businesses and individuals a way to transfer funds quickly, securely, and affordably. As a result, it’s undoubtedly one of the top cryptos to join this week for those looking to be part of the next wave of blockchain innovation. Analysts’ Predictions: As the crypto presale continues, analysts predict significant growth for the $TICS token. After the presale ends, projections show a remarkable ROI for early adopters: $TICS at $1 After the Presale: 334% ROI $TICS at $5 After the Presale: 2071% ROI $TICS at $6 After Mainnet Launch: 2505% ROI $TICS at $10 After Mainnet Launch: 4243% ROI $TICS at $15 After Mainnet Launch: 6414% ROI With such strong predictions, Qubetics ($TICS) presents an exciting opportunity for those seeking a promising blockchain project in the cross-border payment space and is certainly one of the top cryptos to join this week. Sei Network to Abandon Cosmos Support, Eyes Full EVM Transition with SIP-3 Proposal Sei Network is poised to undergo a major architectural overhaul as it considers dropping Cosmos support to become an EVM-only blockchain, per the SIP-3 proposal introduced by core developer Philip Su. Set for community discussion on May 14, this shift would phase out CosmWasm contracts, cease native Cosmos messaging, and introduce “EVM Pointers” to bridge existing Cosmos assets into the Ethereum-compatible layer. The move follows mounting technical complexity and a clear user preference for EVM protocols after the network’s v2 upgrade. Developers and users will face asset migrations and code rewrites. Still, proponents argue the transition will streamline infrastructure, enhance toolset compatibility, and align Sei with the broader Ethereum ecosystem for long-term scalability and adoption. BNB Price Eyes $1,110 Breakout as Cup-and-Handle Pattern Aligns with Potential Trump Pardon for CZ Binance Coin (BNB) is poised for a major breakout as it forms a textbook cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart, signaling a potential rally toward $1,110—especially if former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao secures a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. Currently trading around $615, BNB has shown resilience amid market consolidation, and technical analysts point to the bullish continuation pattern—formed since its 2021 peak at $662—as a key driver of upcoming momentum. A pardon could serve as a powerful catalyst, boosting investor sentiment and clearing the path for CZ to re-engage with U.S. crypto markets, potentially reviving Binance US. With historical rallies tied to favorable CZ developments and renewed institutional optimism, analysts forecast a breakout past $740 could ignite a surge first toward $1,000 and eventually to $1,110, while a drop below $485 would nullify the bullish outlook. Conclusion: Why Qubetics is a Game-Changer As the cryptocurrency market progresses, the demand for faster, more affordable, and secure blockchain solutions is greater than ever. While projects like Cosmos and Binance Coin have made substantial contributions to the industry, Qubetics ($TICS) stands poised to take advantage of a critical gap in the market: efficient cross-border transactions. With its impressive crypto presale performance, growing adoption, and bold vision for the future, Qubetics has positioned itself as a project to watch closely. For those searching for the top cryptos to join this week, Qubetics presents an exciting opportunity. As blockchain technology continues transforming financial systems, Qubetics is paving the way for businesses and individuals to experience the future of payments today. For those looking to be part of the blockchain revolution, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the top cryptos to join this week with immense growth potential.

Surprisingly, it’s not just retail buyers jumping in—whales from the XRP and Cardano (ADA) communities are beginning to reposition into this rising asset. After securing $8 million in early funding, MAGACOINFINANCE is making waves—not because of hype, but due to its structured launch, transparent mechanics, and increasing analyst attention. While ADA and XRP remain technically solid but stuck in neutral, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging with real upside potential and near-term actionability. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! XRP and ADA Hold Ground—But Lack Momentum In May 2025, both Cardano and XRP are in the spotlight—but for very different reasons: Cardano (ADA) shows signs of a bullish reversal thanks to growing speculation around a possible Cardano ETF , plus real-world adoption ahead of the LAOS upgrade. Still, ADA is hovering between $0.70–$0.72 , with resistance near $0.81 and $1.17 yet to break. XRP , now priced around $2.22 , has been volatile due to delays in ETF filings and softened trading volume. Though Bloomberg analysts still assign an 85% probability to an ETF greenlight in 2025, the mood remains cautious following the SEC’s latest stall. Both remain credible long-term holds—but the lack of immediate catalysts is steering attention toward emerging high-ROI assets like MAGACOINFINANCE . Over 3,000% ROI Potential + 50% Bonus Fuel the Surge MAGACOINFINANCE is currently delivering what some analysts call a textbook early-stage investment scenario. Here’s why: Projected returns above 3,000% from presale to listing 50% bonus tokens available during the active round Fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale Bonuses dropping and prices climbing steadily as demand builds With a well-calibrated structure and no open-ended timelines or vague ambitions, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out from the flood of meme tokens circulating today. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Positioned for a 25x–35x Climb Before Year-End Analysts forecast MAGACOINFINANCE hitting its listing target of $0.007 , translating to an expected return of 25x to 35x from current levels. What supports that projection? A global-scale marketing campaign is already planned Influencer and agency partnerships are underway Exchange listing conversations are active Unlike most token sales that lean on hype without delivery, MAGACOINFINANCE is already executing—a fact not lost on XRP and ADA holders now rotating capital in. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Watched Closely by Analysts More than a narrative token, MAGACOINFINANCE is now being cited as one of the few high-potential early-stage plays. For those who missed out on ETH , SHIBA INU , or DOGE in their early days, this may be the next serious contender. While ADA and XRP continue to trade within well-defined ranges, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in price discovery mode—and gathering momentum fast. With institutional-grade branding, expanding community traction, and over 20,000 active holders , it’s rapidly climbing the altcoin radar for 2025. This is no longer about “if”—it’s about when .

The cryptocurrency stablecoin almost ended its smooth business in the US, with several Senate Republicans and possibly some Democrats pushing to bring it under U.S. jurisdiction. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act was far from radical. In fact, it was one of the more sensible crypto bills we’ve seen in years. Designed to bring transparency and accountability to stablecoin issuers, it laid out basic safeguards: licensing requirements, mandatory reserve disclosures, and federal oversight. Not exactly revolutionary, just responsible. Luckily for Tether, the Senate failed to advance a vote to initiate formal debate on the newly revised GENIUS Act. The revised GENIUS Act provisions raised questions among DeFi players If you’ve followed the digital asset space for more than five minutes, you know Tether is everywhere — powering most crypto trades , providing liquidity to DeFi, and even acting as a quasi-central bank for some offshore markets. Yet, Tether has long been criticized for its lack of transparency and murky reserve practices. This bill could have forced Tether and other issuers to play by clearer, safer rules. But instead, the Senate blinked. Originally introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) in February, the GENIUS) Act was co-sponsored by Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) and Subcommittee on Digital Assets Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY). After receiving bipartisan support, Hagerty’s legislation fell 48-49 on the Senate floor on Thursday Before the vote, Republican lawmakers revised the bill, adding a few provisions that some lawmakers claimed they had not read or reviewed beforehand. Some even claimed the Republicans rushed the vote on the legislation and even called off negotiations prematurely. These factors and sentiments affected the vote, with several Democrats pulling their support for the bill. Moreover, the revised bill does leave out the names of the two Democratic co-sponsors, Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks. The new bill is now solely sponsored by Republicans, including only Senators. Bill Hagerty, Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, and Sen. Dan Sullivan. However, the bill stands a better chance of advancing in the Senate if at least one Democrat signs on as a co-sponsor. The new bill includes “extraterritoriality,” which would obligate foreign stablecoin issuers to follow U.S. regulations when offering their services to American customers. Unfortunately for Tether, this provision could mean the end of its regulatory gray area and the beginning of stricter oversight. However, per previous stipulations, the bill supports stablecoin providers expanding to other types of assets, which could benefit the company in the long run. Unlike the old version, the new bill also widens the scope of what constitutes a digital asset service provider, including developers, validator nodes, and operators of self-custodial wallets. Nonetheless, the definition change raises concerns about its possible effect on different facilitators of DeFi protocols and whether they would need to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and AML laws. Not to mention, Digital asset service providers can now be charged for using unauthorized like decentralized stablecoins. Additionally, the new GENIUS Act allows the Treasury Secretary to ease regulations for smaller or pilot projects and to act alone in ‘exigent circumstances,’ raising questions about possible executive overreach. Nevertheless, now that the bill is open to the public, the crypto community can gauge its advantages, possible impact on the industry, and how it differs from the bill approved by the Senate Committee in March. The stablecoin bill could be up for discussion again While the stablecoin bill failed to advance, some analysts believe it’s only a temporary stalemate, and the bill may eventually pass. Kara Calvert, vice president of U.S. policy at Coinbase, even commented, “It’s going to live to fight another day. Would I have liked to see the vote pass? Absolutely. Would that have made the day better? Absolutely. But I didn’t walk away thinking this bill is going to die, or this issue is going away.” Senator Ruben Gallego, the top Democrat on the Senate’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, had sought to postpone the vote until Monday to give lawmakers additional time to evaluate the bill. However, his request was denied, and the bill failed to proceed. Meanwhile, Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto advocacy group The Digital Chamber, acknowledged the bill’s vote-down on Thursday as a setback but believes it is still “far from a defeat.” Some analysts have also argued that there could be another vote to commence discussions on the stablecoin bill by the end of May. If lawmakers are serious about protecting consumers, fostering innovation, and reclaiming leadership in financial technology, they can’t allow personal politics to derail essential legislation. The GENIUS Act wasn’t just about Tether. It was about creating a blueprint for how digital dollars should operate in the world’s largest economy. That blueprint needs to be drawn soon, whether through this bill or another.",OP-ED|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-11 02:30:19

Bullish momentum in the past five days has caused Ethereum’s price action to surge past the $2,200 level with conviction, rising more than 32% in the past seven days alone. The breakout comes as Bitcoin crossed the six-figure mark again, lifting the broader crypto market along with it. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling According to technical analysis of Ethereum’s daily candlestick chart, this rally is more than just a reaction to Bitcoin; it is the start of a new long-term uptrend. $2,200 Breakout Confirms Strength, Analyst Declares End Of Bear Market The recent surge has lifted Ethereum well beyond $2,000, a price level that acted as a ceiling in late March and early April. According to technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MasterAnanda, Ethereum’s bear market is finally over. This comment was made in light of what the analyst called a real bullish action, coupled with really high volume in the past few days. This, in turn, confirms a very strong high in the coming weeks and days, where Ethereum will grow daily non-stop for months. The recent rally has taken the price above the August 5, 2024, and February 3, 2025 lows, highlighted on a chart posted by the analyst on TradingView. The chart also shows that Ethereum broke free convincingly from a steep descending channel pattern that had trapped its price for months. The breakout is convincing because a large green candle accompanied by unusually high trading volume marked the breakout, lending credibility to the view that the bear phase is now over. “This is only the start,” the analyst wrote, adding that Ethereum’s path toward reclaiming its all-time highs is already underway. $5,791 An ‘Easy’ Target, $10,000 Before 2026 ‘Doable’ According to MasterAnanda’s analysis, the current rally could easily carry Ethereum to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level near $5,791.78. He describes this target as “easy”, given the strength of the breakout and the capital inflow that appears to be building behind it. Reaching the $5,791 price target would translate to a breakout to uncharted price territories above Ethereum’s current all-time high of $4,878. However, the prediction doesn’t stop there. A $10,000 Ethereum is not only possible but likely before the end of 2025 due to institutional money and retail sentiment flooding into the market. The chart illustrates Ethereum’s recovery path with various Fibonacci levels mapped out, showing resistance and retracement points ranging from $2,421 at the 0.382 extension up to $5,791 at the 1.618 extension. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy The analyst noted that around $250 billion in capital could eventually flow into the crypto market during this wave, with $10 to $15 billion already in play. He argues that the euphoric phase will begin once the remaining capital enters. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,395.

Armstrong said the Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy could have risked the company’s cash position and potentially killed the crypto exchange. “We made a conscious choice about risk,” he added. Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas, who also attended the video call, added that the firm didn’t want to be seen as directly competing against its customers over which cryptocurrencies would outperform. “Rest assured, we are not stopping there,” Haas said, as Coinbase reported purchasing another $153 million worth of crypto assets in its first quarter results statement on May 8, which was primarily concentrated in Bitcoin. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net , Coinbase holds 9,480 Bitcoin — worth $988 million at current market prices — which makes up the majority of its $1.3 billion crypto asset holdings. Armstrong’s crypto exchange is the ninth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing the likes of Strategy, Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and Tesla. Related: $45 million stolen from Coinbase users in the last week — ZachXBT Several companies have begun copying Saylor’s Bitcoin playbook, funding purchases through stock and debt sales on the bet that Bitcoin’s price appreciation will boost their share prices. Over 100 public companies have now reported holding Bitcoin around the world, while another 40 exchange-traded fund issuers, 26 private firms and 12 nation states have also reported holding the cryptocurrency.

The acquisition will expand Coinbase’s footprint in the crypto derivatives market immensely, which previously had been limited to its Bermuda-based platform. Coinbase noted that Deribit facilitated over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024 and has around $30 billion of current open interest. The deal now makes Coinbase the “global leader” in crypto derivatives trading, the firm said.

Analysts say this rise could be linked to recent comments by the U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced a major breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade talks. If this reset is real, it could lift investor confidence across global markets. Experts believe that this positive news might remove economic uncertainty and push markets even higher. As global liquidity increases, risk assets like cryptocurrencies are expected to follow. Bitcoin Dominance Falling, Altcoins Rising Bitcoin’s dominance—its share of the total crypto market—is dropping, which often signals a shift toward altcoins. A similar pattern happened in late 2024, just before a major altcoin rally. If the trend continues, May and June could be very bullish months for crypto investors. Ethereum has already climbed nearly 40% in just a week and is trading above $2,500. Altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s movement, and with BTC on the rise, many believe altcoins are about to surge as well. At the same time, USDT dominance (how much of the market is held in the Tether stablecoin) is decreasing. This means more investors are moving their money from stablecoins into crypto assets—another positive sign for the market. XRP Could Be Ready for a Big Move Technical analysts are paying close attention to XRP, which recently broke out of a 112-day downtrend. If the rally continues, XRP could hit $2.80 soon, and potentially even set a new all-time high. Some bullish price targets suggest it could go as high as $5.65, especially if it continues to hold above key support levels. The XRP/BTC trading pair also looks promising. It’s currently trying to break out of a “falling wedge” pattern—often a sign of a big move to the upside. Preparing for a Potential Crypto Surge Some analysts are predicting a local market top in June or July, with Bitcoin possibly reaching $120,000 to $130,000. If that happens, Ethereum could return to $4,000, and XRP might approach $4.00.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-11 03:48:22

The broader ETF market now holds over 6% of total supply, yet BRRR has not benefited from that inflow. I continue to see BTC as a 'buy' following a technical breakout and a return of investor demand. BRRR will work fine as a long Bitcoin product, though I still prefer FBTC personally. Back in early December, I wrote about the declining dominance of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) within the digital asset market. My thinking then was that we could be at the beginning of an 'alt season' in crypto. That turned out to be a poor assessment, as Bitcoin Dominance has continued higher through the five months since that piece was published. The metric has moved from 55% up to 62%: Bitcoin Dominance 5/9/25 (CoinMarketCap) The performance of alts against Bitcoin was so bad that at one point in April, CryptoMarketCap's 'Altcoin Season Index' fell all the way to 12. That number has since reversed higher up to 33 and is now at its highest level in nearly 3 months. In the past, we've seen altcoin out-performance be an indicator of bull market exhaustion. Given that, let's explore some historical cycle top indicators for Bitcoin to see if we should be concerned about a deeper market pullback. Or, is the BTC price now more a product of traditional market capital flows through ETFs like the CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (NASDAQ: BRRR ). Historical Indicators & Performance There are several ratios and models that can be used to assess when Bitcoin's price is at or approaching profit-taking levels. Personally, I don't think it's prudent to use these indicators as forecasts or price targets. Rather, they can help investors/traders assess when price is perhaps getting out of hand relative to its past performance. One such metric that I find useful is the Pi Cycle Top Indicator. This utilizes price with the 111 DMA as well as a 2x multiple on the 350 DMA: Bitcoin Magazine PRO When price gets close to or even well above the 350 DMA multiple, it has historically been an indication that the cycle top has been achieved, and the rally is extended. As of May 9th, the green band on the indicator - which is the 2x 350 DMA - is at $157k per coin. This would imply BTC could rally another 50% from current levels before a sell signal would be triggered. Another metric to consider is the MVRV, or market value to realized value ratio: MVRV Ratio (IntoTheBlock) This is another way of showing when BTC is 'overvalued' based on the premium the market is willing to pay for BTC over the average price paid for each address. Bitcoin is historically 'cheap' when the MVRV is less than 100%. It is currently at 212%. Which I wouldn't say is 'cheap' by any means, but also far from the 435% MVRV Ratio in 2017 and the 373% MVRV Ratio in 2021. More recently, the ratio has eclipsed 260% on two separate occasions going back to March 2024. The question is whether or not Bitcoin holders should expect lower highs in these types of ratios as halving cycles progress. We do know the price performance gains have generally exhibited lower returns each halving epoch: BTC Price Gain By Halving Epoch (IntoTheBlock) The first halving epoch generated a return that eclipsed over 7,000%. The second was about 3,000%. The third was roughly 1000%. Clearly, there should be an expectation of diminishing returns in the price performance if history is a guide. Again, the question is what is a reasonably expected price performance high level for this current halving cycle. I think it would be wise to expect well below half the prior cycle. Frankly, I think even a 200% gain this time around would be ambitious, as that would put the price of BTC close to $190k per coin. But even if we split that and call it 100%, that would put BTC in the $130k per coin range and somewhat close to the Pi Cycle Top Indicator. I think this is a far more reasonable expectation. ETFs & a Capital-Driven Market Ultimately, price comes down to capital flows and demand from products like ETFs as well as companies like Strategy ( MSTR ). There, we're seeing a strong surge in demand, with $5.5 billion in digital asset inflows in the last three weeks: Capital Flows By Asset (CoinShares) Compared with the broader digital asset investment market, Bitcoin is clearly the favorite here, nearly 99% of the total year to date flows coming from Bitcoin alone. If 'altcoin season' is ever going to happen, it certainly doesn't look like it's anywhere close. It's difficult for me to see how the lack of a fresh 'altseason' wouldn't ultimately benefit Bitcoin. Especially since we're still only looking at two assets available through the spot ETF wrapper in the United States - though that could certainly change this year. Regardless, the trend in aggregate BTC held through US-based ETFs is positive: BTC Held Through ETFs/Funds ( Bitcoin Treasuries ) At just shy of 1.4 million BTC, the ETF/CEF funds have grown substantially through the years and now hold over 6% of total supply. Interestingly, BRRR is not a fund that is benefiting from this, as the fund's BTC is lower than where it was a year ago. Admittedly, there are some conflicting third-party numbers pertaining to what BRRR actually holds. The Block has BRRR Bitcoin holdings at 3,250 BTC while Bitcoin Treasuries has the fund at 6,554 BTC: BRRR Assets ( Bitcoin Treasuries ) CoinShares' own website cites 6,093 BTC as of May 9th. Regardless, it does appear as though assets held through this ETF have declined while other funds like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) continue to see inflow generally speaking. At a 0.25% expense ratio, BRRR is far from the most expensive spot fund, but it's also not the cheapest; which might explain why the fund hasn't meaningfully grown its stack in the last year. Closing Summary I've been making the argument for some time through Seeking Alpha pieces and elsewhere that Bitcoin's price appreciation is more narrative-driven than fundamentally driven. There are some who might take issue with that framing, but I'm separating Bitcoin the decentralized ledger system from Bitcoin the digital asset. Meaning, Bitcoin's price may go up - but at least to this point in time, that appreciation in price has been more about capital flows into an anti-fiat currency thesis rather than from actual utility of the ledger system by a growing base of users. Fundamentally, the network has been experiencing declining usage since 2023 . To be clear, I have no issue with Bitcoin the digital asset appreciating because of capital flows. Longer term, the math may stop working if miners have no incentive to validate transactions, but that's a problem for a different day. Given the price breakout , investor interest, and the lack of overheated cycle indicators, I think Bitcoin remains a buy and BRRR is a fine way to express that trade. Though I do still prefer FBTC as my spot ETF of choice.",BTC-USD|BRRR,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-11 03:59:00

These legacy assets are once again dominating watchlists across institutional desks and retail communities. But quietly, a new name is being added to the conversation. MAGACOIN FINANCE , an early-stage presale token, is emerging as a contender that could rival — and possibly outperform — even the biggest names in the next breakout wave. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength Meets Real Utility Solana is back above $150 , rebounding from its April lows and trading with renewed strength. With resistance at $153–$155 , analysts believe a breakout could send SOL toward $175 or higher . Solana has also solidified its position in payments and stablecoin settlement, shedding its memecoin-chain reputation and delivering real infrastructure value. RSI: Hovering near 61, suggesting moderate momentum with room for a breakout Price Prediction: $175 short term; $212 possible if ETF speculation materializes Cardano (ADA): Quiet But Consistent Cardano has long played the long game — and it’s beginning to pay off. The blockchain’s focus on sustainability, scalability, and academic rigor is once again drawing investor attention. Trading near $0.68 , ADA has room to climb, with analysts citing a potential move to $1.10–$1.20 if current momentum holds through Q2. RSI: Currently at 57, signaling accumulation phase Price Prediction: Targets range from $0.95 to $1.20 by late Q2 XRP: Post-Rally Consolidation with More to Come XRP has held steady above $2 , following a wave of institutional interest and expanding utility in cross-border settlements. With legal overhangs now largely behind it, XRP’s upside is tied to real adoption — and many believe it could reclaim past highs if market sentiment continues to improve. RSI: Near 64, slightly overbought but maintaining bullish structure Price Prediction: $2.40–$2.65 short term; potential for $3+ with volume confirmation MAGACOIN FINANCE: Still Early, Still Undervalued While the big three command the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly attracting early-stage investors looking for meaningful upside. Trading below $0.001 and available only via magacoinfinance.com , the project is entering Stage 7 with strong momentum. With a projected listing target of $0.007 , built-in scarcity, and a 50% token bonus via promo code MAGA50X , analysts say this setup mirrors the early conditions of breakout projects like SHIB and PEPE. Coins launched from similar structures have delivered 18,500%+ gains in previous cycles — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is building under those same principles. This isn’t the end. It’s just the beginning. And the entry window — while still open — won’t stay that way for long.

SHIBA INU and XRP , while still household names in crypto, are beginning to show signs of flattening trajectories. In their place, a rising contender is making waves: MAGACOINFINANCE , a low-cap token that’s rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in the space. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Traction With Real Backing CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT What’s setting MAGACOINFINANCE apart isn’t just its meme relevance—it’s the foundation it’s been built on. The project is gaining attention thanks to fast-moving presale demand, a strong on-chain presence, and clear alignment with the cultural and political narratives defining this year’s crypto discussions. Why Traders Are Watching MAGACOINFINANCE Closely: Smart Contract Already Live : The contract is deployed and operational on-chain, offering transparency from the start. Audit Completed by HashEx : This provides additional trust, especially among cautious investors. Community-Focused Tokenomics : 45% of the supply is allocated directly to public buyers—giving retail real ownership. Structured Scarcity : With stage-based pricing and a fixed supply, urgency is building at each step. High ROI Forecasts : Analysts are suggesting 25x to 35x upside potential based on branding, positioning, and presale momentum. Combined, these elements make MAGACOINFINANCE a standout among smaller-cap projects poised for a strong performance. SHIBA and XRP Still Matter—But Are They Slowing Down? SHIBA INU , currently priced around $0.00001340 , is experiencing more sideways movement. Without major ecosystem updates, explosive movement may be delayed. XRP , hovering near $2.22 , has clarity post-SEC case and ETF discussions in motion. However, its large market cap may limit further exponential moves. Both are solid holdings, but for traders seeking the type of early-stage leverage that defined the 2021 and 2017 cycles, the next breakout may lie elsewhere. The Final Word: MAGACOINFINANCE Is Catching Fire Before the Crowd Arrives LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X For investors searching for the next breakout meme-inspired token with real structural support, MAGACOINFINANCE checks every box: Verified contract and third-party security audit Presale economics designed to reward early entrants Political relevance that naturally drives viral traction Strong demand already showing in the pace of sale completions While SHIBA and XRP maintain their footholds, the momentum is clearly shifting.

Pi Coin is now nearing the important $1 mark. With exciting updates ahead, Pi is on track to become a major player, where users can mine and trade Pi like never before. Here are the steps you need to follow to buy and sell Pi Coins. How To Buy Pi Coin? Choose an Exchange: Pick a well-known and trusted exchange that supports Pi Coin trading. As of May 2025, you can find Pi Coin (PI) on platforms like OKX, MEXC, BitMart, Bitget, KuCoin, and Bybit. Sign Up and Complete KYC: Register on the exchange and complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, depending on the region, by submitting necessary identification documents. Deposit funds in your account using available methods or other payment options supported by the exchange. Next, search for “Pi Coin” or “PI” on the exchange platform. Select the appropriate trading pair (e.g., PI/USD, PI/USDT, or PI/ETH). Place an Order: Choose your order type (market or limit), enter the amount of Pi Coin you want to purchase, and confirm the transaction. For extra security, you can transfer your Pi Coins to a personal wallet and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your account. How To Sell Pi Coins? If you have a Pi account and have migrated your coins to the Mainnet, you are ready to sell the coins. You’ll also need the Pi Browser app to create a Pi Wallet and complete your KYC verification. Further, if you plan to hold the funds after selling, you can move them to a non-custodial wallet for better security. Create an Account – Sign up on a trusted exchange that supports Pi and complete the KYC verification process. Make sure to avoid the exchanges that Pi Network community has not recognised officially. Find Your Trading Pair – Search for the particular Pi trading pair like PI/USDT, PI/EUR, or PI/BTC. Place A Sell Order – Next, place a sell order. In case of a market order, you can sell instantly at the current market price. In a limit order, you can set a specific price and wait for it to be matched. Withdrawal – Once your order is complete, the balance will usually be updated in USDT or the base currency. You can then choose to withdraw to a crypto wallet, convert to fiat, or swap to another crypto. Tips When Choosing an Exchange Look for low trading fees and small price spreads (difference between buy and sell prices). Pick platforms with high trading volume and strong liquidity, so trades go through quickly and at good prices. Avoid exchanges not officially recognized by the Pi Network community.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-11 04:06:02

That stash is valued at roughly $52.66 million across multiple exchange platforms. When so much enters exchanges all at once, it can trigger massive price movements and increased volatility. Traders indicate they’re paying close attention to order books to determine if prices will fall. Meme-coin community tension is building.

Combined with previous deposits, over $24 million worth of TRUMP tokens flowed onto exchanges in recent days. Chain observers noted the timing, as the activity preceded a high-profile political reception on May 22. Some investors are concerned it is a sign of a group exit strategy among large holders. Others point out that market makers will frequently swap tokens to hedge against risk and balance order books. Either situation keeps eyes fixed on the next giant transfer.

44459267,https://invezz.com/?p=2713517,1746938704,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Solana price prediction: is SOL a coiled spring ready to pounce?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/11/solana-price-prediction-is-sol-a-coiled-spring-ready-to-pounce/,"Solana price has recovered this month, making it one of the best-performing coins in the crypto industry. It jumped to a high of $180 on Saturday, and is hovering at its highest level since March this year. It has spiked by almost 90% from its lowest point this year. This article explores why the SOL price may be a coiled spring ready to pounce. Solana meme coins are rebounding One of the top reasons why the SOL price is about to surge is that Solana meme coins have gone parabolic in the past few days. Official Trump Coin price has surged by 29% in the last seven days, while Bonk, Fartcoin, Dogwifhat , Pudgy Penguins, and Popcat have all soared by double digits. This recovery has brought the market cap of all Solana meme coins to $13.1 billion, up from $6 billion a few weeks ago. It is a sign that these tokens will always do well when there is a rally in the crypto market. The surge in these meme coins helps to boost Solana’s sentiment, and boosting its ecosystem revenue and fees. Data shows that the volume handled by decentralized exchange protocols on Solana rose by 7% in the last seven days to over $21.7 billion, bringing th 30-day figure to $80 billion. Solana’s network handled more assets than Ethereum and BSC, which handled $51 billion and $35 billion, respectively. SOL stablecoin market cap is soaring Stablecoins are the currencies that people use in the cryptocurrency industry since one cannot use fiat currencies like the US dollar and the euro. Therefore, one of the top metrics to look at when evaluating a cryptocurrency’s growth is the stablecoin market cap. Solana has one of the most active stablecoin presence, with their market cap jumping to over $12 billion. While this figure is smaller than Ethereum’s $215 billion and Tron’s $73 billion, it is a sign that it is growing. Similarly, the total value locked (TVL) in th Solana ecosystem has jumped to almost $10 billion today. All these factors have contributed to the robust fees that Solana has made this year. Data shows that Solana has made $710 million this year, making it the third-most profitable network in the crypto industry after Tether and Tron. It has beaten Ethereum, which has made $616 million. Staked Solana inflows is rising Further, investors have pumped over 7 million SOL tokens worth $1 billion to Solana staking pools, bringing the total staking market cap to almost $70 billion. This growth has brought the staking ratio to 65%. The rising demand is a sign that investors will also allocate money to spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) when they are approved by the SEC. JPMorgan analysts predicts that these funds will attract over $6 billion in inflows in the first year. A key driver for this ETF inflow is that the SEC may approve staking in these ETFs, making them more viable than the existing Ethereum funds. Solana price prediction SOL price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the SOL price has staged a strong comeback in the past few weeks, rising from a low of $94 to $180 today. Solana has already moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has also jumped above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Also, the MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have continued rising. Therefore, the coin will likely keep rising as bulls target the 61.8% retracement point at $220. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to $300.

The cryptocurrency community is celebrating, with massive trading volume, bullish sentiment, and hints of major developments on the brink. The next resistance levels for Pi are set at $1.00, followed by $1.40, while support currently sits around $0.80. Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin shared that the Pi Network team will make a big announcement on May 14, 2025. This date is important because it’s the same day the Consensus Summit 2025 begins in Toronto, where Pi’s founder, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, will be speaking. The analyst believes this news could be very good for Pi’s price. He predicts that Pi could reach $1 by May 14, go up to $2 by the end of August, and maybe reach $2 to $5 by the end of the year. Binance Listing Soon? According to on-chain data, a mysterious wallet made a massive purchase of 70 million PI from OKX, pushing its total holdings to 155 million PI—more than any other wallet on active exchanges. This activity has sparked speculation that a big centralized exchange (CEX) might be preparing to list Pi Coin. These patterns mirror previous movements seen before major exchange listings, and the timing aligns with increased activity on the Pi Blockchain and preparations for KYB (Know Your Business) compliance—a requirement for official listings. Community Excitement and Expansion The Pi Network ecosystem is also expanding, and community hype is at an all-time high. With Pi already ranked among the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap on CoinGecko, many believe this is just the beginning. The Pi community is now wondering: Which exchange will list Pi next?

On a daily scale alone, the asset is up by more than 30%, begging the question what’s driving this spectacular pump. It was just over a month ago when PI plunged to $0.4, which became the aforementioned ATL, amid massive token unlocks, market uncertainty, and FUD against the project behind it. It bounced off in the following weeks but still remained in a tight range around $0.6. PI finally shot above that level at the end of last week, gaining 20% daily on Friday. Naturally, such moves attract people’s attention, and analysts and popular commentators started providing big price predictions of $1 and all the way to $5. Interestingly, the smaller target was reached earlier today when PI soared by 35% at one point and tapped $1 for the first time in close to two months. On a weekly scale, the asset has soared a mind-blowing 64%. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko There’s no evident reason behind this surge besides a possible hype growing from an upcoming announcement set for next week (May 14). As reported before, there are speculations about a big exchange listing, perhaps on Binance. Another possibility could again be linked to a hype rally as one of Pi Network’s founders, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, is expected to speak at this years large crypto conference – Consensus, which is also taking place next week (May 14 – 16) in Toronto. Moon Jeff, an analyst frequently talking about PI, noted that many “unknown entities,” including BANXA, continue to accumulate Pi Network’s token, which could also be a culprit for price increases. However, his information remains unverified. BANXA is buying millions of $PI PCT is buying back. Unknown entities are accumulating millions of $PI . Exchange withdrawals are more than deposits.

The tweet reads, “I PREDICT A MASSIVE $XRP CRASH TO $10 IN 2025,” accompanied by a video in which Farina explained, citing historical market behavior, current trends in Bitcoin dominance, and ongoing developments in institutional adoption. I PREDICT A MASSIVE $XRP CRASH TO $10 IN 2025 pic.twitter.com/np1v5kmWYv — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 9, 2025 Early XRP Performance Signals Market Shift In the video, Farina addresses the speculative nature of the current crypto market and emphasizes that this cycle has unfolded differently than previous ones. He pointed out that XRP has already reached over $2 at a time when Bitcoin dominance remains high, indicating what he sees as an early performance surge for XRP. According to Farina, historically, altcoin rallies begin when Bitcoin dominance drops to around 30% to 40%. He argued that despite his skepticism of the term “alt season,” the data indicates XRP has performed uniquely early compared to previous cycles. Legal Clarity and Institutional Momentum Farina explained that XRP’s position in this market cycle signals a broader transition, where speculation increasingly overlaps with real-world financial adoption. He noted that XRP is no longer under legal uncertainty, referring to the conclusion of the SEC lawsuit and a recent injunction that allows Ripple to sell XRP to financial institutions. He believes this development lays the groundwork for a substantial increase in XRP’s value, potentially leading to a 4x growth from current levels. ETF Growth and Ripple’s Strategic Acquisitions Edo Farina projected that such an increase would push XRP to at least $10 in 2025. However, Farina stressed that exceeding that level would require widespread adoption by financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He attributed the potential for this outcome to several factors, including Ripple’s expanding involvement in traditional finance, its acquisition of players like Hidden Road , and rumors of a possible acquisition of Circle . Additionally, he referenced the growing demand for XRP-backed ETFs as a significant signal of market interest and institutional confidence. Looking Ahead to 2025 and Beyond According to Farina, combining legal clarity, institutional involvement, and the accelerating tokenization of real-world assets is central to XRP’s future valuation. He mentioned that financial infrastructure developments, including Ripple’s involvement in digital currency rollouts like the Digital Euro, should be monitored closely. In addressing his followers directly, Farina asked, “How much will 1000 XRP coins be worth in 2025?” He stated that if XRP reaches $10, a holder of 1000 coins would have $10,000. He also speculated that if XRP reached $100, the same holding would be worth $100,000, which he described as potentially life-changing. Farina concluded by encouraging XRP holders to target higher accumulation levels, suggesting that holding 10,000 XRP would provide greater strategic flexibility in taking profits. Farina ended his video with a light-hearted note, stating that he plans to throw a yachting party in Mykonos when XRP hits $10 and invited followers to submit their names to be included on the guest list. While his predictions remain speculative, his analysis reflects a strong belief in XRP’s potential based on emerging financial adoption trends and institutional developments.

The trend is led by none other than the largest of them all – Ethereum, which has soared by another 8% in the past day, and trades well above $2,500. ETH’s Roll Continues ETH’s price plunged hard just over a month ago as it dropped to its lowest levels in over a year on April 9 at $1,400. It managed to bounce off in the following weeks but still struggled to reclaim $1,800 decisively. After the latest positive macro developments and the Pectra upgrade , its price finally started to climb hard. On a daily scale, ETH has soared by nearly 9%, but its weekly surge is a lot more impressive – almost 40%. This has put its price tag at well above the psychological resistance of $2,500. Many altcoins have followed suit with notable price increases as well. DOGE is in a league of its own from the larger ones, having surged by over 16% and now trading above $0.24. ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, HBAR, TON, and PEPE are other impressive examples. PI , UNI, and NEAR have also had double-digit price pumps over the past day, while LEO is among the few in the red.

Source: QuantifyCrypto Bitcoin Back to $104K Although BTC is still in the green on a daily scale, its increase is a lot more modest. BTC has jumped by less than 1% and trades above $104,000 after it was stopped at $105,000 earlier. On a weekly scale, though, bitcoin has jumped by almost 9%. It finally managed to break through the $100,000 barrier this week for the first time in over three months. However, its dominance over the alts has taken a big hit. Recall that the metric was riding high at roughly 62% just until several days ago but has dropped to under 60% as of now.

The token jumped to a high of $0.97, up by 145% from its lowest level in April. It is now hovering at its highest point since March 25. So, why is the Pi Coin price rising and how high can it go? Why Pi Network price is rising There are three main reasons why the Pi Network price has gone parabolic this weekend. The most important one is that the crypto fear and greed index continues rising and is now at the greed zone of 75. A rising greed index is always a sign of a risk-on sentiment among investors, which leads to higher prices. This sentiment has led to higher Bitcoin and altcoin prices. Bitcoin has jumped above $104,000 and is within touching distance of hitting its all-time high of $109,300. Similarly, Ethereum rose above $2,500 for the first time since February on Saturday. Consensus event and key announcement Second, the Pi Coin price is surging because of the upcoming Consensus event in Toronto, where senior executives and policymakers will gather. Nikolas Kokkidis, Pi Network’s co-founder, will be one of the speakers. In an X post last week, the developers promised a major announcement during the Consensus event. As the news is yet to be revealed, analysts are speculating that this announcement will be a listing by one or more centralized exchanges like Binance or HTX.

Tune in to find out what’s coming next! 2:48 AM · May 8, 2025 20.5K Reply Copy link Read 2.7K replies An exchange listing would be a good thing as it would make it more available to millions of investors from around the world. Historically, cryptocurrency prices go parabolic when large centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Upbit list them. The other likely scenario is where Pi Network’s developers announce a major partnership with a big company, which would also be a positive thing. Another potential Pi Network news will be the launch of an ecosystem fund to incentivize developers to build applications on its network. That would be an encouraging thing since most of the existing Pi Network dApps have not gained traction among users. Read more: Solana price prediction: is SOL a coiled spring ready to pounce? Key challenges remain Pi Network price road to recovery faces several obstacles. The first one is that it is a highly centralized coin that the Core Team fully controls. This likely explains why most centralized exchanges have avoided it this year. The risk is that a highly centralized coin can crash as Mantra did in April. Mantra’s price crashed by over 90% within a 24-hour period. While the developers blamed forced liquidations for this, analysts pointed to increased token dumps by insiders, who made billions of dollars. The other potential risk it is facing is the growing supply as token unlocks continue. Pi Network will unlock over 1.4 billion tokens in the next 12 months, adding to its supply, and diluting existing holders.

It found a strong bottom at $0.5572, a level it failed to drop below since April this year. Pi Coin price formed a double-bottom pattern and has now moved above the neckline at $0.79. It has also jumped above the 50-period moving average, a sign that bulls are coming back online. Most notably, Pi Coin has been in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, pointing to an eventual rebound. It will initially jump to $1, and then continue its recovery to the next key resistance level at $1.80. It will eventually soar to $3.

Crypto enthusiast and market analyst Edo Farina recently made a compelling case for why holding just 1,000 XRP could be one of the most impactful financial moves an investor can make. Farina’s prediction, grounded in data and market dynamics, highlights why XRP may soon emerge as a game-changer. A Unique Market Cycle Farina says the current crypto market cycle stands out from previous ones. Unlike past cycles, when Bitcoin’s dominance rapidly declined, this time, Bitcoin’s dominance remains unusually high. Farina points out that when Bitcoin’s dominance eventually drops to around 40%, the much-anticipated alt season will kick off. In this phase, XRP is expected to surge, potentially outpacing many other assets due to its performance during the current cycle. Holding just 1,000 $XRP might be the best financial decision of your lifetime. How Much Will 1,000 XRP be worth in 2025? Full Video: https://t.co/ecm1WbyDBh pic.twitter.com/mtnac1YMMi — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 9, 2025 XRP’s Promising Position XRP has already shown strong bullish momentum this cycle, distinguishing itself as one of the top performers despite market uncertainties. Farina emphasizes that this cycle represents a unique intersection of speculative trading and financial adoption. The recent regulatory clarity around XRP, especially following the settlement agreement filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), adds to its appeal. This clarity reaffirms that XRP is not a security and opens the door for Ripple to sell XRP to financial institutions. The Road to Institutional Adoption One of the most promising factors driving XRP’s potential is its path to mainstream adoption. Farina notes that the next big catalyst for XRP’s price movement is the decline of Bitcoin’s market dominance below 40%. When that threshold is crossed, it could ignite a new wave of altcoin enthusiasm, placing XRP at the forefront. The asset’s status as the only fully regulated cryptocurrency in the United States makes it particularly attractive for institutional adoption. Additionally, there is increasing interest in XRP ETFs, significantly boosting their investment profile. The potential for XRP to be incorporated into financial products could expand its utility and, by extension, its market valuation. Farina also highlights Ripple’s strategic acquisitions, including purchasing established financial entities like Hidden Road . Should Ripple acquire Circle and secure further ETF approvals, it would mark a pivotal moment, drastically impacting XRP’s price trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Calculating the Future Value The numbers presented by Farina are compelling. If XRP achieves a price of $10 by 2025, a modest holding of 1,000 tokens would be worth $10,000 . However, if institutional adoption accelerates and XRP reaches $100, the same 1,000 tokens could be valued at $100,000. Such a scenario would undoubtedly be life-changing for early adopters and long-term holders. Why 1,000 XRP Matters The idea of holding 1,000 XRP as a strategic move stems from its combination of affordability and potential for exponential growth. As XRP becomes increasingly integrated into financial systems and more ETFs are approved, the demand for XRP could skyrocket. Holding a modest number of tokens now could yield substantial financial returns in just a few years. Farina’s analysis underscores the potential of XRP as not just a speculative asset but a cornerstone in the evolving financial landscape. With regulatory clarity, increasing institutional interest, and strategic acquisitions by Ripple, XRP’s future looks increasingly promising. While no investment is without risk, holding 1,000 XRP today could be a defining financial decision for many investors.

Analysts see echoes of 2020 boom,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/11/is-mutm-the-sleeper-hit-of-2025-analysts-see-echoes-of-2020-boom/,"Back in 2020, the crypto world saw quiet, undervalued tokens explode seemingly overnight — often after months of development with little fanfare. Analysts who had their eye on these projects early ended up spotting some of the most impressive growth stories in recent years. Fast forward to now, and that same energy is starting to build around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a new project that’s not in the spotlight yet, but is gaining growing interest among those who recognize early potential. Trading at just $0.025, MUTM is still flying under the radar. As its presale gains momentum, core features continue to take shape, and future price projections remain promising, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most quietly compelling cryptocurrency opportunities on the market right now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is now progressing through Phase 4 of its 11-stage presale, and the pace of participation continues to accelerate. With over 66% of this round already completed, momentum is clearly building. The project has already raised $7.8 million and attracted more than 9,600 holders, pointing to growing interest even before launch. Once Phase 4 wraps up, the token price rises to $0.03, and will continue increasing in later stages until it hits a launch price of $0.06. But that’s just the beginning. Analysts are forecasting that shortly after launch, MUTM could surge to $0.28, based on projected demand and protocol usage. That’s more than a 1,000% increase from its current price — a gain that naturally drives FOMO among early investors. For those searching for the next big crypto, the opportunity to enter before the market catches on is getting narrower by the day. Part of the reason analysts are watching Mutuum so closely is its focus on building real infrastructure — not just spinning up another token with vague promises. The project is centered around decentralized lending and borrowing, allowing users to either earn yield on deposited crypto or unlock liquidity through overcollateralized loans. But beyond the basics, Mutuum is building for the future by integrating with Layer 2 solutions. This gives the protocol a key advantage: low transaction costs and faster processing, especially important as on-chain activity grows. By launching directly on a Layer 2 network like Arbitrum, Mutuum positions itself as a faster, more efficient alternative to legacy DeFi platforms still struggling with gas fees and congestion. What adds a deeper level of utility to the Mutuum ecosystem is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which plays a central role in how the protocol operates. Users who borrow from the platform can mint this stablecoin by locking up collateral, ensuring that every token issued is backed by more value than it represents. This stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar algorithmically, with its supply constantly adjusted based on minting and burning activities. When users repay their loans or when positions are liquidated, the stablecoin is burned — helping keep its value steady and its circulation under control. What makes this model more than just a standard borrowing tool is that the interest paid on these loans flows directly back into the protocol, strengthening its treasury and funding broader operations. This type of self-sustaining model is what draws attention from seasoned analysts — where platform activity generates value, and that value, in turn, fuels continued expansion. What further strengthens MUTM’s long-term outlook is its built-in token acquisition model, which uses a share of the platform’s revenue to consistently repurchase MUTM from the open market and cycle it back to active participants. Those tokens are then distributed to users who participate in the system by staking their deposit tokens. This creates an ongoing cycle of buy pressure, reinforcing token demand over time. As the platform’s adoption grows and more users participate in lending and borrowing, this mechanism has the potential to consistently push MUTM’s price upward — especially in the early months after launch, when usage spikes and liquidity flows into the ecosystem. MUTM isn’t a token built around buzz — it’s a developing ecosystem backed by working mechanics, smart incentives, and real growth potential. With its presale progressing rapidly and a projected post-launch price surge to $0.28, the numbers alone are enough to draw attention. But it’s the combination of stablecoin integration, Layer 2 scalability, and token-driven yield that makes it a standout among current DeFi entrants. For those wondering what crypto to invest in, this could be the kind of early-stage opportunity that doesn’t come around often. Just like in 2020, some of the biggest wins came from recognizing real value before it became obvious. MUTM might be one of those tokens — and the market is starting to notice.

44460244,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66867,1746942623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance: Expert Says Mega Dump Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-dominance-expert-says-mega-dump-is-coming/,"In the ever-volatile world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin dominance has long served as a key indicator of market sentiment. Recently, crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto has raised alarms about a potential seismic shift, forecasting a significant drop in Bitcoin’s market dominance. According to EGRAG, this upcoming downturn could mark the beginning of one of the most explosive altseasons in crypto history. The Imminent Fall of Bitcoin Dominance EGRAG Crypto’s analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency market is on the verge of a major realignment. The chart patterns he observes indicate a drastic reduction in Bitcoin’s dominance, which has historically been a precursor to a massive rally among altcoins. Bitcoin Dominance — The Coming Mega Dump! YOU ARE NOT #BULLISH ENOUGH The chart signals we’re about to witness the greatest drop in #BTC Dominance! This move will be so huge, your wildest dreams can’t fully imagine the profits in this #AltSeason that you will make.… pic.twitter.com/cMnpdHuGsp — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 9, 2025 As Bitcoin’s influence wanes, altcoins like XRP often see a surge in capital inflow, leading to significant price movements. According to EGRAG, the scale of this impending drop is unprecedented, and the ensuing altseason could generate profits that even seasoned traders might find hard to envision. The Bubble Will Burst: Strategic Profit-Taking While bullish sentiment dominates the discussion, EGRAG warns investors to remain cautious and strategic. Every market bubble, no matter how promising, eventually bursts. He emphasizes the importance of locking in profits during the peak moments of the altseason to avoid the inevitable downturn that follows. In his view, the so-called “blow-off top” is on the horizon, and traders must step back before the crash takes hold. When the bubble does pop, EGRAG advises seizing the opportunity to buy assets that will survive the market purge. Among his recommended picks are cryptos with strong use cases, operating assets like real estate, and commodities like gold. This diversified approach aims to mitigate risk while capitalizing on post-bubble recovery phases. Gold as a Strategic Investment EGRAG also shares his perspective on gold, predicting that the precious metal will play a pivotal role in the economic landscape during the next financial downturn. He sets a strategic buying target for gold when its price dips below $2,300, specifically aiming for a range between $1,850 and $2,000. This calculated move aligns with his broader strategy of acquiring assets with long-term value once speculative bubbles burst.

He stresses the importance of remaining alert and flexible, ready to capitalize on both the upside of altseason and the downside of a market correction. For seasoned traders and newcomers alike, the key takeaway is to secure profits during bullish runs and prepare for the subsequent market cooldown. EGRAG Crypto’s warning about the coming mega dump in Bitcoin dominance serves as both a caution and an opportunity. While the allure of massive altcoin gains is undeniable, it is essential to remain vigilant and strategically positioned. By balancing speculative moves with sound investments in tangible assets like gold and real estate, traders can navigate the impending volatility more confidently. As always, a well-thought-out approach can make the difference between capitalizing on market movements and getting caught in the crash.

A decisive break and sustained move above this long-term indicator could signal a significant trend reversal, effectively marking the end of BONK’s prolonged bearish phase. CryptoS6 emphasizes that reclaiming this level would validate bullish momentum and reestablish buyer dominance, setting the stage for an extended rally. Breaking The Long-Term SMA: Why This Level Matters In a recent update on X, popular crypto analyst CryptoS6 pointed out that BONK is flashing signs of a significant technical shift. The price is currently testing the 200-day SMA at $0.0000238, an area widely regarded as a major trend-defining level. Reclaiming this zone would mark BONK’s first serious bullish reversal since early Q1, signaling that buyers are regaining control after months of sideways or bearish pressure. Such a shift in control could ignite renewed investor interest and set the stage for an extended rally. Related Reading: BONK Symmetrical Triangle Squeeze: Is A Mega Breakout Imminent? What makes the setup even more interesting is the minimal resistance standing between the current price and the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0000348. According to CryptoS6, this area often becomes a magnet for breakout-driven momentum, creating room for swift upward moves. If BONK can firmly close above the 200-day SMA, the probability of a stronger rally increases dramatically, as traders are likely to pile in behind the move. CryptoS6 didn’t hold back from making a bold projection either. He suggested that BONK’s chart is setting the stage for what could be a “God Candle” explosive move, a vertical price move that would rapidly push he token from $0.000025 to $0.00004. BONK 3-Way Confirmation: Volume, Trend & History Say ‘Go’ CryptoS6 firmly emphasized that a combination of growing volume, strong trend alignment, and striking historical pattern symmetry reinforces the case for a major breakout in BONK. The recent surge in volume is not just noise; it reflects increasing market participation and suggests that accumulation is underway, often a precursor to a significant price move. Meanwhile, BONK’s price action is aligning with key moving averages, particularly as it eyes a reclaim of the 200-day SMA, a critical indicator of long-term trend shifts.

In conclusion, CryptoS6 described the setup as “clean,” meaning the chart offers a well-defined structure and reliable levels for both entry and risk management.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed to a peak of $104,900 on Saturday evening—just about 4% below its all-time high—following President Donald Trump’s announcement of progress in U.S.-China trade talks during a meeting in Switzerland. “A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,” Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform. “Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” Bitcoin rallied on the heels of the news. Source: CoinGecko By early Sunday morning, the top cryptocurrency by volume hovered around $103,985. And yet, altcoins managed to grab the spotlight as well. At last check, Ethereum marked one of its strongest daily performances in recent weeks, while meme coins roared back to life. See below.

Analysts interpret this as a sign of capital rotation into altcoins, suggesting the onset of an “altcoin season.” The ETH/BTC ratio has rebounded from its lowest levels since 2020, further supporting this trend. Meanwhile, top U.S. and Chinese economic officials are expected to meet in Geneva for a second round of high-stakes trade talks to ease tensions from Trump’s escalating trade war. The conflict has already led to steep tariffs—145% on Chinese goods and 125% on U.S. exports—disrupting global supply chains and prompting companies to seek alternatives. According to the New York Times, economists warn the ongoing dispute could slow global growth, raise inflation, and push the U.S. toward a recession.

Let’s break it down. On March 2, 2025, President Trump posted a statement on social media announcing his support for the U.S. “crypto strategic reserve” that would include XRP, Solana, and Cardano. In the post, he criticized the Biden administration’s handling of crypto and pledged to make the U.S. the global crypto leader. However, less than 24 hours later, the post was deleted. According to a various reports, Trump may have been misled into making the announcement by a lobbyist named Brian Ballard, who reportedly gave Trump the wording for the post. Ballard is said to have ties to Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP. Once Trump found out about the connection, he was reportedly furious and cut ties with Ballard. Despite this incident, there is no official statement or evidence that Trump has “blacklisted” XRP or that the digital asset is under any kind of ban or restriction from Trump or his team. It appears more like a misunderstanding and personal frustration rather than a formal policy stance. For the unversed, Ripple has had past political connections, including donations to Trump-aligned political committees. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer and CEO have both reportedly met with Trump in the past. So, while the deleted post and Trump’s reaction have caused a stir, XRP is not blacklisted, and there is no sign of a formal fallout. In fact, the coin continues to perform in the market, and some analysts still see it as a strong contender in the current crypto cycle. You are on top of things. The SEC agreed for the fine to be reduced from $125 million to $50 million and the SEC agreed to the permanent injunction being lifted. Yep, Trump is furious https://t.co/aBRL4R6pr3 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 10, 2025 To add to the drama, attorney Bill Morgan reacted to the news on X (formerly Twitter) and laughed it off. He wrote, “You are on top of things. The SEC agreed for the fine to be reduced from $125 million to $50 million and the SEC agreed to the permanent injunction being lifted. Yep, Trump is furious.” Conclusion: Trump may have been upset about being associated with XRP without his full understanding, but there is no evidence he has blacklisted or banned XRP. The situation also shows the growing influence of crypto lobbyists — and the risks of political entanglement in the fast-moving digital asset world.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-11 06:10:17

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-buy-signal-flashes-heres-the-implication/,"The XRP community is abuzz with excitement as the SuperTrend indicator has recently flashed a buy signal for the digital asset. This development was highlighted by prominent crypto analyst Ali, who shared the news on X, emphasizing the potential for a bullish momentum in the coming days. The SuperTrend indicator is a popular tool among traders, designed to identify the prevailing market trend and signal potential buy or sell opportunities. It works by calculating average price movements over a specified period and overlaying the results on the chart. When the indicator turns green, it signals a buying opportunity, while a red signal indicates a potential downtrend. The SuperTrend indicator just flashed a buy signal for $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/I6X7crn1zE — Ali (@ali_charts) May 10, 2025 In the case of XRP, the appearance of the buy signal indicates that the asset may be entering a new upward phase , sparking optimism among investors. Historically, the SuperTrend indicator has proven effective in capturing trend reversals, making it a key tool for both retail and institutional traders. The Significance of a Buy Signal A buy signal from the SuperTrend indicator is considered a positive sign, as it suggests that buying pressure is increasing and that the asset could experience further price appreciation. In the case of XRP, this signal comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is experiencing heightened volatility, making it a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset. Ali’s post on X underscores the importance of this signal, as it could encourage both short-term traders and long-term holders to consider increasing their positions. Given the SuperTrend’s track record in forecasting price movements, this buy signal could indicate that XRP is poised for a rally, especially if broader market conditions remain favorable. Factors Supporting XRP’s Bullish Outlook Several factors could amplify XRP’s potential upswing following this signal. First, the ongoing positive sentiment surrounding Ripple’s legal case against the SEC has boosted investor confidence. Additionally, increased adoption and strategic partnerships continue to enhance XRP’s utility as a bridge asset in cross-border transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, with the cryptocurrency market in a state of flux, assets like XRP that demonstrate resilience and positive technical indicators are drawing attention from traders looking for promising opportunities. If XRP manages to sustain buying pressure, it could solidify its position as one of the leading altcoins during the next market cycle. Caution Amid Optimism While the buy signal is promising, traders are advised to remain cautious. Market dynamics can shift rapidly, and relying solely on one indicator may lead to misleading conclusions. It is essential to consider other technical factors and fundamental news that could influence XRP’s price trajectory. Monitoring support and resistance levels, as well as keeping an eye on market sentiment, will provide a more comprehensive trading strategy. The SuperTrend buy signal for XRP, as highlighted by Ali, is undeniably a development worth noting. It reflects a shift towards bullish sentiment, at least in the short term. However, prudent trading practices, such as diversifying indicators and staying updated on news affecting Ripple and XRP, will help investors navigate the potential volatility ahead. As always, thorough research and cautious optimism remain essential in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading.

These tokens are set to undergo the best shifts as they begin to shape to catch the attention of investors in the market. This article will look at the potential of these tokens and the factors that could push them to the predicted highs. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has stolen headlines with its claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during its presale phase. So far, the token has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, with the price of the $XTZ token standing at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will rise to $0.005, meaning that investors who participated early in the project could secure massive gains. After the presale, $ XYZ will also be listed on centralized and decentralized exchanges. While the team has yet to disclose the details, they have released a teaser as they prepare for the big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for investors who are looking for big profits–the relentless, the ambitious, and the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin built for the true fighters–a mindset that athletes and sports fans believe in. $XYZ is the token for experienced investors chasing the next big thing in the crypto sector. Central to the XYZVerse story is its prized fighter in the meme coin arena, XYZepe. It has been battling hard to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next SHIB or DOGE? Only time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community is in charge of things. Active participants earn rewards for their activities, with the team allocating 10% of the total token supply, which is around 10 billion $XYZ for airdrops, making it one of the biggest in the industry. The project also has good tokenomics, which consists of listings on CEX and DEX, regular token burns, and making $XYZ built for a run at the championship. Every move is designed to help the token, driving its price high with help from its community that knows that it is the start of something good. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Unlocking AI for Everyone: The Promise of Fetch.ai Founded in 2017, Fetch.ai wants to make artificial intelligence accessible to everybody. The platform allows access to secure datasets using AI agents through its open and decentralized machine learning network. These agents carry out different tasks across several industries, as well as improving travel systems. In essence, Fetch.ai wants to simplify all digital systems that use large-scale data. In the current market cycle, Fetch.ai stands out due to its mission of making AI accessible to everyone. As the demand for AI and machine learning continues to rise, platforms offering these sorts of services will continue to see increased interest. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, investors are now shifting to projects that are adopting new technologies like AI. The mix of AI and blockchain makes Fetch.ai one of the best tokens in the market. Render Token: Powering the Future of Graphics with Decentralized GPUs Render Token (RENDER) is changing things for creators in search of high-powered graphics rendering. The project allows users to tap into a decentralized network of GPUs, which helps artists render power efficiently at lower costs. Node operators are also allowed to contribute spare GPU capacity to the network, allowing them to earn RENDER tokens in return. This system supports animation, motion graphics, and visual effects, helping creators globally access unused computing power. In the current market, Render Token stands out because of its uses in the digital content industry. With the growing demand for high-quality in gaming, virtual reality, and film, RENDER provides a cheap solution. In comparison to tokens that are not usable in the real world, its focus on solving global issues gives it an edge. The move towards decentralization also supports its value creation, making it a good option for investors looking for the best projects. Ondo Finance: Bridging Real-World Assets and Blockchain for Safer, Smarter Investing Ondo Finance is changing the game by mixing traditional finance with blockchain technology. The project turns stable and income-generating assets into digital assets, making them products that can be accessible to the people. Investors can also earn profits while enjoying the benefits of blockchain technology. Ondo is set out to create tokenized financial products and build DeFi protocols to ensure the products reach a global audience. In a market where users prioritize trust and security, Ondo stands out by teaming up with popular firms like BlackRock and using Coinbase for custody. Their product USDY combines the stability of traditional assets with the accessibility of stablecoins backed by bank deposits and US Treasuries. This approach ensures things are regulated and transparent for investors outside the United States. Ondo’s focus on real-world assets makes it an attractive choice in the current market cycle, especially for investors looking for a blend of traditional stability and blockchain. HBAR’s Hashgraph: Redefining Speed in the Crypto World Hedera Hashgraph is changing the digital environment with its special network. Instead of using traditional blockchain, it uses hashgraph technology. This means that the project does not support mining, a move that is better for the environment and costs. This way, transactions are fast and the network can handle more load, making it the best for financial applications and smart contracts. HBAR, the native token of the network is used to pay for transactions and keeps the network secure though its PoS model. In today’s market, HBAR offers something different. It has speed and efficiency, which sets it apart from other tokens. While the token has been up against tougher competition, it is seeing support from institutional players. The technology might limit the input of its community through its patent, but it ensures security and control. As the crypto world continues to move to faster and cheaper solutions, HBAR’s approach could make it the best choice. Conclusion FET, RENDER, ONDO, and HBAR are poised for growth, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the pioneering sports memecoin uniting fans, aiming for 20,000% gains.

Weekly RSI will turn bullish this week, which endorses our… pic.twitter.com/lUoX6t27Sa — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) May 10, 2025 Key Breakout Confirmed Above $2.2222 The chart in his tweet indicates that XRP successfully surpassed the $2.2222 level and briefly reached $2.3620 before undergoing a corrective retracement to approximately $2.07. Dark Defender emphasized that the correction was anticipated and aligned with the previously defined $2 target zone. In his view, this correction has confirmed the completion of Wave 4 and paved the way for the initiation of Wave 5. Wave 5 Structure to Unfold in Sub-Waves with Interim Volatility In this context, Wave 5 is expected to follow a classic sub-wave structure, unfolding in five smaller waves as part of the upward trend. This structure implies intermittent upward and downward price movements as XRP advances toward the upper resistance range of $5.85 to $6.39. The target zones are marked in the chart with Fibonacci extension levels. The 261.8% extension lands near $5.8563, providing technical validation for the projection’s upper bound. Weekly RSI Crossover Signals Renewed Bullish Momentum Additionally, Dark Defender highlighted that the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is set to turn bullish within the current week. This observation is visually supported in the chart by a circled crossover between the RSI (purple) and its moving average (yellow), which appears to be occurring near the lower mid-range.

The chart suggests that this RSI reversal supports the thesis of an impending upward expansion in price. Analyst Maintains Confidence in Long-Term Bullish Scenario The analyst reiterated that the market should expect both upward and downward volatility during the development of the fifth wave, as is typical in sub-wave patterns. The overall direction, however, remains pointed toward higher levels within the established range. Dark Defender concluded the update confidently, asserting that the bullish market structure remains intact and that XRP is now “ready” for the next phase. His post ended with a personal message wishing his followers a good weekend, reflecting a tone of confidence and optimism.

The question is no longer whether the project has legs—it’s how far it can go as more investors pile in ahead of listing. Rather than stalling like many token sales after initial success, MAGACOINFINANCE is picking up speed —entering its most crucial phase, where visibility, stage mechanics, and early ROI positioning align to create maximum impact. Structured Demand Continues to Fuel Growth SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW Each stage of the presale is intentionally designed for scarcity. With each round closing faster than the last, demand is compounding, not cooling. And with no centralized exchange listing yet, early buyers are locking in undervalued pricing before public exposure shifts everything. The viral growth is being driven not by hype, but by strategic incentives —referral dynamics, social proof, and a growing community presence are all reinforcing the sense that this is one of the few early-phase tokens worth watching closely. $0.007 Target Signals Momentum — But the Ceiling May Be Higher The projected listing price of $0.007 is not just a goal—it’s a milestone along a broader growth arc. With current presale pricing under $0.001 , investors are looking at a base ROI of 36x . Factor in the MAGA50X bonus , which offers 50% more tokens , and the projected return reaches up to 3,745% —not hypothetical, but based on modeled projections and similar launches from previous cycles that delivered as much as 18,500%+ ROI . The setup isn’t accidental—it’s strategic. And that’s exactly why seasoned investors are paying attention. Stages 7–9 Offer Early Access Before the Surge CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST There’s a common misconception that the best moment to enter a presale is early. But with MAGACOINFINANCE , the design means Stages 7, 8, and 9 still offer exceptional positioning—especially with listings, media campaigns, and influencer coverage still ahead. At this point, it’s not about chasing momentum—it’s about securing a foothold before the project breaks wide open.

In a new episode of the All-In Podcast, Palihapitiya says he’s keeping a close watch on the price-to-book ratios of subprime lenders Capital One and Credit Acceptance. Investors use the price-to-book ratio to evaluate whether asset-heavy firms like banks are undervalued or overvalued. But the billionaire venture capitalist notes that the financial metric can also be used as an early warning signal for a potential liquidity crisis in the US. “What it shows you is the spread where Credit Acceptance is versus Capital One. And the point in bringing this up is that when you look back historically around these subprime lenders, whenever these guys start to see price to books just start to escalate and get to highs, it tends to portend a liquidity crisis. It tends to show that things are about to roll over. And from that perspective, I think there are some blinking yellow lights that the Fed needs to take seriously.” Source: All-In Podcast/YouTube The billionaire also says that the Fed can get ahead of a potential liquidity crisis by abruptly cutting rates. “Some of the most critical leading indicators, particularly around liquidity and the credit health of the American consumer are blinking yellow. So right now, they are choosing to ignore these historically useful leading indicators.” Last week, the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%, citing its dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and inflation at 2% over the long run.

Designed to accommodate newcomers and long-time followers, the post is accompanied by a comprehensive chart published on TradingView. This visual representation supports a disciplined and methodical framework intended to help investors manage potential profits while aligning their strategies with individual financial goals and risk profiles. The chart, posted on December 13, 2024, displays XRP’s historical price movements alongside Egrag’s projected “Taking Profit Region” and final “Moon Bag” zone. It also marks historical resistance levels and outlines what he calls the “NO-NO ZONE” for XRP—extreme low price ranges between $0.2874 and as low as $0.0039, where he implies buying or holding is not advisable. #XRP -Ultimate Targets and My Selling Strategy Note: This post is designed to be straightforward for newcomers and newbies.

According to the chart, the key profit-taking levels lie at the following Fibonacci targets: 1.414 ($4.4207), 1.618 ($6.3627), 1.272 ($8.3989), and 1.414 ($13.7394). The uppermost Fibonacci level noted is 1.618 at $27.8631, which he labels the “Moon Bag” range—a segment of holdings he plans to retain long-term regardless of short-term price swings. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In the attached chart, historical price spikes between 2017 and 2021 are marked with colored indicators corresponding to various market cycles, suggesting that Egrag anticipates similar explosive movements in the next phase. He emphasizes that the marked price regions between $4 and $14 form his core “Taking Profit Region.” Egrag’s Personal Selling Plan Responding to frequent messages asking about his approach, Egrag explains that his background in finance, spanning two decades in real estate, hotel investments, and billion-dollar project development, has influenced his current crypto strategies. He officially left his professional role in January 2024, and he now balances financial decisions with family responsibilities as a father of three. Egrag’s primary selling method involves a structured percentage-based exit. He intends to unlock 10% of his total XRP holdings at key price milestones. This method will continue until the asset reaches the $27–$33 range, after which he plans to retain the remainder as a long-term position. This retained portion is referred to as his “Moon Bag.” Encouragement for Individualized Strategies Although Egrag presents his plan, he also encourages followers to explore different methods suited to their risk tolerance and financial objectives. In his tweet, he lists multiple strategies, including recovering initial capital first, selling incrementally, holding for the long term , or aiming for generational wealth. He stresses that each investor must identify a strategy compatible with their unique circumstances and comfort level.

While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, early investors are shifting focus to lesser-known projects with strong fundamentals and room to grow. One such project quietly gathering momentum is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — now available at just $0.025, making it, in the eyes of many, the best cryptocurrency to buy before the market fully wakes up. Unlike projects driven by short-term noise, Mutuum is building for utility and long-term relevance. With an early-stage price, active presale, and major updates ahead, the upside is hard to ignore — especially for those tracking what cryptocurrency to invest in next. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t just another DeFi protocol. It’s a platform developed around real usage, offering decentralized lending and borrowing while creating consistent yield for participants. This foundational structure is what positions MUTM as a potential high-yield crypto and one of the strongest under-the-radar opportunities right now. Currently in Phase 4 of its presale, over $7.8 million has been raised and 9,600+ holders have already joined. More than 66% of the current round is complete, and once it closes, the token price will rise to $0.03. From there, it moves gradually to its launch price of $0.06, already representing a 140% increase from today’s level. But that’s only the beginning. Many analysts believe that, post-launch, MUTM has the potential to climb by up to 2,600%, citing strong community growth, token utility, and the rollout of a beta version of the platform at launch. How Mutuum Finance Works At the core of Mutuum’s platform is its decentralized lending model, which allows users to earn passive income or access liquidity without selling their assets. The system is structured around two key models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Users deposit assets into shared liquidity pools. The pooled assets are accessible to borrowers who provide collateral exceeding the value of the loan. Interest rates shift dynamically based on how much of the pool is being used. It’s ideal for mainstream tokens with consistent demand. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): In this setup, lenders and borrowers negotiate directly. This opens the door to trade tokens that aren’t typically included in P2C — including memecoins like DOGE or PEPE. Investors can offer or request loans using niche assets, all within the Mutuum framework. This dual model gives the protocol flexibility and reach, catering to both conservative lenders and higher-risk traders, making it more versatile than many existing DeFi options. The Next Big DeFi Crypto? The growing buzz around MUTM isn’t just coming from the community — it’s coming from crypto experts already getting involved in the presale. For some, even a modest investment of $1,000 at $0.025 would return $2,400 by launch and over $27,000 when the projected 2,600% surge plays out. These numbers aren’t based on empty speculation; they’re grounded in Mutuum’s clear roadmap, growing ecosystem, and strong fundamentals. The protocol is also undergoing a CertiK audit, one of the most respected security assessments in crypto. This audit ensures that the platform’s smart contracts are tested, verified, and ready to handle capital securely. For investors, this is a key sign that Mutuum is serious about protecting users and delivering long-term trust. Finding a well-structured project at an early valuation is increasingly rare in today’s crypto market. MUTM at $0.025 represents one of those moments. With utility in lending and borrowing, a built-in token distribution mechanism, a beta platform going live at launch, and predictions pointing toward massive upside, the opportunity is hard to overlook. As the broader market remains focused on Bitcoin’s next move, the real growth stories may be unfolding in the background. For those asking what’s the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a strong answer — and once the market catches on, this entry point might be long gone.

With Bitcoin surging above $104,000 and Ethereum reclaiming the $2,500 mark, the crypto landscape is rapidly shifting back into a bullish phase. Altcoins are waking up across the board, and HYPE is quickly emerging as one of the standouts. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month After a brief pullback, HYPE has bounced strongly off the $17.5 level—an important throwback zone that is now acting as support. The asset is regaining momentum and approaching local highs, signaling strong buyer interest and potential for further continuation. Crypto analyst Cheds shared a technical breakdown confirming this setup, noting that HYPE is displaying clean strength off its recent retrace and could be gearing up for a significant breakout if market conditions hold. As sentiment turns bullish and liquidity rotates into high-potential altcoins, HYPE is well-positioned to benefit from the renewed energy in the market. With price structure improving and key levels being reclaimed, the coming days may be critical in defining whether this move evolves into a sustained uptrend. Traders are now watching closely for follow-through as HYPE approaches its next resistance zone. HYPE Bulls Target January Highs HYPE is facing a decisive moment as price action pushes into a key supply zone near the January highs around $28. After bouncing strongly from the $17.5 throwback level, the asset has regained bullish momentum and now approaches one of the most important technical levels on its chart. This zone served as a rejection point earlier in the year, and bulls must now prove they have the strength to flip it into support. Cheds shared insights confirming the shift in momentum, noting that HYPE is showing clear strength off the $17.5 level—an area that has now acted as a successful retest following the asset’s initial breakout. The strong rebound suggests that market participants are accumulating, and momentum is beginning to build as the broader crypto market turns bullish. Across the board, sentiment is improving. HYPE is now participating in that resurgence, but faces its biggest test yet. If bulls can reclaim the $28 level with conviction, the path toward new all-time highs opens up. However, if this level holds prices again, another period of consolidation may follow. The weekend rally has pushed markets into critical zones, and HYPE’s ability to sustain upward pressure through this resistance will be closely watched. A breakout above $28 would not only mark a technical victory but also likely accelerate interest and volume across the board. For now, bulls remain in control, but the next move will determine whether HYPE enters true price discovery or pauses just below the highs once more. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? HYPE Approaches Resistance With Momentum As Bulls Eye Breakout The 4-hour chart for HYPE shows strong bullish momentum, with price currently trading at $25.29 after tapping a local high near $25.57. The rally has been steady and clean, bouncing consistently off the 200 EMA and SMA, now well below the current price, confirming a clear uptrend structure. HYPE is now pressing into a key resistance zone between $26 and $28, a level that previously acted as supply back in January. This area represents a major test for bulls, as it aligns with the upper boundary of a multi-month range. Volume is healthy, and the trend remains intact with higher highs and higher lows across multiple timeframes. If HYPE can break and hold above $28, it opens the door for a challenge of the all-time highs. For now, the price may consolidate slightly below resistance as sellers defend this zone, but the overall structure favors a breakout continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels A throwback to the $23–$24 region could act as a healthy retest, but holding above $22 is key to preserving bullish momentum.

Wedson argued that Bitcoin’s historical cycle is still valid, and that the peak is likely to occur in October. However, he also warned that there could be serious volatility before then. Wedson, who opposed comments claiming that the Bitcoin cycle was disrupted due to the influence of institutional investors, stated that he found this approach “naive.” “Those who think that institutions are new to crypto are wrong; they have actually been around since the early years of Bitcoin. The only difference is that some of the data is now publicly available, but often with a lag,” Wedson said, arguing that the cycles are surprisingly accurate and consistent. Related News: Its CEO is a Bitcoin Skeptic, But the Company's BTC Holdings Surprised Everyone: Goldman Sachs Revealed How Much Bitcoin It Owns Wedson noted similarities seen in the past: “May can catch many people off guard. For example, there are striking similarities between April 2021 and April 2023, and November 2021 and November 2022.” Arguing that May was historically unpredictable, the CEO said that a new shock development such as China's ban decision could occur again in 2021, but even such events would not disrupt the general cycle. “Even if the worst-case scenario happens and the headlines say ‘Bitcoin is dead,’ there’s still time for a new high,” Wedson said. “We have 120 emotionally intense days ahead of us in July, August, September and October.” Stating that the analysis made three months ago is still valid, Joao Wedson predicted that Bitcoin could peak between $143,000 and $146,000 in this cycle, in projections based on the performance of the current cycle. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm. In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin ( BTC ) or altcoins. When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin. Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altcoins may start gaining momentum, potentially entering a period where they outperform Bitcoin.

He noted that unlike 2021, there’s no sign of retail investors entering the market. Traders are rotating capital faster, with little incentive to hold long-term positions. Technical trader Moustache offered a more optimistic view. He shared a chart showing repeating altcoin accumulation phases followed by explosive growth. According to him, the current structure mirrors those of 2016 and 2020. “Altseason 2025 has officially begun,” he said. However, skeptics remain. Commentator Rekt Fencer pointed out that most altcoins have been down 90% since December. A modest 10% bounce this week sparked exaggerated optimism, prompting him to mock the rally. “This is the ALTSEASON we’ve all been waiting for,” he joked. Source: Rekt Fencer Related: Bitcoin ‘more likely’ to hit $110K before $76.5K — Arthur Hayes Crypto market rallies on global optimism Crypto markets started the weekend with strong bullish momentum, driven by renewed investor confidence. Bitcoin surged to $104,900, just 4% below its all-time high after President Donald Trump announced positive developments in US-China trade talks. The rally extended beyond Bitcoin, with Ether ( ETH ) posting one of its best daily performances in weeks. Memecoins also rebounded sharply, signaling renewed risk appetite across the broader altcoin market. “Crypto rallied on a wave of global optimism,” Hank Huang, CEO of Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph. “Ceasefire talks between India and Pakistan eased regional tensions, while news on U.S.-China trade tariffs signaled renewed cooperation between major economies.” Huang added that Ether’s strong rally added fuel, lifting altcoins across the board. “Bitcoin surged to $105K as investors returned to risk assets, clarity replaced uncertainty,” he noted.

44464779,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=396019,1746950297,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/44464779.jpeg,Trump’s Ripple (XRP) Post Fallout: How the White House Sidelined Lobbyist (Report),https://cryptopotato.com/trumps-ripple-xrp-post-fallout-how-the-white-house-sidelined-lobbyist-report/,"In early March, a Truth Social post by President Donald Trump promoting a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” went viral in the United States. However, within hours of its going up, the post backfired on one of Washington, D.C.’s most well-connected lobbyists, Brian Ballard. Truth Social Post Drama According to a report from Politico, the idea for the post came from a staff member at Ballard’s lobbying firm who had spoken to Trump several times during a weekend donor event at Mar-a-Lago. She allegedly urged the president to back the crypto industry publicly and even suggested the language he would use. Unknown to Trump at the time, Ripple, whose native XRP token was mentioned in the message, was a client of Ballard’s firm. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has made no secret of his desire to see XRP included in a proposed digital asset reserve. Once the President learned of the connection, he was furious. “He is not welcome in anything anymore,” Trump reportedly told White House associates later that month, referring to Ballard. As a result, staff were allegedly quietly directed to avoid meetings with him, effectively freezing him out of the West Wing. Since Trump’s return to power, Ballard Partners has gained 130 new customers. The firm earned $14 million in the first three months of 2025, more than three times what it made in the same period last year. However, some people in Trump’s circle now believe the influence peddler has gone too far. According to Politico, they think he uses his past ties to the President and his team to get more clients, even though those relationships may not be as close as he claims. “One way to get yourself in the doghouse is for the President to think you are trading on his name,” one Trump ally told the media outlet, adding that the lobbyist overstates his “importance and value.” Ballard Denies Accusations In a statement to the media outlet, the 65-year-old rejected the criticisms and denied that he has been sidelined. “I have never touted my relationships with people in the West Wing to try to win clients,” he noted. Regarding the Truth Social incident, someone from his team said they never tried to trick Trump with the message. Despite this, the situation seems to have caused Ballard some trouble with his business. A few of his clients have reportedly begun seeking alternative routes to gain access to the President and his advisers. After opening his Washington office in 2017, Ballard quickly became one of the city’s most successful lobbyists. He is a well-known figure in Trump’s world, having helped raise tens of millions of dollars for the politician’s campaigns. He also used to represent the Trump Organization, and his firm also employed two of the President’s close allies, Susie Wiles and Pam Bondi.

The conversation focused on vulnerabilities not within SWIFT itself, but within the infrastructure of institutions that use it. Can Ripple help secure the SWIFT network? Ripple mentioned in a webinar as a potential solution to mitigate security risks on the SWIFT network, during a discussion about a hacker exploit that costed SWIFT $81 million dollars. Listen. pic.twitter.com/izrNIptnTE — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 9, 2025 The 2016 Bangladesh Bank Hack The speaker in the video emphasized that while SWIFT is “terribly secure,” the system can still be compromised if participating banks maintain weak internal defenses. This was illustrated through the well-known 2016 cyberattack on Bangladesh Bank, in which hackers compromised the bank’s SWIFT credentials by exploiting a firewall vulnerability. The attacker stole $81 million from the bank’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. According to the speaker, the weakness was caused by a misconfigured $20 RadioShack router. Ripple’s Possible Role in Risk Mitigation Most stolen funds were laundered through casinos in Macau and other parts of the globe and were never recovered. This issue shows that SWIFT can be breached. External breaches can compromise even the most secure protocols if the endpoints are not protected. In this context, Ripple was mentioned as a potential solution . The blockchain-based protocol could offer an additional layer of security, especially in credential management and transaction validation. Ripple’s distributed ledger technology on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) allows for real-time verification across a network, which could help prevent unauthorized access and reduce reliance on static credentials. Tranglo is already offering cross-border payments to Bangladesh with better security. However, the speaker said it remains “an open question whether Ripple can mitigate this.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Blockchain Integration in Financial Infrastructure The relevance of blockchain solutions like Ripple in enhancing financial infrastructure security continues to be evaluated. While XRP is primarily known for its capabilities in cross-border payments, its architecture could be repurposed or integrated into existing systems to help address weaknesses at the institutional level. The 2016 Bangladesh Bank incident serves as a reminder that security is only as strong as the most vulnerable part of a system, which gives another reason why XRP is a viable alternative to SWIFT . Adopting technologies that reduce the reliance on manually maintained credentials and enhance transaction monitoring may offer a path forward. Whether Ripple or similar protocols can play that role at scale remains a discussion among financial institutions and cybersecurity experts, and many believe XRP is the right choice.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $4.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction.

Over the last few hours, the price of dYdX has been hovering around support channels. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price dropped toward $0.7 following rejection An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced selling pressure after the price failed to maintain momentum above $0.76. As a result, buyers are now defending a drop below the $0.7 level. The 24-hour volume surged to $15.15 million, showing increased interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.712, surging by over 0.3% in the last 24 hours. dYdX shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around the buying region at level 60, hinting that buyers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bulls strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, bulls maintain buying confidence as the dYdX price aims for a rebound. dYdX price chart The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.89, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.92964 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.84402 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.844129 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.807292 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.948906 SELL SMA 100 $ 1.315705 SELL SMA 200 $ 1.23951 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.8087 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.902097 SELL EMA 10 $ 1.069497 SELL EMA 21 $ 1.266273 SELL EMA 50 $ 1.426172 SELL EMA 100 $ 1.413397 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.475345 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.7706, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.8644. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.6768, beginning a bearish trend to $0.5155. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Following the overall selling demand in the market, dYdX witnessed a surge in selling pressure around $0.76. As a result, bears are aiming for a hold below $0.7. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.7 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5.

After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark.

Recently, Bolivia’s Minister of Economy and Public Finance, Marcelo Montenegro, announced the approval of a new decree that is intended to regulate FinTech companies and virtual asset services. On the other hand, El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have surpassed $620 million, fueled by Bitcoin’s price breaking the $100,000 mark. Bolivia regulates FinTech and digital assets Bolivia’s new initiative is intended to provide clear legal grounds for new financial services relying upon blockchain and digital assets, in light of the rapid growth of the sector situated in this country over the past twelve-month period. Backed by President Luis Arce, the effort attempts to create an environment conducive to encouraging public and private sector start-ups. According to a Bolivian official news source, the regulation provides payment, remittances, loans, tokenised assets, etc., in a secure and trustworthy environment for the fintech services in this country. The decree is also a momentous change for over 40 existing FinTechs operating in Bolivia, the majority of them being in Santa Cruz, La Paz, and Cochabamba. Currently, these firms have operated in a relatively unregulated grey area, bringing with them fears of inadequate user protections and insecure transactions. Companies must obtain proper licenses and comply with data protection and authentication standards under the new rules, which are to be finalised within 40 business days by the Financial System Supervisory Authority (ASFI). This regulation is expected to encourage national and international investor interest in the country, with Bitcoin and Ethereum usage in the country leading the way while also preparing Bolivia to take a larger part in the cryptocurrency and blockchain arena. El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings surpass $625 million El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have topped $620 million as the price of Bitcoin has risen above $100,000. The government currently owns 6,170.18 BTC, with recent daily purchases averaging $95,000 per coin. President Bukele remains committed to Bitcoin, with support from Economy Minister María Luisa Hayem, who sees the asset as crucial for fiscal policy and investor attraction. This week, Bukele met with Jeff Booth, a well-known venture capitalist, to develop Bitcoin ties. Despite IMF warnings, El Salvador continues to embrace digital assets, following worldwide trends set by companies such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet.

In partnership with the State Council of Education (CEE-PR) and the Secretariat of Science, Technology, and Higher Education (SETI), the initiative will use blockchain to provide authenticity, transparency, and security to digital certificates. In the first year, the state could see as many as 175 short courses from the seven public universities, in areas including public management, IT, and business development. A R$2 million fund will assist in the development of the courses, and the remaining regulations were adapted to allow each higher education institute to define its micro credit framework. With blockchain, certificates will be immutable and can be shared easily across job platforms and academic networks, preventing fraud and accelerating employment processes. Likewise, these micro credits will count towards a degree, postgraduate, or extension programs, thereby providing a versatile and future-oriented educational model among the public institutions across the state of Paraná.

The fighter-turned-politician presented the idea on May 9 and labeled it as a way of bringing financial power back to the people of Ireland. Crypto was initially devised to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power back to the people’s money,” McGregor tweeted on X. McGregor added that more would be announced in an upcoming X Spaces session, and there was quick reaction from within the crypto industry. Crypto Leaders Take Notice McGregor’s tweet was met with immediate response from prominent Bitcoin advocates. He responded directly to Anthony Pompliano, host of The Pomp Podcast, saying, “We need the best minds for this BTC Reserve. Message me and let’s talk on my space.” David Bailey, a crypto advisor to Donald Trump, also reached out, with McGregor embracing further dialogue: “David message me, let’s talk about your ideas!” Political Challenges for a National BTC Reserve In spite of the enthusiasm of some within the industry, McGregor’s suggestion has significant hurdles to overcome. Ireland has no history of hosting digital assets in national reserves, and McGregor’s push is not supported by any prominent political party. Countries like the U.S., El Salvador, and Bhutan have already established Bitcoin reserves — albeit typically with sweeping government infrastructure and legal reform. McGregor entered the fray in March 2025, standing on anti-immigration and anti-crime tickets. The election must be held by November 11, 2025, at the latest. Past Controversies and Crypto Failures McGregor’s offer is tainted by legal troubles. He’s battling a civil sexual assault judgment and has also faced previous hate speech investigations. His cryptocurrency reputation was dented in April when the McGregor-supported “REAL” token project fell apart, raising only $392,315 in a presale — far less than its $1 million target, with full refunds being given to investors.",Bitcoin|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-11 08:45:06

This sharp vertical move marked one of the most dramatic ETHFI price spikes in recent weeks, pushing the token past several resistance zones in a single stretch. While the rally has captured significant momentum, early signs of cooling off are now emerging on both intraday and daily timeframes. ETHFI price analysis (Source: TradingView) Looking at the 4-hour chart, ETHFI has shown strong bullish candles supported by high volume, followed by a retracement from the $1.29 top. This pullback brings the price into a consolidation range between $1.12 and $1.20, as traders digest the recent gains. The Bollinger Bands are significantly expanded, with the price retracing toward the upper band support around $1.13—indicating that volatility remains elevated.

The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity. Amidst Ethereum’s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price – What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It’s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market. In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders’ confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation. The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours. If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead.

According to Hoskinson, this vision aims to reach 3 billion customers without the need for banks or exchange systems.

The analyst says that year one of a new cycle typically sends Bitcoin to levels never seen before. “2025 will be the year of the BTC Bull Market peak. 2026 will be the year of the Bitcoin Bear Market. And 2027 will be the Bottoming Out year to precede an entirely brand new future Bull Market.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt says that Bitcoin tends to print the steepest rallies of its bull market after entering a fresh four-year cycle. “It’s 2025, the year of the BTC Parabolic rally into a new Bull Market peak. This phase of the cycle only comes around once every four years. This could very well be one of the most defining years of your life, if you play it right.” Zooming in on BTC, Rekt shares a chart suggesting that BTC will initially climb to around $150,000 before witnessing another consolidation and igniting a final leg up en route to $200,000. “This Bitcoin cycle has been a story of Re-Accumulation Ranges.

Every cycle, the biggest gains tend to happen quietly—right before everyone else catches on. It’s not always the loudest projects that deliver. Instead, the real opportunities usually start with a solid foundation, consistent traction, and the right timing. That’s exactly why a growing number of crypto whales are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a project that’s showing the same early signals many remember from Solana’s breakout moment. Still flying under the radar and priced at just $0.025, MUTM isn’t trying to mimic SOL — but it might just end up delivering something similar… or even bigger. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now, this might be the project flying under the radar. Solana (SOL) Before it made headlines and climbed into the top 10, Solana (SOL) was largely dismissed as just another layer-1 experiment. However, a handful of early investors recognized the true potential beneath the surface. Instead of chasing the hype, they focused on the fundamentals and the data. Fast, cheap transactions. Scalable infrastructure. A product-first roadmap. And critically, they noticed early traction without the noise. Solana’s price gains didn’t happen overnight, but once momentum kicked in, it didn’t stop. Those who entered before the spotlight made life-changing returns — not because they timed the top, but because they understood the pattern. It became one of the most successful cryptocurrency investments of its time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is gaining attention for similar reasons. It’s early. It’s structured. And most importantly, it’s building around real usage — not just tokenomics. The project is developing a decentralized platform for borrowing and lending, where users interact directly through non-custodial smart contracts. This means investors can earn passive income on deposited assets, while borrowers unlock liquidity by posting overcollateralized crypto. That foundation, already tested across other DeFi giants, is being refined within the Mutuum ecosystem to focus on accessibility, transparency, and yield reliability — something many are labeling as the next high yield crypto worth watching. What adds to the confidence? The protocol will launch with a beta version already live, making it usable from day one — a move that distinguishes it from many early-stage projects still operating on roadmaps instead of product. Right now, Mutuum is in Phase 4 of its presale, and over 66% of this phase is already filled. The token has raised more than $7.8 million so far and gathered 9,600+ holders — solid numbers for a project that hasn’t even launched yet. It’s gaining traction as a strong contender for the next big crypto to emerge from the DeFi space. The current price of $0.025 won’t last long. Once this round concludes, it will increase to $0.03, eventually reaching $0.06 at launch. That alone gives early buyers a 140% return before the token hits exchanges. But for those looking at longer-term crypto predictions, the potential upside is significantly larger. Mutuum’s model creates natural demand through smart use of platform fees. A share of the protocol’s revenue is allocated to purchasing MUTM tokens directly from public markets. These tokens are then redistributed to users who participate in the system, especially those staking mtTokens — a structure that rewards engagement and supports price strength. It’s mechanisms like these that attract experienced investors looking for what crypto to invest in during uncertain market periods. The platform is also integrating an overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar. It’s minted when borrowers lock up more value than they withdraw, and it plays a central role in the ecosystem. The interest generated from stablecoin loans flows back into Mutuum’s treasury, helping to strengthen the protocol’s internal economy without relying on outside sources. To ensure everything operates securely, Mutuum’s smart contracts are undergoing a full audit with CertiK. For any serious investor, this is a green flag — the project isn’t cutting corners or rushing launch. It’s taking the time to verify that users’ funds and interactions are protected by code that’s been rigorously tested. MUTM isn’t trying to be Solana — but like early SOL, it’s ticking the right boxes: functional product, early traction, low entry price, and growing attention from smart money. With the presale still open and big names beginning to take positions, it feels like one of those rare early windows that doesn’t stay open for long. Crypto whales know the pattern.

According to a May 9 Bloomberg interview , CEO Brian Armstrong said the idea of converting a large portion of Coinbase’s balance sheet into Bitcoin had been floated multiple times over the past 12 years. “There were definitely moments where we thought, should we put 80% of our balance sheet into Bitcoin?” Armstrong said. However, he explained that the company made a conscious decision to manage risk, suggesting that such a move could have jeopardized Coinbase’s liquidity and future operations. Coinbase Avoided Crypto Bets to Stay Neutral with Customers Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas echoed Armstrong’s caution, stating that Coinbase deliberately avoided entering into competition with its own customers by betting on specific cryptocurrencies. Despite that, Coinbase remains significantly exposed to Bitcoin. In its latest earnings report on May 8, the firm revealed a $153 million crypto purchase in Q1, primarily in BTC. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, Coinbase now holds 9,480 BTC, worth nearly $1 billion at current prices. This makes it the ninth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, behind firms such as MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Marathon Digital Holdings. While Coinbase held back from a full-scale Bitcoin pivot, other companies have embraced Saylor’s strategy, using equity and debt to fund large Bitcoin acquisitions. Globally, over 100 public companies, 40 ETF issuers, and even 12 nation-states now report holding Bitcoin. 193 publicly traded entities now hold BTC on their balance sheet +200% increase Year to Date This is just the beginning. We. Are. Going. Higher. https://t.co/QqvTssMzaj — Mitchell (@MitchellHODL) May 10, 2025 Coinbase also made headlines this week by acquiring crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion, marking the industry’s largest merger to date. The acquisition significantly boosts Coinbase’s presence in the crypto derivatives market, an area it previously accessed only through its Bermuda-based operations. Deribit processed over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024 and holds $30 billion in open interest. Coinbase said the acquisition positions it as the new “global leader” in crypto derivatives. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings—rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share—still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs. Coinbase’s earnings were weighed down by unpredictable macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in digital asset prices. However, the company noted its second-highest ever monthly user count, with CFO Alesia Haas highlighting increased engagement across non-trading services.

44468632,https://crypto.news/?p=14378147,1746956786,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/44468632.jpeg,AI could’ve predicted—even prevented—the Mantra crash | Opinion,https://crypto.news/ai-couldve-predicted-even-prevented-the-mantra-crash/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. The fall of Mantra ( OM ), the native token of the layer-1 real-world asset blockchain Mantra, shook the crypto market on April 13. Within hours, the asset saw its market cap plunge from over $6 billion to around $500 million. You might also like: AI is creating a new class of entrepreneurs, and you’re either in or out | Opinion In a market already scarred by billion-dollar collapses, the collapse of Mantra’s native asset proved yet again that hacks aren’t the only enemy to the industry—crypto has been crippled by negligence. The team behind Mantra blamed “forced liquidations” for the 90% token crash, which is only half of the story. As more data surfaces, it’s becoming clear that the collapse wasn’t just a case of unfortunate timing or high market volatility. It was a preventable disaster that had many catalysts, like overleveraged positions, weak liquidity, and various gaps in its automated risk management systems. Ironically, artificial intelligence, the technology that crypto evangelists have been praising over the last three years, could have predicted, flagged, and even prevented this crash, had it been implemented properly. AI-driven liquidity stress testing The problem with traditional financial stress testing is that it is designed for stable, regulated markets and conventional assets like stocks and bonds, where extreme volatility is rare. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, operate in a different reality where wild price swings and sudden liquidity crashes are pretty common and part of the market game. Legacy risk frameworks that rely on historical patterns fail to capture these shocks. AI-driven stress testing offers a dynamic alternative. Instead of relying on static historical data, machine learning models adapt to real-time conditions, analyzing market sentiment, on-chain metrics, and liquidity patterns. A new method called kurtosis-based stress testing focuses on reducing the risk of extreme outlier losses, precisely the “fat tail” events that characterize crypto market failures. This technique can help firms in “less predictable, high-impact” events like the recent Mantra and the 2022 Terra ( LUNA ) crashes. During the Terra collapse in 2022 , traditional risk models failed because they didn’t anticipate how quickly a stablecoin de-peg could spiral into a $60 billion wipeout. The research shows that portfolios designed to reduce extreme risk swings delivered a 491% return with the kurtosis model, beating the simpler ‘buy-and-hold’ approach at 426% and even outperforming those built around traditional Sharpe ratio strategies, with a 384% return. A high kurtosis value indicates a higher probability of extreme volatility. In crypto, these events aren’t anomalies—they’re part of the landscape. Mantra’s exposure to thin weekend liquidity and token concentration could have been flagged well in advance with AI-powered stress testing methods, offering stakeholders a window to act before catastrophe struck. Tracking and flagging movements with AI Blockchain’s transparency is its greatest strength, yet monitoring millions of transactions manually is impossible. This is where AI excels. Autonomous AI agents can continuously scan on-chain activity and flag unusual patterns that might indicate impending market manipulation, all without the need for human involvement. In Mantra’s case, blockchain data analyzed after the crash revealed telling signs. Just days before the collapse, a wallet linked to Laser Digital reportedly transferred 6.5 million OM tokens to another wallet, which then sent them to OKX, where they were liquidated. An AI monitoring system could have detected these movements in real time, issuing immediate alerts to exchanges, regulators, and the broader community. AI agents can distinguish routine market behavior from potential manipulations since they don’t just track transactions but also build behavioral profiles across wallet networks. Predicting order book vulnerabilities Perhaps the most direct way AI could have prevented the Mantra crash is through sophisticated order book analysis. Order books reveal the true health of a market, but their complexity demands more than just surface-level analysis. Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks, have proven to deliver promising results in forecasting price movements based on order book data. One study found that temporal CNNs can predict Bitcoin ( BTC ) price shifts with up to 76% accuracy. AI-driven analysis of market depth would have highlighted the risk of significant slippage from large sell orders—conditions ripe for a cascading price collapse. Consequently, these models could have exposed Mantra’s fragility by identifying dangerously thin order books during weekend trading hours. With the help of AI and deep learning models, crypto firms can implement dynamic safeguards like circuit breakers triggered by sharp price drops and structural weaknesses in liquidity to flag or prevent situations similar to Mantra. Building a resilient crypto ecosystem with AI While blockchain technology promises decentralization and transparency, it remains vulnerable without advanced AI-powered risk management systems that can process millions of transactions and flag suspicious patterns. The collapse of high-profile assets like Mantra and Terra has proven the need for these systems. Financial institutions with crypto exposure must prioritize dynamic stress testing frameworks that integrate both on-chain and off-chain data. Real-time transaction monitoring, powered by AI agents, needs to be the standard practice for exchanges and liquidity providers. Continuous order book analysis is also crucial to anticipate slippage risks and prevent manipulation-driven crashes. At this point, crypto companies are having a hard time catching up to the global regulations, with every region having its own set of limitations. Sometimes, regulatory frameworks take years to be negotiated and assessed properly. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), for example, was proposed in September 2020 and was officially adopted on May 31, 2023, but was still incomplete—some rules for stablecoins were announced in June 2024, and provisions for crypto-asset service providers were announced in December 2024. Despite the sensitivity of these regulations, they still fail to encapsulate the complexity, speed, and volume of data that define blockchain ecosystems today. Consequently, regulators are left with rules designed for yesterday’s problems. Instead of imposing blanket and one-size-fits-all restrictions that stifle innovation, AI-powered tools can also help regulatory bodies with more effective oversight. Government agencies can focus on detecting manipulation patterns and systemic risks without compromising decentralization principles to ultimately make timely and accurate decisions. From prediction to prevention The Mantra crash wasn’t inevitable. Most of the tools and techniques that could’ve predicted it already exist, but what’s missing is the industry’s will to implement them. Companies need to start integrating advanced and more complex risk management into broader enterprise frameworks rather than treating it as a separate domain. Investing in cross-functional expertise spanning quantitative modeling, blockchain infrastructure, and compliance isn’t just a luxury anymore; it’s a necessity to protect market integrity. Crypto firms should benchmark against emerging global standards like MiCA and Basel crypto frameworks and leverage both on-chain analytics and real-time exchange data for comprehensive monitoring. The projects, exchanges, and institutions that embrace these methodologies will gain both competitive advantage and community trust. Most importantly, they can build a crypto ecosystem where innovation thrives without the constant threat of market manipulation and catastrophic crashes. The question is no longer if AI should be integrated into crypto risk management, but how soon the industry is ready to embrace it before the next crisis unfolds, and more investors are hurt. This isn’t just about protecting individuals, but also the reputation of the whole ecosystem. Every major collapse, hack, and rug pull hurts the public’s trust in the crypto market. This allows the regulators to push for stronger regulations. AI can complement the decentralized ecosystem and help identify bad actors, detect systemic vulnerabilities, and separate credible builders from those exploiting the system.

Bitcoin SV, a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, which itself is a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, saw its price stunted as a result of the exchange’s actions, the litigants have claimed. According to reports, the investors have asked the United Kingdom Court of Appeal to readmit their claim that the delisting caused them to lose out on significant growth in the value of their holdings. In July 2024, the Competition Appeal Tribunal struck out an element in their complaint, where the Bitcoin SV investors argued that the Binance action resulted in a “forgone growth effect,” a move that prevented the token from fully developing into one of the top-tier digital assets in the market today. If this claim is allowed to stand, the court could announce a verdict where Binance could pay the highest possible financial penalty, which is above $13 million, based on the assumption that Bitcoin SV could have grown to the same height that Bitcoin was in July 2022, when the investors originally filed their claim. Bitcoin SV investors want to revive the Binance lawsuit Last Thursday, at the Court of Appeal, the legal representatives of the investors also argued that the court should hear the loss of chance claim of their clients when the case goes to trial. They believe that the delisting has caused a permanent loss of value to their clients as a result of the stunted growth of the token. “Because of the delisting, there has been damage which continues to this day,” said John Wardell KC, the lawyer representing the investors. In its pre-trial judgement in July 2024, the Competition Appeal Tribunal refused to honor Binance’s request to throw out the case completely. However, it agreed with the exchange that the “market mitigation rule” applied to the delisting, which meant that the majority of Bitcoin SV holders were aware of BSV’s removal before it happened and would have had enough opportunity to convert their tokens into alternatives. “The evidence currently before us as to the extent to which any BSV holders could reasonably have remained sufficiently unaware to exclude the market mitigation rule is … scant and high-level,” the tribunal’s judges concluded at the time. However, lawyers for BSV have argued this week that the market mitigation rules do not apply in this case, because they alleged that investors could not avoid the loss by trading into alternative assets. BSV lawsuit takes a new twist Binance’s lawyers have argued against the reasoning put forward by the investors’ legal representatives, with Brian Kennelly KC of Blackstone Chambers asking the Court of Appeal, “BSV could have been exchanged for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,” he said. “BSV is and was, at all relevant times, a readily marketable asset.” not to reverse its 2024 decision on the so-called forgone growth effect. The case against Binance is a part of a class action lawsuit involving Kraken, Bittylicious, and ShapeShift, which all delisted the token between April and June 2019. The claims were submitted by BSV Claims Limited, a special-purpose vehicle for which Lord Currie of Marylebone serves as sole director. Lord Currie was the chair of the UK telecoms regulator Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority. The case was registered on behalf of all UK-based Bitcoin SV holders between April 2019 and July 2022, with the number of investors estimated to be around 243,000. Partner at legal firm Edmonds Marshall McMahon, Ashley Fairbrother, noted that the case is very novel and it has an extraordinary backstory. “Last year, in an unprecedented case, the English High Court found that Dr Craig Wright was not Satoshi and that he had orchestrated a fraud not only on many people and companies, but also on the Courts of England and Wales, Norway, and the USA,” he said. According to Fairbrother, Wright used his false claims to influence investment in BSV, which enabled him to profit from the lies.

As its presale surges past $8 million , analysts are sounding the alarm: this token could deliver a staggering +18,500% return over the next year—if current trends continue. Backed by political relevance, smart supply design, and a fiercely loyal community, MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning itself as the standout altcoin of the 2025 bull cycle . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT A Presale Surge That Signals What’s Coming Momentum isn’t just speculation—it’s measurable. The MAGACOINFINANCE presale has outpaced nearly every other launch this year, attracting both retail and institutional capital in record time. It’s no surprise that analysts are comparing its setup to early-day successes like SHIBA INU and DOGE . With sellout stages and price increases arriving fast, the token’s entry window is narrowing—and fast. What’s Fueling MAGACOINFINANCE’s Explosive Forecast? A few key factors are pushing MAGACOINFINANCE into the spotlight: Limited token supply ensures scarcity and value preservation Structured tokenomics with built-in price acceleration Massive community backing with tens of thousands of participants Cultural and political relevance that drives organic visibility With its listing target set at $0.007 , the potential for early buyers is huge—especially given the sub-penny current presale pricing. Could This Token Outpace Solana and XRP? While legacy altcoins like Solana and XRP continue to perform, MAGACOINFINANCE may outshine them in pure ROI terms. Analysts are now projecting a potential move from under $0.01 to $1+ by the end of 2025—a trajectory that could yield 18,500%+ gains for early participants. It’s not just about hype—it’s about undervalued entry meets viral narrative at the perfect moment in the cycle.

The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author recently took to X, urging investors to abandon “fake money” and consider hard assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. His bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2035 has added momentum to the current rally, which has seen BTC gain nearly 8% over the past week. Kiyosaki’s long-standing belief in decentralized assets as a hedge against inflation aligns with the broader sentiment driving Bitcoin’s rise. As the U.S. dollar faces increasing scrutiny, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply are becoming more appealing to both retail and institutional investors.

Kiyosaki’s anti-fiat stance boosts Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against inflation. Predicts BTC could reach $1 million by 2035. US-China Trade Optimism Fuels Risk Appetite and Bitcoin Demand Moreover, the surge in Bitcoin’s price can also be attributed to the positive developments surrounding US-China trade relations . As of May 10, President Trump shared optimistic updates regarding trade talks between the two economic giants, suggesting that a potential deal could ease geopolitical tensions. This optimism has extended to global financial markets, including Bitcoin, which often reacts favorably to risk-on sentiment.

Bitcoin’s price surge is influenced by positive updates on US-China trade talks. President Trump’s optimism about a trade deal boosts global financial markets, including Bitcoin. Bitcoin benefits from both dissatisfaction with traditional financial systems and broader economic optimism. Institutional Inflows Provide Strong Support Bitcoin’s breakout above $104,000 also reflects strong institutional demand. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently recorded over $1 billion in net inflows, highlighting growing interest from institutional investors. This is part of a broader trend, with Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF collectively adding nearly $1 billion in the past week. These inflows suggest that institutional investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a strategic long-term asset. BlackRock’s ETF leads with $1B in net inflows.

Suddenly not so crazy… pic.twitter.com/uAw25MU4Oa — Blok Topik (@Bok2in) May 10, 2025 Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels to Watch From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is trading around $104,276, just below the critical 2.618 Fibonacci extension at $105,250. This level is a significant barrier, representing a potential profit-taking zone for short-term traders. If BTC clears this resistance, the next target is the 2.786 extension at $106,864, offering a potential 2.5% upside. However, early signs of a bearish MACD crossover suggest that momentum could be fading, which might lead to a short-term pullback. Trade Setup: Buy Above: $105,250 Take Profit: $106,864 Stop Loss: $103,681 Strategy: Consider buying if BTC breaks above $105,250, targeting $106,864. Use a tight stop below $103,681 to manage downside risk, as a drop below this level could trigger a deeper correction. Conclusion With strong institutional support, high-profile endorsements, and a growing anti-fiat narrative, Bitcoin appears well-positioned for further gains. However, traders should remain cautious as BTC approaches critical resistance levels, where profit-taking could trigger short-term volatility. The path to $200,000 remains possible, but will likely depend on continued institutional interest and broader market sentiment. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.58M as Flexible 78% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction, crossing $5.58 million in funds raised as it nears its $6.27 million presale cap. Priced at $0.002505, the token has positioned itself as more than just a meme coin—offering real utility through flexible, high-yield staking. Utility-Driven Tokenomics Fuel Demand Unlike typical meme tokens, BTCBULL blends crypto culture appeal with tangible staking rewards. Investors can currently earn an estimated 78% APY while keeping their tokens fully liquid—unstaking is allowed at any time without penalties or lockup periods.

Investor Raoul Pal has suggested that Dogecoin ( DOGE ) could play a key role in the financial world, citing its notable performance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ). His outlook is based on a potential bullish flag pattern in the Dogecoin/Bitcoin chart, which he believes could indicate a significant breakout. Pal speculated that if this pattern plays out, DOGE might become “the hardest currency on earth,” he said in an X post on May 11. “I still think the most amusing outcome possible would be for DOGE to be the hardest currency on earth… this is the DOGE/BTC chart…to me it looks like a potential big flag pattern and new highs await,” he said. His analysis of the DOGE/BTC chart, covering over a decade, identified two prominent falling wedge patterns, a formation often interpreted as bullish by technical analysts. The first pattern, from 2014 to early 2021, preceded a breakout that propelled the meme cryptocurrency to historic highs against Bitcoin. BTC/DOGE price chart. Source: TradingView/Raoul Pal Now, a similar pattern appears to be unfolding again from the 2021 peak to the present, suggesting the possibility for another upward move. While Bitcoin is traditionally seen as a possible currency due to its fixed supply and deflationary design, Pal’s assertion that Dogecoin could become “the hardest currency on earth” turns the conventional narrative on its head. Despite DOGE’s inflationary supply model, his statement challenges traditional views of monetary value and raises questions of whether the meme coin can evolve into a legitimate store of value. DOGE breaks out Pal’s outlook coincides with a surge in Dogecoin buying pressure, placing it among the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the past week. The asset is attempting to retest the $0.50 resistance level, with eyes set on its all-time high of $0.73 in 2021. At the same time, whales are showing renewed confidence in the token through sustained accumulation. To this end, on-chain data from Santiment revealed that, as of May 10, whales purchased approximately 600 million DOGE within just 48 hours. Historically, such large-scale transactions have often preceded significant price movements. DOGE whale transaction.

On May 9–10, 2025, the crypto world witnessed a historic event that redefined competitive trading: the International Crypto Trading Cup ( ICTC ) 2025, the first-ever live-streamed global crypto trading championship, sponsored by WhiteBIT , Europe’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by traffic. This e-sports-style showdown brought together eight elite traders from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, each of whom started with $50,0000 in a stablecoin to trade with, all competing for a prize pool of up to 5 million USDT. With expert commentators, in-depth strategy analysis, live trader interviews motes, and exclusive interviews, ICTC 2025 set a new benchmark for an e-sports style event in crypto, bringing together the traders for an event unlike any other. “Crypto trading has all the necessary components for a spectacular format: strategy, emotions, and strong personalities with extraordinary stories,” WhiteBIT Founder, Volodymyr Nosov, told the audience assembled at the Andorra Park Hotel for the awards ceremony. You might also like: Coinbase to launch 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading in U.S. The event’s e-sports-like format, with traders competing under intense conditions—no bots, no external tools, and a minimum of three trades per hour—mirrored the high-stakes drama of poker or gaming championships. TradingView , the official technological partner, powered the live trading platform, while Tether , a title sponsor, ensured a secure and stable prize pool, denominated in a special stablecoin produced exclusively for the event called USDB. Participants of the first International Crypto Trading Cup (ICTC) 2025. Source: crypto.news More than a competition, ICTC 2025 was a platform for learning. “Our mission is mass blockchain adoption, and with ICTC, we aim to make crypto trading accessible and exciting in a brand-new format,” Nosov added. The event’s educational focus allowed viewers to analyze professional strategies, engage in live discussions, and compare their own approaches with the pros. Live interviews with traders offered exclusive insights into their mental preparation, risk management, and market navigation, making every trade a lesson. Driven by the event’s format, traders ventured into uncharacteristically risky bets over the two days, which tested their skills and posed unique challenges that tested the limits of their strategies. Taking positions with 50x or 100x leverage created risky conditions that traders were willing to take due to the nature and format of the tournament. Malik Roth Klindt Jensen, a trader from the UAE who participated in the event and came in fourth place, told crypto.news that due to the limited time frame of the event posed challenges to his normal strategy. “It’s very difficult to trade on skill,” he said. “For it to be based on skill, it has to be based on a longer time frame.” The event did not go off without a hitch. Several traders complained about glitches with the internet, and trades that included abnormal slippages that resulted in much less than expected profits. Others who participated in the event concurred. According to Luca Boiardi, a trader from Italy who came in fifth place, “I think luck plays a major role in a tournament like this. It was not a natural environment, but that was the entire point, it was very challenging.” The winner of the event, a trader from Ukraine named Max Hamaha, told crypto.news that the event created unique conditions that forced him into positions he would not normally take. Hamaha, who hosts a popular channel on YouTube that covers crypto trading and broadcasts to an audience of over 100,000 subscribers, has over 17 years of experience as a trader. In addition, he has also recently launched a popular memecoin on the TON ( TON ) network called Gaileo ( GGAI ). “In an event like this, traders have to take risks based on the format, which creates conditions that most traders are not used to.” Still, many predict such competitions could carve a new niche in crypto culture, blending intellectual rigor with real-time drama. As Alex Kozenko, WhiteBIT’s CMO, emphasized, “this is the first event where anyone could test their skills in real-time, against seasoned professionals. We look forward to organizing this event again next year.“ Read more: Crypto VC funding: Sentora, T-Rex and Sonic Labs collect fresh capital",News|Exclusive|crypto|Cryptocurrency|DeFi,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|TON,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-11 10:12:44

With Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000 following fresh ETF flows and altcoins getting picked up by fintech giants, crypto’s not just a side hustle anymore—it’s part of the global conversation on what comes next. As markets shake off Q1 volatility, buyers are no longer just chasing hype; they’re seeking ecosystems that solve actual problems, scale across networks, and return value with serious long-term potential. That’s why all eyes are on emerging cryptos to buy—especially ones like Qubetics , which is building serious traction in the middle of a heated crypto presale, and veteran chains like Cosmos and Aptos, which keep leveling up in ways most traditional financial assets can’t. Among these, Qubetics is stepping into 2025 with growing momentum and a suite of tools that feel designed for real-world demands, not just crypto-native speculation. Qubetics – A Presale Making Waves With Real Utility Right now, the Qubetics crypto presale is in its 33rd stage, with over $16.6 million raised, more than 510 million $TICS sold, and a backer count that just crossed 25,600. The current token price sits at $0.2302, and with each stage pushing that price up by 10%, early community members have been stacking serious value. But this isn’t about just raw numbers—it’s about what’s underneath. Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, and it’s doing something few chains have pulled off: unifying fragmented networks, tools, and data streams into one modular structure. That structure is built around the QubeQode IDE—a powerhouse AI-enhanced development suite designed to simplify how people build in Web3. Whether you’re launching a DeFi protocol or tokenizing invoices for a local service provider, QubeQode automates cross-chain deployment, debug processes, and user interface syncing. Imagine being able to deploy smart contracts on multiple chains in one dashboard—without needing a dev team of five. Now, combine that with the Qubetics IDE, which lets logistics companies build supply-chain apps that sync in real time across different blockchains, or freelancers mint their portfolios into verifiable NFTs without code. These aren’t just whiteboard ideas—they’re solutions answering real problems. At $TICS price points like $1, $5, and $15, projected ROI scales from 334% to 6,415%. It’s easy to see why this is climbing charts of top emerging cryptos to buy—because it’s not just offering ROI, it’s offering relevance. Cosmos – Still the Standard for Interoperability Cosmos has always had a single-minded goal: fix the mess that is blockchain communication. And to be fair, it’s done that well. With IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol), Cosmos allows different chains to talk to each other without relying on third-party bridges that so often get exploited. It’s one reason why DeFi protocols continue to pick Cosmos as their base infrastructure. Cosmos may not have the same ROI projections you’d get from a high-growth crypto presale, but it earns its place among the top emerging cryptos to buy for anyone who values infrastructure over short-term swings. The ATOM token has seen resurgence from broader DeFi adoption and network upgrades expected in 2025 could give it another leg up. Aptos – Built for Speed, Gaining Ground With Devs Aptos came out the gate with serious ambition, backed by Meta veterans and loaded with expectations. While it didn’t explode right away, Aptos has quietly secured its position in the Web3 stack thanks to its Move programming language and a consensus mechanism built for parallel execution. Translation? It’s fast, secure, and makes scaling smooth, especially for apps with lots of transactions. In 2025, Aptos is being picked up by dev teams looking to ditch clunky Solidity-based environments for something faster and easier to manage. From NFT projects to gaming economies, Aptos has gained traction because it actually delivers on speed without sacrificing reliability. That’s what lands it on our list of emerging cryptos to buy heading into Q2. How QubeQode and Qubetics IDE Solve Real-Life Problems How many developers, startups, or even everyday service providers are getting left out of blockchain innovation because it’s just too complex? Qubetics is tackling that head-on. With QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE, even non-coders can deploy Web3 projects. Think about a tutoring service turning session logs into tokenized proof-of-work, a fitness brand turning memberships into cross-chain NFTs, or regional logistics firms tracking shipments on decentralized ledgers—all made doable without jumping through 10 layers of tech. That’s why Qubetics isn’t just another entry on a long list of emerging cryptos to buy. It’s stepping in to simplify, scale, and bring people into the ecosystem who’ve been priced out by complexity. Conclusion: These Cryptos Are Building the Next Era of Utility In a time where attention spans are short and thousands of tokens are launching every month, it’s rare to find chains that actually offer clarity and purpose. But Qubetics, Cosmos, and Aptos each bring something real to the table. Whether it’s Qubetics rewriting how people build on blockchain, Cosmos connecting siloed systems, or Aptos making scalable apps—each has a role in the future of finance and technology. If you’re eyeing emerging cryptos to buy , Qubetics’ crypto presale could be the most time-sensitive opportunity, offering unmatched ROI potential and tools designed to simplify blockchain’s messy backend. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics considered one of the best emerging cryptos to buy now? Because it’s solving the usability problem that most chains ignore. Its modular tools, live presale momentum, and enterprise-level applications make it stand out. How do QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE help non-developers? They let anyone—from small business owners to solo creators—build and deploy cross-chain apps, NFTs, and smart contracts without needing deep technical knowledge. Is Aptos still relevant in 2025? Yes. Thanks to its Move programming language and scalable consensus, Aptos is gaining traction in Web3 development, especially in high-speed dApps.

The rise shows investors are returning to the country due to confidence boosters from the deal, which are expected to create economic links and market stability. The trade deal, announced by President Donald Trump and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is focused on increasing trade between the two countries by lowering tariffs and opening up the US market for British goods. Key provisions in the agreement eliminate some non-tariff barriers and provide expanded market access to American foods, including beef and ethanol. However, despite its improved market performance, the meme coin is still experiencing market volatility. Analysts have, therefore, pointed out that the coin’s growth could be short-term, slightly influenced by the current market sentiment. Analysts believe the TRUMP coin could soon reach $20 if US-China talks succeed The White House’s decision to agree to a trade deal with the UK and start talks with China has improved global market sentiment and Trump’s image overall. The public’s perception of him has taken a more positive turn, even extending to his meme coin, TRUMP. The meme coin holders now see a spike in the token’s prices and look forward to an upward trajectory. In the past week, the altcoin has surged 28% and is close to breaking its resistance level at $14.53. Should the coin pass this resistance level, the new target to beat will be $17.14. Moreover, analysts believe the TRUMP coin could spike to $20.00 if negotiations between the US and China succeed. They explained that a trade deal between the two countries would hint at a stronger market outlook and bolster investor confidence. However, with the excitement around the trade deal news subsiding, it’s clear that growing TRUMP coin momentum is more of a short-term reaction than sustained investor confidence. Typically, dependence on short-term political events is extremely risky for any crypto asset, especially if market sentiment reverses in the future. The Trumps have become actively involved in the cryptocurrency sector. The first lady also launched a meme coin in January, and last year, the president and his three sons started a crypto platform called World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, Trump Media and Technology Group, where the president is a majority shareholder, announced plans to work with Crypto.com to provide investment products linked to crypto. This month, the US Justice Department said it would disband a unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency-related fraud as digital asset oversight began to loosen. Trump’s administration cut tariffs on UK luxury car brands in their new trade deal According to a White House fact sheet, the Trump administration will reduce tariffs on the first 100,000 UK vehicles imported into the country each year to 10%; then, any additional vehicles will be subjected to a 25% levy. In his Oval Office announcement, Trump even commented: “We took it from 25 to 10 on Rolls-Royce because Rolls-Royce is not going to be built here. I wouldn’t even ask them to do that. You know, it’s a very special car, and it’s a very limited number, too.” Donald Trump Aside from Rolls Royce, other British car brands that could see relief from the tariff reduction are Bentley, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Aston Martin. However, the two have yet to agree on terms for any other consumer product. Nonetheless, Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, claimed that there would be more trade deals, asking the American public to be patient. He added that the agreement with the UK is a template for how they’ll handle other negotiations. Trump even announced that their deal with the UK is just “the first of many.” His administration, however, still has to settle over 100 trade deals before July 8, when the 90-day pause ends. He, however, insists that any country that retaliates against its tariffs will regret it, possibly facing higher tariffs.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Top trader says XYZVerse could surge to $25, potentially challenging DOGE and XRP. Table of Contents XYZVerse price forecast: Can this memecoin 30x from presale? Dogecoin price increases XRP price forecast Conclusion A top trader predicts that XYZVerse (XYZ) could reach $25. With a possible 15,000% surge, investors are taking notice. What is driving this massive growth potential? Could XYZVerse be the next big success in digital currency? XYZVerse price forecast: Can this memecoin 30x from presale? XYZVerse is stepping into the memecoin spotlight just as altcoin season heats up — and it’s playing to win. With hype-driven tokens like PEPE, Bonk, and Dogwifhat pulling off massive runs, XYZVerse could be next in line, thanks to its sports branding, deflationary tokenomics, and influencer-backed marketing. Why XYZ is catching investor attention The project mixes viral energy with structured tokenomics: Sports and influencer partnerships boost mainstream appeal. 17.13% burn rate helps curb selling pressure. 15% liquidity allocation aims to stabilize early trading. 10% for community rewards encourages holding and engagement. With memecoins gaining traction and XYZVerse still in presale, early buyers are eyeing a potential breakout — especially if major exchange listings follow. XYZ price forecast Presale price: $0.003333 Post-presale target: $0.10 (as estimated by the team). Launch hype peak (1–2 weeks): $0.15 – $0.25 (with strong demand and CEX support). 6–12 months outlook: $0.20 – $0.40 (if key partnerships and listings are secured). Can XYZVerse realistically hit $0.10? A 30x jump is possible — but it hinges on: Top-tier listings (e.g., Binance, KuCoin, OKX). Sustained memecoin momentum. Active community and viral marketing from sports influencers. Favorable market conditions for altcoins. Final take XYZVerse has a high-risk, high-reward setup — typical of memecoins — but with stronger fundamentals than most. If the team delivers on marketing and exchange traction, a 3,000% surge from presale is not out of reach. Early entry could mean maximum upside before listings drive FOMO.

In the past week, its price increased by 34.48%. Over the past month, it surged by 47.70%. However, over six months, it dropped by 33.43%. Currently, DOGE trades between $0.18 and $0.24. The nearest resistance level is at $0.26. If it breaks through, the next target is $0.30. The nearest support is at $0.16, with a secondary support at $0.14. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.20, and the 100-day SMA is $0.18. The Relative Strength Index is 73.76, and the Stochastic oscillator is 80.49, indicating overbought conditions. Based on this data, DOGE might face a price correction soon. If it surpasses $0.26, it could rise by about 5% to reach $0.30. If it can’t hold current levels, it might fall to $0.16 or even $0.14, a decrease of up to 10%. Traders are watching these levels for potential shifts in price direction. XRP price forecast XRP has shown significant movement lately. Over the past week, its price increased by 8.62%. Looking at the past month, XRP surged by 17.94%. In the last six months, it increased by 280.86%. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.10 and $2.47. The coin’s recent performance suggests strong upward momentum. The simple moving average over 10 days is $2.31, while the 100-day average is $2.17. This indicates a positive short-term trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 69.06, nearing overbought levels. Stochastic is at 78.24, also suggesting potential overbought conditions. The MACD level is 0.0327, indicating bullish momentum. If the bullish trend continues, XRP might test the nearest resistance level at $2.45, which would be an increase of around 6% from the current price. Beyond that, the next resistance is at $2.69, representing a potential gain of around 16%. However, if the price falls, the nearest support is at $1.98, a decrease of about 6%. The second support is at $1.75, about 16% lower. Conclusion Despite the strengths of DOGE and XRP, XYZVerse distinguishes itself by uniting sports fans in a unique memecoin ecosystem with ambitious growth potential.

The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground.

Analyst Says Breakout Is Imminent,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-nears-key-resistance-level-analyst-says-breakout-is-imminent/,"XRP is making waves once again as it approaches a critical resistance zone around the $2.40 mark. According to crypto analyst XRPunkie, who recently shared insights on X, the digital asset appears primed to breach this level, backed by encouraging weekly chart patterns and a favorable Relative Strength Index (RSI) setup. XRP Eyes a Breakout In his latest update, XRPunkie highlighted that XRP is currently testing the $2.40 resistance, and he anticipates a potential breakout soon. The analyst points to the strength shown on the weekly charts and notes that the RSI is on the verge of crossing, suggesting bullish momentum. Should XRP successfully break through this resistance, XRPunkie identifies the next significant levels at approximately $2.70 to $2.90. Beyond that, XRP could target the $5 to $8 range , with potential extensions to as high as $10 to $13. XRP teasing at the $2.40 resistance zone. Looks like we will break it soon. Weekly charts looks great and RSI looks like gonna cross. Next resistance level ard $2.70-$2.90. After that next stop $5-$8. Possible extends to $10-$13. https://t.co/3a9VB9GpQn pic.twitter.com/Ll3kOIKFVb — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) May 10, 2025 Previous Predictions Align with Current Trends XRPunkie’s latest forecast aligns with his earlier analysis from May 1, 2025, in which he described a “beautiful bull pennant” forming on the weekly chart. At that time, he projected a pullback to the $1.80 to $2.00 range before a substantial breakout. The technical target for this bull pennant, according to XRPunkie, could see XRP reaching between $13 and $14, although he cautioned that there would likely be additional pullbacks along the way. Chart Patterns Signal Bullish Potential The concept of a bull pennant in technical analysis is typically associated with continuation patterns that follow a significant upward price movement. If XRP maintains its bullish posture and breaks out from this pattern, it could confirm a long-term upward trend. XRPunkie’s focus on the $2.40 resistance zone is particularly noteworthy because a successful breach could signal renewed buying interest and a push toward higher levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Catalysts The positive sentiment around XRP is not without merit. Recent developments, including Ripple’s progress in regulatory clarity and increased institutional interest, have boosted confidence among investors. Furthermore, XRP’s ability to hold above the $1.80-$2.00 support range has reinforced bullish sentiment, as buyers appear resilient even during pullbacks. Risks and Considerations Despite the optimistic outlook, caution is warranted. XRP’s history of volatility means that any breakout attempt could face resistance, leading to short-term fluctuations. Traders should be mindful of potential corrections, especially if the asset fails to maintain momentum above key resistance points. XRP’s approach to the $2.40 resistance zone has the community watching closely, as a successful break could open the door to a much higher valuation. XRPunkie’s analysis offers valuable insights, pointing to both short-term resistance levels and long-term targets. As always, investors are advised to exercise caution, especially given the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.

The sit-downs, which are being held in private at the Swiss ambassador’s villa near Lake Geneva, involve US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng. According to Reuters, this is their first time meeting in person since both countries jacked up tariffs to more than 100%. Neither the United States nor China gave any details after Saturday’s round. No statement, no schedule, no clear win. The talks are happening behind a locked gate in the rich Cologny neighborhood. Not a word has been said publicly by the negotiators. Trump claims progress in Geneva talks but gives no details Even though the teams stayed quiet, President Donald Trump posted late Saturday on Truth Social that the conversation was “a total reset… in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” He also wrote, “A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland. Many things discussed, much agreed to.” Trump added, “We want to see, for the good of both China and the US, an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!” That’s all he shared. No mention of whether tariffs will go down, or if any terms were written into a draft. Switzerland was picked after recent visits by Swiss politicians to both China and the United States, where they pitched Geneva as a neutral ground. Now it’s hosting two of the world’s largest economies as they try to pull back from a trade war that’s already gone too far. Meanwhile, Trump is flying into the Gulf on Tuesday, with stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. The trip comes right in the middle of serious political chaos. On the table: talks about a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict, oil deals, trade discussions, investment pitches, and possible new rules around exporting semiconductors and handling nuclear programs.

Launched with the slogan “It goes where you go,” the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case. “The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X. “When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added. Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution. Source: Alicia Katz The Orb Mini is a portable iris-scanning device that creates a unique World ID for users stored on the blockchain. Resembling a smartphone with visible eye sensors, it’s a smaller, more accessible version of Worldcoin’s original Orb. Unveiled at the “At Last” event in San Francisco on April 30, the device is part of a broader push by Tools for Humanity , which also plans to roll out 7,500 Orb units across the US by year-end. Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in US Crypto users question Orb Mini’s practicality Several prominent voices raised concerns over security, ethics, and basic practicality. “What real-life problem does this solve?” one user asked, while others mocked its vulnerability to spoofing, with one tweet suggesting the device “could be fooled by a half-decent AI render of a human.” In the same thread, one user sarcastically recommended a “rectal probe” for more secure identity checks, claiming, “Every human’s anal print is unique.” Critics also slammed the device’s social implications.

In his post, which began with the words “ETH will surpass BTC,” Tomaino compared the current position of Bitcoin and the potential of Ethereum. Tomaino stated that Bitcoin was initially a cryptocurrency established by and for the people, and that this feature brought it to a value of $2 trillion. Stating that the “store of value” feature built on trust in mathematics is revolutionary, Tomaino conveyed that Bitcoin has become an institutional asset preferred by large companies and states today. Related News: MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor Explains Why Bitcoin Isn't at $150,000 Yet Tomaino criticized the lack of useful applications on the network that attract new users, noting that a single company owns more than 2.5% of the Bitcoin supply. Tomaino said that Ethereum hosts innovative use cases such as decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, NFTs, prediction markets, decentralized social networks and identity systems, and that these applications both include new users in the sector and increase the value of ETH by making it rarer. Stating that Ethereum stands out as a native and neutral store of value for the internet, Tomaino said, “Maximalists say there will only be one neutral, internet-based store of value. They are completely wrong. There will be many options, but there are only two valid options today: BTC and ETH.” *This is not investment advice.

Today you will learn about the critical attributes of a 1000x crypto and focus on Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , an innovative AI-driven meme coin that is rapidly becoming a key project to watch for those seeking substantial upside. The kind of message that makes you check twice. 📳💲 pic.twitter.com/9iaJyk7Vlw — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) April 15, 2025 Key Markers the Smart Investors Are Watching Now The ambition to turn a small stake into a significant sum through a 1000x crypto gain is a powerful driver in the digital asset space. However, such returns don't materialize from thin air In the May 2025 market, these markers are more crucial than ever: Micro Market Capitalization: The most explosive growth stories often begin with coins valued at just a few million dollars (or less) during their presale or very early public trading phases, offering a low base for exponential multiplication. Innovation and Strong Narrative: The crypto must present a compelling and unique value proposition. This often involves innovative technology, a novel application of existing tech like Artificial Intelligence, or a solution to a significant pain point within a large addressable market, such as AI, advanced DeFi, or Real-World Asset (RWA). Growing Community: A strong and organically expanding community is often the engine behind a crypto's viral success. This ""digital army"" can drive marketing, provide valuable feedback, create network effects, and offer resilience during market downturns. The 1000x Potential Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) In-Depth Review Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is not presenting itself as a fleeting meme but as a project with foundational strengths designed for significant upside. Here’s how its core components align with the profile of a high-potential crypto: AI-Powered Utility: A critical differentiator for Dawgz AI is its clear roadmap towards integrating sophisticated AI tools. Plans include ""Blackbox AI trading algorithms"" aimed at providing users with automated trading strategies, predictive market analytics for informed decision-making, and AI-enhanced risk management features. This commitment to utility offers a strong value proposition beyond speculative appeal. Verified Security and Transparency: In the often-turbulent crypto space, trust is paramount. Dawgz AI proactively addressed this by subjecting its Ethereum smart contract to a comprehensive audit by SolidProof, providing a crucial layer of confidence for early investors. Early Traction: The project’s presale phase has been a notable success, raising over $3.4 million. This strong capital inflow is a tangible metric of early investor belief and market validation. It has also fueled the growth of its ""Dawgz Army"" community, an essential element for organic promotion and sustained engagement. Tokenomics and Long Term Value: Dawgz AI features a fixed total supply of 8.888 billion $DAGZ tokens, a characteristic that can contribute to value appreciation as demand increases. Furthermore, a significant 20% of the token supply is allocated to staking rewards, directly incentivizing investors to buy and hold their $DAGZ tokens, which helps stabilize price and rewards long term commitment. Conclusion: Watching for the Crypto That Could Multiply Your Investment The dream of finding the best crypto to buy now that could deliver a 1000x return is a big part of what makes the crypto market so exciting. It’s a tough search that needs care and a bit of luck, but looking for projects with new ideas, strong communities, and real potential can point you in the right direction. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , with its smart mix of AI power and fun meme coin energy, is certainly one of the projects to watch closely as you look for that next big crypto chance. FAQ Section : What are the top things to watch for in a crypto if I’m hoping for 1000x potential? If you're hoping for 1000x potential, watch for a crypto with a very low starting market cap, truly innovative technology or a unique use case (like the AI features of Dawgz AI ($DAGZ)), a strong and growing community, and clear upcoming catalysts. These are key signals when considering the best crypto to buy now for massive growth. Is it truly possible for a crypto to go up 1000x in 2025? While it's rare and involves high risk, a crypto can achieve 1000x growth in 2025, especially if it’s a new coin with a groundbreaking concept that gains widespread, rapid adoption. Investors often watch projects like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) for this potential, given its unique AI utility and meme virality, but it's vital to understand the speculative nature. What are the biggest mistakes to avoid when looking for the best crypto to buy now with huge potential? Avoid investing more than you can afford to lose, falling for pure hype without checking fundamental facts (like security audits and team credibility), and ignoring the token's economic model. Even with an exciting project like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), thorough research into its AI roadmap and tokenomics is essential before you buy. Why is a strong community so important for a crypto you hope will 1000x? A strong, engaged community is critical because it drives word-of-mouth marketing, creates social media buzz that attracts new investors, provides support for the project, and encourages wider adoption – all essential for a crypto to achieve 1000x potential. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), for instance, is actively nurturing its ""Dawgz Army"" to help it become one of the top coins to watch.

These are coins that start super cheap – often just fractions of a cent – but have the potential to shoot up in price, making big returns for early birds. As we look at the market in May 2025, the big question is: which meme coin has what it takes to make that incredible jump? We'll explore what makes these coins special and take a close look at Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , a new meme coin that’s mixing AI utility with meme fun, making it a coin to watch today. Why Are Meme Coins Often the Next Penny Cryptos to Surge? You might wonder why meme coins are so often talked about when people look for the next penny crypto to surge. It’s a good question! The connection is pretty clear when you look at how these coins work and how the market sees them. First off, many meme coins start their journey with a very low price per coin. We're talking prices way under a dollar, often just tiny parts of a cent. This automatically puts them in the ""penny crypto"" category. Second, meme coins are built for attention. They use funny internet themes, popular characters (often dogs, like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu!), and catchy names. This makes them easy to talk about and share on social media like X, Reddit, and Telegram. When a meme coin catches on and lots of people start talking about it, that interest can create a wave of buying. Third, the risk and reward are both very high, which attracts a certain type of investor. Because their value is often based more on hype and community feeling than on technology, their prices can be super volatile. This means they can jump up incredibly fast, but they can also drop quickly. However, it's important to remember that not all meme coins will surge. Many will fade away. The trick is finding the ones that have something extra – a strong plan, a truly dedicated community, or a unique idea – that could help them stand out and become the next penny crypto to surge in 2025. Key Signs a Meme Coin is Worth Investing in While it’s never a guarantee in the crypto world, there are definitely some important signs to watch out for. These clues can help you pick a meme coin that has a better shot at taking off, rather than just being a flash in the pan. A Super Strong and Active Community: This is maybe the biggest one for meme coins. Is there a real ""army"" of fans online? Look at their X, Telegram, and Reddit. Are people excited, talking, sharing ideas, and promoting the coin? A passionate community can make a meme coin go viral. A Unique Angle or Story: Does the meme coin have something special about it? Just being another dog coin might not be enough anymore. Is there a cool theme, a funny idea, or even better, a connection to something new and exciting, like Artificial Intelligence? A unique story makes the coin more interesting and memorable. The Coin's Setup: This sounds technical, but it's about how many coins there are and how they work. Is there a limited supply, or can they just keep making more? Are there rewards for holding the coin? A good setup can help the price go up if lots of people want to buy the coin. Listing Potential: Is the team behind the coin actually trying to get the word out? Are they active online, and do they have plans to get the coin listed on more crypto exchanges? Being easy to buy on popular exchanges is a big deal for a coin to explode. A Sign of Real Plans or Utility: This is becoming super important. While memes are fun, the best meme coins often have a little something extra. Are there plans for the coin to be used in a game, for a special service, or with new tech like AI? This shows the project is thinking about the long term, not just a quick pump. Security Checks (Audits): Has a trusted company checked the coin's computer code (its ""smart contract"") to make sure it's safe and doesn't have big flaws? This is called an audit, and it’s a very good sign of a serious project. Finding a meme coin that ticks these boxes takes a bit of homework. But if you spot these positive signs, you might just be onto a crypto that’s getting ready for a major price surge today or in the near future of 2025. The Meme Coin Poised to Be the Next Penny Crypto to Surge in 2025 Could $DAGZ be the one that breaks out from its low price point and delivers those big gains everyone is hoping for? Let’s see what makes it a top coin to watch. Meet Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) – it’s making a name for itself by being more than just your average meme coin, here’s why $DAGZ is so interesting: Smart Blend of Fun and Future – The AI Meme Power: What makes Dawgz AI really stand out is its clever mix of meme culture and AI technology. It takes the fun, shareable energy that makes meme coins explode in popularity and adds a layer of real utility with Artificial Intelligence. This combination is a hot ticket in 2025, attracting people who love memes and those excited about AI’s potential in crypto. You can usually find more about their vision, including videos, on their official website and active social media. Real Use Planned – Not Just a Joke Coin: A big problem with many meme coins is that they don’t do anything. Dawgz AI is different. The team has plans to offer real tools powered by AI. Imagine having AI helpers for crypto trading, getting smart market insights, or even creating new memes with AI. This focus on actual use gives $DAGZ real value and lasting potential, which is rare for a coin starting at a penny price. Safe and Secure – Checked by the Pros: Trust is a big deal in crypto. The computer code behind Dawgz AI (its smart contract) was checked out by a company called SolidProof. They did this audit early on (around June 4, 2024), even before the big presale push in 2025. This means they’re serious about making sure the project is safe for investors and that the tech is solid. People Are Already Interested – Strong Presale: A great sign for a new coin is how many people want it early on. Dawgz AI raised over $3.4 million in its presale phase! That shows a lot of investors believe in the idea and are excited about its future. This early excitement can build momentum for a big surge after it lists on more exchanges. The kind of message that makes you check twice. 📳💲 pic.twitter.com/9iaJyk7Vlw — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) April 15, 2025 Good Token Plan and Rewards for Holding: Dawgz AI has a set total number of $DAGZ tokens: 8.888 billion. This is good because it means they can’t just make endless new coins, which can lower the price. Plus, they’ve set aside 20% of all tokens for staking rewards. Staking is like earning interest on your crypto – you hold your $DAGZ tokens, and you get more over time. You could even start staking during the presale, which is a nice bonus. Clear Future Plans – A Roadmap to Success: Dawgz AI isn’t just about a quick launch, they have a roadmap that shows their plans for the future. It includes stages like ""Puppyhood"" (getting started with the token and audit), ""Growing the Pack"" (building the community and AI tech, first exchange listings), ""The Big Dog Stage"" (adding more features, marketing worldwide), and ""Alpha Dog Status"" (becoming a mature platform with big partnerships). This shows they’re serious about long term growth. Conclusion: Spotting the Next Meme Coin Before it Surge Finding the best meme coin to buy that could also be the next penny crypto to surge is an exciting part of being in the crypto market. It’s like looking for a hidden gem! While it takes some luck, focusing on meme coins that have a unique idea (like adding AI), a strong community, and real plans for the future can boost your chances. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is showing a lot of these good signs, making it a coin to watch for a potential big price jump in 2025.

This rally comes amid rising optimism over a potential settlement between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could redefine XRP’s regulatory status in the United States. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.37, with a robust 24-hour trading volume of $5.03 billion, reflecting strong market interest. Legal Developments and ETF Speculation Fuel Rally; XRP Supported The SEC vs. Ripple case remains a major catalyst for XRP’s price action. Recent court documents reveal that the SEC has requested Judge Analisa Torres to reconsider a prior ruling, a move that some analysts see as a potential sign of settlement discussions. If resolved, this two-year legal battle could remove one of the biggest regulatory overhangs for XRP, possibly clearing the way for broader institutional adoption. The SEC vs. Ripple case nears its end, and XRP holders have questions. What does the May 8 settlement mean? Will XRP thrive? This thread breaks down the facts: settlement terms, ETFs, regulatory shifts, institutional adoption, no hype, just clarity. #XRP #XRPL @Ripple pic.twitter.com/KE2DvIY7fB — JDNomax (@JDNomax) May 10, 2025 Adding to the bullish momentum, rumors of an XRP ETF launch in 2025 have further stoked market enthusiasm. According to reports, this potential ETF could significantly boost institutional inflows, similar to the impact seen with Bitcoin ETFs, which collectively added over $1 billion in net inflows last week. If approved, an XRP ETF could provide a more accessible investment vehicle for institutional investors, further supporting XRP’s price growth. Recent Key Developments: XRP up nearly 30% in the past week SEC’s letter to Judge Torres hints at possible settlement Rumors of XRP ETF in 2025 fuel institutional interest Whale Accumulation Signals Institutional Confidence In addition to legal optimism, large-scale XRP transactions suggest growing institutional interest. On May 9, Ripple-affiliated whales moved a staggering 370 million XRP, worth approximately $782 million . These transfers included a 70 million XRP transaction ($148.3 million) and a 300 million XRP transfer ($633.7 million), according to Whale Alert data. Such large movements often indicate strategic positioning by institutional investors, possibly in anticipation of a favorable legal outcome or a major market event. XRP Whale Just Moved $782 Million — What’s Going On? https://t.co/ZiBzDNi1wh — Marco Ħ (@MarcoSalzmann80) May 11, 2025 On-chain metrics further support this narrative. According to Santiment, the share of XRP held by whales (addresses with between 1 million and 10 million XRP) has risen from 8.24% to 9.44% over the past three months, reflecting a significant accumulation phase. This trend suggests that large investors are increasingly viewing XRP as a long-term bet, reinforcing the bullish case for the token. Whale Activity Highlights: 370 million XRP moved on May 9, worth $782 million Whale-held XRP share increased from 8.24% to 9.44% in recent months Large-scale transactions signal growing institutional confidence Ripple’s Strategic Moves: Expanding XRP Ecosystem and Halting Quarterly Market Reports Apart from this, Ripple has made important moves to grow the XRP ecosystem. Ondo Finance plans to launch a tokenized U.S. Treasury fund on the XRP Ledger, which is seen as a major development. This fund will give institutional investors access to U.S. government-backed assets through blockchain technology, using Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin for minting and redemption. This could make XRP more attractive to institutional investors.

Ripple halts quarterly market reports, raising transparency concerns. Technical Outlook: Bulls Aim for $2.48 From a technical perspective, XRP price prediction is bullish as it’s trading around $2.3748, consolidating just below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $2.3890. This level, which aligns closely with an ascending trendline, serves as a critical support zone. If bulls can defend this area, the immediate upside target is the recent high at $2.4762, followed by the psychological $2.50 level. However, the MACD is showing early signs of a bearish crossover, suggesting a possible short-term pullback. Traders should watch for a potential drop below $2.3351, which could expose XRP to deeper losses toward the 50% Fibonacci level at $2.2915. Trade Setup: Buy Above: $2.3350 Take Profit: $2.4760 Stop Loss: $2.2915 Strategy: Consider buying above $2.3350, targeting the recent high at $2.4760. Use a tight stop below $2.2915 to manage downside risk, as a break below this level could trigger a deeper correction.

Altcoins are also rallying, with Ethereum leading the pack. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin is still in a bullish trend, with the price now approaching the $105,000 level. Currently, Bitcoin is showing strong signs on the weekly chart. The MACD, a momentum indicator, is close to confirming a bullish crossover, which hasn’t happened since October 2024. Past crossovers like this have led to strong rallies, so traders are watching for confirmation at the next weekly close. A cluster of liquidity near $105,000 is drawing attention. Historically, Bitcoin tends to gravitate toward such areas, making a move toward that level likely in the coming days. Strong resistance may appear around $106,000–$109,000, near previous all-time highs. Ethereum Price: Ethereum has finally gone back above $2,500, showing some real strength after weeks of slow movement. A recent network upgrade called Pectra didn’t have much of an impact at first, but now that prices are going up, investors are starting to feel more confident again. The price has now broken above the $2,500 level, which is a strong sign of recovery. ETH had found solid support around $1,500 in past months, and it’s now pushing through resistance zones between $2,700 and $2,800. XRP Price: XRP has also seen a sharp move, jumping to about $2.48. This rise came without any major news, which suggests it could be driven by short-term hype or speculation. XRP sentiment is currently high, but some analysts warn it could be a temporary spike unless stronger news supports the price. A confirmed breakout above $2.45 could mark the start of a new uptrend, with possible resistance ahead at $2.56, $2.80, and $3. If the breakout fails, support lies near $2.30. However, momentum is building as XRP tests the top of its descending channel. Solana Solana continues its strong upward trend, driven by a long-standing bullish divergence. The price recently broke above the key 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $167. The next resistance zones to watch are around $179 and then the major “golden pocket” range between $191 and $200. If prices dip, support is expected at $167, $154, and $146.

44471248,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66696,1746961225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,From Utility to Price Action — MUTM May Deliver a 15x Return Faster Than Anyone Expected,https://timestabloid.com/from-utility-to-price-action-mutm-may-deliver-a-15x-return-faster/,"In a market where speculation often outpaces substance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reversing the trend. Instead of chasing hype, the project has focused on delivering real tools for decentralized finance—earning the attention of serious traders who care as much about utility as they do about price action. But now, as its presale continues to gain traction, there’s growing talk that the price might catch up with its fundamentals a lot sooner than expected. Some projections already suggest that a 15x return from today’s price isn’t just possible—it might arrive faster than many are prepared for. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The protocol is designed to let users borrow and lend digital assets without handing over control of their funds. Everything runs on smart contracts, removing middlemen and manual processing entirely. On the lending side, users deposit their assets into smart contract-based liquidity pools and receive mtTokens, which represent their holdings and accumulate interest over time. Borrowers, on the other hand, lock up collateral and access overcollateralized loans—with no expiration date—as long as their position remains healthy. It’s a straightforward system built on tested mechanics. But it’s the execution that sets Mutuum apart. With clear on-chain automation, transparent design, and a real-time interest model based on pool utilization, the platform doesn’t just describe utility—it enables it. While the fundamentals have always been strong, what’s catching attention now is the shift toward price momentum. Currently in its fourth presale phase, MUTM is priced at $0.025. More than $7.8 million has been raised, with over 450 million tokens sold, and the round is closing in on 70% completion. Once this phase wraps up, the price will climb to $0.03, and the official launch price is set at $0.06. But based on current adoption and early investor interest, analysts believe this launch price might just be the start. Internal forecasts from several market watchers suggest the token could reach $0.375, which would represent a 15x return from the current price. Unlike many new projects that spike purely from hype, Mutuum is seeing interest flow from its core mechanics. As the protocol introduces additional features—like its upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin, built entirely within the platform’s own lending infrastructure—its use cases are expanding in a sustainable way. This stablecoin will be minted directly from collateral supplied by borrowers. It doesn’t rely on external liquidity pools or centralized reserves. Once repaid, the tokens are burned, which keeps the supply aligned with actual borrowing activity. That kind of functional design attracts long-term holders who want more than just short-term gains. For users and traders evaluating what crypto to invest in, this blend of real-world function and market timing creates a rare window. It’s not often that utility and early pricing line up in a way that allows for calculated entries with outsized potential upside. The crypto space moves fast—and so do presales. With momentum building and the next price increase locked in, early buyers are positioning themselves before MUTM steps into broader market awareness. This phase of the presale offers one of the last chances to acquire tokens at this low valuation before price movement begins reflecting demand. And with more than 9,600 holders already onboard, it’s clear that investors aren’t just watching from the sidelines—they’re securing positions ahead of schedule. MUTM isn’t promising overnight gains. It’s delivering a working product, a smart system for generating passive income, and a protocol designed with long-term functionality in mind. That’s exactly why seasoned traders are paying attention—and why a 15x move from today’s level no longer feels like a stretch. For those still exploring the best cryptocurrency to invest in, Mutuum Finance may not be a secret much longer. From smart contract utility to market movement, all the signs are pointing in one direction—and the window to catch it early is still open.

The exploit, which was detected by security firm Cyvers Alerts, happened in the early hours of May 11. According to the security firm, the hackers deployed the contract from address 0xb32a53… at 07:31:38 UTC and initiated the exploit at 07:33:56 UTC, draining funds from the victim wallet 0xb5252f… According to the report, Cyvers mentioned that the attacker used contract 0x631adf…to carry out a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained about 28.5 million MBU tokens worth about $2,152,219.99, converting them into stablecoins after the theft. Mobius suffers a smart contract hack on BNB Chain According to Cyvers’ statement , the Mobius exploit was “critical”, with the platform noting the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns. “Two minutes before the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X. As of the time of writing, the attacker’s wallet remains active. 🚨ALERT🚨 Our system has detected an exploit on Mobius Token smart contracts, draining over $2.15M in Mobius Token ($MBU) on BNB Chain. Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract, that eventually targeted the Mobius Token… pic.twitter.com/NEG5AXdfoc — 🚨 Cyvers Alerts 🚨 (@CyversAlerts) May 11, 2025 In a follow-up post, Cyvers mentioned that the attacker has deposited the funds to Tornado Cash, a decentralized platform that runs on Ethereum and acts as a money mixer. The platform obscures fund trails, so it doesn’t get connected back to its original source. However, the Mobius Token team is yet to release an official statement acknowledging the development. Meanwhile, crypto losses to illicit activities and actors inched close to $360 million in April. Last month, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the crypto industry witnessed losses across 18 different hacking incidents. According to Hacken CEO Dyma Budorin, crypto firms have still not changed their approach to cybersecurity, and it has led to more of these hacks happening. Despite the $1.4 billion lost in the recent Bybit hack early this year, Budorin mentioned that one would think that these firms would increase security measures, noting that they have continued to rely on the usual measures, including bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than using comprehensive security strategies. “Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.” According to reports, the largest chunk of the losses in April came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer worth $330 million. The theft, which now ranks as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history, was carried out using social engineering tactics. The wallet was said to have belonged to an elderly United States citizen, with on-chain sleuth ZachXBT flagging the transaction and revealing key details about the exploit.

Is Something Big Coming?,https://timestabloid.com/whale-makes-massive-xrp-move-is-something-big-coming/,"A recent development has sparked curiosity among XRP enthusiasts and the broader crypto community. According to Xaif, a prominent figure on X, a crypto whale has just acquired a staggering 11 million XRP from the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit. The news has led to widespread speculation about the potential reasons behind this significant purchase and what it might mean for XRP’s future. The Mysterious Whale Activity The substantial acquisition of 11 million XRP, worth millions of dollars at current market prices, has raised questions about the whale’s intentions. Such large transactions often hint at strategic moves, as whales typically buy in bulk when they anticipate a major price surge or positive market development. BREAKING: A crypto whale just scooped up 11,000,000 $XRP from Korean giant Upbit! Is something BIG coming? pic.twitter.com/sObAcjnHqn — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 11, 2025 Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has witnessed increased activity related to XRP in recent months. This latest transaction, however, stands out due to its sheer size. Crypto whales, known for influencing market trends, might be positioning themselves ahead of an anticipated breakout or favorable news regarding XRP. What Could Be Driving the Move? There are several possible explanations for this massive XRP purchase. One theory is that the whale anticipates an upcoming bullish trend for XRP , potentially driven by Ripple’s ongoing legal victories or advancements in adoption. Recently, Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has seen favorable developments, making investors increasingly optimistic. Another possibility is that the whale is preparing for a strategic partnership or institutional adoption involving XRP. Ripple has continued to expand its payment network and increase partnerships worldwide, bolstering XRP’s utility as a bridge currency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Reactions and Speculations The news has stirred discussions within the XRP community. Some speculate that the whale could have insider information about upcoming announcements related to Ripple or significant market movements. However, without concrete evidence, these remain speculative assumptions. Price Implications Historically, whale movements have impacted XRP’s price trajectory . If the purchase signals a broader trend of accumulation, it could drive upward pressure on XRP’s price in the coming weeks. Market analysts will be closely monitoring for any follow-up transactions or additional signals that might clarify the whale’s intentions. While the reasons behind this significant XRP purchase remain unclear, the acquisition has undoubtedly captured the attention of investors. As the market speculates on the whale’s motives, the potential for a breakout or significant price movement cannot be overlooked. With Ripple’s ongoing progress and the growing utility of XRP, the coming weeks could prove crucial in determining the asset’s next direction.

That’s the question stirring the pot as the meme coin market claws its way back into the spotlight. Bitcoin’s recent strength and Ethereum’s rebound have set the tone for an altcoin lift, but surprisingly, some of the smaller meme tokens are making the loudest noise. DOGS ($DOGS) jumped 25.24% in the last 24 hours, and Baby Doge Coin ($BabyDoge) followed with a 16.98% pump, outpacing broader market averages. While those numbers are undeniably bullish, they don’t tell the whole story. Both DOGS and Baby Doge are seeing volume surges and renewed attention, but the hype is starting to outpace substance underneath the hood. Meanwhile, a new player— Troller Cat ($TCAT)—is flipping the game with a live presale and a structured plan to reward early believers. Meme coins have always been about timing, narrative, and crowd energy. We’ve watched the likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu create millionaires overnight. But the space is evolving. Traders are hunting for the next big one, not just the next loud one. That’s why the Troller Cat presale is gaining serious traction and positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now, especially as Stage 4 is underway with a jaw-dropping 6,044.68% ROI potential by launch. Troller Cat ($TCAT): The Smart Meme Coin for the Next Cycle Troller Cat ($TCAT) isn’t just another token with a tail. It’s a fully designed meme coin ecosystem, and the roaring presale. Stage 4 is live at $0.00000864, and the projected ROI to launch price ($0.0005309) sits at 6,044.68%. That’s not a typo. If someone drops $20,000 into Stage 4 today, they’d receive around 2.31 billion $TCAT—worth approximately $1.22 million at launch. Now, let’s talk strategy. Trollercat isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s engineering it. The presale spans 26 price-increasing stages, creating natural demand pressure. The earlier you buy in, the more upside you secure. Unlike DOGS or Baby Doge Coin, Troller Cat has put smart tokenomics, deflation, and utility at the center of its growth engine. It’s audited. KYC verified. Built on Ethereum. Liquidity is locked for two years. And the Play-to-Earn Game Center is structured to reduce supply via ad-revenue-driven token burns. That means the more people play, the fewer tokens exist. Scarcity meets scale. Staking and Passive Income (69% APY) This is where things get real for long-term holders. Trollercat offers a staking program with a 69% APY during presale. That’s right—while the token appreciates through stage progression, holders can also earn passive income. Staking begins at Stage 9, but buying now lets users prepare in advance for double-dip rewards. Trollercat.com lays it out clearly. It’s not just about holding—it’s about holding smart. The APY is locked and distributed over time, keeping dumpers at bay. It’s one of the only meme coin projects that pays you while it grows. Combine that with referral benefits—a 10% bonus for referrals and on purchases—and you have a self-expanding ecosystem. With $80,000+ already raised and early Stage 1 buyers up over 72.8%, this cat is sprinting. Investors who want to capture real passive income, strategic growth, and meme magic all in one bag are circling Troller Cat as the best crypto to buy now. DOGS ($DOGS): Fast Climb, But Is It Built to Last? DOGS has had a wild 24-hour ride, posting a 25.24% gain and hitting $0.0001889. Technically, it broke above its 7-day resistance and triggered fresh buying across DEX platforms. Social media mentions are spiking, and short-term sentiment is bullish. This price action catches eyeballs, and speculative traders circle like hawks. But what’s fueling the growth beyond the chart? That’s where it gets murky. DOGS doesn’t have a roadmap update or platform expansion to back the pump. The rally seems primarily driven by whale moves and influencer chatter, which can be fickle. The liquidity depth has improved, and momentum is currently up—but can it hold? Technicals suggest another push toward $0.0002 is possible, but a failure to flip that into solid support could trigger a retracement. If you’re stacking DOGS, it’s probably not for the long-term kennel. Investors looking for the best crypto to buy now are likely weighing short-term flips against sustainable gains, and DOGS may not deliver the latter just yet. Baby Doge Coin ($BabyDoge): Nostalgia Hits, But Will It Stick? Baby Doge Coin has always had name recognition going for it—and in crypto, that matters. Its 16.98% climb over the last 24 hours to $0.000000001569 is fueled by a strong meme heritage and an engaged fanbase. Some traders are returning based on momentum alone, seeing the coin retrace losses from late April. From a technical perspective, BabyDoge is bouncing from oversold levels. Volume on Binance and PancakeSwap has spiked, pushing RSI into neutral territory and MACD into positive alignment. It’s a solid recovery play, but is there fuel for more? That depends on how you define utility. Baby Doge has attempted to develop a payment ecosystem with a charity wallet element, but recent development has been relatively quiet. The team hasn’t released any significant upgrades, and its burn mechanism is slow compared to newer entrants. It’s trading well right now, and its nostalgia factor makes it appealing—but for those seeking the best crypto to buy now, especially something with built-in growth mechanics, BabyDoge may still be coasting on old fumes. Long-term conviction might require more than just a cute logo and a historic chart. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, DOGS and Baby Doge Coin are seeing short-term momentum, but their long-term paths remain uncertain. Meanwhile, Troller Cat has set itself apart with hype, smart staking, structured scarcity, and real upside. With 6044% ROI potential, 69% APY staking, and a live presale already in Stage 4, Troller Cat isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, it’s time to stop chasing pumps and start investing with purpose. Head to Trollercat.com and grab your tokens before the next stage flips.

Twitter has changed the world and Dorsey’s Square Payments company’s CashApp was a very early corporate innovator in Bitcoin. Way back in 2019, CashApp started offering BTC custody services that account holders could buy with their credit card. Overnight, its users began doing on a smaller scale precisely what has made MicroStrategy (now Strategy) a Wall Street sensation more lately. Today, Square is named Block. Its shares just plunged by 20% to start off May. Dorsey warned investors of turbulent times for the US consumer strength. Ironically, while that’s not good news for Block’s business model, it could be the catalyst that drives Bitcoin’s price to $1 million. Consumer Weakness to Spur Fed Rate Cut? After Block’s earnings report, the CEO of one of the largest payment processing apps in the world said consumer spending has shifted dramatically. “This coincided with inflows coming in below our expectations. During the quarter, non-discretionary Cash App Card spend in areas like grocery and gas was more resilient, while we saw a more pronounced impact on discretionary spending in areas like travel and media. We believe this consumer softness was a key driver of our forecast miss.” The cutbacks on spending drove lower sales in Q1, which saw the US economy shrink for the first quarter in three years. If it happens for a second quarter in a row, it meets the most commonly used definition of a recession by formal economists. As a result, the central bank is apt to cut interest rates to get business going again. A CNBC survey finds rate cuts likely this year due to the wobbling economy. That could be what launches BTC prices again to the $1 million level, as Dorsey has previously predicted. Dorsey Forecasts $1 Million BTC by 2030 When the Fed cut rates in 2007-08, Bitcoin started operating for the first time. During the ensuing multi-year low interest rate regime, BTC prices soared from thousandths of a penny to $20,000 by Dec. 2017. By then, the Fed had raised rates again, and Bitcoin’s price had crashed. It began to recover after the Fed slashed rates again in 2020 and soared to a new record high of $69,000 by Nov. 2021. The landscape seems rather similar now, but BTC’s price is actually well above $100,000 even after the Fed’s third consecutive refusal to lower the rates.

The biggest winners often don’t make headlines at first — they gain traction among early adopters, build solid infrastructure, and then seemingly appear everywhere overnight. Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is sitting at just $0.025, quietly gaining interest from serious investors. It hasn’t hit mainstream feeds yet, but those who are paying attention say this may be the best cryptocurrency to invest in before the crowd catches on. MUTM isn’t just another low-priced token — it’s the foundation of a decentralized ecosystem that’s taking a deliberate, structured approach to long-term value. And while the buzz around it is still developing, the progress behind the scenes tells a different story. Why Investors Are Looking at MUTM Now In a space where hype often outweighs utility, Mutuum Finance stands out for building before broadcasting. The protocol focuses on decentralized lending and borrowing, offering a non-custodial platform where users can earn interest or unlock liquidity using overcollateralized digital assets. What makes the project more than just a DeFi clone is its infrastructure-first mindset. Instead of launching the token first and building afterward, Mutuum is timing its token release to coincide with the rollout of its beta platform. That means when the token hits exchanges, users will already be able to engage with real utility — a rare move for new projects. This level of preparation is one of the reasons why investors tracking what crypto to invest in are already building positions. Mutuum is currently in the fourth phase of its eleven-phase presale, with more than 66% of this round already finalized. So far, it has raised more than $7.8 million and brought in over 9,600 holders. These aren’t just passive wallet numbers — they represent early community involvement and growing trust in the project’s direction. The current token price remains at $0.025, but this is set to increase to $0.03 in the next round. By the time it reaches its $0.06 launch price, early buyers would already be up 140%. But analysts suggest that’s just the initial leg. Projections for MUTM range much higher in the months after launch — with some forecasting a rise to $0.72, which would mark a 2,780% increase from today’s entry point. While predictions should always be taken with caution, this kind of potential makes it a strong candidate among next big cryptocurrency opportunities. The MUTM token isn’t designed for speculation alone. A key part of Mutuum’s protocol model involves cycling value directly back into the token. Specifically, a portion of the revenue generated by the platform is used to buy MUTM from the open market. Those tokens are then redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens — a system that encourages platform usage while creating consistent demand pressure for the token itself. This is more than just an incentive mechanism — it helps align long-term holders with the growth of the platform, creating a self-reinforcing structure that many DeFi protocols lack. Another major feature drawing attention is Mutuum’s introduction of an overcollateralized stablecoin. Pegged to the U.S. dollar, this token will be minted when users lock up assets beyond the value of their loan. The design eliminates reliance on centralized backing, giving users greater confidence in its price integrity. More importantly, interest payments on stablecoin loans are funneled back into the protocol, further strengthening Mutuum’s financial base. This cycle not only enhances platform resilience but also gives MUTM a deeper layer of utility — something experts consistently look for when evaluating long-term cryptocurrency investments. To ensure the safety of users’ funds, Mutuum is currently undergoing a full audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the industry. This shows the team’s commitment to transparency and secure development, something experienced investors increasingly expect from any serious DeFi project. MUTM may still be under the radar, but the foundation it’s laying is designed for something much bigger. With a working product on the way, a strong token model, and growing presale momentum, this could be the kind of early-stage entry point that rarely sticks around. The price is still low. The attention is just beginning. For investors looking into cryptocurrency opportunities ahead of the next breakout, Mutuum Finance is emerging as one of the most promising contenders in today’s market.

Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO recently took to X to sound the alarm , declaring that XRP’s breakout is imminent and warning investors that they might regret not buying more within the next three to six weeks. This bold assertion has sparked a wave of speculation and analysis within the crypto space, with enthusiasts and traders alike wondering whether this is the long-anticipated upward move that could redefine XRP’s market trajectory. #XRP breakout imminent! In 3-6 weeks from now, you'll regret not having bought more. pic.twitter.com/cSGE26Mi9v — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 10, 2025 Understanding the Current Market Sentiment XRP’s price action has been relatively subdued in recent months, but sentiment has been gradually shifting. The latest post from STEPH IS CRYPTO has acted as a catalyst, pushing traders to reassess their positions. According to the analyst, technical indicators are aligning to signal a significant move, making now a critical time for investors to pay attention. In the broader market context, XRP’s potential breakout is being observed amid a phase where several altcoins are displaying bullish patterns. Historically, XRP has shown the capacity for sudden price surges, especially following prolonged periods of consolidation. Technical Indicators Pointing to a Breakout A key factor fueling the optimism around XRP is the series of technical signals pointing towards an impending breakout. Analysts note that the token has been consolidating near crucial resistance levels, and once breached, a rapid price escalation could follow. One of the primary indicators cited is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is inching closer to the overbought territory — typically a precursor to upward momentum. Additionally, trading volumes have seen a slight uptick, hinting at growing investor interest. Chart patterns, particularly the formation resembling a bullish pennant, further support the breakout narrative. Why Timing Matters: The 3-6 Week Window In his post, STEPH IS CRYPTO emphasizes a specific timeline of three to six weeks, during which he believes XRP could make a substantial move. This projection is rooted in the convergence of technical patterns and market dynamics that historically precede significant price shifts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This period is crucial because it aligns with several upcoming macroeconomic factors and possible regulatory updates that could influence the market. As such, both short-term traders and long-term holders are keeping a vigilant eye on XRP’s price movements. FOMO or a Genuine Opportunity? The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a powerful force in the crypto market, and STEPH IS CRYPTO’s statement has undeniably stirred it. While some may view this as a speculative play, others see it as an opportunity grounded in technical analysis. Given XRP’s history of rapid price movements following consolidation phases, the potential for a breakout aligns with past performance patterns. However, as always in the volatile crypto market, caution and strategic planning are essential. Should You Buy More XRP? With STEPH IS CRYPTO’s analysis highlighting the possibility of a breakout within weeks, investors are left to weigh the risks and rewards. While the potential upside is enticing, it’s essential to consider one’s risk tolerance and investment strategy. Whether or not the prediction materializes, the current setup makes XRP a focal point for traders looking to capitalize on a potential bullish phase. As the market awaits confirmation of the breakout, investors should stay informed and make calculated decisions based on emerging data.

In a press release , the US Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Alabama says that Hunter Hudson, Jr., and seven other people have been sentenced to prison in an elaborate bank fraud scheme that caused an intended loss amount of more than $1.5 million. The group, which referred to itself in a group chat as the “Fraud Academy,” stole checks, altered them and then deposited them into fraudulent bank accounts, according to prosecutors. The US Postal Service aided in the investigation, according to the press release. Says Timothy J. O’Malley, Acting Special Agent in Charge with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), “Any attempt to exploit our postal or banking systems is a serious violation of the public’s trust. These actions will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Protecting the integrity of our postal and financial systems is essential and non-negotiable.” 25-year-old Hunter Hudson, the ringleader of the operation, was arrested in May of last year. Local news outlet Fox 13 reported that his rap lyrics gave the investigators material for their probe. Captain Eric Hill with the Venice Police Department in Florida said that Hudson “drove around throughout the whole region of the United States and he would steal mail.” “He would wash those checks or use the account information on those checks to then make fraudulent deposits into other individuals’ accounts who would agree to be part of this scam with them.” Hudson was sentenced to 92 months in prison and was ordered to pay $987,883.50 in restitution and to forfeit $91,020.41.

According to a recent X post by popular analyst CW, XRP’s convergence breakout is just around the corner, and the next target price is set at $4.5. The prediction has ignited discussions within the community, as investors are eager to understand the factors behind this anticipated move. $XRP 's convergence breakout is imminent. The bext target is $4.5 according to the pattern pic.twitter.com/6TmJc2ctRP — CW (@CW8900) May 10, 2025 Understanding Convergence Breakout A convergence breakout occurs when the price of an asset, after consolidating within a tightening range, finally breaks through a critical resistance level . This phenomenon often indicates a potential surge in momentum, as pent-up buying or selling pressure gets released. For XRP, this pattern is forming at a crucial juncture, making the next few trading sessions particularly significant. What Makes XRP’s Convergence Breakout Different? CW’s analysis suggests that the current market conditions surrounding XRP are unique compared to previous breakout patterns. The convergence is not merely technical but also influenced by macroeconomic factors and growing adoption within the financial ecosystem. Ripple’s ongoing strategic expansions, coupled with the regulatory clarity emerging from recent legal developments, have bolstered market confidence in XRP. Price Target and Technical Indicators The predicted target of $4.5 aligns with chart patterns indicating a bullish continuation. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are also hinting at upward momentum. If XRP manages to break past its resistance zone, the rally could gain significant traction, reaching or even surpassing CW’s anticipated price mark. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Community Reactions The prediction from CW has stirred excitement among XRP holders. Many believe that cryptocurrency is on the brink of a major price movement, driven by increased trading volume and favorable market sentiment. Online discussions reflect a cautious optimism, with some investors positioning themselves to capitalize on the potential breakout. As the XRP market braces for what could be a monumental price shift, the convergence breakout theory put forth by CW remains a focal point of analysis. If XRP hits the $4.5 mark, it would not only affirm the technical predictions but also solidify the asset’s resilience amid market fluctuations. Investors are closely monitoring key resistance levels, hoping to ride the wave as XRP approaches its next big milestone.

Ethereum and XRP rebound sharply from April lows amid renewed market optimism. Conor McGregor calls for an Irish Bitcoin reserve, fueling further bullish sentiment. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are poised to maintain their upward trend amid favorable developments in ongoing trade talks between China and the U.S. On Saturday, U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland to de-escalate the tariff war, during which both countries had imposed tariffs of over 100% on imports from each other. The initial tariff announcement in April unsettled financial markets, including crypto. However, a relief statement from President Trump later brought renewed optimism. The biggest boost to the crypto market came last week after news broke that the U.S. and China would hold negotiations over the weekend.

However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long. Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin’s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains flat near $94K , XRP continues its recent slide, and Solana (SOL) edges higher off recent lows. But while attention stays fixed on these majors, Chainlink (LINK) is quietly becoming one of the most-watched tokens heading into mid-year. And now, MAGACOINFINANCE is breaking into the conversation as a speculative standout building its own lane. Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana Form a Standoff — While LINK Advances Bitcoin (BTC): Holding Steady Ahead of Fed Signals Bitcoin trades in a narrow band between $93,800 and $94,200 , awaiting fresh direction. A slight daily loss of 0.5% hasn’t shaken long-term confidence, but with the May 7 Federal Reserve announcement looming, investors are watching closely. Key resistance near $99,000–$100,000 has yet to be breached. XRP: Down 7% With Uncertainty Over RLUSD and ETF Hopes XRP , now at $2.08 , has dropped 7% over the past five days . Ripple’s pivot toward its RLUSD stablecoin has clouded utility clarity, even as ETF speculation (77% odds) continues to hold some investor interest. Short-term pressure remains, with potential long-term upside if institutional developments materialize. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Solana (SOL): Modest Gains and Network Strength Solana posted a 1.96% daily gain , now trading at $146.81 . Its yearly rise of 179.9% has made it one of the most consistent performers. Developer activity and user growth continue to boost its position despite April’s volatility. Chainlink (LINK): Flying Under the Radar — But Not for Long Currently valued at $13.41 , LINK has been steadily rising on trader watchlists. Despite a 1.55% 24-hour dip , analysts predict upside to $14–$15.30 by July, with bullish cases pushing toward $19.63 . Its quiet strength is drawing attention from value-focused investors anticipating a breakout. MAGACOINFINANCE Joins the Watchlists as Altcoin Rotations Expand CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST As the majors remain locked in their respective narratives, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground in presale circles. Currently in Stage 7 and priced under $0.001 , the project is capturing momentum from its unique branding, political positioning, and exclusive early access. This is not a direct competitor to BTC or SOL — it’s carving out a distinct identity in narrative-driven crypto investing . Analysts see MAGACOINFINANCE as one of 2025’s most compelling speculative plays due to: A projected 35x ROI based on presale-to-listing modeling Retail-first positioning and political meme coin appeal Growing social traction, especially on Discord and Twitter A limited supply and tiered structure that incentivizes early entries MAGACOINFINANCE by the Numbers +22% weekly growth in daily active Discord users Steady token holder increase with each presale phase Transparent public roadmap and community-focused development LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Final Take: As Market Diverges, Traders Rebalance Portfolios Bitcoin continues to serve as the macro anchor as traders await macroeconomic direction. XRP faces structural pivots, Solana pushes through with ecosystem strength, and LINK quietly prepares for an upside surge. But as presale cycles heat up, MAGACOINFINANCE is making its case as the high-risk, high-reward play for those looking beyond the familiar. With 2025’s altcoin cycle entering its mid-phase, capital may increasingly flow toward assets that offer narrative power, scarcity, and entry-stage upside.

The report predicts that if the crypto market moves towards an optimistic scenario, Ethereum’s price could rise to as high as $10,000 if Bitcoin surpasses $300,000 this cycle. The report, which stated that ETH's financial foundations are still strong, stated that Ethereum maintains its position as the most important infrastructure in the crypto finance world. According to the data, the total amount of locked assets (TVL) in the ETH DeFi ecosystem is around $ 60 billion, which accounts for more than 53% of the global DeFi market. On the stablecoin side, the total market value of stablecoins on Ethereum is $ 124 billion, representing more than 50% of the global market.

According to the report, the prediction that the ETH price could reach $5,000 this cycle is based on the following factors: The end of the quantitative tightening (QT) process in the US and the start of interest rate cuts; With the possible change in the SEC chairmanship, the expectation of progress in tokenization and staking laws on the ETH chain; Stability in the Ethereum Foundation's infrastructure development and roadmap management; Maintaining stable growth of the on-chain financial ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

This breakout came after a multi-week accumulation phase and a clean breakout from a descending trendline on both the 1D and 4H charts. What’s Happening With PEPE’s Price? PEPE price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The PEPE price action has formed a strong bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart, pushing past multiple resistance zones in the $0.00000800 to $0.00001100 range.

On the Fibonacci retracement (weekly chart), PEPE is now hovering between the 0.618 level at $0.00001206 and the 0.5 level near $0.00001448, which will likely act as short-term resistance.

The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $174.59, up 47% over the past month and 20% in the last week alone. This surge comes as Solana benefits from a mix of technical breakouts, rising DeFi activity, and improving market sentiment. DeFi Dominance and Cross-Chain Inflows Drive Solana’s Momentum One of the primary drivers of Solana’s recent surge is its growing influence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. According to DefiLlama , Solana recorded $3.32 billion in 24-hour decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, capturing nearly 29% of the entire DEX market. This highlights Solana’s scalability and speed, making it an increasingly attractive choice for traders and developers. Solana low-key eating earth one bridge at a time.

These inflows underscore the growing confidence in Solana as a preferred network for DeFi and cross-chain transactions. Key DeFi Metrics: Major inflows from Ethereum and Arbitrum $3.32 billion in 24-hour DEX volume (29% market share) $165 million bridged from other chains Technical Breakouts Signal Further Upside for Solana Solana price prediction remains bullish as SOL recently cleared its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the key 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $167.39, confirming a strong bullish reversal. The price has also formed a “three white soldiers” pattern, a classic bullish signal, indicating sustained buying interest. Immediate resistance now stands at $178.33, with further targets at $183.95 and $189.60 if the momentum continues. However, the MACD is showing early signs of divergence, suggesting that bullish momentum might be cooling. Traders should watch for a potential pullback to the $167.39 support zone, which aligns closely with the 50-day EMA at $165.66. Technical Levels to Watch: Next Support: $157.15 Immediate Resistance: $178.33 Next Resistance: $183.95 Next Resistance: $189.60 Immediate Support: $167.39 Next Support: $164.01 $SOL outlook: looks like we've reclaimed the daily 200 ema with conviction. looking for a final push up to the daily supply into a correction to the 200 ema or a retest of the prev break of structure point pic.twitter.com/JLLib5qwES — JaviFX (@real_javifx) May 11, 2025 Thus, the decisive break and hold above this level could pave the way for further upside in the coming weeks or months, echoing the setup of previous major rallies. Macro Tailwinds Boost Sentiment as Trade Tensions Ease The broader market sentiment is also supporting Solana’s rise. President Trump’s recent comments about progress in US-China trade talks have eased global market fears, boosting risk appetite across asset classes. This improved sentiment has helped push the global crypto market cap to $3.33 trillion, providing a favorable backdrop for high-beta assets like Solana. Key Macro Highlights: Positive risk sentiment benefiting altcoins Easing US-China trade tensions Global crypto market cap at $3.33 trillion Conclusion: Is $200 in Sight for Solana? Solana’s strong technical setup, coupled with rising DeFi activity and macroeconomic tailwinds, suggests that a move toward $200 is possible in the coming weeks. However, traders should be cautious of potential pullbacks as the MACD signals possible weakening momentum. A break above the $178.33 resistance could set the stage for a push to $200, while a drop below $167.39 could signal a short-term correction.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits From Meme to Mainstream: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin, launched in 2013, began as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. Inspired by a popular Shiba Inu meme, it quickly captured the internet's attention. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. While it started as a joke created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin grew into a serious player in the crypto world. In 2021, its value skyrocketed, propelled by social media buzz and endorsements from influencers like Elon Musk. This surge pushed Dogecoin into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, highlighting the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Dogecoin's technology is based on a simple and efficient blockchain system, making it accessible for everyday transactions. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to garner interest due to its active community and widespread recognition. While some view it as a symbol of the crypto market's unpredictability, others see potential in its growing adoption and the support it receives from notable figures. Comparing it to other coins, Dogecoin's unique journey from a meme to a mainstream asset illustrates the evolving landscape of digital currencies and the potential for unconventional projects to make a significant impact. XRP: The Digital Currency Aiming to Revolutionize Global Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency that stands out for its speed and efficiency. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it's designed as a digitally native, programmable currency that is fast, low-cost, and borderless. Unlike traditional systems, XRP operates on a decentralized network without a central authority. This means transactions are irreversible and secure, and you don't need a bank account to use it. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. They gifted 80 billion of these to Ripple, a company focused on improving global financial transactions. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to boost liquidity and support the ecosystem. To manage the supply, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow, releasing it in a controlled manner. XRP's name comes from ""ripple credits,"" reflecting its goal to make payment transfers seamless across different currencies. In the current market, XRP's technology offers advantages over some other cryptocurrencies, especially in speed and transaction costs. While market trends are always changing, XRP's focus on real-world applications in global payments keeps it in the spotlight. Its potential to simplify cross-border transactions sets it apart and could influence its position in the evolving digital currency landscape. Conclusion While Dogecoin and XRP remain strong, XYZVerse's unique sports-meme ecosystem positions it for potential massive growth, aiming to surpass tokens like PEPE and MOG.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/next-48-hours-could-be-game-changer-for-xrp-heres-why/,"In the world of cryptocurrency, timing can be everything. Ripple Queen, a prominent voice in the XRP community, recently made waves with a bold statement on X , declaring that the next 48 hours could be a game-changer for XRP holders. According to her, the digital asset is on the verge of a massive breakout, leaving many investors on high alert. XRP HOLDERS, PAY ATTENTION! The next 48 hours could change everything! $XRP is primed for a MASSIVE breakout! Whales are moving, the charts are heating up… Are you READY for liftoff?! #XRP pic.twitter.com/uPwuMdzUJM — Ripple Queen (@Ripple_queen) May 11, 2025 Whale Movements Signal a Shift One of the most significant indicators behind this prediction is the activity of crypto whales . Over the past few days, large transactions involving XRP have been recorded on the blockchain. Typically, when whales accumulate or move significant amounts of a cryptocurrency, it hints at an upcoming price movement. Ripple Queen’s assertion that whales are positioning themselves aligns with this observation, suggesting that the next few days could be crucial for XRP. Technical Analysis Points to Liftoff Technical analysts are also paying close attention to XRP’s price action. The charts have shown increased bullish momentum, with XRP testing key resistance levels . If the asset manages to break through these barriers, it could pave the way for a substantial price increase. Market sentiment appears to be turning optimistic, as traders and long-term holders anticipate a rally. Aside from technical indicators, several fundamental factors could influence XRP’s price surge. Ripple’s continued efforts in expanding its global payment solutions and ongoing legal developments with the SEC are pivotal. A positive outcome from the lawsuit or new partnerships could significantly boost investor confidence and push XRP higher.

The crypto market’s inherent volatility means that even seemingly certain breakouts can face pullbacks. Risk management is crucial, and holders should avoid making impulsive decisions solely based on speculative predictions. Ripple Queen’s prediction has undoubtedly stirred the community, but as always, thorough research and calculated strategies are key. Whether XRP is truly on the cusp of a breakout or facing a false dawn, the next 48 hours will be crucial.

Currently in presale at an ultra-low price of just $0.0000002, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves with a predicted 6,200% rally in just two weeks, thanks to its community growth, viral tools, and meme-powered momentum. Dogecoin Price Eyes $1, But FloppyPepe (FPPE) Aims For The Stratosphere With A 6,200% Surge In 2 Weeks The Dogecoin price, currently trading at approximately $0.8, is showcasing a technically promising pattern with significant upside potential. An analyst has highlighted on a Dogecoin price chart a series of breakout scenarios from previous downtrends, each followed by impressive rallies, including gains of over 100% to nearly 500% in past cycles. This historical momentum, combined with bullish indicators like a bullish divergence on the RSI and the Dogecoin price action pressing against a long-term descending resistance, suggests that DOGE may be poised for the $1 target. According to the projection zones marked on the chart, if this breakout materializes similarly to previous patterns, the Dogecoin price could surge toward the milestone of $1.00, aligning with the Fibonacci extension levels and historical resistance points. If momentum follows through, we could see its next big rally well before or around August 2025. While the Dogecoin price continues its steady march toward the $1 target, a new rival is rapidly emerging from the meme coin shadows, and it’s not just keeping pace; it’s aiming to outrun DOGE entirely. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a meme-meets-AI technology that's turning heads across crypto circles with bold predictions of a 6,200% rise in just two weeks.

A soft cap of $20 million is earmarked for real development, marketing, and community growth, while the hard cap of $45 million is scaled to include private, presale, and bonus phases, maintaining scarcity pressure. The supply of 120 trillion tokens has been carefully structured for accessibility and virality. The market has already spoken: 5 trillion tokens were snapped up in under 24 hours during the private sale, raising nearly $1 million, and 7 trillion more are moving fast in the public presale. Not Just Hype: How FloppyPepe (FPPE) Uses AI To Fuel A 6,200% Surge FloppyPepe (FPPE) breaks the meme coin space by offering real-world value instead of relying solely on hype and social buzz. This meme coin uses its AI-backed utilities to fuel its anticipated 6,200% price rally. Some of these AI tools include; Meme-o-Matic, an AI tool for FloppyPepe (FPPE) holders, empowers users to generate viral memes that can be shared and monetized. FloppyX, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) cutting-edge AI video engine, produces videos in real-time, advancing content creation for marketers and meme-makers alike. FloppyAI powers FloppyPepe's (FPPE) creative ecosystem by transforming simple user prompts into high-quality memes and videos in real time, making content creation engaging.

It’s also earned the endorsement of influential crypto analyst Nass Crypto, further cementing its place in the spotlight.

According to on-chain data shared by analyst EmberCN, the Solana ( SOL ) is the platform’s accumulated transaction fee revenue over the past week and follows a consistent pattern of revenue processing. “Pump.fun transferred 132,000 SOL ($22.88 million) in transaction fee revenue to Kraken few hours ago,” EmberCN reported. The analyst mentioned that Pump.fun usually moves these SOL to Kraken after accumulating one to two weeks of transaction fee revenue. Source: EmberCN This latest transfer is an established pattern for the Solana-based token launchpad, which has processed notable fee revenue since its inception. According to EmberCN’s data, Pump.fun has sold 3.868 million SOL valued over $701.76 million over the past year. The sale was made for an average selling price of $183.38 per SOL.

The latest May 11 transfer shows a slight increase in volume compared to previous transfers. The transaction coincides with Solana’s strong market performance, with SOL jumping 20% over the past week and 47.1% over the last 30 days. The token has climbed from approximately $140 to as high as $178 during this period. The Solana meme coin market capitalization also increased 1.8% to $13 billion in the last 24 hours. Several prominent SOL meme coins have posted gains over the past week. This includes Trump ( TRUMP ) (up 25%), Bonk ( BONK ) (up 38%), Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) (up 20.5%), and Dogwifhat ( WIF ) (up 62%). Pump.fun top gainers Pump.fun has earned a position as one of the primary meme coin launchpads on Solana. It allows users to create and deploy tokens with minimal technical knowledge. The platform charges fees for token creation and transactions, which it collects in SOL before periodically converting to other currencies through exchanges like Kraken.

By 2025, which could be the standout choice that transforms fortunes— XRP or Ethereum ? This article delves into the potential growth and investment opportunities of these prominent cryptocurrencies, offering insights into their future trajectories. Discover which one may redefine long-term wealth in the coming years. XRP’s Strong Gains Indicate Investor Confidence XRP 's strong gains of 21.83% over the past month and an impressive 284.81% rise in the last six months illustrate a period of lively price action and buoyant investor sentiment. A 9.38% increase over the last week adds to a history of persistent upward movement and healthy market enthusiasm, reflecting solid performance and renewed interest among traders. Prices remain in a trading range between $1.75 and $2.50, with a key support level at $1.31 and immediate resistance at $2.80. Bulls appear to hold sway amid potential tests of near-term highs, while a lack of a clearly defined trend calls for careful trading within these established levels, using stops near support and targets just above resistance. Ethereum Price Analysis: Recent Surge Amid Mixed Trends Over the past month, Ethereum showed strong upward movement with a 66.56% gain and a notable weekly rise of 38.16%. However, over the span of six months, the coin experienced a decline of 24.97%. The price has moved within a range of $1468 to $2037.38, reflecting rapid short-term gains alongside longer-term weaknesses. Price action has been volatile, with significant weekly gains contrasting with extended bearish pressure over half a year. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range with nearest resistance near $2280.58 and support at $1142.20. Bulls are pushing the price upward, backed by high momentum and an RSI of 81.59, though the market reflects mixed signals. With secondary resistance at $2849.77 and support at $573.01, traders might see opportunities to enter near these support levels if buyers maintain control. Conclusion XRP and ETH both have their unique strengths. XRP focuses on fast and efficient cross-border transactions. ETH offers a platform for decentralized apps and smart contracts. By 2025, ETH's versatility might attract more developers. XRP's speed and cost-efficiency could benefit global transactions. Each coin has potential, but ETH may appeal to those interested in a broader range of blockchain solutions. XRP remains a strong candidate for those prioritizing transaction efficiency. The decision ultimately hinges on whether the priority is broader applications or transaction efficiency. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to a recent post by Brett on X, a staggering 36.6 million XRP, approximately valued at $18.3 million, was moved in a single transaction. This significant transfer has sparked a wave of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. According to Argo, this transaction was the second large buy in less than 10 hours, following a transaction involving 11 million XRP on Upbit . BOOM! 36.6M $XRP (~$18.3M) just SPLASHED in one massive move! Whale’s awake. Stay sharp. pic.twitter.com/EBFIfNQfa7 — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 11, 2025 The Whale Awakens Brett’s post on X did not go unnoticed, as the mention of such a large XRP movement immediately caught the attention of the community. The sheer size of the transaction has led many to wonder whether this whale activity could signal a major market shift. Historically, large transfers of this nature are often associated with institutional moves, significant buying or selling pressures, or strategic repositioning within the market. Whales, or individuals and entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, can significantly influence market sentiment and price action. A single move involving millions of dollars worth of XRP often leads to speculation regarding potential market impacts. While some view such transfers as a precursor to price surges, others interpret them as signals of possible sell-offs or strategic repositioning. Community Speculation Runs High The XRP community, known for its vigilance and speculative spirit, has been quick to discuss potential reasons behind this massive transfer. Some suggest that this movement could indicate increased institutional interest, especially as Ripple continues to solidify its position in the crypto finance landscape. Others believe it might signal preparations for upcoming announcements or strategic investments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why It Matters Massive transactions, especially those involving XRP, often precede significant price movements or announcements. With Ripple’s ongoing global expansion and regulatory milestones, every large-scale XRP transfer is scrutinized for possible connections to corporate activities or partnerships. Given the context of Ripple’s recent advancements in the financial sector, this whale activity could be more than just routine. While the intentions behind the massive XRP movement remain speculative, it’s clear that the community is on high alert. Whether this transfer will translate into a bullish run or cautious profit-taking remains uncertain. As the market digests this whale activity, one thing is for sure—XRP holders and enthusiasts are paying close attention, eager to see how this unfolds.

Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success. Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.” Amid concerns of conflicts of interest and blatant token shilling by the Trump family, it remains to be seen whether these upcoming regulations will adequately protect everyday investors. Regardless, these are the eight firms that have banked on big bucks in the US this year. Binance.US resumes USD services; CZ seeks clemency Binance.US officially reinstated USD deposit and withdrawal services less than a month into Trump’s presidency. They were halted on June 13, 2023, on the back of a civil enforcement action by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), claiming willful evasion of US laws and operating illegally in the country. Binance later settled for $2.7 billion; then-CEO Changpeng Zhao paid $150 million. Soon after halting USD on- and off-ramps, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and its then-CEO, Changpeng Zhao, with a lawsuit. The agency claimed Zhao and Binance “engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.” In November 2023, Binance and CZ agreed on a settlement with the Department of Justice that included pleading guilty to federal charges, including violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, a $4.3-billion fine, CZ’s dismissal as CEO and a prison sentence. Zhao has sought clemency from President Trump , who has pardoned a number of crypto executives. Zhao (right) discusses his clemency request. Source: Farokh Radio eToro files for US IPO after 2024 enforcement action Online trading platform eToro publicly filed its registration statement for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “ETOR.” The IPO is anticipated to occur as early as Q2 2025, pending market conditions, with eToro seeking a $4-billion valuation with plans to raise $500 million by offering 10 million Class A shares. The trading platform ran into some trouble with the SEC in 2024, when the agency claimed eToro “operated an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency in connection with its trading platform that facilitated buying and selling certain crypto assets as securities.” As a result, eToro paid a fine and agreed to reduce its crypto offerings for US customers to Bitcoin ( BTC ), Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) and Ether ( ETH ). The move signals growing investor confidence in the future of retail cryptocurrency trading platforms in the US as the jurisdiction reorients its rules defining cryptocurrencies and loosens restrictions that made it more difficult for such platforms to receive banking services. OKX relaunches in the US months after $500-million settlement OKX, a major global cryptocurrency exchange, announced its reentry into the US market in April 2025. The company is implementing a phased rollout plan throughout the year and has established a new regional headquarters in San Jose, California. The firm also named Roshan Robert, recently of Barclays, as head of its US operations. Edit the caption here or remove the text The relaunch comes just months after the firm announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). US attorneys alleged that the platform “knowingly violated anti-money laundering laws and avoided implementing required policies to prevent criminals from abusing our financial system” for over seven years. OKX paid a hefty $500-million fine, pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and agreed to pay for an external compliance consultant. In a statement, OKX said , “There were no allegations of customer harm, no charges against any Company employee and no government appointed monitor as part of the settlement. Related: OKX to restart DEX with anti-abuse upgrades after Lazarus ‘misuse’ Robert told Fortune that the firm was ramping up its compliance and risk management infrastructures ahead of the relaunch. He also cited the improving regulatory landscape as a contributor to the relaunch. “The rulemaking will take some time, but there is a path that we can see,” he said. Nexo returns to US markets after deadlock with regulators Nexo, a global digital assets wealth platform, announced its return to the US market on April 28, 2025, at an event in Sofia, Bulgaria. According to industry media, US customers will have access to Nexo’s asset-backed credit lines, crypto savings accounts and advanced trading options. Nexo left the US in 2022 after 18 months of negotiations with federal regulators reached an impasse. Eight different state regulators had charged Nexo with allegedly failing to register its Earn Interest Product. Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev credited the crypto-friendly approach of President Trump with his firm’s relaunch: “America is back — and so is Nexo.” “Nexo is returning to America — stronger, smarter, and determined to win,” he added. Circle relocates to NYC ahead of IPO Circle, the issuer of the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, is relocating its global headquarters from Boston to New York City in early 2025. The move to One World Trade Center aligns with Circle’s plans for an initial public offering and reflects its commitment to integrating with traditional financial markets. Circle filed for its IPO on April 1 and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are serving as lead underwriters. The firm is seeking a $5-billion valuation. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said, “Our new headquarters near the top of One World Trade Center is a symbol of the trust, security and stability we’re building as a critical infrastructure provider for the future of finance.” Circle initially sought to go public via a blank-check firm in 2022, but the deal fell through. The deal would have valued Circle at $9 billion at the time. Crypto.com introduces stock and ETF trading Crypto.com is expanding its services in the US throughout 2025, including introducing trading for stocks and ETFs. The company is rolling out these offerings in phases as part of its 2025 roadmap, including significant expansions of its banking, crypto, stock and credit card services for US customers. The plan shows the company’s broader strategy of integrating crypto with traditional finance, a theme recurring with many crypto and finance firms operating in the US. Travis McGhee, Crypto.com managing director and head of global capital markets, said that the firm is letting clients “marry up that capability [trading stocks and ETFs] with your crypto trading, as well as your crypto derivative trading.” McGhee added that “there’s a lot of tailwinds” pushing the industry ahead, including an “administration that is [...] looking to put a regulatory framework into place.” “That just bodes well for a strong market and a strong future for crypto.” a16z returns to US after initial UK move Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) announced that it is closing shop in the UK and focusing its efforts on the US. In a Jan. 24 X post, Anthony Albanese, chief operating officer of Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm, said the firm will be closing its UK branch despite the “enthusiasm for crypto building and adoption” in the country. According to Sifted, the UK government had spent five years wooing a16z to move to London, just for the firm to leave 18 months after it opened its offices there. Related: A16z leads $25M funding for Miden blockchain project A16z launched offices in London in 2023, citing the regulatory environment under former President Joe Biden as too unfriendly to the blockchain industry. Albanese said there was “strong momentum” behind the crypto industry with the inauguration of President Trump. Per TechCrunch, other factors driving a16z’s relocation were the slow progress on crypto in the UK and the Labour government shifting its priorities away from digital assets. Coinbase acquires Deribit in bid to capture derivatives market US-based crypto exchange Coinbase bought crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion on May 8. The merger makes Coinbase the largest crypto derivatives platform by open interest, per an exchange blog post. The deal comes as major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood jockey to dominate the growing global crypto derivative market. On the day of the announcement, Coinbase’s international derivatives exchange saw $10 billion in trading.

With fresh innovation driving the space forward, this cycle may favor projects that combine real-world utility with strong tokenomics and long-term scalability. Standouts like Unstaked (UNSD), Sui (SUI), Render (RNDR), and Celestia (TIA) are capturing early attention for exactly that reason. Each offers a unique solution, ranging from AI-powered automation to modular blockchain design and decentralized GPU computing. As excitement grows, these four projects could be positioned for breakout growth in 2025. Here’s a closer look at why they matter now. 1. Unstaked ($UNSD): AI Agents Power Next Phase of Decentralized Growth Unstaked is transforming the blockchain ecosystem by fusing artificial intelligence with real on-chain utility. At the core of its platform are autonomous AI agents that can be deployed to manage and grow online communities across platforms like Telegram and X (formerly Twitter). These agents handle tasks such as content creation, user engagement, moderation, and even marketing, automatically and without human oversight. This radically cuts the cost and time it takes to build strong, active Web3 communities. What makes Unstaked stand out is its intelligent agent model, which adapts and improves based on performance data. Through real-time feedback and machine learning, each AI agent evolves to deliver smarter, more effective community support. With pricing starting as low as $10–$25 per month, it offers a powerful, low-cost alternative to traditional team-based community management, especially for smaller projects that need to scale fast without burning capital. The $UNSD token fuels this ecosystem, used for deploying, upgrading, and governing agents. Now in Stage 8 of its presale at $0.007994, with a confirmed $0.1819 launch price, Unstaked has already raised over $4 million, including $1 million in just 24 hours. With demand for decentralized AI tools climbing, Unstaked may be one of the smartest early-stage plays heading into the next bull run. 2. Sui (SUI): Speed and Scalability Powering a 229% Forecast Sui is emerging as a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain built for real-time scalability. As of May 4, 2025, SUI is priced at $3.22, showing minimal 24-hour movement but massive upside potential. With analysts projecting a jump to $10.54 by June, Sui could deliver a 229% return, making it one of the most watched tokens this cycle. What drives this bullish outlook is Sui’s parallel transaction processing architecture, which boosts throughput and eliminates bottlenecks. Its growing DeFi ecosystem and developer adoption position Sui to thrive in a market increasingly driven by performance. If the bull run intensifies, SUI could become a breakout winner. 3. Render (RNDR): GPU Power Meets the Decentralized Future Render (RNDR) is turning GPU computing into a crypto-native utility. Currently trading at $4.40 as of May 4, 2025, RNDR is holding strong amid market shifts. With analysts forecasting a rise to $8.79 by year-end, the token has a 43.9% upside baked in, supported by real-world demand for decentralized rendering. From 3D animation to AI model training, Render connects GPU providers with users through a decentralized network. This not only lowers costs but brings scalability and transparency to high-performance computing. With demand for decentralized infrastructure climbing, RNDR could be one of the next wave’s biggest gainers. 4. Celestia (TIA): Modular Power with 277% Growth Potential Celestia (TIA) is rewriting blockchain architecture with a modular design that separates consensus and data availability from execution. Trading at $2.42 on May 4, 2025, TIA is coming off short-term volatility, but forecasts suggest a surge to $9.74 by June, a projected 277% gain. By enabling developers to build custom, scalable blockchains, Celestia offers a flexible foundation for the next generation of dApps. Its ability to horizontally scale makes it a standout as demand for tailored solutions increases. For those betting on infrastructure innovation, Celestia could be a key player in the next market explosion. Looking Forward The upcoming crypto bull run presents a rare window for major upside, especially for those backing projects with real innovation and utility. Unstaked ($UNSD) , Sui, Render, and Celestia each offer distinct solutions, from AI-powered agent networks to modular and scalable blockchain infrastructures, addressing critical gaps in the decentralized ecosystem. As demand for performance, automation, and customizability grows, these projects are positioned to capture serious market share. Backed by strong tech and growing communities, they’re not just speculative plays, they’re foundational bets on the future of Web3. Including them in a well-researched, diversified strategy could be the edge heading into 2025.

Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032 , attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction. Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).” At the center of the risk is EIP-7702, a core component of the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduces the SetCode transaction (type 0x04), which enables users to delegate control of their wallet to another contract simply by signing a message. If an attacker obtains this signature — say, via a phishing site — they can overwrite the wallet’s code with a small proxy that forwards calls to their malicious contract. “Once the code is set,” Usman explained, “the attacker can invoke that code to transfer out the account’s ETH or tokens—all without the user ever signing a normal transfer transaction.” Source: Vladimir S. | Officer's Notes Related: Ethereum Pectra upgrade adds new features Wallets can be altered with offchain signature Yehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, noted that this new transaction type introduced by Pectra allows arbitrary code to be installed on the user’s account, essentially turning their wallet into a programmable smart contract. “This tx type allows the user to set arbitrary code (smart contract) to be able to execute operations on the user’s behalf,” Rudytsia said. Before Pectra, wallets could not be modified without a transaction signed directly by the user. Now, a simple offchain signature can install code that delegates complete control to an attacker’s contract. “Pre-Pectra, users needed to send transaction (not sign message) to allow their funds to be moved… Post-Pectra, any operation may be executed from the contract which user approved via SET_CODE,” Rudytsia explained. The threat is real and immediate. “Pectra activated May 7, 2025. From that moment, any valid delegation signature is actionable,” Usman warned. He added that smart contracts relying on outdated assumptions, such as using tx.origin or basic EOA-only checks, are particularly vulnerable. Wallets and interfaces that fail to detect or properly represent these new transaction types are most at risk. Rudytsia warned that “wallets are vulnerable if they do not analyze Ethereum’s transaction types,” especially transaction type 0x04. He emphasized that wallet engines must clearly display delegation requests and flag any suspicious addresses. This new form of attack can be easily executed through common offchain interactions like phishing emails, fake DApps, or Discord scams. “We believe it will be the most popular attack vector regarding these breaking changes introduced by Pectra,” Rudytsia said. “From now on, users have to carefully validate what they are going to sign.” Source: Noir Related: Pectra features already in use: Ethereum EIP-7702 wallets roll out Hardware wallets are not safer anymore Hardware wallets are no longer inherently safer, Rudytsia said. He added that hardware wallets from now on are at the same risk as hot wallets from the perspective of signing malicious messages. “If done—all the funds are gone in a moment.” There are ways to stay safe, but they require awareness. “Users should not sign the messages they do not understand,” Rudytsia advised. He also urged wallet developers to provide clear warnings when users are asked to sign a delegation message. Special caution should be taken with new delegation signature formats introduced by EIP-7702, which are not compatible with existing EIP-191 or EIP-712 standards. These messages often appear as simple 32-byte hashes and may bypass normal wallet warnings. “If a message includes your account nonce, it’s probably affecting your account directly,” Usman warned. “Normal sign-in messages or offchain commitments don’t usually involve your nonce.” Adding to the risk, EIP-7702 allows for signatures with chain_id = 0, meaning the signed message can be replayed on any Ethereum-compatible chain. “Understand it can be used anywhere,” Usman said. While multisignature wallets remain more secure under this upgrade, thanks to their requirement for multiple signers, single-key wallets — hardware or otherwise — must adopt new signature parsing and red-flagging tools to prevent potential exploitation. Alongside EIP-7702, Pectra also included EIP-7251 , which raised Ethereum’s validator staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ETH, and EIP-7691, which increases the number of data blobs per block for better layer-2 scalability.

Source: Vladimir S. | Officer's Notes Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision investors attempt to rekindle lawsuit against Binance A group of Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision ( BSV ) investors is attempting to rekindle a 2019 lawsuit against Binance , alleging that the crypto exchange caused price damage to the altcoin by delisting BSV in 2019. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a previous ruling from the United Kingdom Competition Appeal Tribunal, throwing out the claims of undue damage from the delisting, should be examined again, according to legal outlet Law360 . BSV has experienced a long-term price decline since 2021. Source: TradingView If successful, the litigants could demand up to 10 billion British pounds (GBP), or roughly $13 billion, in damages from the exchange. BSV continues to suffer from a multitude of issues, including a long-term price decline, several 51% attacks that compromised the blockchain network's security, and criticism from the crypto community. Robert Kiyosaki says ditch ‘fake money’ for Bitcoin, gold, and silver Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin , gold, and silver. In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul. Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed , described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control. Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns. “Fake money leads to dishonest money, dishonest statistics, dishonest accounting, dishonest balance sheets, dishonest compensation, dishonest relations, dishonest leaders, and corruption in everyday life,” Kiyosaki wrote. He called on Americans to “fight back” by opting out of fiat systems and instead embracing decentralized stores of value like Bitcoin (BTC) and precious metals.

Vance To Headline Crypto’s Largest Convention On May 28 Vice President J.D. Vance is set to deliver a keynote address at the world’s biggest Bitcoin conference. Vance will address Bitcoiners in person in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 28, making him the first sitting US vice president to speak at a digital asset conference, as announced by BTC Inc., the event’s organizers. “This is more than a headline moment — it’s a signal,” BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey opined. “Bitcoin is the most exciting financial innovation in the world. It’s at the forefront of the national conversation.” The Bitcoin 2025 conference is the world’s largest Bitcoin-focused event, expected to attract over 30,000 attendees. During his term as a US Senator, Vance endorsed Bitcoin, criticized regulatory overreach, and oftentimes slammed Securities and Exchange Commission leadership under former chair Gary Gensler. While he has been a Bitcoin holder since 2021 , owning over $250,000 worth of the premier cryptocurrency, it’s unclear whether the VP intends to make a historic policy statement at the upcoming confab. Nevertheless, Vance’s address is anticipated to focus on innovation, financial sovereignty, and Bitcoin’s role in the future of the United States. “This is a historic moment for Bitcoin,” said Brandon Green, co-organizer of Bitcoin 2025. “We are beyond honored to host the Vice President at the world’s largest Bitcoin conference. VP Vance represents a new generation that values freedom and doesn’t fear — but rather pioneers — new technology.” Last year, President Trump spoke in person at July’s Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, ahead of his November election win. Since his return to the White House, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to set up a strategic Bitcoin reserve and separate digital assets stockpile, signed the first crypto-related bill into law, and had his SEC dismiss a slew of enforcement cases against firms in the burgeoning industry. He even debuted his own Solana-based meme coin just days before his inauguration. Two of the president’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who are tied to the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, are both listed to speak at Bitcoin 2025. The upcoming conference will also feature Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht in his first public appearance since being pardoned by President Trump in January after 11 years behind bars.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-11 13:17:35

Experts believe profits from Bitcoin’s run may soon begin rotating into promising altcoins, with Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) leading the charge. However, the real gem could be Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-priced altcoin that insiders are betting could deliver massive returns in the coming months, making it one of the top altcoins to watch as capital flows out of Bitcoin. Already in Presale Phase 4 at $0.025 per token, the project boasts more than 9,600 investors and has collected over $7.9 million. Investors are running out of time with more than 65% of the phase already sold out. There is a 20% price increase to $0.03 in Phase 5, and a 140% gain at launch for investors who invest today. Solana (SOL) and XRP: two altcoins poised to benefit as Bitcoin profits rotate With Bitcoin (BTC) still leading the pack, most of the focus has moved to altcoins, and among the group leaders are Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP). Solana’s high-speed blockchain and scalable ecosystem have made it a favorite among developers and investors, putting it in direct competition with Ethereum as a leading contender. XRP’s surge to new ATH, nonetheless, remains hotly anticipated, holding significant promise for massive returns should the token prevail. Both tokens are compelling options for diversifying out of Bitcoin, with high growth potential in 2025. In the meantime, as SOL and XRP continue to shine, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is flying under the radar in another altcoin quietly gaining momentum for explosive growth. Mutuum Finance gathers steam Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is rising fast as its presale gains serious traction. At the current price of $0.025, buyers are positioning themselves for a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches and pushes the token to $0.03. With a planned market launch at $0.06, Phase 4 investors are eyeing a potential 140% ROI. Over $7.9 million has already poured into the project from more than 9,700 backers, and that number continues to grow. One of the platform’s standout innovations is its Buy-and-Distribute strategy. Through this mechanism, Mutuum Finance actively purchases market tokens and redistributes them to stakers, ensuring constant engagement and strengthening the project’s tokenomics. This system not only manages supply in a smart way, but also offers sustained rewards, making it appealing for long-term participants. In a market often dictated by hype and volatility, Mutuum Finance introduces a stabilizing force grounded in continuous utility. Leaderboard rewards system boosts engagement To deepen user engagement, Mutuum Finance recently launched a leaderboard dashboard that highlights the top 50 MUTM holders in real-time. Those who maintain their positions will receive additional rewards, adding a gamified edge that boosts loyalty and community involvement. CertiK audit brings added security and trust Security is another key focus for Mutuum Finance. The team has partnered with blockchain security leader CertiK to carry out a full smart contract audit. Once completed, the audit results will be published on Mutuum’s social media channels to give the community full visibility and peace of mind about the safety of their investments. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top altcoin pick as capital starts rotating out of Bitcoin. With over $7.9M raised, 9,700+ investors, and Phase 4 more than 65% sold out, momentum is building fast. The current $0.025 price offers early buyers a potential 140% gain by launch, with further upside projected into 2025. Between its CertiK-audited smart contracts, innovative Buy-and-Distribute model, and active community rewards, MUTM is built for sustainable growth. Don’t miss your chance, Phase 5 is approaching and the window to buy in before the price jumps is closing fast.

Monero (XMR) gained over 50 percent, but not because of updates. Reports suggest it may be tied to laundering activity involving $330 million in stolen Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) is close to triggering a $55 million short squeeze if it crosses $0.19, with pressure rising near $0.25. These stories show how meme coins and privacy tokens can move for reasons that raise more questions than confidence. On the other hand, Web3 ai is entering the market with a different plan. It is preparing to launch a full AI suite for crypto users, using models like those behind ChatGPT. At $0.000331 per token, early presale participants are watching for a move to $0.005242 at listing, which would mark a 1747% return. Monero (XMR) Sees Price Jump Tied to Laundering Activity The recent Monero (XMR) surge was not linked to new features or wider use. It followed reports of $330 million in stolen Bitcoin being moved through the network. XMR rose sharply by over 50%, from $228 to $347, before dropping back to $295. On-chain investigator ZachXBT shared that over 3,500 BTC were shifted across exchanges, with Monero as a key part of the process. This raised short-term interest in XMR, but it looks more like a temporary spike than a long-term trend. The timing of the jump matched the laundering and slowed after news spread. While privacy remains central to XMR’s role, events like this raise concerns about what truly drives price moves and whether they reflect lasting demand or brief shocks. Traders Eye Breakout as Dogecoin (DOGE) Builds Pressure Dogecoin (DOGE) price is building a bull flag pattern on the 1-hour chart, with $0.1840 as a key resistance level. A move past that line could trigger a rise toward $0.22 or $0.25. Sentiment data shows a split: general mood is strong, with a crowd score of 0.77, but experienced traders remain cautious, with smart money still showing negative bias. The focus is on the $0.19 zone, where over $55 million in short positions are placed. A break above could force short sellers to cover, possibly pushing the price higher quickly. That’s why DOGE is under close watch, especially between $0.1810 and $0.1840. If momentum builds, a fast upward move could follow. Web3 ai Developed What Many Only Talked About Web3 ai is working on a full set of AI tools aimed at crypto traders. These include real-time trading bots, natural language models, and systems that predict risk or price trends. It isn’t an idea, it’s software being prepared for launch. The presale pricing structure adds to the interest. There are 50 total stages, the current stage 3 price is at $0.000331 and rising to $0.003267 in the final batch. The exchange listing is set at $0.005242, giving early buyers a path to 1747% gains. That return is based on the pricing model alone, not including any future market movement. The presale has picked up momentum in the ongoing bull run and has now crossed $2.5M in funding. Even at the highest presale tier, the price stays below the listing. That makes it one of the lowest-cost AI-focused tokens before launch. As more traders learn about the rollout, Web3 ai is being mentioned as a top crypto for 2025 by users focused on real tools, not just branding. In a space filled with projects promising future results, Web3 ai is offering a plan with a set launch and clear pricing. That is why many traders watching the market shifts are taking a closer look. What Is the Best Crypto Investment? Dogecoin (DOGE) price hovers near a level that could set off short liquidations, and Monero (XMR) price is reacting to a report linked to stolen Bitcoin. Both moves are short-term and could shift quickly, making them risky to follow without timing. At the same time, Web3 ai is working on tools that use machine learning, NLP, and AI trading systems. It is offering early access through a crypto presale at $0.000331, with a confirmed listing price of $0.005242. That gives early buyers a potential 1747% return by launch. With its focus on building usable tech, Web3 ai is becoming popular as a project to watch in 2025.

44476623,https://zycrypto.com/?p=105808,1746970252,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Cardano (ADA) to Rocket Past New All-Time High Price After Critical Milestone Update,https://zycrypto.com/cardano-ada-to-rocket-past-new-all-time-high-price-after-critical-milestone-update/,"Major cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) is looking for a significant price breakout as it enables a major upgrade on its blockchain network. The world’s 9th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is one of the older decentralized networks that appeared after the first altcoin boom in 2018. After a relatively lacklustre start to the 2024-2025 bull market, ADA is counting on major updates to kickstart its progress. Cardano Price Action According to a verified crypto influencer on X, the Cardano network is looking to incorporate a series of latest updates to bring inter-blockchain connectivity. He posted: “BREAKING: Bitcoin just TELEPORTED to Cardano—no bridges, zero trust! INSANE move could rocket $ADA past $1 faster than anyone expects” Currently, the digital currency is hovering just below the $0.8 level as it looks to counter the resistance at this level. Here is the graph of ADA for the last 30 days: ADA had suffered a major setback at the start of this calendar year, along with the rest of the altcoin market, and the situation has remained stagnant ever since. However, the end of April has brought a significant change in the overall fortune of the market, and things are looking upbeat from here. ADA has already posted a 25% price appreciation, and a major upgrade is set to make things ballistic as we head into the much-anticipated 3rd and 4th quarters of 2025. Cardano to Become Fastest Blockchain: Founder Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano blockchain network, recently revealed its latest upgrade, which he claims will make it the fastest in the crypto landscape. According to Hoskinson: “What we are introducing with Leios, and eventually with the rest of the pipeline, will make Cardano the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet” . Hoskinson went on to claim that the team had undergone a painstaking 8 years of research to come up with this update. It promises a multi-layered block structure comprising input blocks, ranking blocks, and endorsement blocks. If successful, it will enable Cardano developers to use it in more powerful applications with enhanced security and scalability. However, updates on blockchain networks are a tricky business, and it remains to be seen how they will perform in the coming months. On the other hand, even if they aren’t as advertised, one can expect a major price appreciation in ADA’s value due to optimism surrounding the resumption of the crypto bull market.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-11 13:30:52

State‑owned funds won’t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway’s sovereign fund, the globe’s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China’s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He’s previously spoken of “large blocks” of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington’s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

This week, the crypto market took a positive turn on the heels of growing institutional accumulations and macro interests. Retail tailwinds also spurred a string of inflows as Bitcoin (BTC) hit a three-month high, followed by an altcoin frenzy. XRP holders now fancy a $5 monthly peak, despite January’s $3.4 point. XRP Bulls In Buying Mode On-chain data shows massive XRP purchases by large holders this week. A slew of retail wallets maintains similar pressure amid growing momentum. The rise in institutional accumulation marks a third consecutive week of inflows, which started in April and is set to deepen to possible monthly peaks. In the last 30 days, XRP whales have accumulated over $880 million worth of assets, fueling a price surge. After the last dip, holders have consistently picked up the asset due to growing on-chain dynamics and global partnerships. On May 8, Wellgistics, a Florida pharmaceutical firm, announced the use of XRP for real-time payments in a $50 million deal, citing the need to lower centralized banking delays. Holders have also pointed to increased anticipation for a spot ETF product in the United States as a rallying factor. If approved, bulls pitch a new all-time high for the altcoin. Recently, Polymarket users have placed odds at 85% similar to Bloomberg analysts as favorable conditions swirl U.S. markets. Another factor behind recent institutional accumulation is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) settlement filing . The move reaffirmed positive sentiment for the asset and spurred its price to a 10% rally. Centralized exchanges also saw outflows simultaneously with trades keen on the next wave. Will XRP Price Hit $5? Most bulls are pricing a $5 mark this month, banking on recent institutional inflows. A move to that level remains possible if present institutional accumulation continues. Last week, XRP institutional products notched $10.5 million inflows ahead of swinging macro data. The United States and United Kingdom trade deal and talks about easing tensions with China could usher in a good spell for crypto assets. XRP holders are poised for a higher run in the coming weeks, and a price surge to $5 could set the tone for a bull run. At press time, XRP price stands at $2.39, a 7% spike in the last 24 hours and an 8% rally this week. With trading volume above 41%, the asset’s market cap has surged to $138.91 billion.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-11 13:35:21

Morgan’s insight highlights XRP’s resilience and growing momentum, even in the face of significant Bitcoin-related developments. XRP currently outperforming Bitcoin despite all the Saylor Bitcoin acquisitions, strategic reserve news and treasury acquisitions. @ScamDetective5 must be devastated pic.twitter.com/pVoP1nTyx9 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 11, 2025 The Saylor Factor One of the key factors that typically boosts Bitcoin’s standing in the market is the aggressive acquisition strategy employed by Michael Saylor and other institutional investors. Saylor, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, has made headlines for purchasing large amounts of Bitcoin as part of strategic reserve and treasury initiatives. Such moves are often seen as strong endorsements of Bitcoin’s long-term value, attracting both retail and institutional investors. However, despite these acquisitions, XRP has managed to outperform Bitcoin, indicating that the market dynamics are shifting. Investors are increasingly paying attention to XRP’s potential and utility, particularly in the context of regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. Why XRP Is Gaining Ground Several factors contribute to XRP’s current performance against Bitcoin. Firstly, the ongoing legal clarity surrounding XRP’s status as a non-security has significantly boosted investor confidence. As Ripple continues to solidify its position within the financial sector, XRP’s use case as a bridge currency for cross-border payments gains traction. Moreover, the strategic positioning of XRP within the broader crypto market is becoming more apparent. While Bitcoin remains a store of value and a hedge against inflation, XRP’s role in facilitating real-time, low-cost transactions makes it an appealing choice for institutional partnerships and adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and the Road Ahead The positive sentiment around XRP is also reflected in trading volumes and market movements. Analysts suggest that as regulatory hurdles clear, more institutions may incorporate XRP into their payment infrastructure, further boosting its market value. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance, despite the strategic reserves, seems to be facing challenges as investors explore alternatives within the crypto space. While Bitcoin continues to hold a dominant position as digital gold , XRP’s ability to outperform amid strategic Bitcoin acquisitions signals a notable shift in the crypto landscape. Investors and analysts alike are keenly observing whether XRP’s momentum will continue, especially as adoption and regulatory clarity converge in its favor.

In a May 9 post on X , McGregor argued that Bitcoin aligns with the principle of financial empowerment. “Crypto in its origin was founded to give power back to the people,” he wrote. “An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money.” Bitcoin Price Surges to Over $104,000 McGregor’s proposal comes amid a sharp rally in Bitcoin, which recently surged to over $104,000. He plans to elaborate on his vision during an upcoming X Spaces event, inviting key Bitcoin figures to join the conversation. “We need the greatest minds for this BTC Reserve. Message me and let’s chat,” he responded to crypto influencer Anthony Pompliano. U.S. presidential crypto advisor David Bailey also expressed interest, to which McGregor replied enthusiastically. McGregor announced his independent run for the Irish presidency in March 2025, focusing on crime reduction and strict immigration policies. Ireland’s next presidential election is scheduled no later than November 11, 2025, when the current term of President Michael D. Higgins ends. While the idea of a Bitcoin reserve is bold, it’s uncharted territory for Ireland. Only a few nations—including the U.S., El Salvador, and Bhutan—have actively explored sovereign Bitcoin reserves. Crypto in it's origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money. I will be cohosting a Twitter space to talk about what I want to see changed. Victory to Ireland! — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 9, 2025 Implementing such a strategy, especially from an independent candidate without party backing, would face significant political and regulatory hurdles. McGregor’s crypto credibility has also come under question. His previous blockchain venture, the REAL project, failed to meet its $1 million funding goal during its April pre-sale, raising just $392,315 before issuing refunds to investors. The project aimed to merge crypto and gaming but failed to gain traction. Adding to his controversial profile, McGregor is appealing a recent civil conviction for sexual assault and has previously faced investigations over hate speech. Bitcoin Holds Above $103K but Momentum Indicators Signal Weakness Bitcoin is trading at $103,546 after peaking at $104,765, showing signs of slowing momentum following last week’s bullish rally. While the price remains above key support, indicators suggest the market may be cooling off in the short term. On the 30-minute chart, the RSI has dipped below the neutral 50 line to 44.64, reflecting reduced buying strength. The MACD has also flipped bearish, with the signal line crossing above the MACD line — a common sign of potential downside pressure. Bollinger Bands are starting to narrow, indicating declining volatility. Short-term movement on the 1-minute chart confirms the weakness, with the RSI hovering near 41.5 and the MACD turning negative. Bitcoin is now trading near the lower Bollinger Band, signaling cautious sentiment among intraday traders. If bulls fail to defend the $103,000 level, further downside could follow. However, holding above that mark would keep the broader uptrend intact for now.

Its mission to enable seamless international transactions gave rise to one of crypto’s most efficient payment rails. But today, that crown is being challenged—and possibly taken—by a rising force: Bitcoin Solaris. What Stellar started, Bitcoin Solaris is finishing with style. This emerging platform isn’t just enabling global settlement at lightspeed; it’s doing so while giving first-time users the power to earn real wealth, all through a mining app that fits in your pocket. Stellar’s Legacy Meets a New Era Stellar’s strength has always been its simplicity and speed. Transactions processed in seconds, low fees, and a vision of global connectivity. But there’s a growing debate about centralization and limitations in wealth generation for the average user. Stellar wasn’t built to mine—it was built to move money. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris turns the tables. It doesn’t just offer fast payments—it makes it profitable to participate. Meet Bitcoin Solaris: Where Wealth, Speed, and Access Collide At its core, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) brings something new to the table. It fuses the security of Bitcoin with the speed of Solana, delivering 10,000 TPS and 2-second finality while consuming 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin. But the real game-changer is how it puts wealth creation into the hands of anyone, anywhere. Mining no longer requires a warehouse or technical skill. With the upcoming Solaris Nova App, the process is radically simplified: Smartphone and laptop mining support One-tap mining experience Cross-platform functionality (Android, iOS, web, desktop) Built-in BTC-S wallet and in-app education Adaptive algorithm that adjusts to your device Whether you’re a student or a full time employee, you can now mine from your phone and earn BTC-S with zero setup cost. Turn Your Phone into a Passive Income Machine Advanced Tech That Goes Beyond the Blockchain Basics Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a fork or an imitation—it’s a new category of crypto. At the heart of its power is a dual-consensus system (PoW + DPoS) that ensures both security and scalability. But there’s more: The Helios System powers advanced DeFi, including DEXs, lending, and yield farming. Audited smart contracts ensure maximum trust and reliability. A growing network of bridges allows BTC-S to interact with Solana, Bitcoin, and beyond. The referral program allows early users to earn 5% for every purchase through their link—plus their invitee gets a 5% bonus. It’s not just fast—it’s powerful, secure, and designed to grow. Bitcoin Solaris Is Gaining Serious Momentum The world is noticing. Not just investors, but entire communities are joining the movement. Just check out this detailed review by Crypto Royal where he breaks down why Bitcoin Solaris is one of the most exciting crypto launches of 2025. This growing attention is fueled by a powerful, short-lived presale, which has already raised over a quarter million dollars in one short phase. Here’s where things stand: Current Presale Price: $2 Next Phase Price: $3 Launch Price: $20 Bonus This Round: 14% The presale ends on July 31, 2025, with only a 90-day window—the shortest of any major crypto this year. The potential ROI? Up to 1,900%. The presale is live, but fading fast. And if you’re curious about updates, community drops, or presale news, jump into the Telegram channel to stay ahead of the curve. Conclusion Stellar set the standard for fast payments. Bitcoin Solaris is building the future—faster, smarter, and far more profitable for regular users. From mobile mining and secure DeFi to a presale that could change lives, BTC-S is paving the way for a new class of crypto millionaires. If you’ve been watching the blockchain revolution from the sidelines, this is your moment to step in—not just to transact, but to thrive.

Despite strong long-term fundamentals, near-term momentum has faded, creating a space for newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE to gain traction among traders searching for early-stage growth. ETH is down 2.7% over the last 24 hours , currently sitting at $1,770 — just above its support at $1,755 but still trapped beneath the 50-day moving average at $1,782 . XRP, meanwhile, holds at $2.12 , stuck in a tight channel after a prior rally to $2.25 . With futures open interest dropping by $520 million , speculation is waning. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW ETH and XRP Struggle to Maintain Momentum Ethereum’s Near-Term Pressure Builds Current Price: $1,770 Support: $1,755 50-Day MA: $1,782 200-Day MA: $2,714 Ethereum remains a favorite for long-term holders, but investors are increasingly cautious as Layer 2 rollouts underperform expectations and price remains below key moving averages. XRP’s Sluggish Trend Despite Strong Fundamentals Current Price: $2.12 Support Level: $2.00 Resistance Level: $2.25 Open Interest Decline: –$520M in 7 days While ETF hopes still stand at 77% probability , technical headwinds and Ripple’s pivot to RLUSD have taken some steam out of XRP’s recent rally. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOINFINANCE Picks Up Steam As Presale Accelerates While major coins waver, MAGACOINFINANCE continues to climb. Its Stage 7 presale is generating buzz across Discord communities and presale trackers, with token pricing still under $0.01 and projections pointing to a $0.007 listing . That setup offers an estimated 35x ROI for early buyers — and investors are noticing. Why Traders Are Moving Toward MAGACOINFINANCE: Presale price: Projected listing: $0.007 Estimated return: 35x ROI Bonus opportunity: +50% tokens via code MAGA50X Investor shift: ADA and ETH holders reallocating to MAGACOINFINANCE The project’s low-cap positioning and fast-growing social base are reminiscent of early DOGE and SHIB moments — but this time tied to a political narrative that’s gaining traction ahead of a critical U.S. election cycle. The Altcoin Rotation Continues — and MAGACOINFINANCE Leads the Way With large-cap altcoins facing stagnation, the shift toward early-stage opportunities is accelerating. MAGACOINFINANCE’s presale has already exceeded several stage targets, fueled by both FOMO and structured scarcity. According to project metrics: Discord engagement is growing double-digits weekly New wallets funded with ADA and ETH have steadily increased Presale caps for each round are being filled faster than projected Final Thoughts: As Ethereum and XRP Cool, the Spotlight Turns Ethereum: Struggling against moving averages as investors await post-Pectra clarity XRP: ETF optimism remains, but technical pressure and capital outflow are real MAGACOINFINANCE: Gaining ground as the early-stage speculative favorite for Q2–Q3 2025 The market remains unpredictable, but in periods of hesitation, undervalued projects often emerge as breakout winners . With low pricing, rising demand, and a clear vision, MAGACOINFINANCE is becoming one of the most watched tokens in the space.

This announcement has sparked considerable excitement among the XRP community and the broader crypto market. The information , shared by BSC Gems Alert on X, has fueled speculation about the potential implications of an XRP ETF in the United States. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has been making calculated moves within the cryptocurrency sector. The confirmation of an XRP ETF meeting marks a new chapter in the firm’s approach to digital assets. As an institution known for its strategic investments, BlackRock’s focus on XRP aligns with its broader push into blockchain and cryptocurrency-based financial products. BLACKROCK CONFIRMS $XRP ETF MEETING!! pic.twitter.com/mXejLYaf39 — BSC Gems Alert (@BSCGemsAlert) May 9, 2025 Why an XRP ETF Matters An XRP ETF could potentially revolutionize the way institutional and retail investors gain exposure to the digital asset. ETFs are investment vehicles that track the price of an underlying asset, allowing investors to trade shares on traditional stock exchanges. If approved, the XRP ETF would provide a regulated pathway for mainstream adoption, significantly boosting XRP’s liquidity and accessibility. Regulatory Hurdles and Market Impact Despite the enthusiasm, the regulatory landscape remains a significant hurdle. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been historically cautious regarding crypto-based ETFs. However, recent developments, including Ripple’s legal battles and subsequent settlement prospects , might pave the way for a more favorable outlook. Should the ETF gain approval, XRP could witness a substantial increase in institutional investments, potentially driving its price upward. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction and Market Speculation The XRP community has reacted positively to the news, with many expressing optimism about BlackRock’s involvement. Social media is abuzz with discussions on how the ETF could impact XRP’s market position. Some analysts believe that approval could signal a new era of regulatory clarity for XRP, while others caution against premature optimism given the SEC’s rigorous evaluation process. BlackRock’s confirmation of an XRP ETF meeting marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing evolution of digital assets within traditional finance. While the potential approval could significantly benefit XRP and its holders, investors must remain cautious and vigilant as the regulatory landscape unfolds. Nonetheless, the move underscores the growing recognition of XRP’s potential as a mainstream financial instrument.

Additionally, Pi Network has made it incredibly easy to mine crypto from just your smartphone. Here’s how you can get started: The Pi Mining app is the main app for Pi Network , available on both iOS and Android. Users can sign up, mine Pi, get updates, join community activities, and interact with others every day. How to Start Mining Pi Coins 1. Download the Pi Network App from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android). 2. Sign Up and Verify Your Account Register with your phone number or Facebook account, choose a password, and verify your identity through phone or email. 3. Enter an Invitation Code Pi Network operates on an invite-only system. So you will need a referral code from someone already in the network. Once you join, you create an earning team of one with just your inviter on the team. Important: The size of your inviter’s earning team has no impact on your mining rate. Some claim that joining their large earning teams will increase your earnings, but this is misleading. Note that your mining rate depends solely on your network, not theirs. 4. Start Mining Finally, you can start mining by tapping the lightning bolt “ ”. Mining sessions last 24 hours, so you will need to tap it every day to keep earning Pi. 5. Build Your Security Circle After 3 days of mining, you can boost your rate by adding your trusted people to your Circle. This will boost your network and increase your earnings. 6. Invite Friends to Boost Your Earnings Next, invite friends with your referral code to grow your network. The more the number of people in your team, the higher your mining rate. Also, locking up your Pi for a set period can boost your earnings, and using apps on the Pi Browser or running a Node can add more rewards. How Pi Mining Works- Pi mining relies on a unique system called Proof-of-Engagement. You will need to show that you are an active user by tapping the mining button daily, which will help keep bots and fake accounts away. Further, instead of using energy-intensive proof systems, Pi Network builds trust through Security Circles, which help keep the network secure and prevent fraud. When it was first launched, Pi’s mining rate was high, but it has since dropped as more people joined in. It started at 3.14 Pi per hour, but as of 2025, the base mining rate for Pi Network is approximately 0.0030 Pi per hour. Before using or transferring Pi, a KYC verification pass is needed. It usually requires a government-issued ID and is similar to the verification process on most crypto exchanges.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-11 14:33:21

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has meme coin potential along with a growing DeFi ecosystem and has witnessed a revival of interest, positioning for significant upside. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) continues to advance its ecosystem and scalability, making it a leading coin for the next big rally. However, all eyes are on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with analysts predicting that it can moon considering its fresh approach to decentralized finance and rapidly expanding community. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 65% sold out, already raking in over $7.9 million with over 9,700 investors participating. With over 65% the phase sold and public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. As the crypto market changes, these three altcoins could outshine XRP and lead the charge for massive gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA): two altcoins poised for explosive growth in 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB), which had been famous only as a meme currency, has been striving to gain a toehold in the DeFi and NFT sectors, which helped it attract dream of rapid growth. SHIB is on a mission to collect as many resources as possible to improve the ecosystem while gradually moving to dominate the altcoin market. Along the same line, Cardano (ADA) has been time and again criticized for its scalability and sustainability and these ongoing development and improvement make Cardano to stand tall as an asset of the future blockchain. Huge popularity from the masses and great reception by the public make it a mammoth project but the strong track of ADA in terms of fundamentals and continuous progress ensures its place among the projects that would surely offer long term gains. For both of these altcoins, new highs are being targeted in this year and 2025, there are some expectations of a new entrant into the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to outstrip both of them in terms of growth. Mutuum Finance: genuine innovation in DeFi lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 5 20% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-cap DeFi plays. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing serious attention, already raising $7.9M+ from over 9,700 early adopters, with Phase 4 over 65% sold out. At $0.025, this low-cap gem offers early buyers up to 140% gains by launch, and long-term projections reaching 5500% by Q4 2025. Major players like SHIB and ADA may rally, but MUTM’s hybrid DeFi model, community rewards, and explosive momentum set it apart. Time is running out, secure your allocation now before Phase 4 ends and the price climbs again.

Investors are closely observing these cryptocurrencies for potential breakthroughs. Could these be the next big winners in the crypto space? Readers will explore which coins are positioned for growth amid the current green trends. Ethena Price Action: Short-Term Surge Amid Long-Term Correction The past month ENA showed a strong upturn with a 33.29% gain and an impressive 38.05% boost in one week; however, over the past six months, the coin slipped by 36.28%. Such numbers suggest a period of vigorous short-term recovery contrasting with the longer-term downward pressure. Recent price behavior reflects rapid bursts of momentum despite a challenging half-year backdrop. Current price levels hover near resistance at $0.45 and support at $0.18, with key markers at $0.59 and $0.05 respectively. Bulls have pushed the price higher recently, as indicated by an RSI of 64.10 and positive momentum signals, though the overall trend remains unsettled. Traders might consider buying near support while keeping an eye out for a breakout past resistance. Avalanche Market Snapshot: Month Surge Amid Six-Month Decline AVAX past month performance shows a strong upward movement with a 36.87% price increase and a notable 22.25% boost in the past week. Over the last six months, the coin experienced a 29.87% decline, indicating a reversal from recent gains. This mixed history reflects a sharp short-term recovery set against a longer-term downturn. Current pricing trades in a range between roughly $16 to $24 with immediate resistance at $27.94 and support at $11.14. Bulls appear to be pushing prices upward, but a clear trend has yet to form. Traders may explore buying near the lower support while watching for breakouts toward resistance, with the second levels at $36.34 and $2.73 serving as broader market guides. Conclusion ENA and AVAX show promise as the market trends upward. Historical data reveals potential for growth. Investor interest is also on the rise, increasing their market presence. These factors suggest that both coins could see significant future gains. Whether they will be the next major success stories remains to be seen. The coming weeks will be crucial to watch.

While overall interest from everyday investors remains low and many people seem to have stepped back from crypto for now, Deutscher believes this might actually be the ideal time to start paying closer attention. According to him, Bitcoin is starting to break out, while many altcoins are showing signs of bottoming out, forming a “triple bottom” pattern on longer time frames. In market terms, this type of pattern often hints at the end of a downtrend and the possible start of a new bullish phase. Deutscher explains that staying tuned in during these slower moments can give traders and investors an important advantage. Typically, most people tend to jump in after prices have already started moving sharply. But those who stay informed and alert during the early, quieter stages are better positioned to benefit when momentum picks up. Among the altcoins on his radar is Pepe, an Ethereum-based meme coin known for leading moves within its category. Deutscher notes that while it isn’t a buy right now, it could present a good entry opportunity if the price pulls back. Another coin he’s watching closely is TAO, a token tied to the growing AI narrative in crypto. TAO recently broke through a major technical resistance level and, according to Deutscher, it’s one of the few tokens with the potential to hit new all-time highs, thanks to its strong story and momentum. Virtuals is also regaining attention. Popular earlier this year, activity on the platform had slowed, but user engagement is now picking up again — a sign that price action could soon follow. Deutscher said that a combination of promising technical charts, rising developer activity, and a lack of retail hype creates the right environment for sudden upward moves in the altcoin market. While the overall crypto market hasn’t fully confirmed a reversal yet, the signs show that the pieces are falling into place for a potentially strong rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BITTENSOR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-11 14:51:40

Here's Why Investors Are Flocking to Lightchain AI,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/is-pi-network-losing-steam-heres-why-investors-are-flocking-to-lightchain-ai,"Pi Network once generated massive buzz with its mobile-first mining approach, but many early supporters are beginning to question its long-term direction. With limited utility and delays in full-scale deployment, investor enthusiasm seems to be fading. In contrast, Lightchain AI is emerging as a powerful alternative — and it’s gaining serious traction fast. With over $20 million raised in its presale and tokens priced at just $0.007, Lightchain AI offers a compelling mix of innovation, real-world relevance, and growth potential. As Pi Network struggles to maintain momentum, savvy investors are pivoting toward Lightchain AI as the smarter, future-ready blockchain bet. Challenges Facing Pi Network Key Events Pi Network transition to its Open Mainnet in February 2025 was a significant development, facilitating external transactions and more extensive utility for its native token Pi (PI). But, the venture has certain limiting factors that may affect its future success. Key Challenges User Migration and KYC Verification - Although more than 18 million users have done KYC verification, only around 8 million account holders have migrated to the Mainnet, which represents a big difference that the staff is covering up. Volatility of token Price- Since the Open Mainnet of Pi, Price witness rapid increase and sharp decline which raises doubt over the stability of the market and trust of investors. Ecosystem Development- The target to release 100 or more dApps was not achieved and as of date, there are only approximately 27 dApps being used thus reducing the real-time use-case of the Pi network. Regulatory Attention- The legal status of the project differs between jurisdictions, and some common regulatory activity could make compliance an issue in the future. Although Pi Network has achieved significant milestones, overcoming these challenges is necessary for the continuing development and adoption of the cryptocurrency in today’s market. Can Lightchain AI Be Next Big Thing? With the future of Pi Network still unclear, many investors are exploring new options—and Lightchain AI is quickly gaining attention. Unlike Pi, which has faced delays and doubts about its token utility, Lightchain AI brings a clear vision by combining blockchain with artificial intelligence. This unique combination enables decentralized, AI-powered applications with practical use cases that go beyond mere speculation. By offering scalable and secure AI solutions, Lightchain AI positions itself as a forward-thinking project with significant long-term potential. As investors shift their focus to projects with defined roadmaps and real-world adoption, Lightchain AI stands out as a strong contender. Its emphasis on practical utility, cutting-edge technology, and decentralized innovation make it an exciting opportunity for those looking to invest in the future of crypto. How Lightchain AI Is Revolutionizing Crypto Market Lightchain AI is shaking up the crypto world by combining the power of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, paving the way for decentralized, AI-powered applications. While most cryptocurrencies stick to basic transactions or smart contracts, Lightchain AI goes further—creating real-world, AI-driven solutions that can transform industries. This isn’t just another speculative project or meme token. Lightchain AI is built for the future, offering scalability, security, and real utility. It’s a bold step toward making blockchain technology genuinely useful, not just trendy. For investors seeking more than hype, this could be the long-term game changer you’ve been waiting for. With demand for AI and blockchain integration on the rise, Lightchain AI is forging a path that could redefine decentralized applications. It’s not just another player—it’s a transformative force reshaping the future of crypto.

As the market shifts into a bullish phase in 2025, SUI, Arbitrum (ARB), PEPE, and Rexas Finance (RXS) have emerged as high-potential candidates. These projects show rising user engagement and price activity supported by growing ecosystems. SUI Recovering from Key Technical Levels SUI has rebounded after retesting important support, reclaiming the $2.18 level and testing resistance at $2.22. Analysts view this zone as a trigger point for a potential move toward $2.52 and higher. The token recently broke out from a falling wedge pattern. After a pullback, it retested the wedge’s upper line at $2.00, which held as support. The MACD turned positive, while the RSI is rising slowly, suggesting upward momentum without overheating. On-chain data also supports the bullish setup. SUI’s total value locked (TVL) reached $2.08 billion in Q1 2025. Its stablecoin supply grew to $721 million, surpassing Optimism. This increase shows rising use in payments, DeFi, and trading activities. Arbitrum Stabilizing After Reaching Lows Arbitrum (ARB) faced high volatility, dropping to $0.245 in early April. It has since stabilized, now trading near $0.31. Analysts report the asset is ranging between support at $0.26 and resistance around $0.43. Arbitrum is still among the leading Ethereum Layer 2 solutions in terms of Total Value Locked, with $2.32 Billion. Its BOLD testnet that was later launched enabled permissionless validation, making the process more secure and decentralized. However, short-term indicators are signaling a potential reversal while demonstrating trading below the 200-day moving average. If this level is cleared, then the highs in 2025 might be near $0.82 as per the above chart. Market conditions in a broader perspective can affect the performance of a firm. PEPE Early Signs of a Potential Breakout Pepe, which is an altcoin based on the meme, has declined significantly, reaching 0.00000864 from $0.00002825. But, it indicates indicators for retesting of the support zone at $0.0000058. The price has since stabilised somewhat, and stands at roughly $0.0000074. The short-term trend looks bullish now as we really see recent technical indications, such as the MACD crossover, have taken a golden cross. The volume seems to be heating up and if the token price surges past $0.0000093, higher targets at $0.0000107 and $0.0000145 are possible. Overall sentiment remains bearish on the markets but some traders perceive the symmetrical triangle pattern as a support/confluence level for the move. Higher interest may help further prop up the token, but the impact over time may not necessarily be linear. Rexas Finance (RXS) Real-World Utility with Growing Investor Interest Rexas Finance (RXS) allows tokenization of real-world tangible and intangible assets, such as real estate and patents. It can integrate with multiple chains and supports tokens such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. Currently, RXS is available in its presale at $0.20, with a listing price of $0.25 set for June 19, 2025. The project has raised over $47.6million and boasts a CertiK audit. Investor confidence has further been enhanced through listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. ⭐️ Milestone Alert! ⭐️Rexas Finance has successfully raised $47.6 Million! 🚀Thank you for your support! 👍Buy Now: https://t.co/tNJAsvBiYe pic.twitter.com/ReSRlfh7un — Rexas Finance (@rexasfinance) March 22, 2025 It involves DeFi utilities, staking options, and NFT functionalities.

Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users. As AI agents increasingly operate in DeFi, this infrastructure limitation becomes critical. We need standardized infrastructure that allows for secure, cost-effective automation with verifiable guardrails across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Automation needs guardrails, not guesswork The rise of autonomous agents opens new possibilities: hands-free DeFi strategies, real-time portfolio optimization and crosschain arbitrage. Without programmable permissions and onchain visibility, however, delegating control to AI can expose users to catastrophic risk. Malicious bots, hallucinating agents and poorly designed automation can drain wallets before a human notices. We’ve already seen what happens when agent infrastructure fails. In September 2024, users of the Telegram-based trading bot Banana Gun lost 563 Ether ( ETH ) (approximately $1.9 million) through an exploited oracle vulnerability that allowed attackers to intercept messages and gain unauthorized access to user wallets. More recently, attackers breached Aixbt’s dashboard and issued commands to transfer funds directly, resulting in the loss of 55.5 ETH worth over $100,000. These aren’t isolated incidents — they are warning signs of systemic vulnerability in our automation infrastructure. Legacy wallets can’t support autonomous agents Despite years of wallet innovation, the architecture remains static mainly : sign a transaction, broadcast it, repeat. Most wallets aren’t built to understand “intent,” verify that automation matches user-defined rules, or restrict activity by time, asset type or strategy. This rigidity creates an all-or-nothing dynamic: either you maintain manual control and miss out on fast-moving opportunities or you hand over access entirely to opaque third-party systems. For AI-powered DeFi to scale securely as it builds more utility, we need programmable, composable and verifiable infrastructure. Programmable permissions are the new trust layer As smart contracts encode logic into DeFi protocols, wallet infrastructure must encode logic into user control. That means enabling session-based permissions, cryptographic verification of agent actions and the ability to revoke access in real-time. Recent: AI and blockchain — A match made in heaven With these features in place, users can delegate trading, rebalancing or strategy execution without giving up complete control. This approach doesn’t just mitigate risk — it expands access. Advanced DeFi strategies could become accessible to users without technical knowledge and managed securely by agents operating within verifiable constraints. Programmable infrastructure makes DeFi scalable Programmable wallet infrastructure doesn’t just make DeFi safer — it makes it scalable. Fragmentation across chains and protocols has long been a barrier to automated strategies. A universal keystore protocol that syncs permissions across networks can streamline crosschain delegation and open the door for interoperable agent ecosystems. As institutional interest in DeFi grows , secure automation will be non-negotiable. Most firms won’t allow AI agents to interact with capital without verifiable guardrails. Just as zero-knowledge proofs are becoming essential to privacy and compliance, programmable wallet permissions may become standard for agent-based security . The future of DeFi Some may argue that AI can’t be trusted with financial autonomy, but traditional markets have already adopted algorithmic trading and black box automation. DeFi isn’t immune — it’s simply unprepared. If crypto is to maintain its transparency and user sovereignty principles, it must build infrastructure that keeps AI agents in check. That starts with rebuilding wallets as interfaces and operating systems for the autonomous, multichain economy. DeFi is on the edge of an automation revolution. The question isn’t whether agents will participate. Whether we give them the rails, they need to act in service of users, not in spite of them. Opinion by: Sean Li, co-founder of Magic Labs.

BSV, which currently trades around $42, is a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which itself forked from the original Bitcoin (BTC) network. According to Law360 , the plaintiffs are asking for the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal to revisit a July 2024 ruling that dismissed their “loss of chance” claim. BSV Backers Blame Binance Delisting for Altcoin’s Decline They argue that Binance’s decision to delist BSV, along with similar actions by other major exchanges, effectively suppressed the altcoin’s market potential. The original claim sought $9 billion in damages, but the investors now say they could pursue up to £10 billion (approximately $13 billion) if the case moves forward. The legal team contends that BSV never recovered from the delistings and continues to underperform due to lack of visibility and trading access. Despite a 15% price bump following news of the revived legal effort, BSV remains in a persistent downtrend and has failed to gain meaningful market share or network power relative to Bitcoin. Today we are at the Royal Court of Justice in London The case is ""BSV Holdings Limited"" vs crypto exchanges such as @krakenfx and @binance . It is over the delisting of the BSV coin in 2019 and BSV holders are asking for £9 billion. The exchanges tried to stop the case going to… pic.twitter.com/0tITwdvrCz — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) May 8, 2025 Binance removed BSV in April 2019, citing concerns over its listing standards. The move followed repeated claims by BSV’s creator, Craig Wright, who has long asserted—without proof—that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had publicly warned that Wright’s behavior could result in delisting. Since then, BSV has also been the target of several 51% attacks, undermining trust in its blockchain’s security and stability. These setbacks have only deepened skepticism about the project’s viability, even as its backers press ahead with legal action. CZ Confirms Pardon Request After Initial Denial Last week, CZ confirmed that he has formally applied for a presidential pardon, weeks after initially denying reports of such a move . Speaking on the Farokh Radio podcast aired May 6, Zhao said his legal team filed the request following widespread media speculation. “I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said during the interview, saying that he ultimately decided to move forward after stories from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal suggested he was pursuing a pardon from former U.S. President Donald Trump. “If they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply,” Zhao added. The former crypto mogul pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in November 2023 as part of a settlement with U.S. authorities. The agreement led to Binance paying $4.3 billion in fines, with Zhao personally contributing $50 million. He was sentenced to four months in prison and barred from holding any management position at Binance as a condition of the deal. Zhao has since shifted focus to international advisory work, offering guidance to governments in Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan on crypto regulation and blockchain integration.

Ripple (XRP) has stumbled, as its price has been affected by the continued speculation of control over the supply and insider moves, discouraging many holders. In other news, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is lighting up the market after raising $7,900,000 as its ongoing presale, selling over 454 million tokens to 9,700 holders. Does Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represent a solution to their disappointment? Experts agree that has the momentum of a powerful turn. Ripple (XRP)’s Struggles Persist Ripple (XRP) is struggling with ongoing issues that throw a shadow on its attractiveness. The price of its tokens is speculated about with theories that monthly escrow releases limit the price increase of the tokens. A pseudonymous analysis was also brought up recently, which pointed out the intricate dynamics of networks with a negative correlation of transaction patterns and price, which incited suspicions about the market manipulation. Despite attorney Bill Morgan’s counterpoint that Ripple’s effect is just a handful, judging by its sales of less than 1% of the monthly trading volume, the investor entropy continues to decline. The price of Ripple (XRP)’s, currently below expectations speaks of this unease. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Sparks Investor Frenzy In the crypto market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a distinctive niche for itself due to its decentralized lending model. Phase 4 of its 11-phase presale is at $0.025 (after the opening phase’s $0.01), which is quite a steep rise. Investors are flooding in thanks to the promise of a 20% gain when phase 5 gets going at $0.03. The tokenomics ensure a 140% return at the listing price of $0.06, with analysts looking at a post-launch increase to $2.50, which represents a staggering 9,900% ROI. In a bid to build trust, the team is in the process of finalizing a smart contract audit with Certik, which will soon be published through different social platforms, to prove its authenticity. So much as a result of this transparency and an additional dashboard released recently that rewards the top 50 holders with bonus turned, is driving an urgency. The swift sellout of Phase 4 will kick off the finance aspect of FOMO, pressuring investors to move fast. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Robust Ecosystem The appeal of MUTUM Finance (MUTM) is its workable DeFi model. Its dual lending system – p2c (peer to contract), p2p (peer to peer) lends users the option to lend assets for passive income, or borrow with over collateralized, stable loans. Through the buy-and-distribute mechanism, the platform profits are pumped back into repurchasing MUTM tokens to bolster demand between stakers. This innovative tactic is essentially at odds with Ripple (XRP)’s speculative boogeymen. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $100,000 community giveaway, with $10,000 tokens to be awarded to each of the 10 winners, adds to the excitement. Towards the end of phase 4, the project’s systematic rise and applied value puts it in the spotlight for rewriting the rules of decentralized finance. A New Dawn for Disillusioned Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving a lifeline to those disappointed by Ripple (XRP)’s flat trajectory. Its presale success, clear roadmap, and a strong lending model offer a glaring comparison to Ripple (XRP)’s regulatory and market troubles. Investors who are looking for stability and incredible growth are finding comfort in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s measured approach. The opportunity window gets smaller, as phase 5 price increase closes in hard. For those ready to consider departure from Ripple (XRP)’s uncertainty, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) calls out with promise.

As Tron (TRX) crosses $750 million in DEX volume and Dogecoin (DOGE) dips after a steep drop, another project is seizing attention in a unique way. BlockDAG is catching eyes thanks to its link with Inter Milan’s Champions League final appearance. Beyond just hype, BlockDAG ’s rise is about timing, relevance, and presence, standing apart from Tron’s data-driven gains and DOGE’s recent price action. BlockDAG Gains Big With Inter Milan’s Champions League Run When Inter Milan advanced to the Champions League final after a long wait, the excitement wasn’t limited to just football fans. BlockDAG, a crypto project that aligned its branding with the club, found itself center stage during a peak moment in global sports media. As millions tuned in worldwide, BlockDAG’s name flashed on LED boards, social posts, and viral replays. This isn’t just exposure, it’s emotional branding when audiences are most engaged. BlockDAG becomes more than a crypto project, it becomes part of the story fans are watching. Alongside this media buzz, BlockDAG’s presale is heating up. With over $235 million already raised, the project is in batch 28 at $0.0262, but a limited-time discount cuts the price to $0.0019 until May 13. More than 19.9 billion coins have been snapped up, and early buyers from batch 1 have seen a 2,520% return. While Inter fans ride the energy of this rare run, BlockDAG is locking in momentum as the next big crypto, using sports and timing to build a bold narrative beyond standard token metrics. Tron (TRX) Price Update Highlights Strength Behind $750M DEX Volume Surge Tron (TRX) is gaining traction after hitting a yearly high of $750 million in DEX volume, reflecting a major surge in on-chain activity. This jump in transactions signals growing user engagement and gives bulls something to watch closely. At the same time, Tron is holding firm at the $0.244 support mark, showing buyers are defending this price range despite broader market fluctuations. This Tron (TRX) price update underlines a strong foundation. If current momentum holds, TRX could see a bullish move. The rising volume and active usage are giving traders reasons to stay focused on the token’s strength. Looking forward, traders are watching to see if this support level can trigger a rally or if the price stalls. Either way, Tron is still high on buyer watchlists, thanks to its steady on-chain performance. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Drop Followed by Rising Volume The recent Dogecoin (DOGE) price drop is drawing attention, especially with volume spiking during the slide. After a brief uptick, DOGE slipped by nearly 5% while on-chain activity surged to $1.37 billion. That shows traders are not just sitting back, they’re reacting and repositioning fast. What stands out here is the shift in the technical picture. The RSI has fallen below the midpoint, hinting at more selling ahead. Meanwhile, the MACD’s fading momentum adds to bearish concerns. Even with strong community support, the current setup suggests the pullback may not be done yet. Right now, the $0.12 level is seen as a possible stabilization point, but uncertainty remains high with volume climbing. Whether this turns into a deeper correction or a quick shakeout depends on how the market responds next. Final Word Market trends come from both hard data and moments that grab attention. Tron (TRX) builds strength with rising DEX activity, and Dogecoin (DOGE) faces technical pressure. But BlockDAG has carved a unique lane by riding the momentum of Inter Milan’s Champions League push. As millions tune in for one of Europe’s biggest football events, BlockDAG gains global visibility at just the right time. With its $235 million presale in motion, this isn’t just marketing, it’s a calculated move that positions BlockDAG as the next big crypto contender worth watching.

The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin’s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023. According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark. The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

Analyst Outlook Revealed Featuring NEAR",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-cardano-solana-or-ethereum-the-smarter-bet-for-may-2025-analyst-outlook-revealed-featuring-near/,"The crypto market faces an important transitional phase in May 2025. The top blockchain assets, including ADA, SOL, and ETH, have evidenced stability during their first year of wild market swings and regulatory changes alongside speculative events. Investors are uncertain between a potential $2,000 resistance test or declining further for Ethereum which maintains its position at $1,800. Early investors are drawn to MAGACOINFINANCE which provides a time-bound allocation bonus of 50% for seeking investment opportunities in a market showing limited movement. MAGACOINFINANCE stands as a new crypto project that is slowly building momentum while others suffer from stagnation. MAGACOINFINANCE offers the exclusive MAGA50X code to provide presale participants with capital bonus allocations during its restricted-time initial purchasing term for those searching intense market involvement across an unchanging crypto market. Although in its early stages this development introduces new storytelling elements to the actively competitive L1 blockchains running today. Cardano, Solana, and Ethereum Are Eyeing Major May Breakouts Each of the top three Layer-1s is carving its own narrative for May: The cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) currently trades at $144.18 with its market capitalization reaching $67.2 billion. After reaching new peaks SOL exhibited a temporary price reduction while preserving its enduring market value. The price of SOL experienced dramatic volatility during the past year as it fluctuated from $96 to $294. A positive market bounce off current support levels might create conditions for SOL to surpass $180 in this brief period. ETH maintains its position at $1,828 while sustaining a narrow trading band as it recovers from its early April lows. ETH experienced substantial price decline above 50% from its all-time high as investors focus on its current market trends to break through $4,000 resistance. Analysts follow accumulation zones intensely because they consider $1,785 to represent critical support. Long-term buying strength could propel ETH to cross $2,000 which represents an important psychological benchmark. The ADA cryptocurrency maintains its speculative standing while trading close to $0.66. Building on the value of ADA depends on upcoming technical implementations since its market capital exceeds $23 billion and its circulating token supply reaches over 35.3 billion. The whale population’s recent stake increase shows potential while the possibility of a spot ETF might further accelerate market movement. The price of ADA currently exists at 79% beneath its all-time highest point indicating extensive growth potential once the following price rise occurs. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOINFINANCE Draws Volume as Over 60% of Current Token Supply Sells Out The ongoing token sale for MAGACOINFINANCE has reached its most critical stage.

The MAGACOINFINANCE presale stands out as one of the most talked about recent Token purchases owing to its early bird bonus scheme for users activating the MAGA50X discount code. Discord and Telegram forum users share predominantly positive sentiments because Telegram provides budget-friendly services and users show increasing interest in new utility capabilities.

Multiple market participants including short-term traders and long-term investors monitor the various presale targets. Conclusion: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and MAGACOINFINANCE All Eye Next Phase as Capital Rotation Rises 31% Month-Over-Month The $1,828 price level of Ethereum shows signs of being an interim pattern. Technical indicators point to ETH potentially reaching $1,880 over the near future under positive macroeconomic conditions. Despite its $144 price dip Solana continues to attract developers along with members of its ecosystem. Multiple large investors are actively purchasing Cardano tokens. MAGACOINFINANCE implements a strategic presale approach which presents opportunities to investors at non-traditional points. Market participants show a 31% Month over Month increase in capital rotation as they shift between established majors and emerging early-stage plays instead of focusing on one specific metric.

Its 24-hour volume jumped by 291% to $493 million. The ETHFI token jumped as the total value locked in its ecosystem jumped to a record high of 2.72 million ETG, up from 2.42 million in January. It has risen from 46,000 in January last year. The TVL has jumped to $6.86 billion in U.S. dollar terms, making it the fourth-biggest player in the decentralized finance platform. This growth has led to a big increase in its weekly fees. DeFi Llama data shows that the weekly fees jumped to $3.1 million, its highest point since February this year. Ether.fi ’s monthly revenue jumped to $2.4 million, with a portion of it going to its token buyback. April protocol revenue totalled $2.4M (avg ETH price $1,716). A portion of revenue will be utilized for $ETHFI buybacks https://t.co/IBC0U0WVtf — ether.fi Foundation (@ether_fi_Fdn) May 8, 2025 Ether.fi’s network has done well in the past few days because of the ongoing Ethereum ( ETH ) price surge.

Enthusiasts and investors alike are increasingly attentive, sparking curiosity about impending price movements. With market dynamics shifting, a notable rise in these digital assets could be on the horizon. Dive deeper to uncover which coins might be primed for growth. Solana Price Dynamics: Recent Surge Amid Long-Term Correction SOL recorded a 55.64% increase over the last month while showing a 21.16% decline over the past six months. A 19.53% gain in the past week adds to a volatile picture with a mix of short-term bullish activity and longer-term downward pressure. Price action over these periods points to a notable rally in recent times contrasting with an extended period of loss recovery, reflecting a dynamic yet unsettled market history. Current trading sees prices fluctuating between $109.64 and $171.28. Resistance stands strong at $194.93 while support appears at $71.65. Bulls show recent strength, but no clear trend emerges. Consider buying near support and selling as prices approach resistance. Cardano Rally: Recent Momentum and Key Trading Levels Last month showed a strong upward movement with a 32.68% gain, adding to a six-month increase of around 31.60%. The coin displayed noticeable weekly strength of over 15%, indicating fresh buyer interest and growing momentum. Price activity over these periods shows that Cardano has maintained relative gains, attracting attention from traders looking for a steady upward channel. Cardano current prices are trading between $0.55 and $0.78, with immediate resistance at $0.88 and support at $0.41. Bulls appear to be in control as the asset approaches these levels, although a clear trend has not firmly established itself. Traders may consider waiting for a break above $0.88 or a dip toward $0.41 to refine their entry points. Conclusion SOL and ADA are showing signs of increased interest from buyers. This accumulation often hints at a possible rise in value. Market movements support a potential price surge. Investors are watching closely, anticipating a significant shift. Overall sentiment appears positive, as the buildup continues. This trend suggests a keen eye should be kept on future developments.

After a surge driven by weekend volatility, traders are eyeing whether the world’s top cryptocurrency is on the brink of a new breakout. Volatility Fuels Multimonth Highs Data showed Bitcoin reaching a high near $105,000 over the weekend. This jump occurred during low liquidity trading hours and coincided with renewed speculation about a positive shift in US-China trade relations. According to analyst Rekt Capital, the current price level is crucial. “Can Bitcoin do it? Can Bitcoin Weekly Close above the Range High of its recently reclaimed Re-Accumulation Range to kickstart the breakout process?” he asked on X. He suggested that Bitcoin may be entering the second phase of its “Price Discovery Uptrend,” a period historically characterized by steep gains. Bull Market May Still Have Room to Run Rekt Capital’s analysis pegged the current bull market as 85.5% complete but noted that some of the most volatile gains may still be ahead. Market monitoring site CoinGlass showed a concentration of sell orders just under $106,000, while buy orders stacked below $102,000 indicated strong interest around the current trading band. This dense liquidity zone suggests both bulls and bears are gearing up for the next significant price move. Skeptics Warn of a Fakeout Despite the optimism, some traders remain cautious. A popular trader known as HTL-NL suggested the current upswing could be a “fake out,” aimed at trapping latecomers betting on more gains. “Will $BTC close/open the week remaining within the range, will it do a ‘fake out (UTAD)’ or was this really a reaccumulation range as many want to believe,” he said. He admitted that while a genuine reaccumulation phase is possible, his primary expectation is that the rally may not sustain itself. Correction Risks Still Linger Il Capo of Crypto, a well-known bearish voice in the space, echoed similar warnings. “This is the time to scale out, not in,” he posted on May 10, cautioning that the rebound since early 2024 could eventually be wiped out if Bitcoin fails to break through resistance convincingly. With strong resistance being tested, the coming days could determine whether Bitcoin will soar to new highs or retreat once again.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-11 15:23:17

Pump.fun recent SOL sales (Source: EmberCN) EmberCN said: “Pump.fun will transfer these SOLs to Kraken after accumulating one to two weeks of transaction fee income.” With the recent sale, Pump.fun has sold over $38 million worth of SOL this month alone. While this reflects its selling behavior, the fact that it deposited a higher amount of SOL in its latest transfer than more recent ones suggests that it might be seeing a resurgence in activity, driving up its transaction fees. Data from Dune Analytics support this, with the protocol seeing an increase in its daily volumes this month. In the last 24 hours alone, over 26,000 tokens have launched on the protocol. Pump.fun sells over $700 million SOL in more than a year While the recent selloffs by Pump.fun are not surprising, the timing brings back the debate over the impact of the memecoin launchpad on the Solana ecosystem. On the one hand, the platform allowed Solana to become the leading network for memecoins, thereby boosting the chain activity. However, concerns about how Pump.fun is only extracting value from the Solana ecosystem have grown with every SOL sale by the protocol, with many believing it has caused more harm than good. Despite the differing opinions, the one clear thing is that Pump.fun SOL sales represent a major selling pressure for the token. Interestingly, the platform has sold 3.868 million SOL tokens worth over $701.76 million in more than a year, with an average price of $183.3. Its latest sales even coincide with the SOL price resurgence, leading to speculation that it might be taking profits. The token has seen a 45% rise in value in the last 30 days, making it one of the best performers in that period. Meanwhile, SOL is now trading around $171, with its value steady over the last 24 hours despite the recent sell-offs by Pump.fun. Although the token is still down 11% year-to-date, many see the recent gains as a sign of optimism and resurgence. Memecoins are up 82% in average price in the last four months SOL’s positive performance reflects the gains of the memecoin sector in recent weeks. According to CoinMarketCap, the sector has seen an increase of 58.78% in its market cap over the last 30 days, while the average price has also increased by 82.43%. Almost all the major cap memecoins, starting from the leading token DOGE, have recorded at least double-digit gains in the past month. Outliers such as WIF, PENGU, BRETT, and PNUT have even seen over 100% increase in value. While the broader market performance has also influenced memecoin gains, the sector’s substantially higher growth during the period suggests that investors might be interested in memecoin again. Still, not everyone is sold on memecoins. A recent report by Solidus Labs claims that 98.6% of tokens launched on Pump.fun are pump and dump schemes or rug pull while. It added that only 97,000 of the seven million memecoins launched through the platform had maintained at least $1,000 liquidity. The report represents a criticism of a sector many believe exemplifies everything wrong with the crypto industry, where bad actors continue to embezzle billions and retail investors leave with losses. However, Pump.fun has pushed back on the criticisms, stating that the long-term worthlessness of memecoins is a feature, not a bug. The protocol spokesperson, Troy Gravitt, stated that a functioning marketplace for those who want to trade is more important.

While the rally has been rapid, and the current technical signals suggest there’s still gas left in the tank, caution is still warranted. The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has pushed decisively above the $100K resistance and is now hovering around the $104K mark. This breakout marks a clear escape from the month-long compression between the rising trendline and the 100 and 200-day moving averages. The price has reclaimed both the moving averages around the $90K price level, and the RSI is holding above 70, indicating strong momentum. However, it also points to slightly overbought conditions. If the buyers maintain pressure and avoid sharp rejections, a run toward a new all-time high is likely. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, the breakout becomes even clearer. BTC exited an ascending channel pattern to the upside, rallying through the previous key supply zone around $98K with almost no resistance. Since then, the asset has been grinding higher in an orderly fashion, supported by the RSI cooling off. The latest price action shows signs of slowing momentum, but there’s no reversal confirmation yet. A healthy pullback into the $100K–$98K range would be a logical area to look for continuation setups if the buyers remain in control. However, if that level fails, support at $94K could catch the next wave of bids. Onchain Analysis Miner Reserve On-chain data reveals a persistent downtrend in the Bitcoin Miner Reserve, which has now dropped to around 1.8M BTC, the lowest in recent years. This suggests that miners are not accumulating, but rather continuing a long-term distribution pattern. Instead of increasing their holdings during this rally, they appear to be gradually offloading BTC, possibly to capitalize on higher prices or manage operational costs post-halving. While this doesn’t necessarily signal aggressive selling, it does indicate that miners are not contributing to long-term supply tightening at the moment. Their lack of accumulation, in contrast to strong spot buying, reinforces the idea that current demand is being driven by other market participants, such as institutions and retail investors.

A successful breakout could trigger a fresh rally toward the $3 threshold. XRP Analysis The Daily Chart Following an influx of buyers at the key 200-day moving average support near $2.1, XRP has surged toward a decisive resistance area. This critical region includes the upper boundary of the prolonged wedge pattern at $2.5, which poses a robust barrier for buyers. A breakout above this level, followed by a successful pullback, could initiate a bullish rally toward Ripple’s all-time high of $3.4 in the mid-term. Conversely, a rejection at this resistance would likely lead to a consolidation phase within the wedge, providing the market time to rebuild momentum. Overall, XRP remains confined between the wedge’s upper boundary and the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, awaiting a breakout to define its next major direction. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ripple’s push toward the $2.5 wedge boundary highlights increasing bullish pressure. However, the price has faced a mild rejection at this level, prompting a retracement to the short-term support zone at $2.3. This area is likely to provide a temporary floor. XRP currently trades within a narrow range between the $2.3 support and the wedge’s upper boundary. The most probable scenario is a bullish breakout above this structure, which would pave the way for a continuation toward the $3 resistance zone.

The service, provided via Coinbase Derivatives LLC, now allows traders to trade around the clock—including nights, weekends, and holidays. Closing the Time Gap in U.S. Crypto Markets Until now, CFTC-regulated derivatives were restricted to weekday sessions, creating a disconnect with the global crypto market’s nonstop pace. This strategic move lets traders respond instantly to volatile price shifts and aligns with crypto’s always-on nature. Coinbase said this offering will support both institutional-grade and retail-sized contracts. Clearing will be handled by Nodal Clear, ensuring compliance and transparency. Key Partnerships Powering the Launch To support this 24/7 launch, Coinbase partnered with market maker Virtu Financial and several Futures Commission Merchants, including ABN AMRO, Wedbush Securities, and Coinbase Financial Markets. Coinbase Financial Markets CEO Andy Sears called it a “game-changer,” highlighting the platform’s commitment to providing frictionless access through Coinbase Advanced. $2.9 Billion Deribit Acquisition Strengthens Strategy Coinbase’s derivatives push gathered steam with its $2.9 billion purchase of crypto options exchange Deribit, announced just a day ahead of the 24/7 futures launch. The acquisition includes $700 million in cash and 11 million Coinbase shares. The transaction, which is expected to be finalized by year-end pending regulatory approvals, adds Deribit’s options and perpetuals products to Coinbase’s growing stable—a capital-efficient platform for spot, futures, perpetuals, and options trading. Regulated Perpetual Futures in the Pipeline Further ahead, Coinbase plans to unveil U.S.-regulated perpetual-style futures—expiry-free contracts long popular on offshore exchanges. Such offerings position Coinbase to conquer a flourishing market, with April alone seeing $1.9 trillion in BTC futures volume, with $22.1 billion via Deribit. Competitive Landscape Heats Up Coinbase’s Q1 earnings revealed 37% YoY growth in subscriptions and services revenue to $698.1 million, reflecting hunger for non-trading revenue sources. Meanwhile, rivals like Kraken are expanding as well, with leveraged forex perps and UK market pushes, pointing to the fierce fight for crypto derivatives dominance in 2025.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-11 15:50:00

Following a series of bullish developments, XRP (Ripple) is poised for significant growth, with predictions suggesting that it could reach $5 by 2026.

Coldware (COLD) Emerges as the New Player in Real-World Asset Tokenization While XRP (Ripple) is making strides in the financial sector, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a leader in Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. As demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions grows, Coldware (COLD) is capturing the attention of investors with its focus on providing seamless access to tokenized real-world assets, such as real estate and commodities. The upcoming release of Coldware’s Web3 hardware is expected to drive significant growth, bringing further attention to Coldware (COLD) and its ecosystem.

XRP’s Price Prediction: Will $5 Be the New Reality?

With the potential for a spot XRP (Ripple) ETF approval in the U.S. and the growing adoption of XRP (Ripple) by financial institutions, the sky’s the limit for this cryptocurrency. Recent analysis shows that XRP (Ripple) is testing key resistance levels, and if it breaks through, a rally toward $5 is highly probable. Despite some market challenges, XRP (Ripple) continues to showcase its real-world utility in facilitating fast, low-cost cross-border payments, positioning it as a top contender in the financial services space. Why These Two Are Poised for Big Gains Both XRP (Ripple) and Coldware (COLD) are set to continue their growth trajectories, driven by increasing demand in their respective markets. While XRP (Ripple) is solidifying its position as a leader in cross-border payments and financial services, Coldware (COLD) is pushing the boundaries of DeFi with its innovative real-world asset tokenization solutions. With XRP (Ripple) set to break new price milestones and Coldware (COLD) gearing up for significant growth, the future looks incredibly bright for these two cryptocurrencies. Investors and analysts alike are bullish on the potential of both XRP (Ripple) and Coldware (COLD), making them key assets to watch in the coming years. The Road Ahead for XRP and Coldware As we look toward 2026, XRP (Ripple) is set to solidify its dominance in the cross-border payment space, while Coldware (COLD) is gearing up for explosive growth in the tokenization of real-world assets.

Furthermore, Meta is revisiting crypto with stablecoin plans, as institutional interest in altcoins, tokenized real estate, and Web3 projects accelerates. Meanwhile, regulators remain active, with Arizona creating a Bitcoin reserve and the SEC postponing a decision on a Litecoin ETF. Let’s find out more. Bitcoin Bhutan has partnered with Binance Pay and DK Bank to launch the world's first national crypto-based tourism system that will allow travellers with Binance accounts to pay for services like hotels and tickets using over 100 crypto assets. Ethereum The Ethereum blockchain has officially launched its Pectra upgrade, introducing a suite of changes designed to enhance staking capabilities, improve user experience, and significantly boost scalability. Business Meta is reportedly revisiting its cryptocurrency ambitions, exploring stablecoin integrations for payment services across its platforms after a three-year retreat from the sector. Alex Mashinsky, the former chief executive of defunct crypto lending platform Celsius, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in a sweeping fraud that contributed to the platform’s collapse and inflicted billions in losses on investors. Two major players in the digital asset investment space, Bitwise and 21Shares , have made fresh moves to diversify beyond flagship cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling growing institutional interest in layer-1 protocols and platform tokens. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has further strengthened its position in the cryptocurrency market, acquiring an additional 555 Bitcoin for approximately $53.4 million. Web3 KuCoin Pay and WLTG, founded by football legend Patrice Evra, have announced a groundbreaking partnership that blends blockchain, AI, and social impact to empower fans worldwide through seamless crypto payments, AI-driven fan engagement, and a global Pay It Forward movement.

After the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved to end its legal battle with Ripple , attention has again shifted to the agency regarding a decision on an investment product related to XRP expected in June. Specifically, in late April, the SEC extended its review of Franklin Templeton’s application for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) to June 17, 2025, a date that could be pivotal for the token. Franklin Templeton is among the largest asset managers seeking approval for an XRP-based ETF. If approved, the fund would allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional brokerage accounts, potentially driving the asset’s price upward. In comparison, when spot ETFs for Bitcoin ( BTC ) were approved in January 2024, prices surged as institutional money poured in. Ethereum ( ETH ) also experienced a significant rally amid ETF-related speculation. Consequently, investors now expect XRP to be next in line for a similar breakout, especially within the large U.S. market. While Brazil previously approved the world’s first XRP spot ETF , this had little impact on the token’s price due to the smaller size of Brazil’s financial markets. XRP’s legal clarity Adding fuel to the fire is the recent resolution of Ripple’s long-standing legal dispute with the SEC. On May 8, the parties settled, with Ripple agreeing to a reduced $50 million fine and all appeals withdrawn. This outcome lifted the sales restrictions that had hampered Ripple’s U.S. operations for years, paving the way for broader institutional involvement and boosting confidence in XRP’s regulatory clarity. Furthermore, optimism has continued to build with new, more crypto-friendly leadership at the SEC and ETF approval odds on the market betting platform Polymarket , which are currently standing at 77% for 2025. Meanwhile, amid the growing excitement, whales have shown increasing confidence in XRP’s long-term prospects through continued accumulation. For example, whales accumulated 800 million XRP throughout April, a significant potential catalyst for future price growth. XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.36, down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours but up approximately 7.8% on the weekly timeframe. XRP seven-day price chart.

XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts He cited a long-term symmetrical triangle pattern that has formed since 2018, with $15 as the pattern’s highest projected target. While the outlook is bullish, caution remains necessary, as such patterns can also produce false signals, especially given XRP’s sensitivity to broader market sentiment.

Priced at just $0.025, a rally of that magnitude would place MUTM near $3.78, an ambitious but not unrealistic target considering previous bull market patterns. Now, in phase 4 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is capturing investor attention with a bold mix of utility and explosive potential. Once Phase 5 begins, the token price will increase to $0.03, offering 20% ROI for Phase 4 investors. The project has already raised over $7.9 million from more than 9,700 investors, with Phase 4 already more than 65% sold out. Experts point to its strong DeFi fundamentals, growing community backing, and perfect positioning ahead of the next altcoin cycle. For investors hunting the next breakout star before it gains traction, MUTM may just be the sleeper hit of the coming year. Presale Growth The MUTM token is currently priced at $0.025 and is in high demand. Investors entering during this Phase 4 stage stand to gain a 20% increase when Phase 5 kicks off. With listing price set at $0.06, several crypto analysts are already forecasting a potential surge to as high as $3.78, an exponential jump from today’s presale value. These factors contribute to why MUTM is one of the most talked-about low-price DeFi tokens. Shaping the Next Generation of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a forerunner in the DeFi market because of its hybrid lending model, which takes the best from Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract model provides users with a stable way of earning passive income. The platform uses smart contracts to control the liquidity pools, removing intermediaries and reducing human error. Users can earn stable yields by participating in the pools as the smart contracts allocate funds, interest, and risk management automatically. This passive approach appeals to users who want a secure and automated method of earning income in the DeFi ecosystem. On the contrary, the Peer-to-Peer model offers the users the opportunity to negotiate terms of a loan directly between themselves. The decentralized system offers greater privacy and control, with both borrowers and lenders in a position to structure agreements to fit individual needs. P2P lending is different from the traditional model of lending centered on centralized platforms or authorities in that it enhances transparency and trust among the stakeholders through blockchain verification and direct communication. The model is most attractive to buyers who value independence and personalized terms of finance. This dual structure provides both flexibility and high yields, with liquidity providers earning over 10% returns, a rare feat in today’s DeFi environment. $100K Giveaway Fuels Community Growth As an enticement and reward for being an early adopter, Mutuum Finance is offering a $100,000 contest, where 10 users will be awarded $10,000 of MUTM tokens each. Along with a consistent referral program, these incentives are helping build a successful, loyal community, key to long-term project success. Security and Stability: Collateralized Stablecoin and Audits Security is at the heart of Mutuum Finance. The platform is preparing to launch a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin backed by Ethereum, not algorithmic, but reliable and transparent. In addition, Mutuum Finance team is committed to rigorous smart contract audits and ongoing financial transparency, giving investors peace of mind in a sector often marred by exploits and instability. Over $7.9 million has already been raised by more than 9,700 investors, putting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) firmly on the radar as the next big altcoin breakout. Phase 5 will raise the token price to $0.03, offering a 20% gain instantly and 140% ROI at launch. Act now before the next price surge leaves latecomers behind.

As traders watch for a potential breakthrough, altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Rexas Finance (RXS) are drawing attention for their price trajectories. While DOGE and XRP face volatile predictions tied to market sentiment, Rexas Finance emerges as a standout, merging blockchain innovation with real-world asset tokenization. Dogecoin Eyes Breakout Amid Whale Activity Dogecoin is capturing headlines after a whale transferred 478 million DOGE ($72.9 million) between anonymous wallets. Analysts interpret this as accumulation, coinciding with predictions of a breakout. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi notes DOGE is forming an ascending rectangle pattern, suggesting a surge to $0.8 if resistance breaks. Trader Tardigrade adds that DOGE’s RSI exiting oversold territory signals momentum. However, the meme coin’s reliance on hype leaves its long-term viability uncertain compared to utility-driven projects. Ripple’s XRP Hinges on Stablecoin Ambitions Ripple’s XRP faces a pivotal moment as its upcoming stablecoin, RLUSD, aims to capture a slice of the projected $2 trillion stablecoin market by 2028. Analysts speculate RLUSD securing 50% dominance could propel XRP to $50. While bullish, this hinges on regulatory shifts and adoption—a gamble compared to Rexas Finance’s tangible asset-backed model. XRP’s current chart shows a falling wedge pattern, hinting at a reversal if it breaches $2.51. Yet, macroeconomic pressures and legal uncertainties linger, casting doubt on short-term gains. Rexas Finance Redefines Asset Ownership While DOGE and XRP navigate speculation, Rexas Finance is transforming global investment through real-world asset tokenization. The platform allows users to buy fractional ownership in assets like real estate or gold—imagine a retail investor in Mumbai owning a stake in a Parisian apartment, earning passive income effortlessly. By converting physical assets into ERC-20 tokens, Rexas dismantles barriers, enabling borderless, one-click transactions. Rexas Finance’s toolkit empowers users to tokenize assets independently. The Token Builder simplifies creating compliant digital tokens, while the Launchpad lets projects raise funds securely. The Quickmint Bot accelerates asset digitization, and AI-driven tools like GenAI and AI Shield enhance security and user experience. With Rexas Estate integrating property markets, the platform bridges blockchain and traditional finance, positioning RXS as a cornerstone of the tokenized economy. Presale Momentum and Whale Confidence Rexas Finance has raised $48.2 million, nearing its $56 million goal, with 92.2% of presale tokens sold. Priced at $0.20—a 6.6x jump from its initial $0.03—RXS is attracting smart money. Etherscan data reveals a whale purchasing $150,000 worth (750,000 RXS) , signaling institutional trust. Opting for a public presale over VC funding underscores Rexas Finance’s commitment to democratizing access. The confirmed $0.25 listing price and 2025 exchange launch set the stage for a potential 50x surge, with analysts eyeing double-digit valuations post-launch. Security and Market Readiness A CertiK audit certifies Rexas Finance’s smart contracts, assuring investors of robust security—a critical edge in a market rife with vulnerabilities. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko amplify visibility, while upcoming Tier-1 exchange debuts promise liquidity. The ongoing $1 million giveaway, offering 20 winners $50,000 each, fuels community engagement, aligning with Rexas Finance’s vision of inclusive growth. Bitcoin’s ascent to $100,000 could ignite rallies for DOGE and XRP, but their reliance on external factors pales next to Rexas Finance’s grounded utility. By tokenizing $256 trillion in global real estate and commodities, Rexas Finance taps into an endless market, backed by a presale nearing completion and cutting-edge technology. For investors seeking projects with real-world impact and exponential growth, RXS offers a compelling entry—before exchange listings propel it beyond the $0.25 launch price. The window to join this revolution is closing swiftly.

44481828,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=724775,1746979235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44481828.jpeg,Yield demands spike as investors shun long-dated US Treasurys,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/yield-demands-spike-us-treasurys/,"Long-dated Treasurys are falling out of favor fast. Since April 2, the 10-year yield jumped to 4.37% as bond prices dropped, even though shorter-term yields went the other way. That divide—what Wall Street calls a steepening twist—came as markets were still reacting to President Donald Trump’s tariff moves, which triggered chaos earlier in April. This twist has already started raising borrowing costs across the economy. The Federal Reserve may plan to cut rates to boost growth, but long-term yields don’t seem to care anymore. They’ve disconnected from the usual relationship with short-term rate expectations. That’s a major red flag for policymakers trying to keep credit flowing. Longer-term yields rise as term premium climbs One of the key reasons for the spike in long-dated Treasurys is fear—mostly about inflation and policy direction. Trump’s unpredictable trade policies have clouded investor expectations. While many think inflation will cool down in the coming years, they’re not betting on it with full confidence. To protect themselves, they want a higher return for holding long-term debt. That extra return is called a term premium, and it’s been on the rise. “The bond market is reflecting uncertainty about where this economy is heading and still lingering uncertainty about what the policy landscape will ultimately be,” said Tim Ng, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Capital Group. Another concern is the federal budget deficit. Investors are worried the government will keep pumping out more bonds to cover its shortfall, which will keep dragging down prices. Republicans in both chambers have been trying to push tax-cut bills, but there’s no clear plan for spending cuts to balance it out. That makes investors even more cautious. Even if the U.S. hits a recession and the Fed slashes rates, there’s concern that long-term yields might stay stubborn. That would screw over mortgage borrowers and anyone trying to take out large loans. The average 30-year mortgage rate last week hit 6.8%, up from last month, Freddie Mac reported. Term premium isn’t easy to calculate, but most models say it’s been trending up since 2021 when inflation returned after years of absence. It rose again after Trump got re-elected in November. Investors expected his policies to fuel higher deficits and inflation. Then his tariff announcement caused a broad market selloff, including in Treasurys. The administration later eased up on some trade policies, and yields fell slightly, but term premium is still elevated. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report that it’ll be hard “to undo the reset in term premia,” adding that the “underlying macro uncertainty…likely won’t simply resolve with shifts in rhetoric.” Some argue the economy can survive higher term premiums—it did in the 80s and 90s—but others say the Fed is flying blind. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, said last week the central bank isn’t in a hurry to cut rates. He said the economy’s still holding up but warned inflation risks haven’t gone away. “They’re really trying to establish their inflation-fighting credibility and keep that credibility,” said Chris Brown, who runs securitized products at T. Rowe Price. The Treasury Department has started reacting. In 2023, officials began raising the size of long-term bond auctions to cover more borrowing. But when yields surged, they slowed those increases to calm things down. During his campaign, Scott Bessent—now Treasury Secretary—blasted the department for not issuing enough long-term debt. But since taking office, he’s changed course. He’s now saying he has no plans to tweak auction sizes in the near future.

44481495,https://bitzo.com/2025/05/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-nears-105000-amid-renewed-bullish-momentum,1746979245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/44481495.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Nears $105,000 Amid Renewed Bullish Momentum",https://bitzo.com/2025/05/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-nears-105000-amid-renewed-bullish-momentum,"Bitcoin (BTC) soared to an intraday high of $104,916 as it tested the $105,000 level before losing momentum and dropping to its current level of $103,992. The flagship cryptocurrency’s momentum stalled over the weekend after surging past $100,000 on Thursday. BTC marginally increased over the past 24 hours, trading around $104,196. Analysts expect the price to continue pushing higher despite the weekend lull. Goldman Sachs Betting On Bitcoin Goldman Sachs has put quite a few eggs in the Bitcoin basket, betting $1.4 billion on the asset through BlackRock’s IBIT ETF. The stake in BlackRock’s ETF makes the bank the largest institutional holder of the product, with 30.8 million shares. The acquisition marks a 28% increase in a single quarter, allowing Goldman Sachs to surpass Brevan Howard to establish itself as the primary institutional investor in IBIT. The bank has built an impressive crypto portfolio worth $2.04 billion, diversified across several ETFs. The portfolio includes $1.4 billion in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, $300 million in Fidelity’s ETF, and a $500 million split between the Ethereum ETFs of both managers. Goldman Sachs’ pivot towards Bitcoin and crypto should come as no surprise. The bank anticipates a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the second half of the year after revising its inflation figures upwards. “Goldman now expects core PCE to rise to 3.5% this year versus 3.0% under previous assumptions for less aggressive tariffs. They expect the Fed to cut three times in the second half of the year to address the hit to growth and employment.” Bitcoin To Go Beyond $130,000? Bitcoin (BTC) has registered an impressive jump after a sluggish start to the year. The flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $100,000 on Thursday and could move towards its all-time high if it can get past the $105,000 mark. BTC’s rally has buoyed the rest of the crypto market, with Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins registering substantial rallies. One analyst has shared an update on their Bitcoin analysis, stating that Bitcoin and the crypto market witnessed substantial bullish momentum following Donald Trump’s election victory. The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin was breaking above a significant price level as a result of the post-election rally. The flagship cryptocurrency broke above its “minor high” around the time of its former all-time high in November. The analyst stated that based on its historical pattern, BTC goes on a parabolic run whenever it surpasses the minor high during the cycle. The November 2024 breakout formed a cup-and-handle pattern, often considered a bullish pattern, signaling the continuation of its upward trend. BTC continued to rally until it reached $100,000 but faced a substantial correction to around $74,000 after reaching its all-time high in January. However, it experienced only a minor pullback to its “minor high” before resuming its uptrend. This prompted the analyst to put the cup-and-handle target for the asset at $137,000. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged over 2% on Saturday after President Trump announced a potential breakthrough in trade talks with China. BTC’s rally also extended to other altcoins, which also registered significant rallies. Trump posted on his Truth Social, stating, “A very good meeting today with China in Switzerland. Many things were discussed, and much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly but constructive manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the US, an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!.” Trump’s statement came after high-level talks in Geneva where US and Chinese officials met to de-escalate an intense trade war due to tariffs. Markets were swift to respond, interpreting it as a sign of easing tensions Bitcoin’s rally comes as global markets record a surge in liquidity. Analysts believe the surge in liquidity is powering the flagship cryptocurrency’s ascent to $100,000 and beyond. Raoul Pal, founder of Global Macro Investor, highlighted the strong correlation between Bitcoin and global M2 liquidity, stating that despite geopolitical tensions, recession risks, and other factors, rising liquidity has been the dominant force in Bitcoin’s price action. Pal stated that expanding liquidity is responsible for 90% of Bitcoin’s price action and nearly 97% of the Nasdaq’s performance. BTC registered a notable increase on Thursday (May 1), rising to $96,458. Price action remained positive on Friday as BTC registered a marginal increase and moved to $96,939. Selling pressure returned over the weekend as the price fell 0.98% on Saturday and 1.66% on Sunday to settle at $94,390. Despite the bearish weekend, BTC registered a marginal increase on Monday and settled at $94,773. Buyers retained control on Tuesday, with the price rising over 2% to reclaim $96,000 and settle at $96,845. A marginal increase on Wednesday allowed BTC to claim $97,000 and settle at $97,013. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC surged over 6%, shattering the $100,000 barrier and settling at $013,096. However, buyer exhaustion led to a marginal decline on Friday as the price dropped to $102,851. Price action turned positive on Saturday after President Trump announced a breakthrough in US-China trade talks. As a result, BTC rose almost 2% to $104,617. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The most popular crypto projects right now are capturing serious attention through real-world utility, surging user activity, and breakthrough presales. Unlike fleeting meme cycles, these tokens are backed by growing ecosystems and measurable traction. Whether it’s privacy-focused wallets, revenue-generating blockchains, or high-speed smart contract networks, these names are not riding trends, they are making them. From Cold Wallet’s explosive presale gains to Dogecoin’s bullish chart setups, here’s why these four are among the most popular crypto projects to watch this year. 1. Cold Wallet – True Privacy and $0.00743 Presale With 4,900% ROI Potential Cold Wallet has quickly become one of the most popular crypto presales in 2025, thanks to its user-first approach and impressive growth potential. Unlike wallets that leak user data or rely on centralized control, Cold Wallet makes privacy automatic and ownership simple. Using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), it keeps transactions, balances, and user identities hidden while maintaining accessibility. Users enjoy gasless transactions, internal swaps, and native bridges across major blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon. The real attraction, however, is in the numbers. Cold Wallet is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, priced at $0.00743, with a projected listing price near $0.35171. That represents a potential 4,900% ROI, making it an opportunity hard to ignore. Cold Wallet’s mission goes beyond speculation. Fully DAO-governed, with staking, loyalty rewards, and cutting-edge privacy features, it aims to be the everyday wallet for those who value speed, security, and full control. If you are searching for the most popular crypto that combines utility with strong tokenomics, Cold Wallet is clearly in the spotlight. 2. TRON (TRX) – Revenue Leader With USDT Dominance and Steady Growth TRON remains a staple among the most popular crypto projects due to consistent performance and revenue generation. In 2025, it surpassed $1 billion in revenue, cementing its role as a leader in stablecoin infrastructure. TRON is second only to Ethereum in transaction volume, hosting over $10 billion in USDT across more than 64 million wallets. TRX currently trades around $0.2478, testing key resistance levels with strong technical indicators. With RSI sitting above 60 and a bullish MACD crossover, traders see a likely push toward $0.30–$0.35, with longer-term targets as high as $0.42. TRON’s growth is not based on hype. Its ability to generate revenue and dominate the USDT layer keeps it in the conversation as one of the most popular crypto assets to consider right now. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE) – Classic Meme Token With Renewed Technical Strength Dogecoin is showing it still belongs on the list of the most popular crypto tokens in 2025. Priced at $0.1806, DOGE jumped more than 13% in 24 hours, supported by bullish patterns on both short and long-term charts. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart and a “cup and handle” on the monthly chart point toward continuation. Analysts are targeting $0.1913 to $0.2304 in the short term, with a potential run to $0.2053 by mid-year. Despite Elon Musk’s planned reduction in public support for DOGE, community strength and technical signals remain positive. Correlation with Bitcoin at 97% also suggests that any BTC rally could lift DOGE further. Memes aside, Dogecoin’s resilience keeps it ranked among the most popular crypto choices right now. 4. Kaspa (KAS) – Protocol Innovation and Miner-Focused Growth Kaspa has earned a place among the most popular crypto projects through smart protocol upgrades and miner-first incentives. Priced near $0.0969, KAS has climbed with a 13% gain in 24 hours and maintains a market cap of nearly $2.4 billion. The breakout from a descending triangle pattern has analysts eyeing short-term targets of $0.110, with projections climbing to $0.222 and even $0.409 by year-end if momentum continues. Kaspa’s GHOSTDAG protocol delivers rapid block times and quick confirmations, while the launch of Kasrate, a private mining pool offering up to 30% better profitability, is attracting more miners. Add smart contract support and the upcoming Crescendo Fork, and Kaspa’s innovative approach makes it one of the most popular crypto assets for miners and developers alike. Final Thoughts: These Popular Picks Have Serious Staying Power In 2025, identifying the most popular crypto projects means looking beyond short-term noise. Cold Wallet offers unmatched privacy and a 4,900% ROI presale opportunity, making it one of the most undervalued tokens on the market. TRON continues its steady climb with revenue and USDT dominance. Dogecoin proves its staying power with bullish technical signals, and Kaspa is innovating on multiple fronts to attract miners and developers alike. Each of these projects brings more than excitement. They offer real utility, growing ecosystems, and clear paths to sustained relevance. If you want to position early before the next major market push, keeping these names on your radar could be a smart move. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

BlackRock has significantly expanded its risk disclosures about the threats posed by quantum computers in its updated filing for its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). The new filing includes more sweeping statements about how technological advances could undermine Bitcoin’s fundamental security structure. Whereas the document previously mentioned that only “breakthroughs in mathematics, algebraic geometry, and quantum computing” could pose potential risks, these sections have now been enriched with more detailed scenarios for how Bitcoin’s cryptographic algorithms could be cracked. Related News: Prominent Founder Reignites Old Debate After Recent Surge: Says Ethereum Will Surpass Bitcoin Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas interpreted BlackRock’s new language as part of a broader risk disclosure update. “To be clear, these are just basic risk disclosures. It’s completely standard procedure that they point out potential issues with every product or asset they list,” Seyffart wrote on X (formerly Twitter). The document’s risk section, which runs from page 16 to page 65, covers a wide range of topics, from quantum threats to regulatory pressures, potential hard fork scenarios, price volatility, and mining hardware concentrated in China. It also includes the potential impact of Donald Trump’s Bitcoin reserves on the market and the high energy consumption of mining operations. On the other hand, the year 2025 will witness a global acceleration in quantum science. The United Nations aims to accelerate quantum research by declaring this year as the “International Year of Quantum Science and Technology.” But academics such as quantum expert Pierre-Luc Dallaire-Demers of the University of Calgary say a quantum computer capable of threatening Bitcoin's cryptographic security is at least five to seven years away. *This is not investment advice.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020. Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform. Ether ( ETH ), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin ( BTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and XRP ( XRP ), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction. ETH's “up band” target is around $10,000 Ether’s long-term price action continues to follow a parabolic curve that has defined its major market cycles since 2015. As of May 2025, ETH has rebounded from the curve’s lower boundary near $2,100 — a historically significant support zone that has previously triggered major rallies. ETH/USD monthly price chart. Source: TradingView If this parabolic trajectory holds, Ethereum’s next move could be toward the upper boundary of the curve, which currently intersects near the $10,000 level. Supporting this view, analyst MilkyBull Crypto highlights a similar setup on Ethereum’s monthly chart, noting that ETH’s rally to $10,000 “can’t be ruled out technically.” Source: MilkyBull Crypto Combined with RSI recovery from a multi-year support zone near 40, the setup adds further weight to the five-figure price target. ETH looks set to outperform top crypto rivals The bullish outlook for Ethereum is gaining traction as analysts anticipate an altcoin season in the coming months. Chartist Mister Crypto, for instance, argues that altcoins like ETH may rally 40% in a single day amid capital rotation from Bitcoin. Source: Mister Crypto The Altcoin Season Index , which has broken out of a downtrend just below the 29 level, signals a potential shift away from Bitcoin dominance. While still in “Bitcoin Season” territory (below 25), the breakout suggests altcoins like ETH may soon begin to outperform.

Ether symmetrical triangle hints at above $10,000 As of May, Ether is reclaiming the lower trendline of its multi-year symmetrical triangle after a brief breakdown in March, while bouncing off its 200-2W exponential moving average (200-2W EMA; the blue wave) support.

MAGACOINFINANCE continues to gain visibility across crypto forums and Discords as the company establishing new structures with accelerating momentum while its value shows potential upward movement. $5 Price Target? XRP Forecasts Get Aggressive as Legal Winds Shift Standard Chartered along with other major institutions released XRP price predictions which show it could reach between $5.00 and $5.50 during year-end 2025. Their rationale hinges on three factors: Ripple finds great optimism for its future as growing Hedge fund market demand for rule-governed Blockchain exposure pairs with increased Investor interests in Tokenized Real-world Assets and enlarging RippleNet partnership networks. DeepSeek AI platform predicts XRP will rise to $3.50 to $5.00 based on sentiment analysis and macro factors if the SEC classifies Ripple’s tokens as favorable. That outcome may not be far off: Specialists analyze the XRP case to reach a conclusion before the end of this year. The resistance at $2.30 represents the final barrier for XRP to break through and reach its previous price levels near $3.00. An official breakout from these zones would most likely trigger substantial purchasing because it mirrored data from past cycles. The “ETF zone” label describes the spot where institutional investors could shift their funds from the conventional markets to start stockpiling aggressively. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE Presale Accelerates as Over 61% of Token Allocation Is Claimed The MAGACOINFINANCE platform exists in multiple stages of their presale process. Data reveals that 61% of the total presale tokens were already sold and the marketplace is growing rapidly through the user base on X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit. User interest in MAGACOINFINANCE events keeps expanding through X and Reddit while the presale claims have now surpassed 61% of its total allocation. Users are focusing on the special bulk distribution terms enabled by the MAGA50X code. The recent token incentive at MAGACOINFINANCE for its presale remains the largest bonus structure ever seen in Discord and Telegram trading communities this year. Many traders find appeal in MAGACOINFINANCE’s distinction from XRP because the platform operates below market radars and lacks institutional backing. Influencers and On-Chain Activity Are Picking Up MAGACOINFINANCE social messaging indicators continue to expand. The latest dashboard revealed a 125% rise in wallets established during the presale period. An increase in user participation tracks with new attention from crypto influencers at different levels and analysts tracking presale wallets. Project investors appreciate the low risk level of wallet ownership concentration because such characteristics avoid whale-controlled investments. Interestingly, some early participants are also long on XRP, highlighting a trend of capital rotation: Excited XRP holders convert their profits into undervalued cryptocurrency positions ahead of their public exchange listing. Conclusion: XRP and MAGACOINFINANCE Show Divergent Paths to Growth as Market Rotation Continues Investors opt for simultaneous investments in MAGACOINFINANCE and XRP because the investment length versus short-term volatility alignment creates compelling opportunities. XRP brings stability through its brand recognition and its ability to operate under regulatory systems. At its entry-level stage MAGACOINFINANCE implements an innovative bonus system which provides potential exponential growth through expected partnership investments. Diversification strategies continue to gain appeal as large caps and micro caps exchanged more than $48 billion during the last month of trading. Smart money investors are actively positioning themselves by adding both multi-month stability and high-speed currency potentials.

A: It’s possible. Standard Chartered, DeepSeek AI, and multiple analysts now place XRP within the $3.50–$5.50 range by late 2025 if Ripple’s legal outcome is favorable. Q: What is the MAGA50X bonus about? A: It’s a 50% token allocation bonus offered to early MAGACOINFINANCE buyers during the current presale. It’s a limited-time and ends as supply sells out. Q: Are investors buying both XRP and MAGACOINFINANCE? A: Yes. Some traders are using long-term XRP positions while allocating to early-stage plays like MAGACOINFINANCE for potential short-term upside. Continue Reading: XRP Headed for $5?

The incident involved hackers gaining access to one of the addresses of the Lido oracle multisig, but only draining a small amount of 1.4 ETH, raising questions about the hackers' intentions given the protocol's $23 billion value. Lido's oracle system operates with a 9-of-5 multisig setup, and the leak was detected after a developer received a low balance alert. The situation is under investigation, and the DAO is taking immediate steps to mitigate any potential risks. This is an AI-generated article powered by DeepNewz, curated by The Defiant.

The deal consists of $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase Class A common stock, with the transaction expected to close by the end of the quarter. This acquisition represents the largest merger and acquisition deal in the cryptocurrency sector to date and is expected to enhance Coinbase's market infrastructure and global expansion. Despite this strategic move, Coinbase's stock experienced a decline following weaker-than-expected earnings. In its Q1 2025 earnings report, Coinbase reported an adjusted EBITDA of $930 million and a net income of $66 million. The company also introduced a new profitability metric, adjusted net income. Coinbase disclosed that it purchased approximately $150 million in new cryptocurrency investments, predominantly Bitcoin, bringing its investment portfolio's fair market value to about $1.3 billion, which represents 25% of its net cash. CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that over the past 12 years, Coinbase considered adopting a Bitcoin-heavy treasury strategy similar to that popularized by Michael Saylor, which would have involved allocating up to 80% of its balance sheet into Bitcoin. However, the company ultimately decided against this approach due to concerns about liquidity risks and the potential impact on core operations. Coinbase's revenue mix is evolving, with retail transaction revenues declining from 90% in 2019 to 52% last year, while institutional transaction revenues now account for nearly 9%, and subscription and services revenues make up 35% of total revenue.

While the XRP price could see short-term gains, some experts argue that Remittix offers a stronger long-term opportunity. Built for global payments and backed by real-world adoption potential, Remittix is emerging as a serious contender in the utility altcoin space, possibly outpacing Ripple in the years ahead. Ripple gains clarity as XRP futures prepare to launch XRP is getting increased attention after CME Group announced plans to launch XRP futures on May 19, 2025, subject to regulatory approval. This shift would enable institutions to access XRP exposure without owning the token, thus paving the way for wider participation. The announcement follows Ripple’s much-awaited legal settlement with the SEC , which had accused the company of unregistered securities sales. With that case behind it, XRP now appears on firmer ground. Source: CoinMarketCap Legal clarity and potential futures trading have given Ripple breathing room to rebuild market trust. Still, analysts like EGRAG remain cautious. While the XRP price has jumped to $2.37 a 7.77% weekly gain it’s hovering in a tight zone between $2.15 and $2.41. Crypto analyst EGRAG says anything within this range is “just micro noise.” A decisive three-day close above $2.41 would signal a breakout. Until then, despite strong headlines, Ripple remains in wait-and-see territory. Remittix shows stronger upside as Ripple steadies While Ripple now enjoys legal stability and institutional buzz, Remittix (RTX) draws attention for a different reason: growth. Unlike XRP, which is battling resistance at $2.41, Remittix is still early in its journey and rising fast. Priced at just $0.0757, it has already gained over 400% during presale, raising over $14.8 million. Analysts say this momentum is driven by real-world demand, not courtroom wins or futures speculation. Remittix offers something Ripple does not: complete crypto-to-fiat conversion that lands directly in global bank accounts. It allows users to send crypto like BTC, SOL or XRP and have it arrive as local currency, all without hidden fees. It also supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, positioning itself as a practical solution for everyday users and global businesses. That’s a far cry from Ripple, which still relies on institutional deals and large-scale partnerships to fuel its vision. What sets Remittix apart isn’t just speed, it’s flexibility. Businesses can open merchant accounts, manage crypto withdrawals and access over 50 crypto pairs alongside 30 fiat currencies. All it takes is an internet connection to unlock the platform’s powerful Pay API, which helps merchants reduce costs and streamline global payments. The native RTX token fuels every platform transaction, conversion and payout, making it the engine behind one of crypto’s most promising real-world use cases. Conclusion For investors looking at long-term adoption, Remittix appears better positioned. Its business model connects directly to the $250 trillion cross-border payments market. Meanwhile, Ripple remains in a narrow technical range and is waiting on confirmation from traders. That contrast is why analysts believe Remittix could be the more rewarding bet in 2025.

Strategic insights reveal the factors that might trigger explosive growth for these popular coins. Curious minds will find value in discovering the key elements fueling this potential upward trend. Stay tuned to explore the precise moments that could mark their next big leap. Shiba Inu Price Dynamics: Surge Amid Long-Term Decline Last month saw a strong price lift of nearly 40% alongside a weekly gain of about 25%, while the broader six-month picture shows a stark downtrend of over 41%. The data highlights rapid short-term recovery against a backdrop of a prolonged decline, reflecting periods of significant volatility in SHIB ’s performance. Current prices move between $0.000010 and $0.000015, with resistance levels around $0.000018 and $0.000023 and support at $0.000008 and $0.000003. Bulls appear active within this range, yet the mix of recent gains and six-month losses leaves the overall trend unclear. Traders might consider buying near support and testing sell points at the resistance levels for risk-managed entries and exits. DOGE Surge Amid Long-Term Correction: A Dual Perspective Strong monthly gains near 55% contrast with a 32% drop over the past six months. Price action shows a quick rally from lower levels, indicating a sharp short-term increase against a longer-term downtrend. Market activity suggests that participants are optimistic, but the half-year decline points to the presence of bearish sentiment and profit-taking. These fluctuations have defined a volatile environment that may present favorable entry points for traders looking to capitalize on short-term movements. Current trading shows Dogecoin oscillating between $0.1371 and $0.2003, with key resistance at $0.2281 and support at $0.1019. Bulls have propelled a one-week surge of nearly 35%, with indicators like the RSI at 74 signaling robust buying pressure, though caution is warranted due to overbought conditions. Traders may explore long setups near resistance, while monitoring support levels and testing for breakout possibilities. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have shown strong signs of potential growth. Recent market trends and increased adoption suggest they could see significant price increases. Their unique communities and strong social media presence also contribute to their growth potential. Both coins are worth watching closely for anyone interested in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! From Meme to Mainstream: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin, launched in 2013, began as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. Inspired by a popular Shiba Inu meme, it quickly captured the internet’s attention. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. While it started as a joke created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin grew into a serious player in the crypto world. In 2021, its value skyrocketed, propelled by social media buzz and endorsements from influencers like Elon Musk. This surge pushed Dogecoin into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, highlighting the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Dogecoin’s technology is based on a simple and efficient blockchain system, making it accessible for everyday transactions. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to garner interest due to its active community and widespread recognition. While some view it as a symbol of the crypto market’s unpredictability, others see potential in its growing adoption and the support it receives from notable figures. Comparing it to other coins, Dogecoin’s unique journey from a meme to a mainstream asset illustrates the evolving landscape of digital currencies and the potential for unconventional projects to make a significant impact. XRP: The Digital Currency Aiming to Revolutionize Global Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency that stands out for its speed and efficiency. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it’s designed as a digitally native, programmable currency that is fast, low-cost, and borderless. Unlike traditional systems, XRP operates on a decentralized network without a central authority. This means transactions are irreversible and secure, and you don’t need a bank account to use it. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. They gifted 80 billion of these to Ripple, a company focused on improving global financial transactions. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to boost liquidity and support the ecosystem. To manage the supply, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow, releasing it in a controlled manner. XRP’s name comes from “ripple credits,” reflecting its goal to make payment transfers seamless across different currencies. In the current market, XRP’s technology offers advantages over some other cryptocurrencies, especially in speed and transaction costs. While market trends are always changing, XRP’s focus on real-world applications in global payments keeps it in the spotlight. Its potential to simplify cross-border transactions sets it apart and could influence its position in the evolving digital currency landscape. Conclusion While DOGE and XRP have performed well, XYZVerse aims to surpass them as the pioneering sports memecoin, blending meme culture and sports for potential significant growth.

Don’t miss MUTM before it goes to phase 5,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/11/missed-shib-and-doge-dont-miss-mutm-before-it-goes-to-phase-5/,"Timing in crypto isn’t just a bonus — it’s everything. Ask anyone who bought SHIB or DOGE before they exploded. The biggest runs don’t usually begin with headlines. They start with quiet accumulation, early-stage communities, and tokens priced low enough to multiply fast. Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering that kind of entry — but not for long. MUTM is currently valued at $0.025 as it approaches the final stages of Phase 4 in its presale. With Phase 5 on the horizon, the token price is set to rise to $0.03. For those watching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in before the market wakes up, this might be one of the last chances to catch it early. SHIB and DOGE were easy to foubt — until they weren’t Initially, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin didn’t receive much serious attention. Both were dismissed by critics as memes with no fundamentals. And yet, they delivered massive gains to early holders — not because of what they promised, but because of when people bought. The lesson isn’t to chase hype — it’s to recognize momentum and act before the noise. That’s why more investors are shifting their focus to Mutuum Finance, which is already showing the type of growth signs that preceded both SHIB and DOGE, minus the memes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum isn’t trying to ride off community trends. It’s building utility from the start. The protocol offers a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, allowing users to deposit crypto and earn passive returns, or borrow assets by locking up collateral. All activity is managed through non-custodial smart contracts — which means users keep control of their funds. But more than that, the platform is launching with real mechanics that tie directly to the MUTM token. This isn’t a placeholder token waiting for future use cases. It’s a working part of the system from day one, aligning with what many consider a long-term cryptocurrency investment opportunity. Mutuum’s presale is structured across 11 phases, and as of now, over 67% of Phase 4 is already completed. More than $7.8 million has been raised, and the number of holders has crossed 9,600. It’s not a project waiting for traction — it’s gaining real momentum. The price increase in Phase 5 may not seem huge on paper — a shift from $0.025 to $0.03 — but for early-stage investors, those incremental jumps stack fast. By launch, the token is set to debut at $0.06, meaning buyers today can expect a 140% increase before it even hits exchanges. A major draw of Mutuum’s model is how it creates organic buy pressure. A portion of the protocol’s revenue is consistently used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market, and those tokens are then redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens. This gives participants access to real yield tied directly to platform activity. Mutuum is also launching a stablecoin that will be fully backed by collateral held on-chain. Interest paid on loans taken in this stablecoin is directed back into the protocol’s treasury, ensuring liquidity and reinforcing long-term stability. For those looking into sustainable cryptocurrency investments, this kind of model clearly sets itself apart. It’s not just about utility — it’s about trust. Mutuum’s smart contracts are currently undergoing a detailed audit by CertiK, a trusted leader in blockchain security. With smart contracts reviewed for vulnerabilities before the platform goes live, early participants can feel confident the infrastructure is being handled responsibly. SHIB and DOGE offered huge gains to early buyers, but most people missed the window. By the time those tokens were everywhere, the upside had already been claimed. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is still under the radar — but not for long. The token is affordable, the project is real, and the roadmap is already in motion. Before Phase 5 begins and the price climbs, MUTM may be the smartest move for those looking ahead, not back. If you’re scanning for the next big crypto that’s backed by function, not hype, this one checks every box — and it’s still early enough to matter.

Frank, a former finance exec, was confirmed as commissioner this week under Donald Trump’s new term in the White House. The agency’s already gone through a mountain of reforms in the first 100 days of Trump’s return — many driven by the Department of Government Efficiency. Now, with Frank in charge, those changes are going even faster. According to CNBC, adjustments are already affecting pensions, overpayment rules, phone wait times, and direct deposit setups. From the way checks are calculated to how the agency handles mistakes, Trump’s government is pressing harder on enforcement and automation. Trump’s law gives retirees more cash A new law that kicked in this January is giving almost 3 million people a raise in their Social Security checks. The Social Security Fairness Act targets workers who used to get hit by the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset — two rules that cut down benefits for folks with jobs that didn’t pay into Social Security. That includes teachers, cops, firefighters, federal employees under the Civil Service Retirement System, and workers under foreign pension plans. Under the new law, they’ll now get full Social Security benefits. Monthly increases started going out in February and could be small for some, but others will see over $1,000 more every month. And it’s not just future checks getting bumped. The agency is also sending retroactive payments all the way back to January 2024. In just over three months, Social Security has already paid $14.8 billion in back pay to more than 2.2 million people. The catch? Not everyone’s getting their check right away. Some cases need manual processing, and the agency says it could take over a year to get those paid. Overpayment rules snap back to 50% The way Social Security handles overpayments has also changed again. If the government pays someone too much by mistake — which can go unnoticed for months or even years — it eventually sends a letter demanding the money back. Under Joe Biden, the default repayment rate was lowered to 10% of a person’s monthly benefit, or $10, whichever was higher. That was meant to ease the burden. Under Trump, the agency announced in March that it planned to bring the rate back up to 100%, meaning someone could lose their entire check until the debt was cleared. The move was supposed to recover about $7 billion over the next ten years. But after complaints, the agency adjusted the plan. Starting April 25, the default withholding rate for new overpayment letters is now 50% for retirement, survivor, and disability benefits. For SSI, the rate stays at 10%. That’s still too much for some. Richard Fiesta, head of the Alliance for Retired Americans, told CNBC, “Losing 50% [of benefits] for a lot of people could put them into immediate economic hardship.” And that’s not the only reason a check can shrink. On May 5, the federal government restarted collection efforts for defaulted student loans. That means the Education Department can now use the Treasury Department Offset Program to grab Social Security benefits, tax refunds, and even paychecks to cover unpaid loans. Some people could see those deductions as early as June. The agency can also withhold checks for unpaid child support, alimony, restitution, and tax debt, depending on who you owe. Both parties in Congress are complaining. Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee told Frank these problems aren’t new. But Democrats worry that if nothing gets fixed, more chaos is coming. The agency says it’s working on a new telecom system that should make phone calls easier. The full upgrade is expected to be finished by the end of this summer. Early results show slightly better answer rates, but the problems aren’t gone.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer painted a positive picture, saying, “These two days have been very constructive. Our differences are not as great as we previously thought.” The talks in Geneva were held between Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and senior U.S. officials Bessent and Greer in an effort to ease tariff wars that have hit global supply chains and raised concerns of an economic recession. However, the Chinese side has made it clear that it will not make concessions during the negotiation process. Chinese state media CGTN confirmed that the talks were continuing on Sunday, while the Xinhua news agency published a commentary saying, “Concessions do not bring respect.” The agency said a solution could be found with the support of a fair and determined international community. Related News: BlackRock Issues “Quantum Computing” Warning About Bitcoin (BTC) - Here's What It Means There was no official statement from either side after eight hours of closed-door talks on Saturday. As of Sunday evening, no concrete agreement had been announced. Ahead of the talks, China had argued that the US should show good faith in lifting the tariffs. However, US President Donald Trump has rejected those claims, although he has hinted that the tariffs on China could be lowered if the talks go well. Trump also raised import tariffs on China to 145%, and Beijing responded by imposing 125% tariffs on U.S. products. According to China’s April export data, total exports rose 8.1%, while exports to the United States fell 21%, the sharpest decline in 21 months.

However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. ‘ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again’ – Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years. Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear & Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

Its rollup models, sidechains, and ZK-based scaling techniques have enabled cheaper transactions and greater speed — without modifying Ethereum itself. But the reliance on bridge mechanics, separate settlement layers, and often complex developer tooling introduces trade-offs. Now, a different model is getting attention. Bitcoin Solaris, built with dual-layer architecture and an integrated hybrid consensus model, is delivering Ethereum-level programmability and Solana-level performance — without relying on external rollups. With native 10,000 TPS, 2-second finality, and a high-efficiency mining system that works on smartphones, Polygon developers are beginning to take notice — and some are calling it “the technical breakthrough of 2025.” What Makes Bitcoin Solaris Different While Polygon scales Ethereum from the outside, Bitcoin Solaris scales from within. Its system consists of two layers: A Base Layer, which uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to manage core blockchain operations and security A Solaris Layer, based on Solana technology, that handles smart contracts and real-time dApps using Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) Both layers are coordinated by the Helios Consensus Mechanism, which combines all four consensus methods for fast, energy-efficient validation and ordering. The result: finality in 2 seconds, horizontal scalability, and no rollups, bridges, or layer jumps required. Bridging between Ethereum and its Layer-2 solutions like Polygon still creates points of friction. Users often face delays, higher gas fees when moving assets, and challenges verifying transactions across networks. Developers building on Polygon must also account for syncing issues, cross-layer logic, and the eventual settlement to Ethereum’s mainnet. Bitcoin Solaris eliminates this complexity. Since smart contracts and base-layer data exist within the same ecosystem — just on different operational layers — developers don’t have to manage bridging logic. Assets are native, execution is instantaneous, and the blockchain itself handles consensus, ordering, and finality in one unified model. Developer Accessibility One of Polygon’s strengths is EVM compatibility. But for many builders, the EVM’s limitations around speed and transaction sequencing persist — even on L2. Bitcoin Solaris delivers its own Solana-compatible smart contract framework, allowing developers to deploy dApps using high-performance, modern tooling. With 10,000 TPS as a baseline and smart contracts processed through PoH-based sequencing, developers can launch apps that scale without bottlenecks or needing external accelerators. For Polygon devs and others looking for a full breakdown of Bitcoin Solaris’s architecture, check out this in-depth review from Crypto Volt . Token Economics: Fixed and Transparent Bitcoin Solaris mirrors Bitcoin’s hard cap — 21 million BTC-S tokens. But instead of relying on fixed PoW distribution or dynamic burns, it has allocated 4.2 million tokens (20%) to a public presale. The presale is currently in Phase 2, with tokens priced at 2 USDT. When this phase ends, the price increases to 3 USDTin Phase 3. There are no lockups, tiers, or hidden mechanics. Just clean distribution in line with the project’s technical rollout. Moreover, Bitcoin Solaris has passed independent audits from top-tier firms and includes full identity verification: Cyberscope Audit Freshcoins Audit KYC Verification All smart contract logic and consensus mechanisms are public and verifiable. Polygon pushed Ethereum’s capabilities forward — but Bitcoin Solaris may be redefining how scaling is handled entirely. By embedding throughput, consensus, and mining directly into its core design, it removes the need for external layers, cross-chain tooling, and validator exclusivity. For developers seeking true scalability, fast execution, and user inclusion in one chain, Bitcoin Solaris presents a compelling next step.

But every so often, a project comes along that quietly builds momentum while checking off everything serious investors want to see. That’s exactly what’s happening with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a token still in its presale but already catching the attention of those who’ve been through more than one market cycle. The question being asked more frequently now is simple: could this be the next crypto to hit $1? For many early investors and analysts, the answer is yes — and it’s based on solid fundamentals rather than market hype. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a blockchain-based protocol that allows users to lend their digital assets or borrow against them through secure, non-custodial smart contracts. It allows users to deposit their digital assets into smart contracts and earn interest while enabling others to borrow against their crypto by providing sufficient collateral. The platform is designed to operate without intermediaries and keeps users fully in control of their funds at all times. What sets Mutuum apart isn’t only its features — it’s the way those features are implemented. From non-custodial smart contracts to passive income through mtTokens, every element is built for function, not just hype. The protocol is also preparing to launch on scalable infrastructure, ensuring lower fees and smoother interactions — something that legacy DeFi platforms still struggle with. Mutuum’s presale is already gaining strong traction. With a growing community of more than 9,600 holders, Mutuum Finance continues to gain traction, having already raised over $7.8 million. The project is currently well into Phase 4 of its presale, with 66% of this stage already finalized. There are 11 phases in total, and once the current one concludes, the price will jump from $0.025 to $0.03. That upcoming shift has created a clear window for early participation. The current entry point is still low, but the upside is closing in quickly. With each new phase, the cost increases, and so does the demand. For those tracking what might be the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now, many are pointing to MUTM — especially before this next price bump. This early-stage pricing paired with growing interest is driving a sense of urgency. It’s not just about getting in; it’s about doing so before the token doubles — and potentially moves far beyond. Mutuum’s tokenomics were crafted to support long-term sustainability. The platform uses a portion of the revenue it generates to buy MUTM tokens directly from the open market. Those tokens are then distributed to users who stake their mtTokens — creating an ecosystem that rewards actual engagement. The token’s supply is structured to support ecosystem development, incentivize users, and maintain steady growth without over-saturation. It’s a model built with both functionality and balance in mind, which is part of why experienced investors are starting to take interest. Security is also front and center. The protocol is currently undergoing a CertiK audit, a step that gives users added peace of mind. With every smart contract reviewed and verified before launch, Mutuum is making it clear that transparency and safety are foundational to its rollout. To support user engagement, the platform has also launched an onboarding dashboard, where participants can track progress, referrals, and even compete for exclusive rewards. A Top 50 leaderboard highlights the most active users — with those leading the board set to receive special bonuses and unique benefits once the project goes live. What’s perhaps most telling is the kind of investors showing up. Early backers of ETH, ADA, and SOL — many of whom made significant returns during previous cycles — are starting to allocate toward MUTM. Their reasoning is clear: real product, working mechanics, clean tokenomics, and a presale that hasn’t yet priced in its full potential. Add to that a community-focused $100,000 giveaway, and it’s easy to see why momentum is building. This isn’t merely a play for short-term profits — it’s a project built on delivering real value from the foundation up. At the moment, MUTM can still be purchased for $0.025, but that entry price is nearing its close as the current presale phase moves toward completion. With its presale nearing the halfway mark, a growing holder base, and increasing buzz among serious investors, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be much more than a hidden gem — it’s a project that might soon become a core part of the DeFi conversation. By launching a beta version of the platform at the same time as the token goes live, Mutuum ensures users can access its core features from day one. For those looking for the next crypto to explode, or simply a well-structured DeFi opportunity at the right price, MUTM is making a strong case — and the $1 target no longer seems out of reach.

It’s Not BTC, ETH, or XRP — It’s Priced at Just $0.025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News For anyone keeping an eye on the cryptocurrency market, the usual suspects — Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP — have long dominated headlines. But right now, a much lesser-known token is gaining serious traction among early buyers, and it’s still trading at just $0.025. That token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , and it’s starting to make waves not because of hype, but because of what it actually offers. While legacy coins remain essential for many portfolios, those searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now are beginning to turn their attention to utility-first, yield-driven protocols. And Mutuum Finance fits that bill better than most. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on inflated narratives, Mutuum is building out a real system with practical mechanics designed to bring value to lenders, borrowers, and token holders alike. At its core, Mutuum operates as a decentralized protocol that allows users to deposit digital assets, earn interest, and borrow against their holdings — all through fully non-custodial smart contracts. But what sets it apart isn’t just the lending feature. It’s the infrastructure behind it. Mutuum is preparing to roll out on a Layer 2 blockchain, which gives it a major edge in speed and cost efficiency. By leveraging scalability solutions like Arbitrum, it drastically reduces gas fees and enhances transaction throughput — two areas that traditional Ethereum-based platforms still struggle with. This alone positions it ahead of many existing DeFi alternatives. As liquidity flows into Layer 2 ecosystems, projects like Mutuum that are already built for this environment will benefit the most. It’s part of what’s making analysts consider it the next big crypto to explode — not because it’s riding a trend, but because it’s designed for where the space is going. What makes MUTM even more appealing is how the ecosystem rewards participation. Every deposit into the protocol generates mtTokens — digital receipts that represent your deposited asset plus interest accrued. These tokens grow in value over time and can even be used across DeFi, providing both flexibility and passive income potential. In addition, Mutuum’s revenue model is built to reward long-term holders. A share of the platform’s revenue is allocated to buying MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to users who hold and stake mtTokens. That means users who engage with the protocol aren’t just earning interest — they’re also gaining additional exposure to token buybacks. With this kind of self-sustaining incentive structure, the project isn’t just another liquidity farm — it’s shaping up to be one of the smartest cryptocurrency investments currently available at this price level. Timing is everything in crypto. Right now, Mutuum Finance is deep into its presale, and the numbers speak for themselves: more than $7.77 million raised, over 9,550 holders, and 65% of Phase 4 already completed. The token remains available at $0.025 for now, though that price point is set to rise soon. Once this round wraps up, the price moves to $0.03 — and from there, it’s a steady climb to the official launch price of $0.06. That marks a 140% gain from today’s level, without even factoring in post-launch demand. There’s still room to get in early, but that window is closing quickly. For those searching for the next cryptocurrency to explode, Mutuum offers a compelling entry backed by strong fundamentals, real yield mechanics, and a clear roadmap. Mutuum isn’t chasing short-term hype. Its upcoming platform launch includes a beta version with full functionality for lending, borrowing, and stablecoin integration. All transactions will be executed through audited smart contracts, adding a layer of trust as the ecosystem expands. And with a native stablecoin in development — one backed by on-chain collateral and integrated into the lending protocol — the use cases go beyond speculation. This forward-thinking design, paired with Layer 2 compatibility and a transparent economic model, explains why some investors now view MUTM as one of the best crypto assets to hold through 2025 and beyond. If you’ve been waiting for a chance to get into a project early — before the noise, before the big listings, and before the wider market takes notice — this might be it. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain solid long-term bets, Mutuum Finance is offering something different: a blend of passive yield, scalability, and real on-chain utility, all priced at $0.025. In a market full of recycled ideas, Mutuum’s approach feels fresh and grounded. And for those looking to diversify into emerging cryptocurrencies with growth potential, it’s one of the most promising options available right now.

The $0.046 level provided support this week and the price resurged with a successful breakthrough the resistance line; although the break is not clear enough to signal a bullish move. Even if the price further increases, it must overcome the mentioned resistance to confirm the bullish signal.

The higher resistance level to watch for a test is the $0.245 level. Currently, the $0.046 level is providing support for the market.

Table of Contents Pepeto raises the bar: Real utility, security, and vision for growth Which memecoin will be the next 100x? Pepe’s time in the spotlight: Is Pepeto next for a 100x surge? Pepeto’s growth potential: What could $10,000 become? How to buy Pepe and Pepeto Pepe (PEPE) posted a solid 63% gain over the past week, outperforming much of the crypto market. This strong performance came after bullish remarks from Donald Trump sparked renewed market optimism. While Pepe continues to ride its momentum, many investors are starting to pivot toward Pepeto (PEPETO), impressed by its stronger fundamentals and swirling rumors about its origin story. With transformative features and rising investor interest, Pepeto is quickly becoming a leading candidate for the next 100x memecoin. Pepeto raises the bar: Real utility, security, and vision for growth Pepeto is setting a new standard in the memecoin space by fusing viral hype with meaningful functionality. Unlike many meme tokens that thrive on speculation alone, Pepeto brings real utility through its zero-fee exchange platform, cross-chain support, and top-tier security designed to protect its users. Its mission is to restore confidence in crypto by championing transparency and building a long-lasting, sustainable ecosystem. Backed by a passionate community and an engaging backstory, Pepeto is more than just a meme, it’s a serious project aimed at transforming decentralized finance. Which memecoin will be the next 100x? The big question on every investor’s mind is which memecoin will be the next to deliver 100x returns? While Pepe’s latest surge has captured attention, more seasoned investors are setting their sights on Pepeto as the more promising option. This is because Pepeto offers true utility with its zero-fee trading platform and superior security, features that set it apart from Pepe. With a current price of $0.000000127 and the same 420 trillion token supply as Pepe, Pepeto offers substantial upside potential.

A central participant is Rootstock, one of the oldest Bitcoin layer-2 projects , crypto analytics firm Messari said in its ""State of Rootstock"" report, published on Thursday. Rootstock is now secured by 81% of Bitcoin's total hashrate, meaning miners that account for amount the hashrate are also approving transactions on the layer 2. The figure was just 56% before the the onboarding of Foundry and Spiderpool, the world's largest and sixth-largest mining pools, respectively, in February. Messari also observed that transaction fees on Rootstock are 95% cheaper than the average Bitcoin transaction and 55% cheaper than those on Ethereum. Rootstock is one of numerous projects looking to bring greater utility to Bitcoin through expanding the provision for DeFi with smart contracts, enabled by ""BitVMX"" , a modified version of the BitVM programming language . Other prominent Bitcoin layer-2 projects include Stacks and BOB (""Build on Bitcoin""). The project has also connected with bridging protocol LayerZero to enable Rootstock-native applications to connect with dozens of other blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana. Its momentum sets the stage for growing adoption of BTCFi through the remainder of 2025, according to Messari. “As BTCFi continues to grow, Rootstock is well-positioned for broader adoption through core upgrades like a 60% reduction in transaction fees, alongside sustained investment in builder education and incentive programs,"" Messari analyst Andrew Yang said.

These include privacy-first coins, established DeFi platforms, and scalable blockchain infrastructure. Each offers practical value supported by adoption, upgrades, and real activity. BlockDAG is gaining attention for measurable results and steady community growth. It is widely viewed as the best new crypto to buy due to strong presale performance and high user engagement. AAVE holds its place in DeFi, Monero remains committed to privacy, and Celestia introduces modular solutions for efficient blockchain use. All four projects show direction, use cases, and active development. As the market matures, interest is shifting toward platforms that deliver ongoing results and structured growth over short-term speculation. 1. BlockDAG Gains $235M Fast BlockDAG continues to lead in 2025, having raised more than $235 million during its ongoing presale. It is now in Batch 28, priced at $0.0019, with this limited offer available until May 13. Over 19.9 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, reflecting strong buyer interest and consistent momentum. With this performance, the project is being recognized as a best new crypto to buy for those tracking early-stage growth and utility. A standout feature is its Buyer Battles system. Each day, 100 million BDAG coins are allocated for the highest contributors, creating competitive energy and active engagement. The presale’s return of 2,520% from Batch 1 to Batch 28 underscores this demand. Hardware sales are also rising. BlockDAG (BDAG) has surpassed $7 million in miner sales and distributed over 17,298 units. Participation across forums and Telegram remains active, with regular updates and leaderboard shifts drawing constant attention. This balance of aggressive pricing, structured rollout, and live community activity places BlockDAG well ahead of many current market entries. With a detailed roadmap and a growing base, it continues to capture attention across the crypto landscape. As other projects compete for relevance, BlockDAG maintains strong positioning through consistent delivery and transparent presale mechanics. 2. Monero Backs Privacy Use Monero (XMR) continues to stay relevant in a market full of changing trends and increasing regulations. Known for complete transaction privacy, it remains the preferred option for users who value anonymity. It also earns attention as one of the best new crypto to buy for privacy-focused holders. Unlike others that reveal addresses and values, Monero keeps all transaction details hidden. Despite external pressure, it has preserved its community and development pace. Monero’s tech stays updated, and its use case remains strong. As digital tracking concerns grow, its privacy model gains even more importance in today’s crypto ecosystem. 3. AAVE Holds DeFi Reign AAVE continues to stand firm within decentralized finance, offering borrowing and lending tools without needing central control. With billions held in its protocol, AAVE proves that stable utility is still a key driver. It is also seen as one of the best new cryptos to buy among DeFi supporters. Its V3 upgrade brought better performance and wider network access, making asset management easier. While other platforms fade, AAVE improves its risk features and grows steadily. Its adoption by institutions and cross-chain flexibility positions it well for future growth. AAVE remains a lasting name in the evolving DeFi landscape. 4. Celestia Builds Modular Chains Celestia (TIA) is gaining developer interest with its modular blockchain design. It separates consensus from execution, which allows for lighter and more flexible blockchain setups. As developers seek better efficiency, Celestia becomes one of the best new cryptos to buy for infrastructure innovation. Unlike chains that aim to do everything, it focuses on being a data availability layer. This setup supports other chains and increases performance. It avoids the meme coin trend and focuses on real backend solutions. As demand rises for modular chains, Celestia’s position strengthens as a go-to option for building advanced blockchain applications. Conclusion BlockDAG continues to outperform other projects with strong figures and daily community engagement. It has raised over $235 million and now runs Buyer Battles daily, where top contributors win rewards. This unique model positions it as the best new crypto to buy for those tracking active utility and ROI. Currently in Batch 28, the price rollback to $0.0019 is valid until May 13. Over 19.9 billion BDAG coins have been sold, showing wide support. The 2,520% ROI gain from earlier stages adds to the momentum. BlockDAG’s system reflects the standards of future-ready crypto platforms in 2025.

They differ from regular stablecoins because they are designed to prioritize privacy, decentralization, and resistance to censorship. Stablecoins backed by fiat or assets like US treasuries were the answer to issues in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, primarily linked to volatility, usability, and bridging traditional finance with crypto. The concept of “dark stablecoins” is now being discussed in relation to the future of cryptocurrencies, particularly as politics continues to clash and integrate with the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Some “dark stablecoins” are already in the top 10 in terms of stablecoin supply. Source: Coinmarketcap Crypto degens may prefer dark stablecoins to mainstream alternatives Traditional stablecoins like USDT or USDC are often tied to fiat reserves and subject to regulatory oversight. On the other hand, a dark stablecoin could enable any interested party to operate without centralized control or intermediaries. They would essentially be uncensorable, decentralized, and will not need middlemen. Above all, they will not be fiat-backed. One method Ju proposed was pegging to existing stablecoins via decentralized oracles like Chainlink. As Ki Young Ju stated , the concept of dark stablecoins is mostly hypothetical. However, while netizens are looking forward to new ones being created, there may already be existing stablecoins that could be classified as dark stablecoins based on their characteristics. One example is DAI, an Ethereum-based, crypto-collateralized stablecoin soft-pegged to the USD and governed by MakerDAO. It fits the bill because it does not use existing stablecoins to maintain its peg, but rather, over-collateralized crypto assets like ETH, WBTC and smart contracts. As things stand, no single entity has the ability to freeze DAI because it is managed by smart contracts and also, crypto collateral like ETH is harder to seize than fiat reserves. Another good candidate for the “dark stablecoin” title is USDe, a synthetic, yield-bearing stablecoin on Ethereum, backed by a delta-neutral strategy (ETH long positions hedged with shorts). It also aims for decentralization and censorship resistance through crypto-based stability. However, a centralized exchange reliance and complexity make it less fit for the role. The concept of dark stablecoins is gaining attention Some governments have been tightening control over cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins because they act as bridges between crypto and fiat systems. Europe, for example, has implemented stricter regulations on stablecoin access through its MiCA regulation, and the U.S. is steadily increasing oversight of USD-pegged stablecoins through legislation such as the GENIUS Act. Stablecoins like USDC are now regarded as potential “choke points” for regulators who monitor or restrict crypto transactions, as they often comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. In essence, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and regulated stablecoins are avenues for governments to enforce taxation and surveillance. This defeats the whole purpose of decentralization in crypto, and users with foresight are already looking ahead for alternatives. The cypherpunk ethos behind Bitcoin also prioritizes censorship resistance and financial sovereignty. As stablecoins become more regulated, users may opt for privacy-focused alternatives to preserve the original ethos. Dark stablecoins could become an escape route for users who want to avoid what Ki Young Ju called “built-in tax collectors” or centralized control linked to traditional stablecoins. Suggestions for dark stablecoin issuers Young Ju also suggested two possible ways a dark stablecoin may be created. One is through advances in blockchain technology, such as decentralized oracles like Chainlink and privacy-focused protocols. Another way is through stablecoins issued by countries that don’t censor financial transactions. In the event that one does materialize, it would most likely be met with more legal challenges than acceptance. A good example was the Diem stablecoin, a product that arrived too early, which crumbled under the weight of challenges from lawmakers worried about its effect on the traditional banks. It is also possible that the decentralization and privacy features could attract scrutiny for potential use in illicit activities, similar to concerns raised about privacy-oriented coins like Monero.

While some projects are recycling old narratives, others are pushing forward with clear goals, solid token models, and a focus on community engagement. Investors are becoming more selective, looking beyond hype to find real-world use cases, transparent teams, and products that solve actual problems. These four projects are standing out by doing just that, setting themselves apart with long-term value. Here’s a closer look at the crypto top gainers for 2025 that are attracting attention for all the right reasons. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): $235M Presale & Transparent Leadership Drive Growth BlockDAG is quickly becoming a standout name among the crypto top gainers for 2025. With $235 million raised in its presale, over 20 billion coins sold, and a current batch 28 price of $0.0019 valid until May 13, BDAG has already delivered a 2,520% ROI since its first batch. This kind of return signals a project with growing traction and buyer trust. What really sets BlockDAG apart is its communication approach. The team, including founders Anthony and Nick, regularly hosts podcast episodes that explain the protocol’s vision, technical roadmap, and strategic decisions. This kind of transparency is rare and adds a sense of accountability that many buyers find reassuring. As the May 13 price window nears, interest in BlockDAG continues to grow. Its strong tokenomics, active presale, and open leadership make it an appealing option for both early movers and long-term holders. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Evolving Infrastructure Keeps Ethereum in the Spotlight Ethereum remains essential in the crypto world, even as new projects come online. Its role as the foundational platform for smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 networks keeps it at the core of Web3 activity. In 2025, Ethereum is making visible progress through upgrades like proto-danksharding and wider Layer 2 integration. These improvements are enhancing Ethereum’s scalability and lowering costs, both critical factors for developers and users. Beyond the tech, Ethereum continues to support rollups, DePIN protocols, and modular blockchain frameworks that drive innovation across the space. Staking rewards and increasing validator decentralization offer additional incentives to ETH holders. Even if it doesn’t show the sharpest price spikes, Ethereum’s deep utility keeps it firmly positioned as one of the crypto top gainers for 2025 . 3. Chainlink (LINK): Real-World Data Access Positions LINK for Growth Chainlink remains one of the most reliable infrastructure layers in crypto, especially as demand for off-chain data and automation increases in 2025. By enabling smart contracts to securely access real-world data, Chainlink supports a wide range of blockchain use cases across DeFi, gaming, and enterprise services. Chainlink’s development of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and expanding ties with financial institutions reinforce its long-term relevance. As traditional finance continues testing blockchain solutions, Chainlink offers the data infrastructure needed for settlement, compliance, and reporting. With consistent adoption among developers and a growing ecosystem of data users, LINK continues to earn its place among the crypto top gainers for 2025 . 4. Cardano (ADA): Steady Development & Smart Contract Maturity Fuel Optimism Cardano continues to gain recognition as a project that prioritizes careful development and long-term value. Known for its academic approach, Cardano has gradually built out a smart contract platform now seeing growing adoption. Its extended UTXO model allows parallel transaction processing, which gives it an edge for complex decentralized apps. In 2025, the rise in Total Value Locked (TVL) on Cardano and the spread of native assets reflect increasing use. DeFi protocols, governance experiments, and international blockchain initiatives are adding layers to its ecosystem. As Cardano moves closer to its Voltaire phase, which introduces full governance and sustainability, ADA is gaining momentum as a dependable choice among the crypto top gainers for 2025 , especially for investors looking for consistent execution. Four Gainers to Watch in 2025’s Crypto Market As the market matures in 2025, investors are looking more closely at projects that offer clarity, real use, and strong fundamentals. BlockDAG’s presale results, with $235 million raised and a 2,520% ROI, place it firmly in the spotlight. Its unique approach to transparency through podcasts with founders like Anthony and Nick builds trust that lasts beyond presale excitement. At the same time, Chainlink, Ethereum, and Cardano are proving their staying power through innovation and active ecosystems. Together, these four represent some of the strongest opportunities in the market. For anyone tracking the crypto top gainers for 2025 , these are the names that continue to deliver, and the year is just getting started. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

Analysts tracking the presale’s momentum say the project’s $0.007 target is now well within reach, potentially turning a modest $1,000 investment into $100,000 for early-stage participants. But the real message for investors is clear: this isn’t the end — it’s just the beginning. What’s Next for MAGACOINFINANCE With over $8 million raised , MAGACOINFINANCE has already surpassed expectations, but what’s truly fueling the buzz is what comes next . The token is currently in Stage 7 of its presale, with Stage 8 and 9 still ahead — meaning investors are not late to the game. The presale price remains under $0.001 , and with a projected public listing at $0.007 , base ROI potential sits at 25x–36x . Add in the MAGA50X promo code for a 50% token bonus , and the upside expands even further. What the Future Holds MAGACOINFINANCE has structured its launch, unlike most meme-themed tokens that depend on hype. At this point, there is no exposure to centralized exchanges, no VC-related sell pressure and no artificial pump cycles. The project builds on scarcity, referral growth, and timed unlocks, creating a framework that grows with the community, not the other way around. Because coins launched from frameworks in their early stages have historically provided gains of as much as 18,500%+, analysts are feeling particularly bullish. If this trend continues, MAGACOINFINANCE has a high 50x or 100x returns potential.# Why It’s Still Worth Joining Now Investors tend to make the same mistake during the cycles: assuming they missed the boat. Though the truth is that Stage 7, 8 and 9 still represent rare windows for early entry into MAGACOINFINANCE. This stage is when the momentum compounds and visibility accelerates, with smart money positioned ahead of the media and exchange listing. The message is simple: This isn’t the end — it’s just the beginning. For those watching from the sidelines, the window to secure high-conviction entry is still wide open — but it won’t stay that way for long.

Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there’s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What’s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we’re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets’ belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That’s because it’s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet , you’ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the ‘digital gold’ reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins , BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we’ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026 . BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here’s a full explainer on how to buy it . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it’d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode . Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that’s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they’ll also benefit from $MIND’s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin . Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390 , having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It’s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there’s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now . DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it’s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time.

According to members of the Lido DAO, an address belonging to the Chorus One oracle was compromised, and the Ether ( ETH ) balance associated with that oracle was drained in an incident still being investigated. Lido Finance emphasized that the issue is restricted to the Chorus One oracle and is not system-wide. The team also said the problem was not due to a coding problem in any particular blockchain oracle or software. Source: Lido Finance Chorus One added that the exploit was likely attributable to a hot wallet private key leak but is also setting up a new machine to ensure security moving forward. The incident highlights the need for robust cybersecurity measures in decentralized finance (DeFi) as the world's monetary, trade, and business systems move onchain in ever more complex digital systems that have large attack surfaces. Related: Mobius Token smart contracts on BNB Chain exploited, $2.1M drained Cybersecurity remains a critical issue for crypto and DeFi Hacks, cybersecurity exploits, and other malicious attack vectors remain a major problem for crypto. As digital finance expands to encompass more services, attack methods become more sophisticated . Cybersecurity firm Hacken released a report outlining the damage done by hacks, scams, and cybersecurity exploits in Q1 2025 and found that over $2 billion in crypto was lost due to malicious activity. The vast majority of the stolen funds were attributed to the $1.4 billion Bybit hack in February 2025, which skewed the findings of the report.

Source: Hacken According to the cybersecurity firm, crypto hacks were responsible for $357 million in losses in April 2025, a significant increase from losses incurred in March. Hacken CEO Dyma Budorin told Cointelegraph at Token2049 that the crypto industry needs to adopt more robust cybersecurity and code auditing measures to stem the tide of hacks and exploits plaguing the asset sector. Cybersecurity threats in crypto have become so pronounced, particularly from hacking groups associated with the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea (DPRK), that G7 countries could discuss the impact of the hackers and how to neutralize these threats at the next G7 Summit.

This Multichain Project Is Outshining NEAR and RENDER,https://nulltx.com/2025s-breakout-ai-altcoin-this-multichain-project-is-outshining-near-and-render/,"Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing about a new up-and-comer that might steal the spotlight in 2025. There’s growing curiosity about a multichain project that’s gaining momentum and potentially outpacing other notable names. As the market experiences a bullish trend, seasoned investors are keeping an eye out for hidden gems. Prominent projects like NEAR and RENDER are already well-known contenders. Yet, there’s talk of an emerging player, Codename:Pepe crypto, capturing the imagination of many. Touted as the true AI breakthrough, Codename:Pepe is leveraging artificial intelligence for significant profit-making. Speculations abound around its community-driven potential, setting the stage for what might be the next big leap in the crypto world. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins , two of the most prominent trends today . Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform . According to its developers, the project’s AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum. Provide Actionable Trading Insights: Generates AI-backed forecasts, risk assessments, and early buy/sell signals to maximize trading efficiency. Optimize Auto-Trading Strategies: Uses real-time data to adjust automated trading strategies, ensuring adaptability in fast-moving market conditions. The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices . The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token was offered at $0.003333333. It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market : AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! NEAR Protocol’s Rapid Rise: Is NEAR the Future of Blockchain? In 2023, NEAR Protocol’s user base grew tenfold, thanks to the launch of NEAT inscriptions, similar to NFTs. These digital assets attracted many new users. A year ago, NEAR teamed up with Alibaba Cloud, the tech giant’s computing arm. This partnership promised NEAR’s technology to nearly a billion Alibaba customers. Though it faced setbacks, NEAR bounced back by late 2024. The rise continued with KAIKAINOW, letting people access content without unlocking phones. This innovation boosted NEAR’s popularity. NEAR aims to be faster and user-friendly. It uses sharding to speed up transactions. Instead of complex addresses, users can have simple names. NEAR climbed from under $4 to over $5 in late 2024. Forecasts suggest it could reach $8.21 by 2025 and $20 by 2030. With strong technology and growing adoption, NEAR looks promising. Render’s Rise: Decentralizing GPU Power for the AI Revolution Render (RENDER) is transforming how GPU services are accessed and utilized. Launched in 2017, Render has built a decentralized network where individuals contribute unused GPU power in exchange for RENDER tokens. Those needing GPU services tap into this network, paying with RENDER tokens, creating a distributed GPU marketplace powered by the community. The surge in AI development, especially after innovations like ChatGPT, has skyrocketed the demand for GPU resources. GPUs are crucial for AI but are often expensive and energy-intensive to obtain. Render’s peer-to-peer network offers a cost-effective solution, allowing projects without substantial resources to access necessary computing power. This democratizes technology, leveling the playing field for many. Historically, RENDER has shown impressive growth. In the previous bull run, it surged from under $0.50 to over $7.47, marking a remarkable 1,394% increase in six months. By March 2024, RENDER reached an all-time high of $13.60. These movements highlight its strong market position and the growing interest in its services. Looking ahead, some predictions are optimistic. Changelly suggests RENDER could reach around $38.43 by 2028. While these forecasts are speculative, they reflect the potential seen in Render’s innovative approach and its role in booming sectors like AI and decentralized infrastructure. With its unique model and strong foothold in both DePIN and AI sectors, Render presents an intriguing opportunity in the current market cycle. Its mission to decentralize GPU power aligns well with the rising demand for accessible computing resources, positioning RENDER as a promising player in the evolving tech landscape. Conclusion Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a standout in the crypto market, offering more immediate potential than NEAR and RENDER. Its dedication to authentic artificial intelligence provides practical tools for investors, helping them make informed decisions in the meme coin sector. This sets it apart from others that may not offer the same level of innovation in the short term. By utilizing AI to uncover profitable opportunities and automate trading, Codename:Pepe crypto seeks to deliver significant returns. Its community-focused model, including a secret DAO and incentives for dedicated members, adds to its appeal. As the market experiences a bullish trend, engaging with projects that employ true intelligence like Codename:Pepe crypto could lead to maximum profits for investors.

In a significant development, gas stations operated by Emirates General Petroleum Corporation (Emarat) now allow customers to pay for gas using digital currency. Launch Aims To Redefine Modern Fuel Retail In an update shared on its official X handle, Emarat clarified that the move is part of its visionary Project Landmark. It states that it is meant to set the pace and redefine how a gas service station should function. Emarat is collaborating with Crypto.com, a cryptocurrency exchange that offers various financial services, including direct crypto payments. The strategic collaboration, which will commence with 10 different locations, is the first in the Middle East and North Africa. The plan is to expand across Emarat’s network. In March 2024, Emarat introduced Project Landmark to redefine modern service stations by integrating technology and sustainable innovations. The idea seems to make gas stations futuristic or keep up with contemporary trends, of which crypto payment is key. Crypto.com to Strengthen UAE Digital Payment Ecosystem As of this writing, the first phase of this partnership will see crypto payments activated in 10 Emarat stations. A flagship “Emarat x Crypto.com” station on Al Wasl Road, Dubai, will also be launched. The service will roll out gradually across different locations nationwide. It is worth noting that Emarat owns about 156 gas stations in Dubai and the Northern Emirates. Hence, activating crypto payment services across all its gas stations will signal a massive win for digital adoption in the UAE. It aligns with the UAE’s growing adoption of cryptocurrency . In March this year, for instance, Ripple, a leading blockchain payment provider, secured regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). The license grants Ripple the green light to provide payment solutions for financial institutions and businesses across the UAE. UAE Accelerates Crypto Adoption The UAE has positioned itself as a leader in crypto adoption and is opening its space as an attractive destination for players in the sector. Binance, a crypto exchange, recently secured $2 billion in investment from MGX , an Abu Dhabi-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and tech investor. The collaboration aims to build a more inclusive and robust digital finance ecosystem.

(Opinion),https://cryptopotato.com/could-the-next-big-ethereum-killer-be-bitcoin-opinion/,"Ethereum isn’t the only hot cryptocurrency in May, with some big app-wide changes and a new roadmap . Bitcoin, the class originator and market cap leader, approved a subtle but big change in May to the way it approves transactions. The network will no longer limit transactions with files larger than 80 bytes. Bitcoin Opens Up For Business Previously, Bitcoin limited these types of transactions with an output type called OP_RETURN. The network automatically canceled transactions with files above a tiny size limit. It would turn these into outputs that were unspendable on the network. But, blockchain developers have found workarounds. For example, there is the BRC-20 standard exploiting Bitcoin ordinals to link files to the blockchain. Acknowledging the reality of the community, industry, and market’s demand, the Bitcoin Core developer community is scrapping it. They will no longer let OP_RETURN stand in the way of further development along these lines. That’s another chink in the armor of hardcore BTC maximalists that view Bitcoin NFTs as junk mail on the blockchain and all altcoins and second-layer currencies as distractions from the original cryptocurrency’s true import. While Bitcoin can be “wrapped” or deposited in smart contracts on other crypto apps like Ethereum and Cardano, and then used in their ecosystems, a smart contract issuance system built right on the old Satoshi layer is another way to do it. Would BTC Prices Go Much Deeper on a Bitcoin App Layer? If they press to build a marketable product, the Bitcoin L2 developer community may find along the way that it has certain key advantages over deploying BTC on another L1 network. CashApp Block founder and CEO Jack Dorsey (who also founded Twitter) predicts Bitcoin will reach $1 million in price by 2030. He was also an early Lightning Network advocate and remains a vocal Lightning proponent.

The rapid rise in their values prompts questions about their future. Could this be the beginning of a lasting breakthrough for Layer 2 technologies, or just a fleeting spike? Readers will discover which coins show promise for growth and what this trend means for the market. Arbitrum Price Trends: Swift Rallies Amid Key Levels Over the past month, Arbitrum surged 65.09%, driven by a one-week jump of 47.73%. However, the coin experienced a significant 29.65% dip over the last six months. Price behavior has been marked by volatility, with rapid increases followed by corrections. These fluctuations indicate a market that remains dynamic, prompting traders to remain vigilant as potential price reversals may arise in the near future. Current levels show support near $0.19 and resistance at $0.43, with an additional peak at $0.55 and a lower floor around $0.07. Bulls have fueled the recent advances, but the high RSI of 76.82 raises caution for traders. Monitoring these key levels, traders may look to buy near support while remaining alert for potential reversals at resistance. Optimism Shows Short-Term Growth Amid Long-Term Decline Last month, OP price surged nearly 40%, accompanied by weekly gains exceeding 32%. In contrast, the six-month performance slipped by about 51%. This indicates a coin experiencing a volatile period where recent upward momentum stands in stark contrast to a longer-term decline. The journey showcases rapid rebounds overshadowed by significant losses over the medium term. Current prices trade between $0.57 and $0.87, with immediate resistance at $1.02 and a higher barrier at $1.32. Support levels appear at $0.41 and drop further to $0.10. Indicators are revealing a moderately bullish moment with the RSI near 66, although oscillators suggest a softer buy. The market remains mixed, prompting traders to concentrate on short-term moves within these outlined levels. ZKsync Surge and Swing: Recent Rally Amid Long-Term Correction Over the last month, ZK enjoyed a notable surge with a weekly rise of about 54.94% and a monthly increase of nearly 50.77%. Over the six-month period, however, prices retreated by roughly 49.45%, showing a sharp short-term boost against a longer-term pullback. Price action reflected strong short bursts of momentum followed by an overall downward adjustment. Current prices range from about $0.0418 to $0.0712. Traders eye resistance at roughly $0.0848 and a secondary barrier near $0.1142, while support holds at around $0.0260. Bulls appear active in the short term despite a high RSI near 71, suggesting caution. Trading ideas center on buying near support and aiming for resistance targets within this clear price channel. Conclusion ARB , OP , and ZK have shown significant recent gains. This surge indicates growing interest in Layer 2 solutions. These coins may be poised for sustained growth if adoption continues to rise. Long-term prospects depend on user trust and wider acceptance. While current momentum is strong, only time will tell if this upward trend is sustainable. Investors will need to monitor developments closely to gauge the market's direction.

There is panic amongst investors, who are currently buying tokens ahead of the reported 20% price increase to $0.03 at the beginning of phase 5. The project has attracted $7,900,000 since the outset of the sale, with more than 454 million tokens sold and 9,700 wallets participating. Such an upsurge strengthens Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attractiveness being a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform with the true utility. In contrast, its forward-thinking lending model and tokenomics design are the platforms for predictions about a price ascension by as much as 19 300% to $5 in 2025. The clock’s ticking while the phase 4 comes to an end; traders on the lookout for profitable opportunities are excited. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is disrupting DeFi by introducing a dual-lending framework that combines the Peer-to-contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Consumers lock USDT in liquidity pools (such as mtETH, mtDAI), earning interest, which surges in value immediately as more assets get locked or liquidity pools grow. Loan seekers obtain funds by putting up collateral which is higher than the funds borrowed in order to increase stability. The P2P function allows users to work out conditions directly which is perfect for niche like meme coins. This flexibility attracts diverse investors. Recently Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was able to introduce a dashboard to highlight the top 50 token holders where they reward them with bonus tokens for being able to keep their ranking to encourage loyalty. Presale Momentum and ROI Potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running hard into its 11-part presale, as phase four’s $0.025 price provides a fleeting window of opportunity for early adopters. The opening phase sold out quickly at $0.01 and the current buyers are likely to have a 20% profit as the price of phase 5 is at $0.03. Tokenomics ensure a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price. Analysts expect a post-launch explosion to $5, equating to a 19,900% ROI from the current value. The same $1,000 investment can soar to $199,000. The team is focused on security, going for a Certik audit of its smart contracts with the outcomes to be announced on social media after completion, thereby strengthening the confidence of the investors. Sustained Growth Mechanisms Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses a buy-and-distribute approach, as platform revenue is fed back into repurchasing MUTM tokens. These are passed on to mtToken stakers, ensuring there is constant buy pressure and minimal sell offs. With $100,000 giveaway, giving $10,000 in tokens to 10 winners, engagement will be heightened, and participation in the presale will be seen. Over collateralized lending on the platform is risk-reducing, attractive to investors who are risk-averse. As phase 4 nearly sells out, the thirst to join grows, and phase 5 hangs over like the price increase. This systematic path sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for long-term gains in the DeFi world separate and apart from volatile altcoins. Riding the DeFi Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes advantage of the crypto market’s desire for utility-focused projects. Its pre-sale success commanding close to 10,000 has indicated a very demanding market. The innovative lending and tokenomics of the project underpin the 19,300% priced breakout guidance to the $5 mark by 2025, as it races pass rivals betting on hype. The investors with significant returns in mind are moving now; the current 65% sell-out in phase 4 is a narrowing window. Buy in at $0.025 before phase 5 price hike and lock-in additional expenses.

In a televised interview on Sunday , Ishiba emphasized the mutual benefits of a zero-tariff agreement, highlighting the positive progress in discussions and his constructive relationship with US President Donald Trump. Ishiba highlighted a recent US- UK trade deal that cut most tariffs on British car exports but left a 10% basic tariff in place and said Japan should seek to eliminate tariffs. He made that argument by noting that high import duties, particularly the 25% tariff on Japanese auto exports to the US now in place, boost costs for American consumers and hurt the US economy. Japan also faces a 24% retaliatory tariff on goods shipped to the US. The Japanese auto industry, an important part of the Japanese economy, has been hit hard by these tariffs. In recent discussions about tariffs, Japan’s chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, cited the example of one auto company that is suffering $1 million in losses for each hour due to the 25% U.S. tariff on an automobile export, underscoring the need for swift progress in negotiations on tariffs However, while Ishiba seems more inclined to a zero tariff plan, President Donald Trump has suggested maintaining the floor 10% tariff. Trump insists on maintaining a base 10% tariff on Japan’s products On the talk show, PM Shigeru Ishiba also described their talks with the US government as “gradually coming together” and even termed his relationship with President Trump as “surprisingly good.” Additionally, he maintained that Tokyo should target tariffs of 0% in their trade deal with Washington, arguing that high tariffs would hurt both Japanese manufacturers and American consumers. For instance, he cited that the country’s automobile exports to the US would lessen and drive car prices up if Trump’s Administration imposed high import duties, which would be detrimental to both parties. He further argued that his country is still investing and creating jobs in the US; hence, if their automobile industry was weakened, they could no longer contribute to US investments. According to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, the country exported 1.37 million vehicles, roughly worth $41 billion to the United States last year, Ishiba also spoke on the US-UK deal, acknowledging it as “one possible model” but a suboptimal one. The US agreed on Thursday to reduce tariffs to 10% on 100,000 units of British luxury exports annually. While Ishiba acknowledged it as a favorable deal for the U.K., he believes Japan can and should pursue better terms, preferably a 0% tariff deal. Nonetheless, Trump maintained that a 10% tariff on imports would remain in effect even after finalizing the trade negotiations. He argued that exemptions could be considered if trade partners offer substantial concessions. Japan will be subject to a 25% tariff on its automobile exports to the US if it cannot agree with the US before July 8. The US will also impose a 24% tax on other Japanese products. Ishiba calls for caution in the reduction of the nation’s consumption tax Ishiba strongly believes that a zero-tariff deal would also boost the American economy. He commented, “For the benefit of the American economy, too, shouldn’t the tariffs be reduced?” He also warned against reducing the Japanese consumption tax quickly. He encouraged caution and prudency, claiming that lowering the consumption tax too rashly may harm the country’s economy. Moreover, he’s called for alternative measures to assist people in need instead of indiscriminate tax reduction.

With the launch price set at $0.06 and projections suggesting a potential climb to $0.22 or higher, the token is gaining attention for its utility-first approach and strong early adoption. If it lives up to expectations, that would represent an 800% increase from the current price — and unlike many tokens in this range, MUTM has a fully developed use case behind it. While plenty of coins advertise themselves as the best cryptocurrency to invest in, Mutuum Finance is quietly building the foundation to justify that title. This isn’t a token built on vague promises or future hype. It’s backed by on-chain lending mechanics, yield-generating assets, and real smart contract infrastructure — all of which are already drawing over 9,600 holders ahead of its official release. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum is launching a permissionless lending platform where users can lend or borrow digital assets using blockchain-based smart contracts. There’s no need for centralized control, and no manual matching of loans. Instead, lenders deposit their crypto into shared liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens serve as a digital representation of the deposit — issued at a 1:1 ratio to the original asset — and their value grows over time as interest accumulates. This lets users track their earnings transparently, and it gives them the flexibility to hold, trade, or use these tokens elsewhere while still collecting returns. Because the yield is tied to real-time pool usage, the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) shifts dynamically: when borrowing demand rises, so does the return for depositors. Borrowers, on the other hand, lock up assets as collateral and take out overcollateralized loans. The protocol uses a Loan-to-Value (LTV) model to determine how much a user can borrow relative to their collateral’s value. Each asset in the system is assigned a specific LTV percentage, and for multi-asset positions, a weighted LTV is applied. As long as the user maintains that ratio, the loan remains active. Repayment is flexible — there’s no set deadline, and users can repay in part or in full whenever they choose. Mutuum’s presale is nearing its final stages, but there’s still time to enter before the next price bump. Over $7.8 million has already been raised, with more than 450 million tokens sold and nearly 70% of Phase 4 now completed. The current price is $0.025, but the next phase will raise that to $0.03 — and at launch, buyers will see a 140% increase to $0.06. What’s more, with launch momentum and platform expansion, the token would reach $0.22, giving early buyers nearly an 800% return. For example, a simple $3,000 entry now could grow to $24,000 when the token hits that target. Even more conservative growth would still offer one of the strongest ratios in the current market. This is what’s putting MUTM on the radar for those searching for the best crypto to buy now — a blend of real utility, organic demand, and early pricing that hasn’t yet caught up to future potential. Mutuum isn’t depending on price action alone to gain interest. It’s also building out an overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to be minted directly from borrower collateral. That means no reliance on separate liquidity pools or centralized backers — just a fully decentralized mint-and-burn system that adjusts the stablecoin’s supply based on actual on-chain activity. All interest paid on these loans stays within the protocol, contributing to Mutuum’s internal treasury and long-term sustainability. This structure creates a cycle where token holders and users alike benefit from growing network activity. Additionally, Mutuum is expanding to Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum to cut transaction costs and speed up interactions, making it even easier for everyday users to engage with the platform and benefit from its tools. For anyone considering an entry, it’s also worth noting that Mutuum is running a $100,000 giveaway, which adds a little more fuel for those jumping in before the presale ends. With its utility already defined, infrastructure nearly complete, and presale momentum gaining pace, MUTM continues to stand out among emerging assets. For those looking for a serious crypto investment under $0.15, the numbers — and the mechanics — make a compelling case.

The White House announced on its official website that an agreement had been reached with China. “I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress in the very important trade talks between the United States and China,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said after the meetings hosted by Switzerland. “I thank the Swiss government for providing this wonderful environment. This productive atmosphere allowed the talks to be constructive.” It was reported that the vice prime minister and two deputy ministers from China, as well as US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Bessent attended the talks.

Market sentiment is rising fast, fueled by bullish technical signals and renewed altcoin strength. Two standouts gaining attention are Remittix and Uniswap, ETH tokens quietly drawing serious investor interest. With projections hinting at 300% gains, Remittix and Uniswap could be top performers in Ethereum’s next major rally. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH gains momentum following major network upgrade Ethereum’s rally to $2,400 has shaken up the market, setting off a wave of renewed optimism. This surge, triggered by the Pectra upgrade , marked the sharpest daily rise over four years, with ETH gaining 20% in a single session. The Pectra upgrade, which merges the Prague and Electra updates, introduces 11 powerful improvements to Ethereum’s ecosystem. These changes aim to speed up the network, improve user and staking experiences, and enhance validator operations. Source: CoinMarketCap Investors and developers have reacted strongly, seeing this as Ethereum’s most significant step forward since the 2022 Merge. This upgrade positions the network for better scalability and future institutional adoption. According to trader Daan Crypto Trades , the pace of this price breakout caught many off guard. While long-term growth past $2,000 was widely expected, the speed at which it happened shows strong, hidden demand. With Ethereum holding above key support zones, the $3,000 mark looks more likely than ever. Uniswap rides Ethereum’s breakout with strong upside potential Uniswap as Ethereum aims to cross the $3000 mark continues to shine. With the size of the largest decentralized exchange on Ethereum, Uniswap enables users to swap ERC-20 tokens and thus is an essential player in the ETH ecosystem. Its liquidity pools and a 0.3% reward for providers continue to make it interesting to casual traders and institutional players. With Ethereum gaining momentum from the Pectra upgrade, Uniswap stands ready to benefit from the broader DeFi revival. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators support this view. The MACD on UNI's chart shows growing bullish strength and a clean breakout from its descending trendline could push it 100% higher, retesting its December highs. Coinbase’s integration of verified Uniswap pools through Base is also key. It simplifies access, boosts trust and widens adoption. With Ethereum rising, UNI tends to follow. As the spotlight returns to DeFi, Uniswap is back on the radar, setting up for a potentially explosive run. Remittix builds momentum as Ethereum strengthens its position Remittix is quietly positioning itself as the ETH token to watch. Despite being the world leaders in payments, large platforms like Coinbase, Stripe and Wise miss one important aspect: crypto-to-fiat conversions with blockchain speed and transparency. This is where Remittix comes in, providing users with a hassle-free method to convert over 40 Cryptocurrencies to fiat and transfer them straight to global banks. Unlike its competitors, Remittix delivers instant settlements, no hidden FX charges and supports over 30 fiat currencies. What makes it even more appealing is how it hides the complexity of crypto from recipients. Transfers land as regular bank deposits, allowing senders full financial freedom without friction. With cross-border payments projected to cross $250 trillion by 2027, Remittix is tapping into one of the world’s most profitable sectors. Built on Ethereum, Remittix takes full advantage of the network’s latest improvements. It also introduces Remittix Pay, an API that lets businesses accept crypto and settle in fiat, giving merchants a powerful payment alternative. Conclusion Remittix’s ongoing Gleam campaign, offering $250,000 in rewards, has boosted engagement and awareness. With token sales structured in rising blocks and a proven smart contract audit, Remittix could realistically post 300% gains as demand spikes. The momentum is growing, and this ETH-powered solution might become a go-to bridge between crypto and fiat.

This week’s movement in the Senate, while seemingly a setback, confirms that lawmakers are serious about crafting guardrails. With crypto bills gaining recognition and political focus, we’re past the era of stalling and speculation. Regulation is no longer an abstract idea—it’s being built piece by piece, in full view. The Stablecoin Bill Stumble Is Just a Pause, Not a Collapse The Senate’s attempt to push forward the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act ran into a procedural wall this week—but few inside Capitol Hill see this as a dead end. While the cloture vote failed 48–49 , it triggered immediate renegotiations. Several lawmakers are optimistic that another vote may come as soon as Monday. 🚨 Senate stablecoin bill fails key procedural vote (48-49), falling short of the 60 needed to advance. The GENIUS Act faced unexpected Democratic resistance despite earlier bipartisan support. GOP leadership may bring the bill back for another vote. #RealWorldAssets … — RWA Alert (@AboutRWAs) May 11, 2025 The failure wasn’t partisan. While Democrats uniformly voted against it, Republicans Rand Paul and Josh Hawley also dissented. Some cited national security concerns; others raised alarms over the absence of public bill text during the vote. Another point of friction was President Trump’s financial ties to stablecoins—an issue fueling Democratic demands for a separate “End Crypto Corruption Act,” which could still surface as an amendment or a standalone vote. For now, the focus has shifted to foreign issuer treatment and anti-money laundering safeguards. Lawmakers want these ironed out before the final voting stages begin, knowing that once the debate clock starts, backtracking becomes politically difficult. And while this delay could potentially slow the broader market structure bill—which aims to define SEC and CFTC oversight—sources suggest that if the stablecoin legislation is addressed within days, progress on crypto’s wider legal framework won’t be derailed. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Early Bets that May 10x or More SUBBD (SUBBD) As regulators work to define what qualifies as a security or utility within crypto, projects like SUBBD could benefit from that clarity—not fear it. This isn’t a platform that relies on speculative tokens or hype cycles. Instead, it’s structured around a tangible use case: giving content creators ownership and control over how their work is distributed, monetized, and experienced. The $SUBBD token functions as more than just a transactional layer. It acts as a key that unlocks access to tiered content, community features, and creator-specific incentives. Fans don’t merely “follow”—they participate in a system where interactions are tokenized, access is controlled transparently, and rewards are direct. That structure could thrive in a regulated space, especially as lawmakers push for accountability and traceability in digital asset flows. SUBBD’s model mirrors the direction lawmakers seem to favor: utility-backed tokens that operate within clearly defined ecosystems. By enabling permissioned content, removing intermediary platforms, and giving creators financial tools without relying on ad algorithms, SUBBD’s value proposition sits firmly within the bounds of where crypto regulation seems to be heading. ClayBro —a popular crypto YouTuber—claims that SUBBD could be one of the few 100x cryptos in the coming weeks. In a future where stablecoins and market structures are clearly codified, platforms like SUBBD—those that enable creative economies rather than just financial speculation—are positioned to benefit. If the rules are being written to separate function from fluff, SUBBD may emerge as one of the few tokens that passes both the legal and practical stress tests. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Projects that tie speculative excitement to actual user interaction and data utility are likely to be treated more favorably under new market structure laws. MIND of Pepe falls squarely in that category. Instead of being just another memecoin, it operates as an AI-powered intelligence tool that analyzes real-time sentiment across social platforms and feeds that insight back into its ecosystem. The token isn’t simply a mascot—it’s a mechanism for accessing high-value social data in the form of trading signals, engagement metrics, and sentiment tracking. As Congress moves toward defining what qualifies as a financial product versus a digital utility, MIND of Pepe’s approach—layering meme culture with actionable AI tooling—may serve as a model hybrid. It delivers a user-facing function with measurable value while also riding cultural narratives. And in a world where data-driven sentiment is already shaping markets, MIND makes that information on-chain and token-gated. The AI agent component is particularly timely, given that David Sacks—who’s central to the Senate's crypto focus—is also vocal about AI’s impact on policy and tech. MIND of Pepe aligns well with this dual evolution: using blockchain to secure data integrity and AI to decode its meaning. In short, MIND of Pepe isn’t betting on chaos—it’s trying to quantify it. That alone could make it one of the more resilient meme-driven assets in a regulated crypto environment. Best Wallet Token (BEST) As lawmakers grapple with how wallets, custody, and asset management should function under federal oversight, Best Wallet sits in a strong position. Unlike speculative tokens that serve little more than governance fluff, the BEST token is tied directly to functionality: it powers a decentralized, non-custodial wallet that supports over 60 chains, staking, DEX trading, and even presale participation via its “Upcoming Tokens” feature. Where this becomes relevant in the context of the GENIUS Act and future market structure bills is custody and accessibility. Best Wallet doesn’t hold your assets; it gives users total control. That aligns with a key concern raised in recent Senate discussions—how to define and separate platform responsibility from user ownership. In Best Wallet’s case, there’s no ambiguity. It's a tool, not a gatekeeper. 🔥 Over $12M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and swap across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/RDGvIhPLRo — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) May 6, 2025 With over $12 million raised, the token itself is layered into usage-based rewards, early access features, and staking incentives. It doesn’t promise passive riches—it creates a framework where user engagement fuels token circulation and platform growth. That’s exactly the sort of token model that could benefit from clearer guardrails, as long as it avoids being classified as a security. More than just a utility token, BEST is part of a fully operational suite with real users and active development. If the U.S. regulatory tide is moving toward defining frameworks for wallets, protocols like Best Wallet won’t just comply—they might help shape the standard. Solaxy (SOLX) As the U.S. inches toward defining how different types of blockchain infrastructure are regulated, Solaxy finds itself aligned with the kind of utility lawmakers are learning to appreciate. This isn’t a memecoin or speculative placeholder—it’s a Layer 2 solution designed to facilitate seamless transactions across Ethereum and Solana while offering native staking and gas-fee optimization through its token, SOLX. Solaxy’s main functionality is built around performance. It supports smart contract deployment, staking validations, and cost-effective transfers across two of the most dominant ecosystems in crypto. That cross-chain design places it in an interesting regulatory position—especially as the SEC and CFTC begin to map which assets fall under their purview. Where Solaxy really tightens its value proposition is in how SOLX is integrated. It’s used for gas on the Layer 2 chain, for validator staking, and for earning APY through protocol engagement. It's also built with modularity in mind, allowing developers to integrate existing Ethereum-based dApps onto a more cost-efficient and Solana-compatible network. That sort of technical alignment with larger chains—especially Solana, which has recently been mentioned in several Senate tech subcommittee hearings—gives Solaxy relevance beyond its own boundaries. In a market where upcoming regulation may start favoring infrastructure with tangible network function, Solaxy doesn’t need a narrative twist. It already does what most projects only promise: lower costs, cross-chain utility, and secure staking—all tied into one high-throughput chain. Conclusion The direction U.S. lawmakers are taking suggests a stronger preference for projects rooted in clear utility, transparent function, and regulatory compatibility. In that light, some of the tokens gaining early momentum today may turn out to be aligned with exactly what this next chapter of crypto demands. As policy shifts from uncertainty to structure, it’s worth paying close attention to projects- like the ones above which are already building in the right direction.

With bullish momentum building fast, analysts now believe PEPE could mirror the explosive rise of Remittix , a project that recently delivered over 400% gains. As retail interest returns and the crypto market heats up, all eyes are on Remittix to see if these 400% gains are only the beginning. Pepe price prediction: PEPE builds bullish structure with breakout in sight Pepe has regained attention after a strong rebound, bouncing from $0.0000075 to nearly $0.0000097 before settling just above the $0.0000085 support zone . This consolidation is being watched closely, as analysts say holding above this level keeps the path open for another test of resistance near $0.0000096. A breakout past this zone could push PEPE toward the psychologically significant $0.00001 mark, a level that would confirm renewed upward strength. Source: CoinMarketCap The daily chart signals strong technical support for this bullish Pepe price prediction. The meme coin has formed a double-bottom around $0.00000574, a classic trend reversal pattern. With PEPE now trading above its 25-day moving average and sitting at the neckline of this setup, traders are eyeing the 23.6% Fibonacci zone at $0.00001072. That marks a potential 20% climb from current levels and further price discovery could extend gains toward $0.000014, nearly a 60% jump. Despite the bullish outlook, traders should note the importance of the $0.0000085 support level. A break below it may expose PEPE to a short-term dip toward $0.0000080, though overall sentiment remains in favor of bulls. With price structure turning positive and meme coin demand rising again, PEPE appears primed for its next breakout. Remittix sets the benchmark as PEPE aims for bigger gains While meme coins like PEPE dominate headlines with explosive moves, Remittix (RTX) quietly builds momentum off a real use case. RTX is priced at just $0.0757 and solves a $250 trillion problem: global money transfers. Its core value is allowing users to send crypto like BTC, XRP, or SOL, instantly converted and deposited as fiat into any global bank account. No middlemen, no hidden FX fees, just speed and simplicity. With its flat-fee transfers, no hidden FX costs and ongoing $250,000 Gleam competition, Remittix is a fully functional asset in a multi-trillion-dollar industry. That clarity has helped fuel its explosive growth. This isn't a theory. RTX has surged over 400% during its presale, raising over $14.9 million. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, Remittix makes crypto usable for businesses, freelancers and families sending money abroad. Analysts believe that if RTX captures even a small share of the global remittance space, the token could deliver 100x returns. Conclusion PEPE may steal the spotlight with its fast 60% jump, but the long-term play may belong to Remittix (RTX) . As Ethereum continues its upward climb, both tokens are gaining traction; one through hype, the other through utility. If PEPE breaks the $0.00001 barrier, short-term traders could score big. But with RTX already up 400% and targeting a slice of the trillion-dollar cross-border market, its growth ceiling is much higher.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) coin rose to $0.000016 on Sunday, its highest level since February this year, and 52% above the lowest level this year. The token jumped as Ethereum ( ETH ) hugged the important resistance level at $2,500 for the first time since February. This surge triggered more upside for popular ERC tokens like Pepe ( PEPE ), AAVE ( AAVE ), and Uniswap ( UNI ). Shiba Inu price also jumped after the burn rate surged by 234,584% on Sunday, with over 19 million tokens being incinerated. One user sent over 17.8 million tokens to a burn address, while another one burned 1 million tokens.

Data shows that Shiba Inu has burned over 410 trillion tokens since its creation, with most of these coming from Vitalik Buterin. Shiba Inu price has also done well because of the growing Shibarium network. Its layer-2 network handled over 3.76 million transactions in the last 24 hours, bringing the cumulative total to 1.152 billion. Its total addresses have jumped to over 207 million. More data shows that the total value locked in the Shibarium network has jumped to $3.84 million, its highest level since January 21. This is a big increase since the network had a TVL of $2.15 million earlier this year. Most of this growth has come from ShibaSwap and WoofSwap. Shiba Inu price analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the Shiba Inu price has formed a popular harmonic chart pattern. The XA section happened between its highest point in 2024 and its lowest point in August. It then formed the AB section through December, and the BC section through April this year. It has now embarked on the CD section that may push it back to its 2024 high of $0.0000455, which is about 190% above the current level. Notably, the AC section of this pattern is at $0.000033, which is its double bottom. Therefore, if it surges above the neckline at $0.000033, the path to its 2024 high will be confirmed.

This upward momentum, now clocking over 15% gains from its test of the $2 support, has brought with it an interesting historical pattern on XRP’s daily chart. A comparison of XRP’s current price structure with its 2017 trajectory shows that a rare setup may be indicating a massive breakout is on the horizon, with a price target as high as $9. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play XRP Price Flashes 1D Death Cross Signal, But Price History Suggests A Twist On the surface, a death cross has appeared on the XRP daily candlestick timeframe chart. This sort of cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, and would typically be interpreted as a bearish sign. However, according to a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform, this might not be the case for XRP. A closer look at historical precedent from 2017 suggests that this technical signal may not be as bad for XRP as it sounds. Back then, XRP exhibited nearly identical behavior of trading within a descending triangle just before the death cross occurred. That moment marked a deceptive shift, as XRP’s price action quickly flipped direction and exploded to the upside. Within weeks of the 2017 death cross, XRP went on to hit the 1.5 Fibonacci extension zone, delivering returns in excess of 1,350% from its pre-breakout level of $0.23 up until its current all-time high of $3.4. XRP has again spent months consolidating within a tight descending triangle in the 2025 setup leading up to the current death cross which is the first in over a year. Despite the bearish implications of the death cross, the parallels in chart structure with the 2017 pattern and timing have made this formation a bullish wildcard. A similar playout of the 2017 death cross rally would send the XRP price to new all-time highs at the 1.5 Fibonacci extension. In terms of a price target, the analyst noted that the 1.5 Fibonacci extension for this year aligns near the $9.00 price level, which would represent a 325% rally from XRP’s current price. XRP 2017 Price Chart: Image From TradingViewXRP 2025 Price Chart: Image From TradingView Indicators Stay Neutral But Optimistic Notably, the XRP price has a neutral but promising technical outlook across higher timeframes. XRP holds a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 54.799 on the weekly timeframe. This is mid-range and shows there’s still plenty of room to climb before XRP becomes overbought. The MACD reading at 0.197 indicates mild upward pressure, while the ADX is at 30.423.

XRP has caught attention with rising institutional activity, especially after Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition and growing ETF momentum. Dogecoin, meanwhile, is showing signs of a potential move toward $0.18, with growing optimism fueled by ETF discussions and political narratives. But the project stirring curiosity right now isn’t either of these giants; it’s a lesser-known name gaining traction fast. Unstaked’s $UNSD is currently priced at $0.00799 in stage 8 of its presale, and experts are aiming high with projections over $4. That suggests a massive 2700% upside from the current level. With over $1 million in inflows within a single day, serious capital is already flowing in. Its AI features are in progress and set to activate after launch, which is expected to cause a demand spike. This makes Unstaked one of the most promising early layer 1 projects right now. Unstaked: Early-Stage AI Coin Targeting a $4 Surge Unstaked is now in stage 8 of its crypto presale , with $UNSD trading at $0.00799. Analysts see strong upside here, with future targets reaching beyond $4, translating to a 2700% gain. The growing momentum is visible, as $1 million flowed into the presale in just one day, raising the total to over $4 million, a sign that it’s capturing serious attention. Unlike many early crypto projects, Unstaked has no private sales or early insider allocations. This gives regular participants the advantage, as no early buyers will dump on the market. The listing price is set at $0.1819, almost 28 times higher than its current rate. With 60% of supply allocated for presale and prices climbing with each stage, timing matters. Unstaked’s AI agents are currently being developed and will operate on platforms like X and Telegram after the presale ends. These tools will use $UNSD for activation, upgrades, and governance once launched. That utility is expected to create a demand surge after exchange listings go live. With limited tokens remaining, early buyers could be the biggest winners. Anyone eyeing a strong layer 1 project in its early stages should be watching Unstaked. Analysts are already saying it might be the next big move before wider listings drive more attention. XRP Market Breakdown: Institutional Growth and ETF Push The latest XRP market data points to both opportunity and caution. XRP is currently hovering around $2.20, slightly down from its April high of $2.34, and showing signs of a descending triangle. Despite short-term patterns, major developments are bolstering long-term confidence. Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road for $1.25 billion has highlighted its plans to grow into institutional finance, and ProShares’ XRP futures ETF approval helped push prices past $2.16. CME’s launch of XRP futures, expected later this month, could open the door to wider institutional access. Ripple also confirmed it won’t pursue an IPO in 2025, emphasizing the company’s stable financial standing. Market watchers still place future targets between $2.40 and $10, depending on momentum and support holding firm. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price: Strong Volume and ETF News Dogecoin’s price is once again climbing, now approaching $0.182 as it breaks key resistance lines. Analysts credit this momentum to the possibility of a DOGE ETF and rising market volume. Social activity, including meme discussions and political themes, is also adding to DOGE’s appeal. Elon Musk’s statement about stepping back from DOGE-related work hasn’t dimmed its popularity. Future projections vary. CoinCodex sees potential short-term dips toward $0.135, while Benzinga analysts suggest a longer-term climb to $0.731, marking a 326% upside. The Dogecoin (DOGE) chart indicates reliable support and room for a major breakout, especially if the ETF buzz becomes reality. With prices still under $0.20, the next big jump may happen fast. Final Remarks! XRP continues to hold attention with its ETF progress, Ripple’s recent acquisition, and upcoming futures listings, backed by steady institutional interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s charts reflect bullish momentum supported by growing social and ETF-related excitement, with upside projections nearing $0.73. But if standout gains are the goal, Unstaked is where early movers are focusing. Now priced at $0.00799 in stage 8, $UNSD has already drawn $1 million in daily inflows, and analysts believe it could top $4 soon after launch. With no private allocations and real tools going live post-listing, this project might be the most undervalued early-stage layer 1 coin available right now.

Experts Believe it Has The Potential to Grow by 20,000% This Summer",https://timestabloid.com/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-be-the-next-binance-coin-bnb-experts-believe/,"Binance Coin (BNB) , known as the powerhouse utility token for the Binance ecosystem, is currently valued at $658.15 , boasting a commanding market cap of $92.72 billion . It serves as the backbone for various DeFi activities, trading, and payments, making it indispensable for millions of crypto users globally. But while BNB dominates, a new player is stepping in to redefine blockchain’s potential. That player is Ruvi , a groundbreaking project merging AI and blockchain to unlock new avenues for users and investors alike. Could Ruvi match the success of Binance Coin? Binance Coin’s Impact vs. Ruvi’s Vision Binance Coin offers unparalleled utility within the Binance ecosystem, powering trading fee discounts, staking, and even real-world payments via Binance Pay . Its role in DeFi platforms further amplifies its influence. However, its most captivating feature is its deflationary model, driven by quarterly coin burns, ensuring long-term value appreciation. On the other hand, Ruvi is carving out its own space in the blockchain landscape with a wholly AI-driven platform aimed at content creation . Users can generate text, videos, images, and other materials while earning $RUVI tokens for their contributions. While BNB caters primarily to traders and institutions, Ruvi targets a broader audience, including content creators, educators, and marketers, making blockchain more approachable and utilitarian. Ruvi’s Presale Opportunity Ruvi is currently in its presale phase , offering tokens for just $0.01 each, with highly attractive tiered bonuses to incentivize early participation. Here’s a breakdown of potential returns based on presale investments and Ruvi’s projected gains. Entry-Level Investment ($700) Tokens purchased at presale price: 70,000 Ruvi 40% bonus adds 28,000 additional tokens , totaling 98,000 tokens . If Ruvi reaches $1, your investment spikes to $98,000 . At $3, it rises to $294,000 . Mid-Level Investment ($1,500) Tokens purchased at presale rate: 150,000 tokens 60% bonus delivers an extra 90,000 tokens , for a total of 240,000 tokens . If Ruvi hits $2, the return is $480,000 , and at $3, it becomes a stunning $720,000 . High-Level Investment ($7,000) Tokens purchased at presale price: 700,000 Ruvi 100% bonus doubles holdings to 1.4 million tokens . If Ruvi reaches $3, this translates into an extraordinary $4.2 million in earnings. Such figures make Ruvi’s presale an enticing proposition for both risk-takers and strategic long-term investors. Ruvi’s Innovation vs. BNB’s Utility BNB thrives on being indispensable in DeFi markets , enabling token swaps, staking rewards, and low trading fees on the Binance platform. Its ecosystem is vast, encompassing gaming, NFTs, and peer-to-peer lending. Its quarterly coin burns only add to the allure, reducing supply constantly over time. Ruvi, however, brings a fresh dimension to blockchain by aligning its platform closely with AI innovations . Imagine an ecosystem where every piece of content you create generates tangible value in the form of $RUVI tokens ! This focus on creative utility makes Ruvi more inclusive than traditional crypto projects and opens doors to adoption across industries like education, marketing, and entertainment. Additionally, Ruvi’s fixed total supply of 5 billion tokens mirrors the scarcity-driven approach of BNB, cleverly ensuring that demand and value can grow as adoption scales. The Time Is Now Binance Coin’s early adopters have seen monumental gains as it became a linchpin for DeFi and trading. Could Ruvi follow similar trajectories but with its revolutionary AI-powered focus? The signs are promising, and the presale stage is the optimal time to act before prices surge with market recognition. This is a limited-time window to secure $RUVI tokens at their lowest price point. Don’t wait for others to capitalize on this opportunity. Stake your claim in Ruvi’s future and ride the wave of blockchain’s next big innovation!

33767162,[object Object],1746986456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $200,000 At Cycle Top – Details",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-predict-bitcoin-hit-200000-cycle-top/,"Market prices of Bitcoin (BTC) surged by 7.20% in the past week to trade above the $104,000 price level . The leading cryptocurrency has experienced a notable price rebound since dipping below $75,000 in April. Interestingly, prominent X analyst Mr. Wall Street has tipped BTC to maintain this bullish form and trade as high as $200,000 before the current market cycle is over. Bitcoin Heading For $200K Psychological Resistance At Cycle Top In an X post on May 10, Mr. Wall Street provided an interesting insight on the BTC market, explaining the reasons behind recent gains, while highlighting future price targets. According to the crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s 40% gain from $74,000 to $104,000 can be attributed to two reasons. Firstly, there was a supply shock at over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which forced institutional investors to go buy Bitcoin directly from crypto exchanges, thereby driving market demand. Mr. Wall Street also explained that the extreme market fear driven by US tariff changes caused investors to seek a safe haven in the gold market. Historically, an increase in gold investments is always bullish for the crypto market, as it’s been reflected in the recent market rally. The crypto analyst stated: … this extreme fear was bringing a geral capital rotation from risk assets to gold which was long term extremely bullish for bitcoin because everytime gold pumps, bitcoin pumps with a average delay of 3 months, as profits are rotated from gold towards bitcoin within that timeframe, and since gold is a x13 bigger market, 1% of gold market flowing towards bitcoin market makes us see a pump of +13%. Looking forward, Mr. Wall Street projects the positive market effects from the institutional supply shock and profits rotation from gold to last for the 3-6 months from the end of April. Therefore, Bitcoin investors can expect a market uptrend until August-November, where BTC should rise as high as $150,000. Thereafter, the analyst tips BTC to trade between $150,000 – $180,000, serving as a good accumulation period before surging to $200,000, which will likely serve as a psychological resistance like $100,000. Importantly, Mr. Wall Street states that $200,000 will potentially serve as the market cycle top at which many early investors are likely to take profit.

While DOGE dominates headlines, a lesser-known token Remittix is quietly setting itself up for something big. It’s fast, practical and built for real-world use, with nearly $15 million raised in the ongoing presale. Here’s what to know about Dogecoin’s journey and why Remittix might be one of the most interesting plays right now. Dogecoin sets up for the $100 billion milestone Dogecoin is back on the menu again. What started as a meme in 2013 is now one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world, with a place in the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies and an active community that keeps pushing it forward. At its peak, DOGE reached a market cap of over $80 billion and now, speculation is growing that it could top $100 billion. After the lows of 2022 and 2023, March 2024 saw a roaring resurgence for DOGE, where it topped at $0.22. While it dipped, that momentum held, with Donald Trump’s return to the White House pushing DOGE from around $0.15 to $0.46 in just over a month, between November and December. Source: CoinGecko That same pattern has repeated, with DOGE tumbling back to $0.14 in April still higher than 2024’s lows and now climbing back out of the trenches. It’s currently up nearly 50% over the past 30 days at $0.227, making higher highs and prompting calls for new multi-year peaks. Some analysts expect that DOGE could hit $1.10 before the end of the year, surpassing its previous $0.73 all-time high. At its current circulating supply, DOGE would only need to hit around $0.67 to smash a $100 billion market cap. The path now seems clear, with the long-term bullish pattern holding. So could Remittix follow in its footsteps? Remittix is built for real-world impact Remittix is doing something big, yet simple: creating a way to move money across borders that actually makes sense for crypto users. It lets users convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat instantly and send the money straight to a bank account anywhere in the world. That’s all without any middlemen or hidden FX fees, just a flat rate and complete transparency. It’s targeting a piece of the $250 trillion cross-border payments market projected for 2027. While banks and big fintech firms still dominate that space, Remittix is taking a different route that makes it stand out from even XRP, focused on accessibility, speed and usability. Users don’t need to understand blockchain to use it and the recipient just sees a regular bank transfer. There’s real business value too. With its Remittix Pay API, merchants can easily accept crypto and then settle in over 30 fiat currencies using 50+ crypto pairs. The RTX token presale is well underway, with nearly $15 million raised to fund its mission. A $250k Gleam competition and fully audited smart are winning investors round, but many are simply excited about the prospects of real-world adoption. With two-thirds of tokens now sold out to reach $0.0757 and tailwinds from a broader crypto rally lifting it higher, Remittix could be the under-the-radar token of the year. The future looks bright for DOGE and RTX Dogecoin’s journey is undoubtedly volatile. However, the bulls might be onto something, with $100 billion looking well within reach this year. For Remittix , utility, speed and solving actual problems in the $250 trillion cross-border payments space could be the recipe for a massive spike in demand for RTX once it goes live. As the market picks back up again, the Remittix presale might sell out sooner than expected. Don’t miss this window of opportunity.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe coin (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), Brett (BRETT) and Dogwifhat (WIF) have all registered rapid price hikes, so much so that picking the best meme coin could be a dilemma. But the question still lingers: are meme coins a good crypto investment once more? Or are rising utility tokens like Remittix (RTX) the way to go? What is Remittix (RTX) and why is it catching on? Imagine sending fiat to any bank account all over the world right from your crypto wallet. The process is smooth and fees are low. The recipient doesn’t know that the transaction started from your wallet. That’s the possibility that Remittix is introducing. Remittix - Welcome To The PayFi Revolution! CryptoAdvance Its PayFi protocol connects over 50 blockchains with payment networks worldwide. It’s a revolution that the world has been yearning for. With the way things are going, there’s a good chance it disrupts the global financial market in numerous ways. Its presale has generated a lot of traction. Without the involvement of venture capitalists, Remittix has raised close to $15 million. More than half a billion tokens have been sold and the coin, now priced at $0.0757, has appreciated by over 400%. This makes it a compelling investment option. Shiba Inu team predicts 1,000% SHIB surge Shiba Inu’s marketing lead recently tweeted that SHIB would appreciate 1,000% in 3 days. This was probably a lighthearted joke, but one can’t deny its true aim to put Shiba Inu in the spotlight and gain some relevance. Lucie’s Tweet. Source: Twitter/X While Shiba Inu has shown little signs of achieving this prediction, the meme coin has performed stellarly in recent weeks. On the monthly scene, SHIB is up by approximately 30%, and there’s been a price spike since Lucie’s prediction. With the crypto market flashing green and Shiba Inu rising to 15th on CoinMarketCap, it's possible that the meme coin actually accelerates 1,000% in the current bull cycle. That would take SHIB to a new all-time high, rewarding those who stuck with it through thick and thin. Pepe: A frog meme with staying power A tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, Pepe coin quickly amassed a cult following and made millionaires out of early adopters. After booming in 2024, the headwinds of 2025 dealt PEPE a major blow. But things are starting to pick up. PEPE’s triple bottom pattern. Source: Crispus9/ Trading View PEPE’s price chart shows the formation of a triple bottom pattern, which indicates a bullish reversal. This is confirmed by a mini golden cross pattern by the 50-day and 100-day Weighted Moving Averages crossing each other. Analysts predict that a significant rally is in the works. PEPE might draw close to, hit or even surpass its previous all-time high of $0.00002835. Solana meme sensation Bonk up 100% BONK was Solana’s answer to the meme coin craze. Airdropped to SOL owners, its aim was to inject fun and community spirit into the Solana ecosystem. This explains BONK’s rapid rise, as well as its 100% surge over the last month. BONK is up 100% on the monthly scene. Source: CoinMarketCap BONK is one of the most talked-about meme coins outside the Ethereum network. It’s only natural that it got loads of speculation when the crypto market is having a resurgence. Fundamental analysis suggests BONK would ride the current wave of meme hype. Given its popularity and stature, Bonk coin could recover the losses of the past few months and hit a new high. Is Dogwifhat primed for a new rally? Dogwifhat has endured a lengthy corrective phase, but now looks set to recover all the losses it made. WIF is up by over 100% in the last month, with numerous signals flashing green. WIF’s recent breakout. Source: WorldOfCharts/CoinMarketCap According to WorldofCharts , WIF has been testing crucial descending channel resistance, and a solid bullish rally is all but confirmed. The recent breakout is backed by trading volume, with an average of $500 million WIF traded in the last days. Should WIF maintain this momentum, a surge to $1.5 or even $2 might be on the cards. Brett: Meme newcomer goes ballistic BRETT is the latest meme coin to burst on the scene. It is inspired by the Brett character from Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comic series. It has gained significant cultural and community support, and has appreciated by a whopping 200% in the last month. BRETT’s recent boom. Source: Coingecko The current surge might propel BRETT to new highs. BRETT relies heavily on hype, more than most meme coins. If the current meme coin supercycle continues, BRETT could deliver outsized returns for risk-tolerant investors. The bottom line: Can Remittix outperform meme coins in the current bull cycle? Unlike SHIB, BRETT, WIF, PEPE and BONK, Remittix has real-world utility and looks primed to ride the bull wave to the hilt. It revolutionizes a massive industry and has surged by 400% already to $0.0757. By the time Remittix goes viral, it could usher in a 100x, outperform meme tokens and turn early adopters into crypto millionaires.

Years ago, his company made it easy for people to buy digital currency. With signs that the U.S. economy is slowing down, Dorsey’s early move into Bitcoin may become even more beneficial. Jack Dorsey Made Bitcoin Adoption Easy for Everyone In 2019, Dorsey’s company, Square, now called Block, started letting users buy and hold Bitcoin through its Cash App. It was one of the first big companies to offer this service. Users could use their debit or credit cards to buy BTC, making it easy and accessible to the crypto world. This was long before big companies like Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, made headlines for buying large amounts of Bitcoin. Block’s Stock Drops After Weak Earnings Block’s stock price fell by 20% at the beginning of May after the company released its first quarter earnings report. The report showed that fewer people were spending money on travel and entertainment, and instead, they spent more on basic needs like food and gas. Dorsey explained that this change in spending hurt the company’s income and was a key reason it could not meet its financial target. Block’s weaker performance in the first quarter matched a bigger trend in the U.S. economy. In the first quarter of the year, the economy shrank for the first time in three years. If this happens again in the next quarter, it could mean the country is entering a recession. Recession Could Be the Spark Bitcoin Needs If a recession does happen, the Federal Reserve may be forced to cut interest rates to help the economy. A new CNBC survey shows that many experts believe these cuts will happen soon. Meanwhile, low interest rates have helped Bitcoin prices rise in the past . After the 2008 financial crisis, when the Fed cut rates heavily, Bitcoin was introduced. During the following years, the digital currency rose from less than a penny to nearly $20,000 by the end of 2017. Bitcoin’s price is already worth over $100,000, even though the Fed has not yet lowered rates this year. If the government cuts rates, the price of Bitcoin could increase much more. Like Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, Jack Dorsey has also predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million . While that once seemed unrealistic, the current economic slowdown and the possibility of interest rate cuts have made some people believe it might come true. Even though Block is facing some financial setbacks, Dorsey’s early support for Bitcoin might prove to be a smart move. If Bitcoin’s value continues to rise during an economic slowdown, it could benefit the company.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031.

TL;DR Breakdown: OP/USDT support lies at $0.743. OP drops 6% as consolidation lingers. The coin is above its 50-day SMA at $0.699. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP lost over 6% As seen on the price chart on May 11, OP faced rejection near $0.95 and dropped over 6% to $0.855 — a sign that the bull may be cooling off. The red candle above the upper Bollinger Band suggests overextension. MACD is positive but flattening, hinting at momentum loss. CMF remains strong at 0.14, indicating buyers are still present. OP lost over 6% Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP remains bullish in the short term, but signs of consolidation emerge OP is consolidating around $0.87 after a sharp rally. The 50-day SMA at $0.699 shows strong trend support. MFI at 65.61 signals buyers are still active but nearing overbought territory. Balance of Power (0.70) confirms bulls remain dominant.

Optimism (OP) Outlook – Short Summary: OP is bullish but facing resistance at $0.90. Indicators show strong buying, though a short-term pullback or sideways move is likely. Holding above $0.85 keeps bulls in control; breaking $0.90 could push it toward $1.00. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The project is 65% filled in the current phase 4 at $0.025, hanging with the tip of the sword for a 20% price jump to $0.03 in phase 5. This is a non-hyped decentralized lending platform that doesn’t have to chase the passing cloud of hype. Mutuum Finance is creating a niche that has real-world application in the form of combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending models. Investors are swarming to get the tokens before the next surge with a predetermined tokenomics feature that claims to have a 140% gain at the $0.06. Will this altcoin surpass leading kings like ADA and DOGE? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Fuels Investor Frenzy Phase 4 of Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) pre-sale is in full swing with 65% of the phase sold out having been staked at $0.025 from the $0.01 that was able to be compensated in the first phase. Token grabbers today are in line to reap a 20% catch in Phase 5 when it goes to $0.03 for a nice quick pick up. Beyond that, the tokenomics lock in at a 140% return at $0.06 but whispers in the market pin a post-launch surge to $2.50 for a jaw-dropping 9,900% ROI. That same $700 could escalate to $65,000 if that target pans out. The team is strengthening trust, aggressively chasing a CertiK audit on its smart contracts, the results of which will soon splatter over their social channels. Innovative Lending Sparks Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reshaping DeFi by reshaping DeFi box and introducing a dual-lending system that is equally user-friendly and strong. Borrowers access the funds, and as they do so, the markets loan tokens known as mtTokens gain interests. If the assets deposited into liquidity pools increase, lenders also benefit from this through interest. Meanwhile, borrowers guarantee on the basis of overcollateralized assets, which ensures stability. The peer-to-peer model allows users to bargain on the go, even with niche tokens, thus increasing the platform’s share on the market. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has revealed a dashboard with a focus on the top 50 token holders, and rewarding them with extra tokens for holding firm. This move sparks loyalty and creates FOMO as the phase 4 approaches the sell-out to compel investors to move as there is no time to lose. Sustained Growth Through Smart Tokenomics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not making a bet on speculation; Its buy-and-distribute mechanism showers platform revenue into repurchasing tokens, sending them back to stakers. This causes unfathomable buy pressure, protecting against sell offs and building long term value. The platform’s mtTokens (such as mtETH or mtDAI), provide unobtrusive passive income, while liquid and transmissible across DeFi ecosystems, they have both liquidity and yield. With the looming 20% price increase in the horizon, the dwindling phase 4 leaves investors with no option but to take action and lock in before prices spiral. The planned presale combined with a $100,000 giveaway for early adopters ups the anxiety, turning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into a flashlight for the profiteers on a prowl for high-margin returns. A Golden Opportunity Awaits Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at an opportunity-crossroads, with presale phase 4 giving it a fleeting window to join at $0.025. Unlike such altcoins as ADA and DOGE, which rely on market sentiment, this altcoin’s real-world lending utility and systematic tokenomics put it on the path of explosive growth. A measly $700 can turn into $65,000 if the $2.50 post-launch comes to stand, pulling ahead of rivals, who are stalled at neutral.

The negotiations involved top economic officials from both sides and wrapped with no press questions taken and no public deal terms—yet. Bessent told reporters that full details will drop Monday. He said President Donald Trump had been briefed throughout and was “fully aware” of the agreement reached. The discussions included US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who sat with Bessent and He alongside two unnamed Chinese vice ministers. Greer described the outcome as “a deal we struck with our Chinese partners,” claiming it would help reduce the $1.2 trillion US global goods trade deficit. He said both sides got through the key sticking points faster than expected. “It’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to an agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,” Greer added. He also said the Chinese team was “tough negotiators.” White House and Commerce back the direction The meeting in Geneva was the first time Bessent, Greer, and He had met in person since Washington and Beijing hit each other with tariffs of over 100%. The deal marks a possible shift in that tariff war , though Bessent did not confirm any actual changes to the current rates. He did repeat his earlier stance that the tariffs were too high and needed to come down, but avoided giving direct answers about what had been agreed. Kevin Hassett, White House economic adviser, said on Fox News that the Chinese were “very, very eager” to hold the talks and fix their trade relationship with the United States. Hassett also said that deals with other countries could be announced as early as this week. Trump posted his reaction overnight on Truth Social, calling the talks a “total reset” done “in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” The president also said: “Many things discussed, much agreed to,” and added, “We want to see, for the good of both China and the US, an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!” While the trade talks were happening, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also joined his colleagues to announce that the 10% baseline tariff on imports from other countries would stay for now. “We do expect a 10% baseline tariff to be in place for the foreseeable future,” Howard said on State of the Union . Howard pushed back on the idea that the tariffs would raise prices for US shoppers. “Business and countries will pay,” he said, rejecting the idea that Americans would bear the costs. But recent trends tell a different story. Since Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, consumer confidence has dropped and prices on some household items have already gone up. Businesses appear to be pushing some of the cost to buyers. Howard didn’t mention that. He only said that US producers would have the edge. “Businesses, their job is to try to sell to the American consumer, and domestically produced products are not going to have that tariff, so the foreigners are going to finally have to compete,” he said. This whole deal, while still mostly under wraps, came together fast. It involved real negotiations. Real stakes. And it put Bessent right in the center of something that could shape US-China economic ties going forward. All eyes are now on Monday.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns. Bitcoin ( BTC ) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend. Bitcoin’s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors’ data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows . Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 The rally was not limited to Bitcoin alone, as several altcoins also moved higher. That has prompted analysts to announce the start of an altseason, with some predicting sharp rallies in altcoins over the next few months. However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs. Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? If it does, let’s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The rally has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought zone, suggesting a correction or consolidation in the near term. Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000. Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962). BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair continues to climb higher, but the bears are expected to fiercely defend the $107,000 to $109,588 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588. Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and subsequently to $83,000. Ether price prediction Ether ( ETH ) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The up move pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, indicating a minor pullback or consolidation is possible in the near term. The first support on the downside is $2,320 and then $2,111. If the price turns up from the support levels, the ETH/USDT pair could extend the rally to $2,850 and later to $3,000. The optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $2,111. That could result in a range formation between $1,754 and $2,600. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls pushed the price above the $2,550 resistance but could not sustain the higher levels. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000. A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA. That could sink the pair toward the solid support at $2,111. Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) soared above the $0.21 overhead resistance on May 10, indicating a change in the short-term trend. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The rally is facing selling at $0.26, which could result in a retest of the breakout level of $0.21. If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31. If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19). If they do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could swing inside a large range between $0.26 and $0.14 for a while. DOGE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has turned down from $0.26, with immediate support at $0.22 and then at $0.21. If the price rebounds off the support zone, it suggests a positive sentiment where dips are being purchased. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.26. Conversely, a drop below $0.21 signals that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could pull the price to the 50-day SMA.

PEPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone, signaling a pullback may be around the corner. The PEPE/USDT pair could drop to the breakout level of $0.000011. If the price rebounds off $0.000011, it suggests that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That improves the prospects for a rally to $0.000017 and then to $0.000020. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.000009). PEPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $0.000014 level. That could pull the price down to the 20-EMA, which is a vital level to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the pair above $0.000014. If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017. On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA. Cosmos price prediction Cosmos ( ATOM ) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10. That signals a potential trend change. ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to pull the price back below the $5.15 level. If they manage to do that, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the price to the moving averages. Alternatively, if buyers sustain the price above $5.15, the ATOM/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $6.50. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $6.50, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could rally to $7.50. ATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The sharp rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone on the 4-hour chart, suggesting a short-term correction or consolidation. The bulls will have to defend the critical $5.15 level if they want to keep the positive momentum intact. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $6.60. Contrarily, a break and close below $5.15 could pull the price down to the 20-EMA. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it may sink the pair to $4.70.

Brian Armstrong says that Coinbase previously considered the idea of adopting the same crypto investment strategy taken by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, reports Bloomberg. “There were definitely moments over the last 12 years where we thought, man, should we put 80% of our balance sheet into crypto – into Bitcoin, specifically.” But Coinbase eventually decided against the idea because it could jeopardize the company’s cash position as a startup and even potentially cause its demise. “We made a conscious choice about risk.” Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas supports the move, explaining that the company doesn’t want to appear as though it’s stockpiling Bitcoin in competition with its own customers. While the crypto exchange abandoned its massive Bitcoin accumulation plan, its latest shareholder letter shows that the firm spent $153 million in Q1 of this year to accumulate digital assets, mostly in Bitcoin. The company now holds $1.3 billion in crypto. Says Haas, “Rest assured, we are not stopping there.” According to Coinbase, it established a huge crypto trove to meet regulatory capital needs, support growing utility and reinforce the firm’s commitment in the digital asset industry.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) cruised above $104,000 and is near the all-time high. Similarly, Ethereum ( ETH ) ended its consolidation and short-squeezed from $1,800 to $2,500. Other altcoins also soared, bringing the total market cap of all coins to over $3.2 trillion. This article looks at the top three catalysts affecting Bitcoin and other altcoin prices this week. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices | Source: crypto.news Trade talks The main catalyst for Bitcoin, altcoins, and the stock market is the ongoing trade talks in Switzerland . The first day ended without a big announcement, but Trump hailed ‘ great progress ’ while no further information was provided. Beijing struck a more cautious tone, with its state news agency warning that China would firmly oppose any proposals that threaten its core principles or global fairness. Despite the high stakes for the global economy, the two sides appear divided on the current state of negotiations. Indeed, a trade deal or de-escalation would mitigate recession risks, analysts say. It would also mean that inflation growth may be contained, creating an opening for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected. You might also like: Today in crypto: Bitcoin, altcoins shine in broad market rally following China-US trade update US inflation data The next important catalyst for Bitcoin and other altcoins will be Wednesday when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. Economists expect the report to show consumer prices rose in April as companies made tariff-related adjustments. The average estimate is that the headline CPI rose from 2.4% in March to 2.5% in April, while the core CPI remained at 2.8%. Goldman Sachs analysts expect that U.S. inflation will continue rising and end the year at 3.8%. Bitcoin and altcoins often react to U.S. inflation data because of its impact on the Federal Reserve. In its meeting last week, the Fed decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.5% and maintain a wait-and-see approach. A lower inflation figure and signs of progress on trade would fuel the ongoing crypto bull run. Consensus event in Toronto The other top catalyst for the crypto market will be the upcoming Consensus event in Toronto, which will gather the most influential names in the industry. Some top speakers are Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, Robert Hines, Eric Trump, Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov, and Anthony Scaramucci. Historically, such events have been good places for companies to announce partnerships and deals that move tokens. For example, Pi Network ( PI ) price surged after the Core Team hinted at a major announcement during the event.

You get a busy week in crypto. Monero (XMR) suddenly shot up 50%, but the move may be linked to reports of $330 million in stolen Bitcoin being cleaned through XMR. No upgrades, just panic-driven volume. At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is testing a breakout level, with $55 million in short positions at risk if DOGE climbs past $0.19. Now think about stepping away from this kind of noise and looking at something with more direction. Web3 ai is lining up a real product launch, and some are already calling it the ChatGPT of crypto. Its tools include real-time AI trading, natural language models, and machine learning features set to go live after launch. And it’s already being named as a top crypto for 2025. At $0.000331, $WAI gives early buyers a clear path to gains. A $100 entry could become $800 at listing. Web3 ai Builds the AI Tools Others Only Promised Web3 ai is taking a different path from the usual AI token buzz. It’s not just offering vague plans. It’s building full systems: from natural language tools to machine learning, to AI bots that support real-time trading. These features will be live after the token launches. It’s not AI for branding. It’s AI with a purpose. What makes it stand out is how the presale is set up. Web3 ai is rolling out its offering in 50 stages, starting at $0.000331. The final listing price is confirmed at $0.005242. That means early buyers could see a 1584% return by the time the token hits exchanges. That structure rewards those who move early and gives each batch a defined advantage. The total presale earnings have already crossed $2 million. Web3 ai’s pricing makes it one of the most affordable and functional AI projects in presale. Even the final batch, priced at $0.003267, is still below the listing mark. But with each batch filling fast, the chance to enter early is narrowing. That’s why Web3 ai is becoming a regular feature in trader circles as a top crypto for 2025. It combines strong tech with clear value and a built-in price lift. What separates Web3 ai from the rest is that it’s not copying others. It’s building from the ground up. And for those who get in early, the reward scales with it. That’s why many in the space are already calling $WAI their top crypto for 2025 pick. Monero’s Sudden Surge Raises Questions After BTC Laundering Reveal This week’s spike in Monero (XMR) news wasn’t about a big upgrade or network growth. It followed a report linking the token to a $330 million Bitcoin laundering case. The price jumped more than 50%, moving from $228 to $347, before settling near $295. Blockchain analyst ZachXBT shared that over 3,500 stolen BTC moved through various exchanges using Monero as a key transfer tool. The spike in XMR was likely driven by that event, not real user demand. Once the story spread, prices started to pull back. Even though Monero is still known for its privacy use case, this kind of Monero (XMR) news brings up questions. Was the price move about real growth or just a reaction to shady activity? For now, it looks more like a short-term reaction than a lasting shift. Dogecoin Nears Key Level With $55M in Shorts on the Line Dogecoin (DOGE) price is drawing attention after forming a bull flag on the 1-hour chart. If the token breaks above $0.1840, it could confirm the pattern and set up a push toward $0.22 or even $0.25. Crowd sentiment is high with a score of 0.77, but more experienced traders are still cautious, as smart money sentiment remains negative. Adding to the pressure is the heavy short zone near $0.19. Around $55 million in short positions are stacked in that range, so if DOGE moves higher, it could force sellers to close fast, driving the price even more. That’s why traders are watching the $0.1810 to $0.1840 range closely. If buyers take control, it could trigger the next breakout. Which Crypto Is The More Stable Choice Right Now? Dogecoin (DOGE) price is sitting near a level that could liquidate short sellers, and Monero (XMR) news is tied to a price jump based on stolen Bitcoin flows. Both have strong short-term interest but also bring high risk and quick shifts. Traders looking to ride a fast move could miss their chance or end up on the wrong side of it. On the other hand, Web3 ai is putting its focus on long-term tools, not quick gains. It’s building a full AI platform with natural language processing, machine learning, and trading bots. The token price starts at $0.000331 during presale, with a confirmed listing price of $0.005242. That gives early buyers a 1584% return if it launches as expected. This is one of the reasons it’s being called the top crypto for 2025 . It offers a real product, a clear price structure, and less hype-driven risk. For traders looking beyond the next 24 hours, Web3 ai may be the stronger play.

Failure to comply with this rule can result in fines of up to €150,000. The government frames this measure as part of efforts to increase financial transparency and combat money laundering. However, critics view it as a form of capital control that restricts access to personal funds. The policy has sparked debate on its potential economic impact, including concerns about whether it might drive high-net-worth individuals to relocate and whether it will effectively increase tax revenues. The move has also fueled interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which some see as an alternative to traditional banking under tighter regulations. This development is part of a broader trend toward increased financial oversight and capital controls in Western democracies, raising questions about the future of cash usage and personal financial freedom.

According to the assessment published by the company, the selling pressure from miners has decreased to the lowest level since 2024. The “Miner Selling Pressure” metric tracked by Alphractal measures the selling power of miners. This metric compares the total BTC outflows over the last 30 days to the average of miner reserves over the same period. A low value indicates that miners are holding on to their assets, which is a positive signal for the price. However, Alphractal warned that reselling interest could increase in the coming weeks depending on the price direction. Related News: Analysis Firm Shares Major Bullish Prediction for Ethereum: “In a Scenario Where Bitcoin Reaches $300,000, ETH...” On the other hand, despite Bitcoin exceeding the $103,000 level, open interest in futures continues to remain weak. The total open interest currently stands at $61.3 billion. Alphractal reminded that in the past, when BTC was at these levels, open interest was at least around $68 billion, and stated that the current outlook reveals that leveraged trading volume and market maker activity are low. This situation is evaluated as a result of liquidations and position closures in recent months. In the short term, whales are seen closing their long positions and giving signals indicating a change in direction in the market. Alphractal stated that if the Whale Position Trend metric continues to fall, the market could either be tied sideways or enter a correction process. *This is not investment advice.

While these targets have frequently been dismissed as unrealistic, the analyst argues they are achievable under certain adoption scenarios grounded in global financial infrastructure and XRP’s technical capabilities. In a detailed thread published on X, Stellar Rippler outlined five scenarios that could drive XRP’s price substantially. The analysis is rooted in the premise that XRP, designed for efficient cross-border transactions , could become a fundamental component in emerging financial systems as legacy infrastructure evolves or is replaced. (1/ ) THE PRICE TARGET OF XRP IS SET AT 1 XRP = $1000. ALL BACKED BY FACTS. You’ve seen the theories. But let’s run the numbers: SWIFT, derivatives, CBDCs, global liquidity. By the end of this thread, it won’t sound like a theory anymore. It’ll sound like a plan. pic.twitter.com/etUWIf8Zd3 — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) May 6, 2025 Scenario 1: XRP as a SWIFT Replacement Could Justify $27–$50 The first projection involves XRP capturing a portion of the settlement volume currently handled by SWIFT, the global financial messaging network that facilitates over $5 trillion in daily transactions. According to the analyst, if XRP were to settle just 10% of these transactions—approximately $500 billion daily—it could drive XRP’s price to between $27 and $50. This estimate is based on liquidity demand and settlement velocity within such a framework. Scenario 2: Unwinding Nostro/Vostro Capital Could Support $80–$100 XRP A second use case centers on pre-funded Nostro and Vostro accounts, where approximately $27 trillion in capital is locked to enable cross-border settlements. The analyst suggests that XRP could be a bridge asset to eliminate the need for such accounts. According to the thread, facilitating even 5% of this total could support a valuation range of $80 to $100 for XRP. Scenarios 3–5: Banking Licenses, IMF Integration, and Derivatives Settlement The third scenario involves Ripple potentially obtaining a banking license, giving it direct access to central banks and the global financial system. If Ripple were to build a new financial architecture with XRP at the center, Stellar Rippler believes XRP would be “easily above $100.” The fourth scenario expands on Ripple’s existing relationships with over 40 central banks and mentions in the IMF and BIS tokenization frameworks. Should XRP be adopted as a standard settlement layer by institutions like the IMF or World Bank, the analyst places the projected price between $250 and $500. The fifth and most aggressive scenario targets the global derivatives market, valued at roughly $1 quadrillion. The analyst suggests that if the XRP Ledger handles just 0.1% of this market’s settlements, XRP could exceed a price of $1,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Obstacles and Why These Targets Aren’t Reflected Yet Despite these bullish forecasts, Stellar Rippler acknowledges that XRP remains far from achieving such valuations due to regulatory uncertainty, market suppression, and institutional hesitation. “These projections remain far-fetched due to lawsuits, suppression, and ‘confusion,’” the analyst noted, attributing XRP’s stagnation to external factors slowing adoption until the traditional financial system is ready. Currently trading near $2, XRP would require a market capitalization of about $582 billion to reach $10—a figure the analyst describes as “ridiculously achievable.” In contrast, a $1,000 price would imply a $55 trillion market cap, a scenario even the analyst concedes is speculative. Still, the argument is that while Bitcoin’s rise was largely driven by belief, XRP’s future value could be derived from tangible use and integration. As stated in the thread, “Bitcoin went from pennies to $100K+ on narrative alone, XRP has real-world utility, banking ties, regulatory positioning, and tech light-years ahead….” By grounding these targets in utility-based scenarios rather than hype, Stellar Rippler challenges the dismissive attitude toward high-end XRP valuations, reframing the asset as a candidate for serious institutional use rather than a speculative token.

The project was still gaining traction, and few believed it could grow into one of the top-performing digital assets of its cycle. But the traders who understood what Ripple was building didn’t wait for headlines or price spikes—they acted early, and the results spoke for themselves. Now, those same early movers are quietly accumulating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), another project flying under the radar but showing signs of becoming a major player. It’s still in presale, still affordable, and still at a stage where patient buyers tend to benefit most. And while the comparison to XRP isn’t about utility overlap, it’s about timing—being early when a project is still accessible, not already priced in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At $0.025 per token, MUTM is drawing in traders who look beyond daily price movements. They recognize a project that’s still being developed but has already drawn in thousands of holders and secured millions in initial backing. These traders aren’t chasing the next quick flip; they’re entering while the protocol is still being developed, with features that aim to serve real use cases once the platform is live. Mutuum’s fourth presale phase is approaching the 70% mark, having already secured more than $7.8 million in funding and distributed over 450 million tokens. The next pricing tier is set to increase the token to $0.03, giving those buying in now one of the last chances to secure a lower entry point before launch. The appeal of MUTM comes from its foundations. Unlike speculative tokens that rely on future hype, Mutuum has outlined a model centered on decentralized finance—allowing users to deposit digital assets, borrow securely with collateral, and stay in control of their funds through smart contracts. This type of setup is gaining attention from traders who are always on the lookout for the next crypto to explode. It’s not just about finding something cheap—it’s about finding something early, with a defined purpose and a working structure. And with Mutuum still in presale, yet already progressing on product delivery, the entry point is aligning perfectly with the interest of traders who’ve been through similar setups before. The interest in Mutuum Finance isn’t coming from hype—it’s coming from traders who’ve seen this kind of setup before. When XRP was still finding its footing, the people who bought in early weren’t just guessing. They were paying attention to the fundamentals: real progress, strong community engagement, and a product that didn’t just live on paper. That’s the same logic being applied to MUTM right now. The project isn’t hiding behind vague promises. The team has been open about what the protocol will do and how users will benefit once it goes live. Development is already in motion, and the smart contract structure that underpins Mutuum’s lending model is shaping up to be one of its strongest features. What’s catching the attention of experienced traders is how clearly Mutuum has laid out its purpose. It’s decentralized by design, so users retain full control over their digital assets. There’s no need for intermediaries, and no manual processing—every transaction flows through smart contract logic. This trustless setup aligns with what serious traders look for when considering a crypto investment that can actually scale. While many traders spend their time reacting to price movements, the most consistent gains often go to those who act before momentum builds. That was true with XRP, and now it’s becoming true again with MUTM. The token still hasn’t hit mainstream awareness—but to seasoned eyes, that’s a feature, not a flaw. XRP’s rise from $0.02 was built on progress and timing, not hype. And Mutuum is currently walking a similar path. It’s establishing its product, securing its early supporters, and doing the work before the market catches on. For anyone looking for a top cryptocurrency with real potential, MUTM offers a unique blend of low entry cost, early availability, and a functional model already in motion. Being early in crypto isn’t about guessing—it’s about recognizing the pattern. And right now, many of the traders who caught XRP’s run from the ground floor are quietly making their move into Mutuum Finance.

Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users.

Brandt identified a rising wedge formation on the chart—a pattern often considered bearish. Ethereum analysis by Peter Brandt. Source: X.com However, he suggested that a breakout above this pattern could propel Ethereum’s price toward the descending resistance line, targeting a range between $3,800 and $4,800. This analysis marks a notable shift in Brandt’s outlook from 2024, aligning with the renewed optimism for the altcoin. Ethereum futures saw a 42% surge in open interest (OI) , climbing from $21.3 billion to $30.4 billion between May 8 and May 11, 2025. Nearing its all-time high of $32 billion, this spike reflects heightened market activity and growing trader engagement. The rapid increase in OI signals strong interest in Ether futures, potentially paving the way for increased price volatility. Ethereum futures open interest.

Historically, such a recovery marks a price bottom but could also signal the beginning of a small correction period after the EMAs retest. Ethereum weekly chart analysis.

This retest represents the first leg of the recovery, but a short-term pullback may occur before further bullish action unfolds. With ETH prices moving at a parabolic rate over the past few days, liquidation heatmaps noted higher buy-side liquidity between $2,200 and $2,400, after a short-squeeze took prices up to $2,608.

The ratio of buy volume divided by sell volume of takers in perpetual swap trades indicates futures sentiment, and a ratio below 1 implies short-term bearishness. Thus, traders could approach the coming days more cautiously, with ETH consolidating under the $2,500 level.

However, the prominent altcoin remains in danger of significant market downside. According to renowned X market expert Crypto Egrag, XRP must close above certain price levels to invalidate this bearish pattern and validate its bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Major XRP Accumulation Alert: Wallets Holding Over 10,000 Coins Cross 300,000 XRP Faces Critical Resistance At $2.41-$2.45, But $2.96 Represents Ultimate Challenge In a recent series of X posts, Egrag Crypto has previously stated that XRP was at a major crossroads facing a pivotal breakout or a potential retest. In line with the crypto market, XRP has seen a sustained price rebound since mid-April, gaining by 35.95%. However, Egrag Crypto warns that the altcoin is facing major resistance at the price range between $2.41-$2.45, which aligns with the descending trend line of the market correction that had dominated the first quarter of 2025. To strengthen the bullish case of its recent breakout, the analyst explains that XRP must move and stay above this price resistance, thereby neutralizing the bearish outlook. If XRP fails to make a convincing breakout above $2.41-$2.45 and slips into consolidation, the altcoin faces the potential of a retest to around $1.2-$1.3, representing a potential 46.05% decline from today’s price. However, the analyst explains that such a retest would only provide a massive accumulation opportunity as the long-term outlook for XRP still remains bullish. In a following post on May 10, Egrag Crypto states XRP must also reclaim the $2.96 price zone to confirm a sustainable uptrend. Notably, the $2.96 price level represents the next major price resistance after the descending trendline and is the closest to the current local market top.

On larger time frames, the altcoin holders are in significant profits as indicated by gains of 10.17% and 23.37% on the weekly and monthly charts, respectively. Generally, the market sentiment among XRP investors remains bullish, especially following recent developments in the legal case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On May 8, the SEC announced a settlement that includes the return of $75 million held in escrow to Ripple, which comes months after the Commission signaled its intentions to terminate its appeal case against the blockchain company. With a market cap of $241.95 billion, XRP remains the fourth-largest cryptocurrency and third-largest altcoin in the digital asset space.

The US-UK trade agreement, hinted at in Donald Trump’s early morning announcement, sparked a surge in investor optimism and drove a wave of capital into digital assets. As bullish momentum gripped the crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) climbed above $2,100, PEPE jumped 44.1% in 24 hours, and one AI token is now stealing the spotlight after seeing the most momentum during its presale. Bitcoin Price Skyrockets On Donald Trump’s US-UK Trade Triumph The announcement of a sweeping US-UK trade deal by Donald Trump has reignited bullish fervor across global markets, but nowhere has the reaction been more electric than in the Bitcoin price . Following Donald Trump’s press release on the US-UK trade deal, the Bitcoin price surged above $100,000. Bulls, already optimistic, now eye the $150,000 mark with renewed confidence. With the asset holding firm at $103,356, analysts on X suggest the Bitcoin price rally still has plenty of fuel and is following the Global M2 trajectory. Bulls are rallying around the Donald Trump US-UK trade deal narrative to strengthen long-term positions and build on the growing momentum. The Bitcoin price surge has also created the ideal macro backdrop for emerging tokens to ride the wave, and one project in particular has caught the bulls’ attention. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Attracts Bulls In Post-Bitcoin Surge As the Bitcoin price blasts through the six-figure ceiling, seasoned bulls are pivoting fast, locking eyes on FloppyPepe (FPPE) as the next asymmetric moonshot. The timing of its presale isn’t just fortunate—it’s strategic. Donald Trump’s US-UK trade deal has triggered a new wave of capital rotation, and this presale sits dead-center in the slipstream of a parabolic bull market. While Bitcoin continues to soak up institutional flows, retail bulls are constantly pouring into the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale and taking advantage of its 80% bonus presale tokens to maximize their potential yield. In a bullish crypto market climate flooded with fresh liquidity, this presale presents a calculated bet that savvy players are already front-running. Don’t miss it! Security, Scarcity, And Staking Drive Institutional Attention Donald Trump’s US-UK trade deal and the soaring Bitcoin price have drawn institutions back into the crypto markets, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) has positioned itself to gain the trust of bulls and institutional investors. With advanced cybersecurity infrastructure, including multi-signature wallets, a third-party audit by SolidProof, and bug bounties, this project is built for maximum protection. Further bolstering confidence is FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) floppynomics model: a deflationary structure with 1% burn per transaction, 1% redistribution to holders, and 1% to wildlife conservation. This blend of social impact and scarcity economics appeals strongly to Bitcoin-native bulls who value ethical initiatives. Global Expansion Aligns With Trump-Era Optimism While Bitcoin bulls respond to the renewed confidence ushered in by Donald Trump’s improved transatlantic trade, FloppyPepe (FPPE) pushed for global expansion. Its planned Tier 1 exchange listings, partnerships with key opinion leaders, and cross-border marketing campaigns align perfectly with the shifting geopolitical narrative. With platforms like Uniswap and CoinGecko listings on the horizon, the project is building toward sustainable liquidity and visibility. The launch of a global Discord and airdrop campaigns coincides with increased market exposure following Donald Trump’s US-UK trade deal announcement. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Gains Momentum As Bulls Seek 80% Bonus Advantage As the Bitcoin price continues to surge in the wake of Donald Trump’s brokered US-UK trade deal agreement, bullish capital is cascading into altcoin presales, especially ones with aggressive bonus structures. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) ongoing presale , priced attractively at $0.0000002 , is now the epicenter of meme coin attention. The 80% bonus (Code: FLOPPY80 ) acts as a major incentive for investors capitalizing early on this opportunity. Bulls who missed the initial FloppyPepe (FPPE) private round, where $907,200 was raised in just 24 hours, now view the public presale as a rare second chance. The Meme-o-Matic platform, real-time FloppyX AI video agents, and hyper-engaged communities on Telegram and X with live beta testing create an ecosystem engineered for virality. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) momentum is real, the technology is live, and the bulls are buying in.

According to a report from the Financial Times, Microsoft may give up a portion of its equity in OpenAI for continued access to the AI company's products and models beyond 2030, when some of the original terms of a deal signed between the two companies expire. Microsoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, when it first acquired an interest in the artificial intelligence firm. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman takes the podium at the White House in January 2025 to discuss AI infrastructure investment in the United States. Source: The White House OpenAI is attempting to restructure the company to shift its focus to profit-making. However, those plans have met with pushback from co-founders like Elon Musk and early investors. The deal between OpenAI and Microsoft is critical to OpenAI's restructuring and the future of the US-based AI startup company. Advancing artificial intelligence has also become a key policy objective for global leaders as the AI arms race heats up. Related: OpenAI to stay nonprofit, scrap proposed overhaul OpenAI faces staunch pushback against for-profit shift OpenAI was founded as a non-profit entity in 2015 by businessman Elon Musk, tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, and AI researcher Ilya Sutskever. However, in 2024, the company began mulling a corporate restructuring that would convert the company from a non-profit entity to a for-profit corporation. Elon Musk has been one of the biggest critics of the plan , calling into question the legality of the proposed shift in a November 2024 legal filing . Elon Musk and others file litigation against OpenAI to block its conversion to a for-profit company. Source: Court Listener The tech billionaire also blasted the company's focus on closed-source software development, which he said was not the original objective of OpenAI. ""OpenAI was actually started and was meant to be open source. I named it 'OpenAI' after open source, now it is, in fact, closed source. It should be renamed super closed source AI for maximum profit AI,"" Musk told an audience at the New York Times DealBook Summit. In February 2025, a group of investors led by Musk submitted a $97.4 billion bid to take over OpenAI. However, the deal was flatly rejected by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. More recently, on May 5, OpenAI announced it was abandoning its shift to a purely for-profit model and is choosing to shift to a public benefit corporation — a profit-driven structure with legal obligations to fulfill social or public goods objectives — controlled by a non-profit entity.

After months of criticism of the Ethereum Foundation, Buterin has proposed reducing the platform’s complexity. Vitalik Buterin Proposed Solution to Solve Ethereum’s Complexity Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain in the world, with over $59 billion locked in its system. The network supports thousands of apps and projects, and at its center is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which powers smart contracts on the network. However, Vitalik Buterin admitted that the EVM and other system parts have become too complex, making it hard for new developers to build on. The 31-year-old co-founder wants to change that by simplifying the network, starting with a limit on code size and building more transparent coding rules. He aims to make Ethereum easier to use, cheaper to maintain, and as simple and strong as the Bitcoin network. Ethereum changed its core system in 2022 by transitioning from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, known as “The Merge.” Some critics say this move made Ethereum less decentralized, but Buterin disagrees. He believes simplifying Ethereum’s architecture will make it more decentralized by reducing developers’ barriers to entry. He admitted that these changes will take time and effort. Buterin also points out that cultural change within the Ethereum Foundation is needed to make this transformation possible. ETH/BTC Ratio Rebounds After 5-Year Low Ethereum’s value against Bitcoin recently dropped to its lowest point in more than five years. The ETH/BTC ratio hit 0.01766, a level last seen in January 2020. However, it has started to recover and is now at 0.02237. Ethereum’s price also began rising on May 7. According to market data, it is now 11% below its first key resistance level at $2,550, with the next target at $2,745. If the price drops, Ethereum could find support at $1,850. On the bright side, technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest that Ethereum could continue to grow in the short term. Institutions Still Prefer Bitcoin, But Ethereum Has Real-World Use Despite Ethereum’s market gains, U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw massive outflows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin investment products recorded net inflows, reflecting stronger investor confidence. While Bitcoin is seeing widespread adoption and massive market growth, Ethereum continues to dominate in real-world applications. In 2024, world-leading asset manager BlackRock launched a tokenized U.S. Treasury fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum network. T he company recently expanded the tokenized funds to the Solana network. This fund has seen massive success, holding more than $2.5 billion. Remarkably, Ethereum currently supports 74% of all tokenized U.S. Treasuries, with a total of $6.2 billion in this market alone.

APE price analysis shows the market has been bullish despite little activity in the last few days, meaning the bulls are gaining control. This week, it turned bullish and broke above $0.65. The coin is now overbought on the shorter timeframes Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or for settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE.

APE historic price sentiment ApeCoin price HISTORY Yuga Labs founded the ApeDAO in 2022. 62% of the tokens were given to the ApeDAO. 15% to BAYC and MAYC NFT holders, 16% to Yuga Labs, 14% to launch contributors, and 8% to BAYC founders. APE was distributed and began trading on March 17, 2022, at $7.26. The year 2022 closed with APE trading at $3. It remained bearish for the first three quarters of 2023. In October, it had dropped to $1.09. The crypto market sentiment changed in October as institutional interest in electronically traded funds rose. As the global crypto market cap broke above $2 trillion, APE broke above $2. The bull run continued in 2024, pushing APE as high as $2.43. The market started reversing afterward, and by June, it had fallen below $1. It crossed into August trading at $0.71. In September, it rose to $0.87 but later corrected falling to the $0.67 mark in October. After the launch of the Apechain, APE pumped, rising above $1 in November and peaking at $2.17 in early December, after which it started correcting. It crossed into 2025 trading at the $1.20 mark. It then assumed a bear run, and by February, it had fallen below $0.70 and $0.50 in April. It recovered in May, rising above $0.65.",Crypto Price Predictions|APE,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|OTHER|RESEARCH|APE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-11 19:50:00

However, having already grown to be fully functional coins, attention is shifting to two relatively two altcoins, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . As a result this cryptocurrency alongside support from a formidable community and ever-growing chance of wider acceptance will sooner or later ensure that the price of DOGE crosses $1. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is gaining traction among insiders who predict it could deliver explosive 13,500% gains in 2025, far outpacing Ripple’s future prospects. At only $0.025 in its presale phase, the project has raked in more than $7.9 million from more than 9,700 investors. With Phase 5 set to increase price by 20% to $0.03, and a listing price of $0.06, early investors are looking at potential returns of as much as 140%. MUTM is quickly stealing the spotlight, with the 4th phase of presale now over 65% sold out amid strong investor FOMO. Mutuum could reach $8 following the projections. From Underdog to Unmissable, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning Sold well over 60% through for just $0.025 under Phase 4 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $7.9 million from 9,700+ investors. As Phase 5 approaches, the token price will rise to $0.03, providing current participants with a 20% profit. With a launch price of $0.06, Phase 4 investors will earn a 140% ROI at public listing. Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency: Stable, Audited, and Made to Last Mutuum Finance isn’t just innovating, it’s building trust. The platform’s smart contracts are open-source and undergoing rigorous third-party audits. In addition to the native token, a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin is being developed, which circumvents the vulnerabilities of algorithmic stablecoins that have toppled other DeFi initiatives. The stablecoin built on the Ethereum network stands as one of the main features introduced in the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are fundamentals of the ecosystem. Fostering Growth with $100K Giveaway and Gamified Community Tools To turbocharge adoption, Mutuum Finance is actively incentivizing its early adopters. Already underway is a $100,000 giveaway, where ten participants will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Running in tandem are a gamified leaderboard, displaying and rewarding the top 50 token holders, to encourage greater investment and continued participation. This is supported through a referral program, a new level of grassroots expansion in this rapidly growing community. As we look ahead, the market is shifting, and the potential for explosive growth is undeniable. While Ripple (XRP) has had its moment, it’s clear that the future belongs to coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance already boasting a staggering $7.9 million raised from over 9,700 investors, the next big opportunity is here. Don’t miss out, join the growing number of investors recognizing the massive potential of MUTM, a project that could soar to $8 in the near future. Act fast, because as Phase 4 is already over 65% sold out, the clock is ticking, and you don’t want to be left behind.

In a new CNBC interview, the founder and CEO of investment firm DoubleLine Capital says he sees the Fed cutting rates this year, but it won’t be related to the Fed’s dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and an average of 2% annual inflation. “I do think they’ll cut rates, but I don’t think it’s going to be because of much better inflation data because I don’t think it’s going to get much better. I doubt the unemployment rate is going to be a shocker in the near term, like in the next few months. But I do think they’ll cut rates because some liquidity problems may come up. So I do think they’ll probably cut rates by year end, and I still think it’s probably less than the market thinks, but I’m closer to the market now because I’ve stayed at two and the market has gone from five or six down to two and a half [cuts].” According to Gundlach, some institutions are starting to witness liquidity problems. Gundlach uses Harvard’s recent bond sale to show that US-based entities are in need of cash, but says other institutions are having the same issue. “The thing that I feel is starting to get talked about, and I think might be significant in the next market problem is this illiquidity issue that [has] developed and it’s getting some play on the newswires with Harvard and some elite universities where they don’t have any money. They’re asset-rich but they’re cash-poor. Harvard has a $53 billion endowment, and they’ve tapped the bond market now twice for basically operating cash. And the reason is – and I’m just using Harvard as a placeholder because this has been in the news and reported with statistics – they report 40% of their endowment in private equity. I suspect that another big slug is in private credit, which has been a booming asset class. We’re starting to see stories of some of the faster-moving university endowments saying, ‘We might want to exit some of our commitments…’ I think this is going to be an issue.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This comes less than three months after Goldman Sachs acknowledged crypto in its annual shareholder letter for the first time ever. Goldman Sachs Bets On Bitcoin With $1.4B Via IBIT The Wall Street giant now holds 30.8 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), now the largest of the spot ETFs, valued at over $1.4 billion. This marks a 28% increase from its holdings at the start of Q1 2025 and makes Goldman the biggest institutional holder of IBIT. By outpacing other major investors such as Brevan Howard and Jane Street, Goldman positions itself at the forefront of institutional crypto exposure. This comes as the IBIT has enjoyed net inflows over the last 20 trading days, marking the longest winning streak for any spot Bitcoin ETF on the market in 2025. The fund has amassed roughly $5 billion during this period, SoSoValue data shows , outpacing other BTC ETFs in the market. Growing Confidence In BTC Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the disparity between IBIT and other ETFs in an X post earlier this month. “One interesting note also is $IBIT taking in SO much more then the rest of them (altho 10 of them have seen inflows). Usually there’s much more parity tho. Why is this? My theory, return of the HF basis trade and some big fish biting after the decoupling and subsequent rally.” Goldman Sachs also holds 3.5 million shares of Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), the industry’s second-biggest spot BTC ETF by assets under management, worth around $314 million, which were disclosed in February. The seventh-largest investment bank’s increased exposure factored in soaring prices for Bitcoin, with the flagship crypto recently retaking the $100,000 milestone. BTC was changing hands at $104,310 as of publication time, just 4% away from its current lifetime high of $108,786 set on January 20. Goldman’s recent purchase of Bitcoin ETFs underscores the growing trend of institutional crypto adoption on Wall Street, fueled by an increasingly favorable regulatory environment under President Trump.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Goldman Sachs,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-11 20:03:18

(Opinion),https://cryptopotato.com/peter-schiff-says-bitcoin-is-nothing-like-gold-is-that-true-opinion/,"The Euro Pacific Capital founder and chief strategist pointed out that gold rose 3% over the previous weekend from Friday until Monday. Meanwhile, the average BTC price fell by 3%. The investment wizard left it to the reader to conclude that Bitcoin cannot be a digital version of gold. Gold rose over $90 today. That’s a 3% gain from Friday’s close. Over the same time period Bitcoin fell by 3%. How can something that is claimed to be a digital version of gold, trade like the mirror image of gold? Bitcoin may be digital, but it’s got nothing in common with gold. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 5, 2025 But this may be a specious argument. Peter Schiff Doesn’t Give Bitcoin Credit The representatives of Bitcoin in online communities compare it to gold, but by analogy. Nobody but Peter Schiff seems to be confused about whether BTC is some kind of gold certificate or ETF. The analogy to the yellow metal begins in the seminal Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto. Describing how the BTC network creates new supplies of the currency, he wrote on Oct 31, 2008: “The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.” In other words, Bitcoin has a limited supply and any network participant must spend the electricity and computer runtime the BTC app requires in order to produce a new coin. The Digital Gold Thesis Lives On Michael Saylor on Gold vs Fiat vs #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/nzWFgV1BfP — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) March 9, 2025 Later in the comment thread on his original post, Schiff wrote: “Gold is 100% intrinsic value. Bitcoin is 100% faith.” But gold does not have intrinsic value. It has instrumental value as a financial commodity because of the specific properties of its nature and the economy of our planet. The rarity, durability, fungibility, and chemical identifiability of gold make it a financial classic of human civilization. The creator(s) of Bitcoin designed it to instantiate all four of those properties in a free, open, public, borderless, computer network database. As for BTC vs. gold in terms of their performance as financial investments, Bitcoin was built to give its bearers relief from overheated central bank printing presses. Traditionally, folks like Mr. Schiff used gold for that purpose. But Bitcoin hasn’t failed so far to live up to gold’s reputation as a fiat shelter. In fact, it’s done even better than the yellow metal over most time spans relevant to most kinds of investors. The post Peter Schiff Says Bitcoin Is Nothing Like Gold: Is That True?
