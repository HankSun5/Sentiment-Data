Binance Has Just Received A Massive Litecoin Inflow According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large move has been spotted on the Litecoin network during the last 24 hours. The transfer in question involved the shifting of 500,000 LTC across the network. At the time that the chain executed the transaction, this stack was worth around $51.3 million. Given the large scale associated with the move, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for it. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop: $75,500? Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level Whales are the largest of investors on the network, who can carry some degree of influence in the market due to their ability to make large transactions like this latest one. As such, the behavior of these humongous holders can often be worth keeping an eye on, as even if it may not always end up impacting the LTC price, it can still tell us about what the sentiment is like among this important cohort. Generally, though, it can be hard to say for certain what the whales are doing from their transaction activity alone, considering the anonymous nature of the blockchain. Nonetheless, sometimes, one of the wallets involved in the transaction can be connected to a central entity, which can provide room for speculation. The latest Litecoin move is fortunately of this type. Here are the details of the addresses involved in the transfer: As is visible above, the whale made the Litecoin transaction from a few unknown wallets. Such addresses are those that aren’t known to be affiliated with any centralized platform, so they can be assumed to be personal, self-custodial wallets of the investor. The destination of the transaction was a wallet attached to Binance, an exchange. Moves of this type, where coins go from personal addresses to the custody of an exchange, are known as exchange inflows.

As such, exchange inflows can sometimes have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. It’s unknown, though, whether the whale truly intended to sell with the latest exchange inflow or not. In the scenario that the investor did plan for it, then it could spell trouble for Litecoin, considering the scale of the move and the fact that its price has already registered a considerable drawdown during the past week. LTC Price Litecoin has recently plummeted alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency sector, which has brought its price down to $104.

Amid this, Dogecoin (DOGE), the world’s largest and most popular meme coin, is catching the attention of crypto analysts and experts. Experts’ Bullish Views on DOGE Meme Coin Recently, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) with a bold prediction. The expert expressed a bullish outlook, noting that DOGE has maintained its position within an ascending parallel channel. Based on historical price momentum, if the meme coin holds above the $0.16 level, there is still hope that it could reach $2.74 or even $6.24 in the coming days. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1897396450528809329 Current Price Momentum Today, March 6, 2025, the overall crypto market sentiment appears bullish, with major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experiencing impressive gains of 3.25%, 2.80%, and 2.15%, respectively. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action and Upcoming Levels Amid this bullish momentum, DOGE has gained 3.29% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.204. However, despite the ongoing price recovery, the meme coin’s trading volume has dropped by 45%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Source: Trading View Besides all this, Coinpedia’s technical analysis suggests that DOGE appears bullish but is currently facing modest resistance near the $0.205 level. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the meme coin breaches this resistance and closes a daily candle above $0.21, it could soar by 18% to reach $0.245 in the coming days. Besides this bullish outlook, another factor supporting it is the current retest of a crucial support level. During the recent price drop, the meme coin found crucial support at $0.18 and is now moving upward. The daily chart shows that this support level has a history of triggering bullish price reversals.",Price Analysis|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 23:01:49

According to Robinhood, the ETH layer-2 Arbitrum ( ARB ) is now available to be bought, sold, and traded over the trading platform. google336x280] News of the addition sent ARB rallying from a price of $0.374 on March 4th to $0.421 a day later. It has since stabilized and is trading for $0.419 at time of writing, a 14.5% gain during the last 24 hours. ARB joins Robinhood’s suite of crypto products, which includes Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum, Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), popular memecoins such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Pepe ( PEPE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and dozens of others. Last month, it was Robinhood reported that it saw a staggering 8x increase in crypto trading revenue in Q4 of 2024, putting pressure on Coinbase, its competitor and the largest crypto exchange platform in the US. According to the Robinhood’s investment report, the company saw a 200% year-over-year increase in transaction-based revenues, most of which can be attributed to crypto. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its investigation into Robinhood without levying any enforcement actions against the firm. As stated by Dan Gallagher, the Robinhood’s chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, at the time, “We applaud the staff’s decision to close this investigation with no action. Let me be crystal clear – this investigation never should have been opened. Robinhood Crypto always has and will always respect federal securities laws and never allowed transactions in securities. As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed.

""Look at this mining. More and more people are turning to me. If it is profitable for us, let's do it. We have excess electricity. Let them make this cryptocurrency and so on,"" Lukashenko told Alexei Kushnarenko, the nation's new minister of energy, according to Belarusian media outlet Belta . The news comes as the U.S. government is studying the possibility of creating a national strategic crypto reserve that could include cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), ripple (XRP) and cardano (ADA). Lukashenko mentioned the White House's interest in crypto. ""You see the path the world is going. And especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep [a crypto] reserve,"" he said. ""Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves,"" Lukashenko said . Belarus wouldn't be the first nation to mine cryptocurrencies.

Remittix Dominates 2025 Best Crypto Presales,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/can-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-make-the-us-crypto-reserve-remittix-dominates-2025-best-crypto-presales,"The Dogecoin price took an instant 15% jump on Sunday following Trump's announcement a few hours earlier. This quick reaction has fueled reactions to a potential inclusion of Dogecoin in the federal crypto reserve. However, while this reaction was impressive, the Dogecoin price is not the only asset that responded positively to this announcement. So, is the Dogecoin surge simply FOMO from investors? Can Dogecoin and other meme assets like Shiba Inu join the US crypto reserve? There are hundreds of questions about the Trump announcements, but let's keep it to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu with this article. However, if you're looking for a top investment choice this year, the Remittix presale offers an option you can take advantage of. But first, let's talk about DOGE and SHIB in the crypto reserve. What Does The Dogecoin Price Brief Response Mean In The Long-Term Projection? Dogecoin remains one of the top choices when talking about the crypto meme coin market. The market cap continues to keep it at the top as the largest meme coin in the world with a cap of about $29B, standing more than a distant second, Shiba Inu. However, many factors have been acting against the Dogecoin price since the beginning of the year, with the sudden influx of new meme coins being a significant concern. This has caused a sudden shift of attention to newer meme coins with options to make a new favorite out of the hundreds of new meme coins that joined in January. The Dogecoin price downtrend in the last few weeks has caused panic, which has made many investors liquidate their positions. However, the recent surge, although brief, has fueled what looks like a return to optimism. While speculations abound about the possibility of Dogecoin joining the crypto reserve as a meme coin option, this is not immediate. The recent surge could only lead to further selling. Where Is Shiba Inu's Place In The Future Of Meme Coins? To briefly touch on Shiba Inu, its addition to the crypto reserve looks highly unlikely. This is because, unlike Dogecoin, which got most of its influence from the contribution of key figures like Elon Musk, Shiba Inu does not have such a strong backing. However, although the Shiba Inu coin is the number two meme coin in the world, recent additions like the Trump coin have posed a big risk to its influence. Hence, adding a second meme coin to the crypto reserve might not help the Shiba Inu coin. With the recent news of a 99% drop in shibarium trading activity, the sun might already be setting on Shiba Inu's dominance. Here Is Why Remittix Could Be The Primary Talk In Crypto This Year Undeniably, the crypto market is already making its way into mainstream finance. Countries such as El Salvador, Japan, and the US are already taking a strong position with cryptocurrency, and it is only a matter of time before it becomes a global currency. However, solutions around its payment integration and remittance are still in their early phases. The Remittix approach to crypto payment allows users to freely send money to different corners of the world, which is delivered directly into the receiver's account. This solution takes the best parts of the traditional banking system, creating ease with FIAT, and mixes them with the decentralization and security of the blockchain. The word in town is that Remittix is the future of crypto payment, as it delivers payment faster and at a lower fee. The ongoing Remittix token presale has become the center of all discussions this year, with over 5x in returns over the last few weeks. But there is more to come with this new token , as experts believe the launch could even bring more growth of over 50x this year, breaking all presale records. Now is a good time to take advantage of this new token, which is still in an ongoing presale round. Check the links below for information on how to buy.

Spotlight on Chainlink (LINK) and Litecoin (LTC) as potential risers. This article dives into insights from experts. Are these coins set for a bullish trend? Readers will discover whether these digital assets are primed for significant growth and what factors could drive their success. Chainlink's Price Journey: Short-Term Dips and Long-Term Growth Chainlink saw a sharp decline of 26.89% over the last month, marking recent market volatility. Over the past six months, however, it surged 49.04%, showing strong long-term growth. The performance changes signal fluctuating investor sentiment and shifting market dynamics. Price trends have adjusted significantly over different durations. Currently, Chainlink trades between 10.20 and 22.70 dollars. Resistance appears near 30.59 dollars and higher at 43.10 dollars, while support holds around 5.58 dollars. Market signals hint at a slight bearish tilt with momentum indicators below neutral. Traders can explore buying opportunities near support levels or await a breakout above resistance for short-term plays. Litecoin Market Pulse: Short-term Dip Amid Strong Long-Term Rally Last month saw Litecoin fall by nearly 6%, alongside a weekly drop exceeding 10%. Despite this short-term weakness, the coin's performance over the past six months reveals a remarkable 55% gain, highlighting a strong long-term recovery. This contrast between immediate declines and extended resilience suggests that the overall upward trend remains intact, even as recent fluctuations create challenges for short-term traders. Currently, Litecoin trades between $92.68 and $151.78, with key resistance at $175.54 and a higher barrier at $234.65. The nearest support stands at $57.33. Bears currently dominate the market with negative momentum and oscillator readings. However, the RSI at 38.20 indicates a possibility for a bounce. Traders may want to monitor these levels for potential signs of a reversal or further breakdown. Conclusion Experts believe that LINK and LTC show potential for growth this month. Both coins have unique features that make them attractive to investors. LINK benefits from its role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data. LTC offers faster transaction times and lower fees. Market conditions and investor interest will play crucial roles in their performance. Watching key indicators can provide insights into their future movements. High trading volumes and positive market sentiments could drive prices up. Overall, LINK and LTC may experience significant activity and potential price increases this month. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg , this omission indicates that crypto is not a personal priority for Trump. “If it was a personal priority, then it would have been in the speech,” Seiberg wrote in a note on Wednesday. Trump sidelines crypto in speech, signaling political strategy or low priority The exclusion particularly stood out since Trump had referenced crypto in prior speeches and on social media just days before the Congress address, according to Seiberg. He views the exclusion as “more substantive” than Trump’s silence on other topics like housing and banking, given that the president does have a crypto strategy. Seiberg highlighted a political rationale for Trump’s omission of crypto in the speech, noting that congressional Republicans seek Democratic support for stablecoin legislation in the coming months. Trump’s involvement could complicate that effort. However, he also proposed a more nuanced reason — Trump does not view crypto as a central issue in his broader political agenda. “Trump talks up crypto when he is before crypto investors. Yet we continue to believe this is not a personal priority,” Seiberg said. Generally, Trump’s speech was “long on showmanship and short on substance for even a Donald Trump address,” according to Seiberg. “As many commentators noted last night, the address more resembled a campaign rally speech than a State of the Union speech.” The White House is set to hold its first Crypto Summit on Friday, led by Trump’s crypto czar, David Sacks. Industry leaders such as Michael Saylor and Brian Armstrong are expected to attend, with reports suggesting the event may reveal details about a U.S. crypto reserve. Crypto prices rally after Trump backs five coins for ‘Crypto reserve The president’s address, spanning a record 99 minutes, served as a defiant sales pitch for the policies Trump championed during his campaign and doubled down on in his first weeks back in office. He vowed to continue enacting sweeping changes to rescue the nation from what he described as his predecessor’s destruction and missteps. Throughout the speech, he rarely addressed the American people directly, who are grappling with recent upheavals, while repeatedly taking jabs at the Democratic lawmakers seated before him. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the Democratic response after Trump’s speech, said, “America wants change, but there’s a responsible way to make change and a reckless way, and we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy.” Though Trump did not mention cryptocurrency in his Congressional speech on Tuesday night, he recently revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he says he’d like to be included in a new strategic reserve to make the US “the Crypto Capital of the World. “ The market prices of the five coins he named – Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano – swiftly jumped after the announcement. During Trump’s presidential campaign, he aggressively courted the crypto community. The previous US president, Joe Biden, had overseen a crypto crackdown due to fraud and money laundering concerns.

Speaking in parliament on the 4th of March, she noted that the regulation of cryptocurrency is complicated due to its anonymous features and is advantageous to criminals. “Our advice to the public is to stay away from cryptocurrencies. The risk of getting burned is high, and if you become a victim of a scam, the chances of getting any of your money back are slim,” said Sun Xueling. Singaporeans suffered 1.1 billion yuan losses from scams last year, 70% more than in the same period last year. Such frauds included those involving cryptocurrency and contributed to a quarter of the losses incurred. With the increased use of cryptocurrencies, criminals are now using it to compel victims to withdraw their money into digital money so that it can hardly be traced. Cybercriminals and phishing attacks have also led to the loss of money from users’ digital wallets. Though the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates local crypto operations under the Payment Services Act, most exchanges and wallets are outside its jurisdiction. Sun remarked that even professional investors have fallen to the tricks of these fraudsters. Calls for tougher fraud penalties The question as to whether penalties for fraud should be more severe was also discussed. Jurong GRC MP Dr Tan Yew Meng opined that Singapore has overly lenient laws at present. While moneylenders who handle $10,000 worth of illicit money face caning, fraudsters who steal much larger sums can go scot-free. He even advocated for compulsory caning in cases where the fraud offence is considered severe. His statements demonstrate a rising concern that regulators have voiced in recent years about the rising number of crypto scams. Sun reported that at present, the government is examining the legislative measures against fraud and increasing some of the offences that can attract caning. She mentioned that more than 80% of the victims of the scam willingly transferred the money to the fraudster through impersonation, pretence of authority or fake promises of financial gains. To reduce this threat, the Singapore government has recently passed the Anti-Fraud Protection Bill. The law, however, allows authorities to block the assets of such victims in case they do not heed the threats. It is anticipated that this should be implemented this year. However, to date, there has not been a policy amendment with regard to some of these concerns. But it should be noted that according to local media reports, new regulations might be introduced soon. However, despite the fraud cases, cryptocurrency use is rising in Singapore. Singapore’s central bank doubled the number of licenses in the market in 2024 to improve stability.

Qubetics ($TICS) aims to do just that, offering solutions to real-world problems that previous platforms have struggled to address. Its innovative features and practical applications position it as a strong contender for those seeking the best crypto for quick profit.​ Meanwhile, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) has introduced the ASI-1 Mini, a Web3-native large language model designed to support complex agentic workflows. This development opens new avenues for the Web3 community to invest in, train, and own advanced AI models. In this article, we will delve into how Qubetics ($TICS) addresses real-life challenges unmet by its predecessors, positioning itself to meet the future demands of blockchain and digital finance.​ Qubetics: Pioneering Practical Blockchain Solutions Qubetics is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to tackle real-world issues through its comprehensive ecosystem. One of its standout features is the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which simplifies blockchain development for businesses, professionals, and individuals. This user-friendly platform enables seamless creation of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and other blockchain-based solutions.​ The QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for those looking to develop blockchain solutions without extensive coding knowledge. It offers a drag-and-drop interface, pre-built templates, and real-time testing environments, making blockchain development accessible to a broader audience. For instance, a small business can create a supply chain management system using QubeQode, ensuring transparency and efficiency without the need for a dedicated development team. Similarly, artists can tokenize their work, creating unique digital assets and opening new revenue streams. These practical applications demonstrate how Qubetics is poised to become the best crypto for quick profit.​ Qubetics is in its 24th crypto presale stage, having raised over $14.6 million from more than 22,200 token holders, with over 495 Million $TICS tokens sold. The current price per $TICS token is $0.0976, with projections suggesting a potential increase to $0.25 by the end of the presale. This growth trajectory indicates a significant return on investment for early participants, further solidifying Qubetics’ position as a top choice for those seeking quick profits in the crypto market. ​ If you invest $1,000 in $TICS at its current price of $0.0976 per token, you would receive approximately 10,245 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, your investment will grow to $2,561, yielding a 156% ROI. Should the price hit $1 after the presale, your holdings would be worth $10,240, reflecting a 924% ROI. If $TICS surges to $5, your investment would skyrocket to $51,200, achieving a 5,019% ROI. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance: Merging AI and Blockchain The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) represents a collaboration between leading blockchain-AI projects: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. This alliance aims to advance decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and, ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The recent introduction of the ASI-1 Mini, a Web3-native large language model, marks a significant milestone in this endeavor.​ The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token has faced a challenging market environment, with reports labeling it among the worst-performing altcoins of the year. Previously known as Fetch.ai (FET), ASI had shown an 8% gain as of mid-February, trading at $0.755, but recent trends indicate a decline. On the technology front, the introduction of ASI-1 Mini has provided Web3 users with new opportunities to invest in and train advanced AI models. Meanwhile, industry leaders such as Sam Altman continue to explore the potential of artificial superintelligence to surpass human capabilities across multiple domains, further shaping discussions around its future. SUI: Navigating Market Volatility SUI has recently experienced significant market fluctuations. Over the past 24 hours, its price plummeted by approximately 21%, reaching around $2.34. This sharp decline aligns with a broader market downturn, with the CoinDesk 20 Index down by 3.9%. Additionally, SUI has seen outflows exceeding $600 million from its ecosystem, contributing to a 17% price drop. Technical analyses suggest potential further declines, possibly towards the $1 mark, if key support levels fail.​ SUI unlocked approximately 40.63 million tokens, accounting for 1.28% of its current circulation and valued at around $117 million. Such token unlocks can increase supply and exert downward pressure on prices. Despite recent challenges, some analysts remain optimistic. Predictions suggest that SUI could reach a $10 billion market cap, driven by institutional adoption and ecosystem expansion. However, these forecasts are speculative and subject to market conditions. Participants are advised to exercise caution, monitor market trends, and consider both technical analyses and fundamental developments when evaluating SUI’s potential.​ Conclusion: Seizing Opportunities in Emerging Cryptos Qubetics stands out as a promising platform addressing real-world challenges with practical blockchain solutions. Its innovative features, such as the QubeQode IDE, make it accessible to a wide range of users, from businesses to individual creators. The ongoing presale and projected growth present a compelling opportunity for those seeking the best crypto for quick profit .

Speaking at an American Bar Association event in Miami today, SEC acting enforcement director Antonia Apps and CFTC enforcement director Brian Young noted that enforcement will remain a priority even amid broader policy changes. “You can expect to see some changes depending on priorities and different policies that we may pursue,” Apps said, “but we will move forward with the core enforcement agenda that we have always moved forward with.” The statements come at a time when both regulatory agencies are undergoing significant transformations under Republican leadership. Since late January, the SEC has been reviewing its cryptocurrency enforcement policies, while the CFTC has been restructuring its enforcement division. Related News: Analytics Company Shares 7 ""Most Negative"" Altcoins According to Funding Rates The comments were made at a government enforcement conference focused on white-collar crime, where Justice Department officials reportedly withdrew from speaking because of ongoing changes and turmoil within the Justice Department. Both Apps and Young voiced strong support for enforcement personnel, who are facing mass layoffs and budget cuts as the administration, along with special adviser Elon Musk, seeks to reshape the federal workforce. “In addition to doing a great job, the CFTC enforcement staff are genuinely good people,” Young said. “I think the taxpayers should be indebted to them for what they do for us every day.” Young also noted that the agency prioritizes cases that have a strong likelihood of returning funds to victims of fraud or market manipulation. One of the most notable policy changes came at the SEC, which has paused or dropped active litigation and investigations related to cryptocurrencies. When asked about the future of crypto enforcement, Apps reiterated that the agency will continue to pursue cases involving fraud and clear regulatory jurisdiction. “We're not walking away,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The ministry said the National Welfare Fund (NWF)’s level of liquid funds should be topped up to reach a level equivalent to 7-10% of Russia’s GDP before Moscow considers buying “riskier” assets like crypto. Russian Crypto Reserve: Could Moscow Start Buying BTC? Per the Russian media outlets Interfax and RBC , the claims came from the Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev, who claimed that the ministry “is not currently considering” buying or holding crypto in the NWF “due to its high volatility.” Vladimir Kolychev, the Russian Deputy Finance Minister. (Source: Katerina Vorontsova/YouTube/Screenshot) When questioned on the matter, Kolychev said that the ministry would “not” make changes in the structure of the NWF’s investments. He said that the fund would continue to focus exclusively on gold and Chinese yuan holdings. Media outlets say that 60% of the fund is made up of yuan, with the remaining 40% in gold reserves. Gold bars embossed with a stamp that reads “Russia.” (Source: Kapital Strany/YouTube/Screenshot) However, Kolychev said it would be “possible to consider riskier assets” when the NWF reaches Moscow’s 7%-10% target. “When we get there, we will be able to think about different assets, including crypto. However, for now, the volatility signs are not favorable.” Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev Kolychev added that Russia is still “far” from reaching its desired levels of reserves. And that is why Moscow will only countenance buying gold and yuan reserves for the time being. We Need Liquidity, Says Deputy Finance Chief The Deputy Finance Minister said the fund’s assets “must be liquid and not subject to sharp revaluations.” He added: “When we sell our reserves, the sales should not result in us receiving 50 kopeks for each ruble we invested, instead of a ruble for each ruble’s worth of our assets.” The comments come just months after Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told university students who asked him about creating a Russian crypto reserve that the Treasury needed to “earn less, but keep its powder dry.” Trump pivots to the war in Ukraine and his talks with Russia. Trump says he has gotten “strong signals” from Russia that Moscow is ready for peace. “Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” Trump asks. Latest updates: https://t.co/vDJlBJzZHe pic.twitter.com/kVlCxo25W9 — Bloomberg (@business) March 5, 2025 Central Bank’s Final Say Kolychev concluded by saying that he was not party to any “discussions about creating a cryptocurrency reserve in Russia” similar to Washington’s own strategic crypto reserve fund. He claimed that final decisions on such matters would be taken by the Russian Central Bank. As previously reported, the Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina is a known crypto-skeptic . Nabiullina has tried on multiple occasions to orchestrate a total, China-style ban on crypto in Russia.

A recent post by cryptocurrency researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) emphasized how this system was implemented to eliminate uncertainty about XRP’s future supply and prevent concerns over centralized control. The discussion, accompanied by a highlighted excerpt from Ripple’s 2017 announcement, has reignited conversations about how XRP’s escrow functions and its broader implications. “Ripple’s Escrow Safeguards XRP’s Price” Ripple’s escrow system was designed to eliminate uncertainty about XRP’s future supply. By locking up a significant portion of XRP, Ripple ensured the market wouldn’t be concerned about centralized control over its distribution. … pic.twitter.com/5fk9ZjQjkG — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) March 3, 2025 The Purpose of Ripple’s Escrow According to Ripple’s 2017 statement, the company locked 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow system, releasing a maximum of 1 billion XRP per month over 55 months. As Ripple stated, the purpose, was “to remove uncertainty around XRP’s future supply” and ensure that a large quantity would not enter the market at once, preventing drastic price fluctuations. This strategy was designed to establish predictability in XRP’s distribution and counter fears of market oversupply. XRP Allocation from Escrow SMQKE’s post reiterated that the primary use of released XRP is “to incentivize market makers for XRP-based currency exchanges and for sales to institutional investors—not retail.” This aligns with Ripple’s original announcement, which stated that XRP would facilitate liquidity by offering “tighter spreads between currency pairs” and would also be sold to institutional investors. Unused XRP at the end of each month is returned to escrow, extending the timeline for its eventual release. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The post directly counters claims that Ripple’s escrow is a means to dump XRP on retail investors. SMQKE argued that if Ripple were indiscriminately “dumping” XRP from escrow, its price would be significantly lower. The structured and controlled release mechanism prevents sudden supply shocks that could negatively impact XRP’s market performance. Speculation on XRP’s Role in Broader Economic Strategy An X user, Wolfemother, commented on the post, speculating on a potential future use case for Ripple’s escrowed XRP . They proposed that it could be utilized as part of a “government’s strategic crypto reserve,” suggesting that the total escrowed XRP—amounting to 37 billion—could reach a value of $1,000 per XRP, equating to $37 trillion, roughly aligning with the U.S. national debt. While speculative, such theories reflect ongoing discussions about the long-term implications of Ripple’s escrow model and whether XRP could help global financial structures. As discussions continue, the system remains a key component of XRP’s market structure, negating the claims of indiscriminate token sales while also fueling broader speculation about its role in the financial ecosystem.

As 2025 unfolds, selecting the right assets could make a significant difference in building a profitable portfolio. While established tokens maintain their dominance, newer projects are introducing compelling solutions that could shape the future of blockchain technology. This guide highlights some of the most promising cryptos for 2025. Each has been analyzed based on recent developments, current performance, and long-term growth potential. From decentralized e-commerce platforms to blockchain protocols advancing decentralization, these are the projects to keep an eye on. 1. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is revolutionizing online shopping by creating a direct marketplace between buyers and sellers using blockchain technology. By removing intermediaries, the platform reduces transaction costs and enhances user privacy. Its presale has gained significant attention, with the 3BAY token currently priced at $0.00524 in its 5th stage, raising over $1.54 million. Analysts anticipate a launch price of $0.1959, potentially offering early investors a 4,200% return. The roadmap for 2025 outlines several key milestones, including full decentralization by Q4 and the introduction of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to involve the community in decision-making. Plans to integrate PayPal and other payment systems are also in motion. With its blend of practical application and strong demand, Web3Bay presents an opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential in the crypto market. 2. Near Protocol: Advancing Blockchain Accessibility Near Protocol (NEAR) continues to innovate, becoming the first non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain to integrate with MetaMask. This connection, facilitated through the NEAR Snap feature, enables seamless account creation and transactions within MetaMask, making blockchain interactions more user-friendly. Currently trading at $3.29 after a slight 2.37% decline, Near Protocol remains focused on scalability and ease of use. With growing adoption in decentralized applications (dApps) and enhanced interoperability, NEAR has the potential to solidify its place among the most promising projects for 2025. 3. Pi Coin: A Community-Powered Ecosystem Pi Coin (PI) has gained attention for its mobile-first mining approach, allowing users to participate in blockchain activities through their smartphones. With a community of over 35 million, Pi Network has generated widespread discussion, particularly following recent speculation about a possible Binance listing. In a community vote on Binance Square, 86.2% of participants supported the listing of PI, although Binance has stated that this is not yet confirmed. Despite its strong user base, potential investors should be mindful of ongoing concerns regarding the project’s legitimacy. Chinese authorities have issued warnings about possible risks related to data privacy. Those considering Pi Coin should thoroughly research before making investment decisions. 4. Hyperliquid: Innovating Decentralized Trading Hyperliquid (HYPE) is gaining traction in decentralized finance (DeFi) with its perpetual trading platform. Recent upgrades include AI-driven trading tools and zero-slippage order execution, improving efficiency and user experience. Over the past month, HYPE has risen by 23%, fueled by increasing trading volumes and platform enhancements. To further strengthen its position, the Hyperliquid Foundation is addressing transparency concerns regarding validator operations. With advanced trading features and a focus on improving accessibility, Hyperliquid is well-positioned for continued growth in 2025. 5. Chainlink: Leading Cross-Chain Data Integration Chainlink (LINK) remains a key player in the blockchain ecosystem, offering critical services for connecting smart contracts with real-world data. Its oracles facilitate seamless data transfers, supporting numerous decentralized applications. Recent updates have focused on expanding staking options and increasing institutional adoption. Although LINK’s price has seen an 18% drop, now sitting at $16.43, its fundamental technology remains strong. With continued developments and integrations, Chainlink presents a viable option for those seeking stability and innovation in their crypto portfolio. Final Thoughts Choosing the right cryptocurrencies involves weighing potential growth against associated risks. Web3Bay offers a fresh approach to e-commerce, while Near Protocol’s technological improvements make blockchain interactions more accessible. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s trading advancements and Chainlink’s role in data connectivity highlight the broad range of opportunities available. Investors should stay informed and track emerging trends to make strategic decisions. Whether looking for high-growth opportunities or established stability, these projects represent some of the most promising options for 2025.

Plus, Insights on DOGE Price Rally & ADA Price Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/achievement-unlocked-inter-milan-boosts-blockdags-presale-to-200m-plus-insights-on-doge-price-rally-ada-price-surge/,"The crypto market is delivering a new kind of excitement, and traders are all in. The Dogecoin price rally is causing a stir on the charts, while the latest Cardano (ADA) price surge is fueling discussions about whether it will break through key resistance. Also, the buzz about ETF approvals and mainstream interest keeps expectations high for both currencies. BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves on social media, partly due to its collaboration with Inter Milan, which has proven to be a catalyst for its presale success. The initiative has amassed over $200 million, selling 18.7 billion coins. BlockDAG’s social media presence has swelled to about 226,000 followers, positioning it as today’s top bullish crypto. Dogecoin Price Rally Gains Momentum Amid ETF Speculation DOGE has reached $0.2793 as the Dogecoin price rally draws more eyes, with its trading volume up by 38.41% at $2.34 billion. Analysts predict that surpassing the 0.618 Fibonacci level might send Dogecoin to a possible high of $2.30. A significant driver of the Dogecoin price rally is the short squeeze that wiped out over 28 million DOGE from short positions, causing a sharp price increase. The SEC’s nod to Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF proposal also boosts the sentiment. Analysts suggest this might open doors for broader market participation, potentially stabilizing DOGE in the long run. Cardano (ADA) Price Surge Encounters Resistance at $0.98 The Cardano (ADA) price surge has injected optimism among ADA supporters, with analysts suggesting it could hit $1.35 if it overcomes existing barriers. Currently, ADA is priced around $0.7719, with a slight 3% dip over the past day but showing promise for a recovery. A strong upward Cardano (ADA) price surge could emerge if ADA can rise above $0.9837, seen by analysts as a crucial milestone. If this is achieved, ADA could potentially climb to $1.16 and further to $1.35. The growing interest from the market has seen ADA attract $4.4 million in the past month while Bitcoin and Ethereum faced significant withdrawals. The anticipation of a Cardano ETF continues to bolster ADA’s longer-term prospects. BlockDAG’s Partnership with Inter Milan Catalyzes Presale Success BlockDAG is swiftly gaining attention in the cryptocurrency sphere, greatly aided by its partnership with Inter Milan . This collaboration is not merely about brand visibility; it’s about introducing BlockDAG to millions of soccer enthusiasts, effectively narrowing the divide between cryptocurrency and popular culture. This increased visibility is enhancing BlockDAG’s credibility and accelerating its presale activities. BlockDAG’s success is evident in the numbers, with the presale amassing a staggering $200 million and distributing over 18.7 billion coins. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, early participants have reaped a 2,380% ROI—a commendable achievement for a project still in the presale stage. This partnership has also significantly expanded BlockDAG’s social media presence, with notable increases across platforms like Telegram (71.7K), X (108.1K), Discord (20.7K), and Instagram (25.4K). Analysts are optimistic that this increased exposure will hasten the growth of BlockDAG’s ecosystem and cement its future prospects. The combination of widespread visibility and robust community engagement distinguishes BlockDAG as it continues to grow its network. Some analysts even suggest that the presale might eventually exceed $600 million due to the soaring demand for BlockDAG. Both retail and more organized interest are on the rise, indicating that BlockDAG is more than just another coin; it’s becoming a significant movement. Final Say The cryptocurrency market is ripe with new possibilities, with Dogecoin’s price rally and the anticipation of an ETF driving sustained trader interest, while Cardano’s price surge and increased attention are fueling discussions on ADA’s potential to overcome significant resistance levels. Amidst this, BlockDAG is carving out a notable niche for itself with the help of its Inter Milan partnership, which is greatly advancing its crypto presale and bolstering its social media footprint. Having already secured over $200 million, BlockDAG is reinforcing its status as a top bullish crypto. The community is keenly watching their BDAG holdings appreciate as the project captures the attention of a growing audience.

41209217,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=687702,1741219246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41209217.jpeg,Trump advisers start mapping out a plan for a national crypto reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-advisers-start-mapping-out-a-plan-for-a-national-crypto-reserve/,"President Donald Trump’s administration has officially started executing plans for its federal crypto strategic reserve, and step one is figuring out exactly how much crypto the US government already owns, according to a report from the Journal. A month into a six-month planning phase, Trump’s interagency working group is reportedly doing a full audit of existing crypto holdings, which include assets seized from criminals. Trump first floated the idea of a government-backed crypto stockpile last summer during his campaign, and in January, he signed an executive order to begin laying the foundation. Bo Hines, executive director of the working group, confirmed the process was underway, saying , “The first thing we have to do is get an accounting of what the government has. We’ll provide more insight as that continues.” Trump is expected to give a speech about the initiative on Friday at a White House industry summit, where more details will probably come. White House team counts up government-owned crypto The Justice Department and US Marshals Service oversee billions of dollars in confiscated Bitcoin and other crypto assets, mostly taken from criminals. According to the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, $18 billion worth of Bitcoin is sitting in government-controlled wallets, though accounting issues have made it unclear how much is actually secured. As part of the new plan, officials are now tallying up these holdings to determine whether they will become part of the official crypto reserve. What’s still unclear is whether the administration will also buy new crypto for the reserve. If they do, Congress might need to approve large acquisitions. There’s also the question of who exactly will oversee the stockpile—whether the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, or a newly created agency. Right now, no federal entity is set up to manage a crypto reserve of this scale. Trump’s push for a government crypto reserve has divided analysts and investors alike. Supporters say it could legitimize digital assets and integrate them into the country’s financial system. Crypto advocates have poured millions into Trump’s campaign and inauguration in efforts to make the reserve a reality. But critics argue that crypto isn’t comparable to gold or oil, which are two assets commonly stockpiled by governments. Gene Hoffman, CEO of blockchain firm Chia Network, doesn’t think the US should be making these calls yet. “The United States government shouldn’t be making this call yet,” he said . Others warn that the extreme volatility of crypto could turn a government reserve into a financial disaster if prices crash. Timothy Massad, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, believes Trump’s plan could be more about paying back campaign supporters than actual financial strategy. “It concerns me that it is a payback for their support of Trump and the Republican Party,” Massad said. Meanwhile, Bitcoin momentarily surged 10% after Trump’s announcement, proving just how much influence he has over the market. Financial advisers in the UK and US are reporting a spike in clients asking about crypto investments. Why people are concerned about Trump’s crypto plans One of the biggest issues with a government-controlled crypto reserve is security. Crypto is a prime target for hackers, and federal agencies haven’t always been great at keeping track of what they already have. The US Marshals Service has struggled to manage seized crypto, and with $18 billion in Bitcoin alone, the potential for mismanagement is quite high. Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital warned that security needs to be a top priority. He recommended keeping assets stored in cold wallets with private keys only accessible under strict controls. “There will need to be some careful consideration about how the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are held and how they are held securely,” McCauley said. Cryptos are difficult to safeguard because they are targeted by sophisticated hackers, putting a premium on cybersecurity measures for crypto exchanges and custodians that hold assets. Bybit, one of the world’s biggest exchanges, recently saw the hacker group Lazarus stole over $1.4 billion in Ethereum from its cold wallets. “Criminals have stolen tokens worth $1.5 billion from the crypto exchange Bybit, prompting a rush of customers demanding their funds back,” Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said. He compared it to the final chaotic hours of FTX, where mass withdrawals led to a complete collapse. “Although Bybit claims to be stable, the developments evoke memories of the chaotic final hours of the now-defunct FTX exchange.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

More and more people are approaching me. If it’s profitable for us, let’s do it. We have excess electricity. Let them produce this cryptocurrency and so on,” Lukashenko told Alexei Kushnarenko, Belarus’s newly appointed energy minister, as reported by local media outlet Belta. Belarus considers crypto mining amid rising global interest in digital reserves This President of Belarus suggestion emerges as the U.S. government is studying the possibility of creating a national strategic crypto reserve that could include assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Lukashenko acknowledged the White House’s growing interest in digital assets, stating, “You see the direction the world is taking, especially the largest economy. They announced yesterday that they will maintain a crypto reserve.” “Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves,” Lukashenko said . Belarus wouldn’t be the first nation to mine digital assets. The Kingdom of Bhutan, with its abundance of hydropower, already has more than 100 megawatts (MW) of operational bitcoin mining infrastructure and is set to get another 500MW worth of power online. The country currently holds $950 million in Bitcoin, according to Arkham Intelligence. El Salvador on the other hand uses geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin, though in smaller quantities. Trump pushes crypto strategy forward with first-ever summit Even with the Trump administration’s promises and enthusiasm, the industry has been left disappointed by meme coin scandals and a lack of concrete government action—aside from the dismissal of a few SEC cases and the release of a somewhat ambiguous Executive Order on January 23. That disappointment, however, just got a temporary lift. Two days ago, the White House announced it would hold its first-ever crypto summit this Friday, chaired by White House A.I. & Crypto Czar David Sacks and overseen by Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reports that the roundtable, scheduled from 6:30 pm to 10:30 pm UTC, is expected to include more than 25 participants, including members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets. As of Wednesday morning, Terrett reported that 11 crypto executives and two White House representatives had confirmed their attendance. However, it seems Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson is not invited to the Summit on Friday, according to a White House source familiar with the guest list. In fact, neither Hoskinson nor any representatives for Cardano have been invited to meet with the president since the inauguration. Many in the community had also taken X posts from Hoskinson in February to mean he would attend a fundraising dinner for pro-crypto PAC MAGA Inc. this past Saturday. As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, excitement is building within the crypto community. This marks progress toward the Executive Order’s goals of bolstering U.S. leadership in digital assets and financial technology while safeguarding economic freedom. However, for a president who closely ties stock market performance to his success, the summit’s announcement alone likely fell short. That may explain why Trump took it a step further, unveiling the first five tokens set to be included in a future crypto reserve: Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, Ripple, and Solana. Trump’s social media posts offer little additional detail on the planned “reserve,” as he referred to it in his Sunday posts. However, the choice of the word “reserve” appears to signal a shift from the administration’s stance in January’s Executive Order. The term “reserve” suggests that the government will proactively purchase more assets. In contrast, the intention stated in January’s executive order to “evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile” would be more about holding onto the $19.1 billion in crypto, 97.9% of which is in Bitcoin, that it already has from seizures across dozens of tokens.

Describing this disparity as “value asymmetry,” the report points out that Solana’s DeFi sector is growing faster and generating more revenue than Ethereum’s, but its tokens remain relatively undervalued. “Solana DeFi valuation multiples are trading lower than their Ethereum counterparts on average despite their significantly higher growth profiles, highlighting a distinct valuation asymmetry,” the report said. Franklin Templeton conducted an analysis comparing five leading Ethereum-based DeFi projects (LDO, AAVE, ENA, MKR, and UNI) to five of Solana’s top-performing protocols (JTO, JUP, KMNO, MNDE, and RAY). The findings showed that Solana projects experienced a staggering 2,400% median growth in fees year-over-year and a median valuation multiple of 9x. In contrast, Ethereum projects saw a more modest growth of 150% and a multiple of 18x. Related News: Analytics Company Shares 7 ""Most Negative"" Altcoins According to Funding Rates This valuation disparity follows a period of rapid expansion for Solana. The network’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have witnessed a surge in trading activity, led primarily by memecoin investors. In January 2025, Solana’s DEXs recorded higher trading volumes than the entire Ethereum ecosystem combined. “DeFi may be entering an era of Solana Virtual Machine dominance, moving away from the historical reign of EVM-based DeFi,” the report said. However, Franklin Templeton clarified that this does not indicate Ethereum’s decline. Instead, the firm noted that the increased activity on Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solutions indicates the strategic evolution of the network. “The shift of activity to layer-2 blockchains is evidence that the Ethereum scaling approach is advancing incrementally,” the report said. Despite the current undervaluation of Solana-based DeFi assets, Franklin Templeton predicted that this disparity may not last forever. “As Solana continues to demonstrate its resilience as a decentralized computing platform, the market may soon price blue-chip, cornerstone Solana DeFi protocols in line with comparable Ethereum protocols,” the report concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Needless to say, the Pepe coin’s speculative mania might not be over despite a downturn of over 35% in the last 30 days. However, Rollblock’s presale is changing the GambleFi sector, raising over $10.8 million in a move that makes RBLK a compelling alternative to speculative meme coins. Analysts already forecast a 100x uptick on launch for RBLK. Pepe’s market performance and risks PEPE’s meme coin hype has persisted since its launch, as the coin surged from a market cap of about $517 million to above $11 billion. Those who bought into Pepe even as early as January 2024 have managed to accumulate a 10x gain. However, past performance is never a guarantee of future results in the world of meme coins. Pepe coin’s recent dips have sparked a wave of uncertainty among holders. Traders who once saw Pepe coin as an easy path to quick profits are starting to exit their positions.

Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, boldly claims a looming debt crisis and calls it a “potential heart attack.” In a statement, Dalio argued that once we reach a point in the cycle where one borrows more money to service debt and bond holders say that it’s risky, it becomes a “debt debt spiral.” Dalio compares the current debt crisis to a heart attack waiting to happen if authorities fail to provide interventions. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Won’t Stop At $150K’ This Year, Research Firm Chief Says Understanding The Current US Debt Issue Dalio’s insights on the current economic landscape and the country’s looming debt crisis come as the crypto market cap drops to $2.76 trillion in one day. During the market shakeoff this week, the overall crypto market cap dropped by 8%, with Ethereum and Bitcoin leading the losers with 11% and 8%, respectively. The US is currently facing a growing debt and excessive budget deficits. According to recent data, the country’s national debt is now $33.6 trillion, with a massive deficit of $1.7 trillion in 2023, equal to 5.8% of the total GDP. Researchers are also warning about the increasing cost of servicing the debt, hitting $879 billion in 2023, comparable to the size of the country’s budget for national defense. Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences. pic.twitter.com/MbBpHO76mN — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) February 6, 2018 Dalio Says Alternative Stores Of Value Can Help In an interview on the Odds Lots podcast, Dalio offered insights on how the general public responds to an economic crisis. He mentioned that in times of economic uncertainties, many investors are looking at alternative stores of value. Dalio asks: What’s an alternative to money with a stable supply? He mentioned the growing role of Bitcoin and digital assets as leverage against inflation. “Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences.” he added. Dalio’s insights followed US President Trump’s announcement on the proposed US strategic reserve, which includes top coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, and Cardano. Trump’s statement was followed by a spike in crypto prices, with Bitcoin surging to over $90k after revisiting $80k. While Bitcoin’s price surged for the day, its dominance dipped from 55.4% to 50%, reflecting the shift in capital to altcoins. Historically, a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance catalyzes an altcoin run, which now excites many on social media. Is Bitcoin The Answer? Although Ray Dalio didn’t categorically mention Bitcoin as the “potential savior”, his recent statements suggest a favorable view on the premier digital asset. Due to its decentralization, Dalio highlighted the asset’s potential as a hedge against economic uncertainties.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,000 followers on the social media platform X that the XRP against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC) pair is flashing a bearish divergence on the weekly chart. Traders keep a close eye on coins flashing a bearish divergence as the signal suggests the token is losing bullish momentum and may be ready to enter a downtrend. Bluntz also notes that XRP appears to be in the midst of an ABC correction against the US dollar. “Looks increasingly like that was a complacency shoulder B wave on XRP in my opinion. If BTC and SOL taught me anything the last month, do not fade the weekly bear divs.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that an asset tends to go through an ABC pullback after completing a five-wave rally. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will fall to the $1 area to complete the ABC correction. At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.46. In January, when BTC was trading above $100,000, Bluntz said that Bitcoin appears to have completed a five-wave rally and that a market top may be in. He later updated his outlook and said that Bitcoin was flashing a bearish divergence on the monthly timeframe. Last month, he told his followers that SOL looked weak after losing the $220 level while showing a bearish divergence on the two-week chart. At time of writing, BTC is trading for $87,421 and SOL is worth $144.78.

The Federal Reserve just dropped its latest Beige Book , and it’s painting a picture of the U.S. economy that’s… well, let’s just say it’s not a blockbuster, but it’s far from a horror show. Think of it as a modest sequel – not as thrilling as the original, but still holding its own. Let’s dive into what this economic snapshot means, especially for those of us keeping a close eye on the crypto markets. Decoding the Fed Beige Book: A Glimpse into Economic Growth The Fed’s Beige Book , a report published eight times a year, offers a qualitative assessment of current economic conditions across the twelve Federal Reserve districts. Think of it as economic tea leaves, gathered from anecdotal evidence from businesses, community leaders, and other contacts. This latest edition, covering the period since mid-January, reveals a recurring theme: modest economic growth . But what does ‘modest’ really mean in the grand scheme of things, and more importantly, how does it impact our crypto world? Here’s a quick rundown of the key takeaways: Slight Expansion: Most districts reported slight or modest growth, suggesting the economy is still inching forward, albeit not at a breakneck pace. Consumer Spending Dip: Perhaps the most concerning note is the decline in consumer spending in several districts. This is a crucial indicator as consumer spending fuels a significant portion of the US economy. Manufacturing Gains: On a brighter note, manufacturing showed modest gains in some areas, hinting at pockets of resilience within the industrial sector. Job Growth Slowdown: Job growth was described as slow across the board, and wage increases are easing. This could be interpreted as a cooling labor market, which has implications for inflation. Price Pressures Persist: Prices continued to rise across districts. Interestingly, some firms are finding it difficult to pass on increased costs to consumers, while others are preemptively raising prices anticipating tariffs. In essence, the Beige Book paints a picture of an economy in a state of cautious equilibrium – growing, but with headwinds and uncertainties. Wu Blockchain, a prominent voice on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted the nuanced outlook, noting that despite policy and tariff concerns, regional outlooks remain cautiously optimistic. This cautious optimism is a key thread running through the report. The Consumer Spending Conundrum: What Does it Mean for Crypto? The dip in consumer spending is arguably the most significant detail for crypto enthusiasts. Why? Because consumer sentiment and spending power are intertwined with investment appetite, including investments in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. If consumers are tightening their belts, it could signal a shift away from discretionary spending and investments. Here’s the breakdown of why declining consumer spending matters: Reduced Liquidity: Less spending can translate to less disposable income available for investments, including crypto. Risk Aversion: Economic uncertainty often leads to risk aversion. Consumers might prefer to hold onto cash or invest in safer assets rather than volatile cryptocurrencies. Broader Economic Slowdown: Declining consumer spending can be a leading indicator of a broader economic slowdown, which can negatively impact all markets, including crypto. However, it’s crucial to remember that the Beige Book is a snapshot in time and reflects anecdotal evidence. It’s not a definitive forecast. Furthermore, the crypto market operates on global dynamics, and while US consumer spending is important, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Navigating Inflation and the Economic Outlook Inflation remains a persistent concern, as prices continue to rise across regions, according to the Beige Book. The report highlights a mixed bag when it comes to businesses passing on costs. Some are struggling, indicating potential pressure on profit margins, while others are preemptively hiking prices due to anticipated tariffs. This inflationary environment has significant implications for the economic outlook and, by extension, the crypto market. Here’s how inflation and the broader economic outlook are connected to crypto: Inflation Hedge Narrative: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often touted as an inflation hedge. In inflationary times, investors might turn to crypto as a store of value, potentially driving up demand and prices. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Central banks’ responses to inflation, particularly interest rate hikes, can impact crypto markets. Higher interest rates can make traditional investments more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Economic Uncertainty: Inflation adds to economic uncertainty. While some investors might see crypto as a safe haven during uncertainty, others might reduce risk exposure across the board. The Beige Book’s mention of cautious optimism despite these inflationary pressures suggests a belief that the economy can navigate these challenges. However, the path forward remains uncertain, and vigilance is key. Job Growth and Manufacturing Gains: Glimmers of Hope? While the Beige Book notes slow job growth and easing wage increases, the modest manufacturing gains offer a sliver of positivity. Manufacturing is a foundational sector, and any growth, however modest, can be seen as a positive sign for overall economic health. Furthermore, a cooling labor market, while concerning for job seekers, could be seen as a positive development in the fight against inflation, as it may reduce wage-price pressures. How do these factors play into the crypto narrative? Manufacturing as an Indicator: Manufacturing health can be a barometer for broader economic activity. Continued modest gains could signal underlying economic resilience, which is generally positive for all markets, including crypto. Labor Market Dynamics: A cooling labor market and easing wage pressures could influence the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. If inflation shows signs of easing, the Fed might become less hawkish, which could be beneficial for risk assets like crypto. Overall Economic Sentiment: These mixed signals – slow job growth but manufacturing gains – contribute to the overall cautious optimism reflected in the Beige Book. This sentiment, while not overtly bullish, suggests a degree of stability that can be reassuring for investors. Actionable Insights and Crypto Market Strategy So, what can we glean from the Fed’s Beige Book for our crypto strategies? Monitor Consumer Spending Data: Keep a close eye on upcoming consumer spending data releases. A continued decline could signal a more significant economic slowdown and potentially impact crypto markets. Track Inflation Metrics: Inflation remains a key driver of market sentiment. Monitor inflation reports and central bank responses closely. Stay Informed on Fed Policy: The Fed’s monetary policy decisions will heavily influence the economic outlook and market conditions. Pay attention to Fed speeches and announcements. Diversification is Key: In times of economic uncertainty, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto or any other asset class. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is volatile and operates in cycles. Focus on long-term fundamentals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term economic reports. Conclusion: Navigating the Modest Growth Landscape The Fed’s Beige Book offers a nuanced, if somewhat underwhelming, snapshot of the US economy. Economic growth is happening, but it’s modest. Consumer spending is a concern, while manufacturing gains offer a glimmer of hope. Inflation persists, and the overall economic outlook is cautiously optimistic. For the crypto market, this report underscores the ongoing economic uncertainties and the need for a balanced and informed investment approach.

41211692,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137360,1741223997,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Bitwise Files Aptos ETF Application with SEC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-aptos-etf-sec-filing/,"Get ready for a potential game-changer in the crypto investment world! U.S. asset management giant Bitwise has just thrown its hat into the ring, submitting a crucial S-1 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Aptos (APT) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This exciting development signals a growing appetite for diverse crypto investment products and could pave the way for wider adoption of Aptos within traditional financial markets. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast or potential investor? Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking news. What is an Aptos ETF and Why is it Significant? Before we get too deep, let’s break down the basics. An Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF, is essentially a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. Think of it as a basket holding various assets – in this case, the assets would be related to Aptos. A spot Aptos ETF , if approved, would directly hold APT tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Aptos without directly purchasing and managing the cryptocurrency themselves. This is a huge deal for several reasons: Accessibility for Retail Investors: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This means everyday investors who might find navigating crypto exchanges daunting can invest in Aptos through a familiar and regulated financial product. Increased Institutional Adoption: Institutional investors, such as pension funds and large investment firms, are often restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies. An Aptos ETF provides a compliant and regulated pathway for these institutions to allocate capital to the Aptos ecosystem, potentially driving significant inflows. Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: The approval of an Aptos ETF by the SEC would be a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It signals that regulatory bodies are becoming more comfortable with digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. Diversification Opportunities: For investors already involved in crypto, an Aptos ETF offers a convenient way to diversify their portfolios beyond established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In essence, an Aptos ETF acts as a bridge, connecting the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency with the established infrastructure of traditional finance. It simplifies access, broadens participation, and potentially injects substantial capital into the Aptos network. Bitwise ETF Application: A Closer Look at the Filing So, who is Bitwise, and why is their Bitwise ETF application noteworthy? Bitwise Asset Management is a well-established player in the crypto investment space, known for its expertise in digital asset funds. They manage a range of crypto-focused investment products and have been actively involved in advocating for and launching crypto ETFs. Here’s what we know about their recent filing: S-1 Filing: Bitwise submitted an S-1 form to the SEC. This is the initial registration statement required for new securities, including ETFs, to be offered to the public. It’s a crucial first step in the ETF approval process. Delaware Entity Registration: Prior to the SEC filing, Bitwise registered the ETF entity in Delaware. This is a common practice for financial entities due to Delaware’s favorable corporate laws. Spot ETF: Based on the information available, it is expected to be a spot Bitwise ETF , meaning it will hold actual APT tokens. This is different from futures-based ETFs, which derive their value from futures contracts and not the underlying asset itself. Track Record: Bitwise has a history of launching innovative crypto investment products. Their experience and credibility within the crypto space lend weight to their Bitwise ETF application. While the filing is a positive sign, it’s important to remember that it’s just the beginning of a potentially lengthy review process by the SEC. The SEC will meticulously examine various aspects of the application, including market surveillance, custody arrangements, and investor protection measures. Navigating the SEC Filing Process for Crypto ETFs: What are the Hurdles? The path to SEC approval for a crypto ETF , especially one holding a cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, is not without its challenges. The SEC has been cautious in approving spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto market. Here are some key hurdles that Bitwise and their Aptos ETF application will likely face: Challenge Description Potential Bitwise Approach Market Surveillance Concerns The SEC wants assurance that the underlying Aptos market is robust and resistant to manipulation. Bitwise will need to demonstrate strong surveillance mechanisms in the APT trading markets and potentially partner with exchanges that have robust compliance programs. Custody of Assets Secure and regulated custody of APT tokens is paramount. The SEC needs to be convinced that investor assets are safe. Bitwise will likely utilize qualified custodians that meet SEC standards for digital asset custody. Valuation and Liquidity Accurate and transparent valuation of APT and sufficient liquidity in the market are essential for ETF operations. Bitwise will need to demonstrate reliable pricing sources and sufficient market depth for APT trading. Investor Protection The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection. They will scrutinize the ETF structure and disclosures to ensure investors are adequately informed about the risks involved. Bitwise will need to provide clear and comprehensive disclosures about the risks associated with investing in an APT ETF and Aptos itself. Despite these hurdles, the fact that Bitwise, a reputable asset manager, is pursuing an Aptos ETF suggests growing confidence in the maturation of the crypto market and increasing regulatory acceptance. The recent approvals of Bitcoin spot ETFs may also set a precedent and potentially ease the path for subsequent crypto ETF applications. The Broader Crypto ETF Landscape: Expanding Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum The potential approval of an Aptos ETF would mark a significant expansion of the crypto ETF landscape beyond the established giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Currently, the majority of approved crypto ETFs focus on these two cryptocurrencies. An APT ETF would represent a move towards greater diversification within the crypto ETF space, offering investors exposure to a wider range of digital assets. This expansion is crucial for the continued growth and evolution of the crypto market. It indicates a broadening interest in and understanding of different blockchain ecosystems and their potential. Furthermore, it could pave the way for ETFs based on other promising layer-1 blockchains and emerging crypto sectors. The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has demonstrated significant investor demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. If the Bitwise ETF application is successful, it could signal the beginning of a new wave of crypto ETF offerings, bringing even more diverse crypto assets into the traditional financial system. Investing in APT ETF: Opportunities and Considerations for Investors For investors considering an APT ETF , it’s essential to weigh both the potential opportunities and the inherent risks. Here’s a breakdown to help you make informed decisions: Opportunities: Exposure to Aptos Ecosystem: Investing in an APT ETF provides direct exposure to the Aptos blockchain, a relatively new layer-1 blockchain known for its scalability and innovative technology. Aptos aims to address some of the limitations of earlier blockchains and has the potential for significant growth. Simplified Investment: As mentioned earlier, ETFs simplify the investment process. You can gain exposure to Aptos without needing to understand crypto wallets, private keys, or crypto exchanges. Potential for Growth: If Aptos continues to develop and gain adoption, the value of the APT ETF could appreciate significantly. The crypto market is known for its volatility and high-growth potential. Portfolio Diversification: Adding an APT ETF to your portfolio can enhance diversification, especially if you are already invested in traditional assets or other cryptocurrencies. Considerations: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Aptos, are inherently volatile. The price of APT can fluctuate significantly, and the APT ETF will reflect these price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the value of Aptos and the ETF. Aptos Specific Risks: Aptos is a relatively new blockchain. It faces competition from other blockchains, and its long-term success is not guaranteed. Technical issues or slower-than-expected adoption could impact its value. ETF Fees and Expenses: ETFs typically have expense ratios, which are fees charged to manage the fund. These fees will reduce your overall returns. Actionable Insight: If you are interested in gaining exposure to Aptos and are comfortable with the risks associated with crypto investments, an APT ETF , once approved, could be a convenient and accessible option. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research on Aptos, understand the risks involved, and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance before investing. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Aptos and Crypto ETFs Bitwise’s filing for an Aptos ETF is undoubtedly a significant development for both the Aptos ecosystem and the broader crypto ETF market. It signals growing institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies and a potential expansion of regulated crypto investment products. While SEC approval is not guaranteed and the process may take time, this move represents a hopeful step towards greater mainstream acceptance and accessibility of Aptos and other innovative blockchain technologies.

41211720,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137361,1741224076,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pivotal Showdown: How Tether & Circle Battle Will Shape the Cryptocurrency Future of Stablecoins,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-circle-stablecoins-crypto-future/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with discussions about stablecoins, and for good reason. These digital assets, designed to maintain a stable value, are seen by many as a crucial bridge between the volatile crypto market and traditional finance. But who will control the future of this burgeoning sector? According to a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report, the answer might hinge on the intense competition between the two giants of the stablecoin realm: Tether and Circle. This isn’t just a corporate rivalry; it’s a battle that could redefine the very fabric of the crypto landscape. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating power struggle and understand what it means for the future of digital finance. The Titans Clash: Tether vs. Circle and the Fate of Stablecoins The WSJ report shines a spotlight on the contrasting approaches of Tether and Circle, emphasizing that their ongoing competition is the key determinant of the cryptocurrency future of stablecoins. These two companies, while both issuing stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, operate under fundamentally different philosophies and strategies. Understanding these differences is crucial to grasping the stakes of this competition. Tether (USDT): Often seen as the elder statesman of stablecoins, Tether has prioritized decentralization and operating outside the traditional financial system. It has historically faced scrutiny over its reserves and transparency but remains the most widely used stablecoin in the market. Circle (USDC): In contrast, Circle has embraced regulatory compliance and aims to integrate stablecoins within the existing financial framework. USDC is known for its greater transparency and is often favored by institutions seeking a compliant digital dollar. This divergence in approach sets the stage for a high-stakes showdown. The WSJ suggests that the victor in this competition will not only dominate the stablecoin market but also dictate the direction in which the entire sector evolves. Will it be a future where stablecoins operate largely outside of traditional regulatory control, or will they become integrated into the established financial system? The answer, it seems, lies in the fortunes of Tether and Circle. Decoding the Different Paths: Tether’s Decentralized Vision vs. Circle’s Regulatory Embrace To truly understand the significance of this battle, we need to dissect the contrasting strategies employed by Tether and Circle. These aren’t just different business models; they represent fundamentally different visions for the role of stablecoins in the global financial ecosystem. Tether: Championing Decentralization and Autonomy Tether’s approach can be characterized by a commitment to the original ethos of cryptocurrency: decentralization and operating outside the purview of traditional financial institutions. Here’s a closer look at their strategy: Decentralized Operations: Tether has historically operated with less regulatory oversight compared to Circle. This has allowed them to cater to a global market, including regions with less stringent financial regulations. Market Dominance: Being the first mover in the stablecoin space, Tether has built a massive network effect. USDT enjoys widespread adoption across exchanges and DeFi platforms, making it the most liquid and widely traded stablecoin. Focus on Crypto-Native Users: Tether’s appeal is strong among users who prioritize decentralization and are wary of centralized financial systems. Its presence is deeply entrenched in the core crypto trading and investment landscape. However, this decentralized approach has come with its own set of challenges, primarily concerning transparency and regulatory scrutiny. Concerns about the backing of USDT and its reserves have been persistent, leading to ongoing debates and legal challenges. Circle: Paving the Way for Regulatory Compliance and Institutional Adoption Circle, on the other hand, has chosen a path of regulatory compliance and integration with the traditional financial system. This strategy is geared towards building trust with regulators and attracting institutional investors. Let’s examine Circle’s key tenets: Regulatory Compliance: Circle has actively sought regulatory approvals and operates under a more transparent framework. USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, enhancing its credibility in the eyes of traditional finance players. Institutional Focus: USDC is positioned as a stablecoin suitable for institutional adoption. Its transparency and regulatory compliance make it attractive to institutions seeking to enter the crypto space while adhering to established financial norms. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Circle aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By being compliant and transparent, USDC can facilitate smoother integration of stablecoins into existing financial infrastructure. Circle’s strategy, while appealing to regulators and institutions, might be perceived as less aligned with the original decentralized ideals of cryptocurrency by some in the crypto community. However, it positions USDC for mainstream adoption and potentially wider acceptance within the global financial system. The Regulatory Tightrope: How Crypto Regulation Could Tip the Scales The WSJ report rightly points out that crypto regulation will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of this stablecoin showdown. Regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on the crypto space, and stablecoins, due to their potential systemic importance, are squarely in their sights. Here’s how regulatory actions could impact Tether and Circle: Regulatory Crackdown on Tether: If regulators successfully clamp down on Tether, demanding greater transparency and stricter compliance, it could significantly impact USDT’s market position. Increased regulatory pressure could erode trust in USDT, potentially leading to a shift towards more compliant alternatives like USDC. Regulatory Tailwinds for Circle: Conversely, stricter regulations could inadvertently benefit Circle. USDC’s proactive approach to compliance positions it favorably in a more regulated environment. Increased regulatory scrutiny on competitors could make USDC a safer and more appealing option for users and institutions alike. Global Regulatory Landscape: The consistency and coordination of global crypto regulation will be crucial. Differing regulations across jurisdictions could create arbitrage opportunities and complexities for stablecoin issuers. A globally harmonized regulatory framework could provide clarity and stability to the stablecoin market. The regulatory landscape is still evolving, making it difficult to predict the exact direction. However, it’s clear that regulatory actions will be a major determinant in shaping the future of stablecoins and the competitive dynamics between Tether and Circle. What’s at Stake? The Broader Implications of the Tether-Circle Battle The competition between Tether and Circle transcends mere market share rivalry. It’s a battle for the soul of stablecoins and, to some extent, the future direction of the cryptocurrency ecosystem itself. The outcome will have significant implications for various stakeholders: For Cryptocurrency Users: The availability and characteristics of stablecoins directly impact crypto users. The dominance of either Tether or Circle could influence transaction costs, accessibility, and the overall user experience within the crypto space. For DeFi Ecosystem: Stablecoins are the lifeblood of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The stability and reliability of these assets are paramount for the continued growth and functionality of DeFi protocols. The regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) surrounding stablecoins can significantly impact DeFi innovation. For Traditional Finance: The integration of stablecoins into traditional finance could revolutionize payments, remittances, and cross-border transactions. However, regulatory acceptance and interoperability with existing financial infrastructure are crucial for this integration to materialize. For the Future of Money: Stablecoins are being viewed by some as a potential form of digital currency that could challenge traditional fiat currencies. The regulatory approach and the success of either decentralized or compliant stablecoin models could influence the future evolution of money itself. The WSJ’s assertion that the outcome of the Tether-Circle competition will shape the future of stablecoins is not an exaggeration. This is a pivotal moment for the crypto industry, and the choices made by regulators, companies, and users will collectively determine the trajectory of this vital sector. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape So, what does all of this mean for you? Whether you’re a crypto investor, a DeFi enthusiast, or simply curious about the future of finance, understanding the dynamics of the stablecoins market is increasingly important. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed about Regulatory Developments: Keep a close watch on regulatory announcements and policy changes related to stablecoins in your jurisdiction and globally. Regulatory shifts can have a significant impact on the value and utility of different stablecoins. Diversify Your Stablecoin Holdings: Consider diversifying your stablecoin holdings across different issuers, including both centralized and potentially decentralized options (while being mindful of risks). This can mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions or issuer-specific issues. Understand the Risk Profiles: Educate yourself about the reserve composition, transparency, and regulatory compliance of different stablecoins. Understand the risk profiles associated with each stablecoin before using or investing in them. Engage with the Crypto Community: Participate in discussions and forums within the crypto community to stay abreast of the latest developments and perspectives on stablecoins and their future. Conclusion: A Stablecoin Showdown with Far-Reaching Consequences The WSJ report paints a clear picture: the future of stablecoins is inextricably linked to the ongoing competition between Tether and Circle. This isn’t just a business rivalry; it’s a battle between two fundamentally different visions for the role of digital currencies in the world. Whether regulators succeed in curbing Tether’s influence, paving the way for Circle’s compliant model, or whether Tether manages to navigate the regulatory storm and maintain its dominance, the outcome will have profound implications. It will shape not only the stablecoin market but also the broader cryptocurrency future , influencing the balance between decentralization and regulation in the digital finance era.

Imagine a tool that not only predicts your revenue but also leverages the power of AI to enhance sales strategies. That’s precisely what revenue prediction startup Gong offers, and their latest milestone is turning heads. Revenue Prediction Startup Gong’s Monumental $300M ARR Milestone Gong, a pioneering revenue prediction startup , has just announced a staggering achievement: surpassing $300 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR). This news, unveiled on Wednesday, signals robust growth and positions Gong as a significant player in the SaaS landscape. Founded in 2016, Gong has carved a niche by using AI to analyze customer interactions, providing invaluable insights for businesses aiming to optimize their sales processes. This remarkable ARR figure isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to Gong’s innovative approach and the increasing demand for sophisticated revenue prediction tools in today’s competitive market. CEO Amit Bendov, in a statement to Bitcoin World, expressed enthusiasm about the company’s momentum, stating, “We’re seeing great momentum. That’s why we’re excited to share the numbers.” This surge in ARR is partially attributed to the integration of generative AI capabilities in recent years, further enhancing Gong’s ability to provide accurate and actionable revenue predictions . AI-Powered Growth Engine Fuels Gong’s Ascent Since its inception, Gong has been at the forefront of leveraging AI to transform how businesses understand and predict their revenue streams. Here’s how AI has become Gong’s secret weapon: Analyzing Customer Interactions: Gong’s core technology revolves around using AI to analyze vast amounts of customer interaction data. This includes everything from sales calls and emails to video conferences, providing a 360-degree view of the sales process. Generative AI Boost: The recent incorporation of generative AI has amplified Gong’s capabilities. This advanced AI allows for even deeper insights and more nuanced revenue predictions , helping companies anticipate market changes and adjust strategies proactively. Predictive Analytics: By identifying patterns and trends within customer interactions, Gong’s AI algorithms offer highly accurate revenue predictions . This enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales funnels, and improve overall revenue generation. The fusion of AI with sales intelligence is not just a trend; it’s a fundamental shift in how businesses approach revenue management. Gong is leading this charge, empowering companies to move from reactive sales strategies to proactive, data-informed approaches. Gong’s Valuation and Market Standing: Is it IPO Ready? Gong’s financial trajectory is as impressive as its technological innovation. Valued at a hefty $7.25 billion during its $250 million Series E funding round in 2021, led by Franklin Templeton, Gong is now being closely watched for its next move. Let’s break down the valuation context: Valuation Metrics: With a $7.25 billion valuation and $300M ARR, Gong’s valuation currently stands at approximately 24 times ARR. This places it alongside major AI companies, indicating strong investor confidence and market perception. Market Comparison: While 24x ARR is significant, it’s essential to compare it with other high-growth AI startups . For instance, Anysphere, known for its AI -powered coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at 25 times ARR, showcasing the premium the market places on cutting-edge AI ventures. Growth Trajectory: Although CEO Bendov remained tight-lipped about specific revenue growth figures, he indicated that Gong’s growth is within the “top-quartile public SaaS companies” range, suggesting an annual growth rate between 25% and 56%. This positions Gong as a high-growth company justifying its valuation and attracting further investment interest. Considering these factors, the question naturally arises: Is Gong gearing up for an IPO ? The $300M ARR milestone certainly fuels such speculation, placing Gong firmly on the IPO radar. IPO Speculation and Future Pathways for Gong The impressive ARR and growth trajectory naturally lead to discussions about a potential IPO for Gong. While CEO Amit Bendov acknowledges that going public is an important milestone, he tempered immediate expectations, stating that an IPO is not planned for 2025. Here’s a look at Gong’s potential future paths: IPO on the Horizon? : While not imminent, an IPO remains a likely long-term goal for Gong. Surpassing $300M ARR is a key indicator of IPO readiness, and as Gong continues to scale, the public markets could offer significant capital and visibility. Financial Strength: Bendov highlighted Gong’s strong financial position, noting that the company is nearly profitable and has barely touched the capital raised in its 2021 Series E round. This financial stability gives Gong flexibility in its strategic decisions, whether to pursue an IPO or consider further private funding rounds. Customer Base: With 4,500 corporate customers, including industry giants like Google, LinkedIn, and Square, Gong has established a robust and diverse client base. This broad adoption underscores the value proposition of Gong’s revenue prediction platform and its potential for continued market penetration. For now, Gong seems focused on sustained growth and further innovation in the AI -driven revenue prediction space. Whether through an IPO or continued private growth, Gong’s future looks exceptionally bright. Conclusion: Gong – A Rising Star in the AI and SaaS Universe Gong’s ascent to $300M ARR is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful validation of the transformative potential of AI in reshaping business operations. As a revenue prediction startup , Gong is not only redefining sales strategies but also setting new benchmarks for growth and innovation in the SaaS industry. The company’s journey from a nascent startup in 2016 to a potential IPO contender is a compelling narrative of vision, execution, and the strategic application of AI .

It’s not just about market caps and price predictions; it’s also about who’s dominating the crypto conversation. Santiment, the renowned on-chain analytics platform, just dropped some fascinating insights. They’ve dived deep into the digital chatter across Reddit, X, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and BitcoinTalk to unveil the definitive list of the top crypto founders everyone’s talking about. Let’s explore who made the cut and why these figures are constantly in the spotlight. Santiment Unveils Top Crypto Figures by Mentions Santiment’s recent analysis isn’t just a popularity contest; it’s a gauge of influence and impact within the crypto space. By meticulously tracking mentions across diverse social platforms, Santiment provides a unique perspective on which cryptocurrency leaders are shaping narratives and capturing public attention. This data is invaluable for understanding market sentiment and identifying key figures driving the industry’s evolution. Here’s the countdown of the top 10 most mentioned crypto founders , according to Santiment’s comprehensive analysis: Satoshi Nakamoto: The Enigmatic Pioneer Topping the list is the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Even after years of mystery surrounding their true identity, Satoshi remains the most talked-about figure. Why? Because Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency they birthed, is the foundation upon which the entire industry is built. The anonymity itself adds to the intrigue, constantly fueling speculation and discussion. Satoshi’s creation sparked a revolution, and their legacy continues to dominate conversations. Do Kwon: The Fallen Titan From groundbreaking innovator to facing legal battles, Do Kwon’s journey is a cautionary tale. As the co-founder of Terra (LUNA) and UST, Kwon was once celebrated. However, the dramatic collapse of his algorithmic stablecoin project in 2022 sent shockwaves through the market, causing billions in losses. Currently on trial in the U.S., Kwon’s story is a stark reminder of the risks inherent in crypto and the intense scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency leaders . His high mention count is unfortunately tied to the Terra debacle, making him a figure of intense discussion and debate. Vitalik Buterin: The Visionary Architect of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of EthereumIn stark contrast to Kwon’s recent notoriety, Vitalik Buterin earns his place for positive contributions and ongoing influence. As the co-founder of Ethereum, Buterin is revered for introducing smart contracts, the technology that powers decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi. His visionary approach and continuous involvement in Ethereum’s development keep him at the forefront of crypto discussions. Buterin is not just a founder; he’s a thought leader constantly pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Justin Sun: The Marketing Maestro of Tron Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, is known for his aggressive marketing strategies and headline-grabbing moves. His infamous multi-million dollar lunch with Warren Buffett showcased his flair for publicity. Whether you love him or critique his tactics, Sun’s ability to generate buzz and keep Tron in the conversation is undeniable. His high mentions reflect his active presence and often controversial but effective marketing approach. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): The Disgraced Exchange King Similar to Do Kwon, Sam Bankman-Fried’s mentions are linked to a significant market event – the collapse of FTX. Once hailed as a crypto prodigy, SBF’s empire crumbled amidst allegations of fraud. The FTX saga is a major talking point in crypto, raising crucial questions about regulation, transparency, and trust. SBF’s downfall is a stark example of the high stakes and intense scrutiny within the crypto mentions landscape. Roger Ver: Bitcoin Jesus and Bitcoin Cash Advocate Roger Ver, nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus,” is a polarizing figure. As an early Bitcoin investor, he was instrumental in its early adoption. However, he later became a staunch supporter of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), leading to significant debates within the Bitcoin community. Ver’s outspoken opinions and long history in crypto ensure he remains a frequently mentioned personality, particularly in discussions about Bitcoin’s scaling and philosophy. Ryoshi: The Vanished Visionary of Shiba Inu The founder of Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ryoshi, mirrors Satoshi’s anonymity but with a different twist. Ryoshi launched the meme coin sensation and then mysteriously disappeared, adding to the mythos of Shiba Inu. This enigmatic departure has only fueled speculation and discussion within the SHIB community and the broader crypto world. Ryoshi’s absence is as much a part of the Shiba Inu story as the coin itself, contributing to their persistent mentions. Charles Hoskinson: The Cardano Architect and Ethereum Co-founder Charles Hoskinson brings a blend of technical expertise and academic rigor to the crypto space. As a co-founder of Ethereum and the creator of Cardano (ADA), Hoskinson is respected for his methodical approach to blockchain development and his focus on peer-reviewed research. His active engagement in the Cardano community and his thought-provoking commentary on the industry keep him relevant in ongoing crypto conversations. Charlie Lee: The Pragmatic Creator of Litecoin Charlie Lee, the developer of Litecoin (LTC), positioned his cryptocurrency as a practical alternative to Bitcoin – “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” Litecoin’s focus on faster transaction times and lower fees has ensured its longevity and continued relevance. Lee’s pragmatic approach and consistent presence in the crypto space contribute to his regular mentions, especially in discussions about Bitcoin alternatives and payment solutions. Changpeng Zhao (CZ): The Binance Titan Turned Educator Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, is synonymous with Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange he founded and led to dominance. After stepping down as CEO due to regulatory issues in the U.S., CZ has transitioned to focusing on Web3 education. His journey from building a crypto empire to navigating regulatory challenges and now promoting education makes him a compelling figure. CZ’s past leadership at Binance and his current focus on education ensure he remains a prominent voice in the crypto mentions landscape. Why Do Crypto Mentions Matter? Understanding which cryptocurrency leaders are being discussed and why offers several key benefits: Sentiment Analysis: High mention counts, especially when analyzed with sentiment data, can indicate market trends and shifts in public perception towards specific projects or figures. Influence Tracking: It helps identify who the key influencers are in the crypto space, allowing for a better understanding of information dissemination and narrative shaping. Risk Assessment: Spikes in mentions, particularly negative ones, can signal potential risks or controversies associated with certain individuals or projects, as seen with Do Kwon and SBF. Community Engagement: Tracking mentions can provide insights into community focus and interests, helping projects and platforms understand what topics are resonating with their audience. Challenges in Analyzing Crypto Mentions While valuable, analyzing crypto mentions also presents challenges: Data Overload: The sheer volume of online conversations can be overwhelming, requiring sophisticated tools like Santiment’s to filter and analyze effectively. Noise and Misinformation: Social media is rife with noise, bots, and misinformation, which can skew the data and make it challenging to extract genuine insights. Context is Key: Mentions alone don’t tell the whole story. Understanding the context behind the mentions – whether positive, negative, or neutral – is crucial for accurate interpretation. Platform Fragmentation: Crypto conversations are spread across numerous platforms, requiring comprehensive data aggregation to get a holistic view. Actionable Insights from Santiment’s Analysis Santiment’s analysis of top crypto figures provides actionable insights for various stakeholders: For Investors: Stay informed about which figures are influencing market sentiment and project narratives. Monitor mentions alongside other on-chain metrics for a more comprehensive investment strategy. For Project Teams: Understand who the influential voices are in your space and track how your project and leaders are being discussed. Use this data to refine your communication and engagement strategies. For Media and Analysts: Identify key figures and trending topics to focus your reporting and analysis. Use mention data to support your narratives and provide data-backed insights. Conclusion: The Enduring Influence of Crypto Founders Santiment’s analysis underscores the enduring influence of crypto founders in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. From the enigmatic Satoshi to the visionary Vitalik and the controversial figures like Do Kwon and SBF, these individuals and their stories continue to drive conversations and influence market perceptions.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-is-designed-to-underpin-us-dollar-usd-heres-why/,"A recent tweet from Digital Perspective has sparked discussion regarding the potential role of XRP in maintaining the U.S. dollar’s dominance as the world’s reserve currency. The tweet suggests that “XRP was designed to underpin the USD dollar to ensure its dominance as the World Reserve Currency for the next 150 years.” XRP was designed to underpin the USDollar to ensure its dominance as the World Reserve Currency for the next 150 years. Ripple is playing chess while everyone else out here is playing checkers on a Maxi board. This isn`t about chasing green candles.This is about protecting the… pic.twitter.com/dR6soENyPf — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) March 4, 2025 This assertion presents an intriguing perspective on the evolving financial landscape and the role digital assets could play in global monetary policy. The Role of XRP in the Global Economy The claim that XRP was designed to support the U.S. dollar’s global standing is significant. While there is no official confirmation that XRP was specifically created for this purpose, its technological capabilities and liquidity advantages make it a candidate for high-level financial applications. XRP’s ability to facilitate near-instant, low-cost cross-border transactions has already positioned it as a useful tool for financial institutions. The tweet further suggests that “Ripple is playing chess while everyone else out here is playing checkers on a Maxi board.” This statement implies that Ripple’s long-term strategy involves global financial infrastructure, rather than focusing solely on short-term market movements. While some cryptocurrency communities concentrate on price speculation, Digital Perspective argues that the real significance of XRP lies in its potential role in economic stability and monetary policy. The Argument for a Basket of Assets In the video attached to the tweet, Digital Perspective discusses the concept of a diversified reserve backing for the U.S. dollar. The speaker states, “This is why I love the idea of a basket of assets, right? And I do mean like gold, oil, and digital assets alike.” This idea aligns with historical discussions about strengthening the dollar by tying it to tangible and digital reserves rather than relying solely on government policies or agreements such as the petrodollar system. The speaker recalls a 2019 conversation with Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the potential benefits of backing the dollar with multiple assets. He suggests that “if you could underpin the dollar with all of those things, instead of just an agreement to print more or just a petrodollar agreement, then you really would have the confidence of a dollar for the next 150 years.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 National Security and Economic Strategy A response to the tweet by X user JohnMWagner brings a geopolitical dimension to the discussion. He argues that “if folks would just re-premise the existence of utility-driven crypto, and not be blinded by gaslighting and tribalism, they would have a clearer perspective on all things being national security first.” Their statement suggests that digital assets, including XRP , should be viewed through national economic security rather than mere financial speculation. The comment also suggests that policymakers are methodically shaping a new financial framework incorporating digital assets into the existing system. The idea that the U.S. is undergoing a systematic restructuring aligns with ongoing regulatory discussions about digital currencies and their role in the global economy. Digital Perspective’s tweet and the subsequent discussion raise important questions about the future of the U.S. dollar and the role of digital assets like XRP. While there is no official confirmation that XRP was designed to support the dollar’s global dominance, its capabilities make it a viable component of a broader financial strategy.

If you’ve been watching the markets, you’ve seen Dogecoin (DOGE) fall below the $0.20 mark despite growing ETF optimism and Shiba Inu (SHIB) barely holding onto support. Meanwhile, the BTFD Coin (BTFD) presale is nearing its final stage with a mind-blowing 3650% ROI potential, making it the hottest meme coin opportunity of 2025 and the standout among the best cryptos to join for long term wins. With over $6.26 million raised and 71 billion coins sold, investors are scrambling to get in before the price jumps at launch. Meme coins have always been volatile, but smart investors know that presales are the safest bet to bypass market crashes and bear trends. That’s why BTFD Coin has captivated the crypto community. With a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a growing army of 11,200 holders, BTFD is not just another meme coin—it’s a wealth-generating machine in the making. But how does it compare to DOGE and SHIB? Can DOGE’s potential ETF approval or SHIB’s last support level change the game? Keep reading to find out why BTFD is the best crypto to join for long term and why it’s set to lead the next meme coin revolution. BTFD Coin: The 3650% ROI Presale That’s Changing the Meme Coin Game How often do you get a shot at 3650% gains? BTFD Coin’s presale started at just $0.000004 and is now at $0.00016 in Stage 14, with a final launch price of $0.0006. Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, meaning those who buy now are looking at life-changing returns. But this window is closing fast. With Stage 14 already 98.85% complete, this might be your last chance to secure a seat before the rocket takes off. Presale Success and Expert Forecasts Numbers don’t lie— BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of spectacular. Starting at just $0.000004 in Stage 1, the current price in Stage 14 has climbed to $0.00016, with a final listing price of $0.0006. With a projected moon price of $0.006, investors are eyeing a massive 3650% ROI, making it one of the best cryptos to join for long term. Over 71 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $6.26 million, while the BTFD Bulls community now boasts over 11,200 holders. The presale is nearing its final stretch, and this window won’t stay open for long! Let’s break this down with a real-world example. If you invest $500 right now at $0.00016, you’ll get 3.125 million BTFD tokens. At launch, that’s already worth $1,875. But if analysts’ moon price of $0.006 is hit? That same $500 turns into $18,750! And let’s not forget staking. BTFD’s 90% APY staking rewards mean you’re earning passive income just for holding, making it one of the most rewarding meme coins of the year. Why BTFD’s Utility and Community Power Make It Unstoppable Meme coins live and die by their community, and BTFD’s Bulls Squad is built differently. This isn’t just hype—it’s a movement. The team has gone all in with a fully launched P2E game, giving players a chance to earn BTFD rewards while having fun. Combined with staking, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an ecosystem designed for growth. How to Buy BTFD Coin Before It’s Too Late Visit the official BTFD presale site . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Select your currency and enter the amount you want to invest. Confirm your purchase and secure your BTFD tokens before the presale ends. Dogecoin (DOGE): ETF Optimism vs. Market Reality DOGE has fallen by 13% and is struggling below $0.20, despite growing optimism around a Dogecoin ETF. NYSE Arca has filed a 19b-4 with the SEC, aiming to launch Bitwise’s DOGE ETF, with Coinbase Custody managing holdings and Bank of New York Mellon handling cash assets. Market sentiment is heating up. Polymarket now places DOGE ETF approval odds at 67%, up from 55%. Bloomberg analysts are even more bullish, projecting a 75% chance of ETF approval by 2025. Yet, DOGE’s price has fallen by 16%, proving that ETF speculation alone isn’t enough to hold it up. For DOGE to recover, it needs to break back above $0.244 and hold $0.284—a challenge given the current market sentiment. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Critical Support Holding By a Thread SHIB is in dangerous territory, trading at $0.00001271 and teetering on losing another zero. It has breached the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, signaling heavy selling pressure. If it falls below $0.00001200, expect even more downside. One glimmer of hope? Selling volume is declining, hinting at potential “bear fatigue.” A breakout above $0.00001400 could shift momentum, but for now, SHIB remains in a precarious position. Final Verdict: BTFD Coin is the Best Crypto to Join for Long Term! Based on market trends, expert predictions, and real-world numbers, BTFD Coin is the clear winner among the best cryptos to join for long term gains. Unlike DOGE, which relies on ETF speculation, or SHIB, which is barely holding onto support, BTFD’s presale has already proven its strength. With 275% ROI at launch and 3650% moon potential, there’s simply no comparison. Time is running out. The final presale stages are almost sold out. If you want to maximize your gains and avoid market volatility, now is your shot. Don’t wait. Buy BTFD before the presale ends and join the Bulls Squad today! Get your BTFD tokens now .

Imagine a world where election outcomes are not just tallied but also immutably etched into a decentralized, transparent ledger. This isn’t a scene from a futuristic movie; it’s the reality unfolding in Tennessee, showcasing a novel approach to election security . Let’s delve into how this innovative step could redefine trust and transparency in electoral processes. Why Bitcoin for Election Security? Exploring the Blockchain Advantage When we talk about Bitcoin , we often think of digital currency and financial transactions. However, the underlying technology, blockchain, offers far more than just a platform for cryptocurrency. The Williamson County GOP’s decision to utilize the Bitcoin network highlights a fascinating and perhaps underappreciated aspect of blockchain technology: its robust security and immutability. But why Bitcoin specifically? Let’s break it down: Immutability: Once data is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This is a cornerstone of blockchain technology. Each block of data is cryptographically linked to the previous one, creating a tamper-proof chain of information. This immutability is crucial for ensuring the integrity of election results . Decentralization: The Bitcoin network is decentralized, meaning it’s not controlled by any single entity. This distributed nature makes it incredibly resistant to censorship and single points of failure. Unlike centralized databases that can be vulnerable to hacking or manipulation, the Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by a global network of nodes, enhancing its resilience. Transparency: Every transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is publicly viewable. While the content of the Williamson County GOP’s election results might not be publicly accessible in detail (depending on how they stored it), the fact that data was recorded at a specific block number (886,370) on the Bitcoin blockchain is verifiable by anyone. This inherent transparency adds a layer of accountability and trust. Security: The Bitcoin network is secured by cryptography and a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Work. This makes it extremely difficult and computationally expensive to attack or manipulate the blockchain. The security of the cryptocurrency network, designed to protect billions of dollars in value, is now being leveraged to protect something equally valuable – democratic processes. Cointelegraph reported that the Williamson County Republican leadership and board selected the immutable Bitcoin network to store the election results from their Republican National Convention election on March 4. These results were recorded on block number 886,370 on the Bitcoin blockchain. This act is a powerful example of how blockchain’s inherent features can be applied beyond finance, extending into areas like governance and civic integrity. How Does Blockchain Technology Fortify Election Integrity? To understand the significance of this move, let’s consider how blockchain technology, in general, and Bitcoin’s blockchain, in particular, can strengthen election integrity : Feature Traditional Election Systems Blockchain-Based Election Data Storage Data Immutability Vulnerable to tampering; digital records can be altered. Data is permanently recorded and cannot be changed once confirmed on the blockchain. Transparency Often opaque processes; audits can be complex and time-consuming. Transactions are publicly auditable; anyone can verify the record on the blockchain. Security Centralized systems are potential targets for cyberattacks and manipulation. Decentralized network; highly resistant to attacks due to cryptographic security and distributed nature. Auditability Audits can be subjective and require trust in central authorities. Cryptographically verifiable audit trail; enhances trust and reduces reliance on central authorities. By storing election results on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Williamson County GOP is essentially creating a permanent, verifiable, and transparent record of their election outcome. This doesn’t mean the entire voting process was on the blockchain, but rather the final results were anchored to this secure ledger. This distinction is important. It’s about using blockchain as a secure notary or timestamping service for critical data. Benefits of Bitcoin Blockchain for Securing Election Data What are the specific advantages of this approach? Let’s highlight some key benefits: Enhanced Trust: In an era where trust in institutions is often questioned, leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain can enhance public confidence in the integrity of election results. The verifiable nature of blockchain can reassure stakeholders that the data is authentic and untampered with. Reduced Risk of Manipulation: The immutability and security of the blockchain significantly reduce the risk of data manipulation or fraud. Altering data on the Bitcoin blockchain is practically infeasible, offering a robust defense against malicious actors. Improved Auditability: Auditing becomes simpler and more transparent. Instead of relying solely on manual recounts or centralized logs, auditors can verify the timestamp and existence of the election results directly on the public blockchain. Innovation and Leadership: The Williamson County GOP chapter is demonstrating leadership and innovation by exploring cutting-edge technology to improve their processes. This move could inspire other organizations, both political and non-political, to consider blockchain solutions for data security and integrity. Challenges and Considerations While the use of Bitcoin for securing election results is an exciting development, it’s important to consider potential challenges and limitations: Complexity and Understanding: Blockchain technology can be complex and not widely understood by the general public. Effective communication and education are crucial to ensure that this approach is accepted and trusted. Scalability for Large-Scale Elections: While suitable for storing election results, using the Bitcoin blockchain directly for every single vote in a large-scale national election would currently be impractical due to scalability limitations of the Bitcoin network itself. However, solutions like layer-2 networks or other blockchains designed for higher throughput might address this in the future. For now, using Bitcoin to secure the final results is a practical and valuable application. Public Perception and Misconceptions: Cryptocurrency and blockchain are still relatively new technologies, and misconceptions exist. Overcoming negative perceptions and educating the public about the benefits of blockchain for data security is essential. Cost and Technical Expertise: Implementing blockchain solutions might require initial investment in technical expertise and infrastructure. However, the long-term benefits in terms of security and trust could outweigh these costs. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin and the Future of Secure Data Management The Williamson County GOP’s initiative is a significant step towards exploring the potential of blockchain technology beyond finance. It opens up a conversation about how decentralized, immutable ledgers can be used to secure critical data in various sectors, including governance, healthcare, supply chain management, and more. This example could serve as a catalyst for further innovation and adoption of blockchain solutions for enhancing data security and transparency across diverse applications. While this particular instance involves a GOP chapter and election security , the underlying principle of using blockchain for data integrity is universally applicable. As blockchain technology matures and becomes more accessible, we can expect to see more creative and impactful uses emerge, further solidifying its role in the digital age. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Transparent Governance The decision by the Williamson County Republican Party to use the Bitcoin network to secure their election results is more than just a technological novelty; it’s a bold statement about the importance of transparency and security in democratic processes. By leveraging the immutable and decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, they’ve set a precedent for how technology can be used to build trust and ensure the integrity of critical data. This innovative approach underscores the versatility of Bitcoin and blockchain, extending its utility far beyond the realm of digital currencies. It’s a powerful reminder that the foundational principles of blockchain – security, transparency, and immutability – can be harnessed to address real-world challenges and pave the way for a more secure and trustworthy future.

41212407,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137369,1741225301,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Eric Schmidt Rejects Risky ‘Manhattan Project’ for Superintelligence AGI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/schmidt-rejects-agi-manhattan-project/,"In a stunning policy reversal that has sent ripples through the tech and crypto communities, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has publicly argued against pursuing a ‘Manhattan Project’-style approach to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This comes as a critical juncture for the future of AI development, especially considering the technology’s growing influence on cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations. Schmidt, alongside Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and Center for AI Safety Director Dan Hendrycks, released a compelling paper urging caution and a shift in strategy. Are we on the brink of an AI arms race, and what does this mean for the rapidly evolving world of digital assets? The Perils of a Superintelligence ‘Manhattan Project’ The core of Schmidt and his co-authors’ argument lies in the potential dangers of aggressively pursuing superintelligence with a ‘Manhattan Project’ mentality. Drawing parallels to the historical project that developed the atomic bomb, they caution against a concentrated, all-out effort to achieve AGI dominance. Why? Because this approach, they argue, is fraught with risks, especially in the current geopolitical landscape. Here’s a breakdown of their key concerns: Escalating International Tensions: A U.S.-led ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ could be perceived as a hostile act by other nations, particularly China, potentially triggering a dangerous AI arms race. Cyberattack Risks: Fearing a global power imbalance in superintelligence , rival nations might resort to extreme measures, including sophisticated cyberattacks, to disrupt or preemptively disable U.S. AI advancements. This could destabilize international relations and create a volatile environment. Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): Borrowing from the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) in the nuclear age, the authors introduce MAIM. This concept suggests that aggressive pursuit of superintelligence could lead to a scenario where nations proactively disable each other’s AI projects, creating a climate of distrust and potential conflict. Schmidt and his colleagues highlight that the assumption behind a ‘Manhattan Project’ – that rivals will simply accept an AI power imbalance – is fundamentally flawed and dangerously naive. They argue that history and current geopolitical realities suggest otherwise. Challenging the Status Quo: Is AI Safety Taking a Backseat? This paper directly challenges the growing sentiment, especially within U.S. policy circles, that a government-backed, intensely focused program like the ‘Manhattan Project’ is the optimal path to secure AI leadership and outcompete China. Recent statements from officials, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who explicitly referenced a ‘new Manhattan Project’ for AI, underscore this prevailing viewpoint. However, Schmidt, Wang, and Hendrycks present a compelling counter-narrative, emphasizing AI safety and global stability over a winner-take-all race. The debate essentially boils down to two contrasting approaches: Approach Proponents Key Beliefs Risks ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ Some U.S. policymakers and industry leaders Aggressive, government-led push is necessary to win the superintelligence race against China. Increased international tensions, cyberattacks, potential for AI arms race, neglecting AI safety concerns. Measured, Defensive Strategy Eric Schmidt, Alexandr Wang, Dan Hendrycks Prioritize AI safety , focus on defensive measures, deterring hostile AI development, and international cooperation. Potential for falling behind in the AI race if other nations pursue aggressive development, requires international consensus and cooperation. Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): A New Paradigm for AI Policy? The concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM) is a crucial contribution of this paper. It suggests a paradigm shift in how we think about AI safety and international AI policy. Instead of solely focusing on outpacing rivals in AI development, MAIM proposes a strategy of deterrence and proactive defense. This involves: Developing Cyberattack Capabilities: Ironically, to prevent hostile superintelligence development, the U.S. should enhance its cyberattack arsenal to be capable of disabling threatening AI projects in other nations. This is presented as a defensive measure, not an offensive one. Limiting Access to Key Resources: Restricting adversaries’ access to advanced AI chips and open-source models is another crucial element in deterring rapid and unchecked superintelligence development. This strategy is not about halting AI progress; it’s about steering it towards a safer and more stable trajectory. It acknowledges the reality of international competition but emphasizes the paramount importance of preventing catastrophic outcomes. Beyond Doomers and Ostriches: A Third Way for AGI Development Schmidt et al. cleverly categorize the existing spectrum of opinions on AI policy into two extremes: the “doomers” and the “ostriches.” Doomers: Believe AI catastrophe is inevitable and advocate for slowing down or even halting AI progress altogether. Ostriches: Advocate for rapid, unbridled AI development, essentially hoping for the best without robust safety measures or international agreements. The paper positions its proposed strategy as a “third way” – a measured and responsible approach that acknowledges both the immense potential and the significant risks of AGI . This “third way” prioritizes defensive strategies and international cooperation, moving beyond the simplistic dichotomy of acceleration versus deceleration. Schmidt’s Evolving Stance on China AI and Superintelligence What makes this paper particularly noteworthy is Schmidt’s involvement. Previously, he has been a vocal advocate for aggressive competition with China in AI. His earlier op-ed highlighting DeepSeek as a turning point in the U.S.-China AI race underscores his previous stance. This new paper signals a significant evolution in his thinking, suggesting a growing concern about the risks of unchecked superintelligence development and a potential shift towards prioritizing AI safety over outright dominance. This shift in perspective from a prominent figure like Schmidt carries considerable weight and could influence policy discussions in Washington and beyond. It highlights the increasing urgency of addressing the potential risks of AGI, even as the race to develop it intensifies. Implications for the Crypto and Tech World While not directly about cryptocurrency, this debate around AGI and AI safety is profoundly relevant to the crypto and broader tech world. AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain technology, impacting everything from cybersecurity and decentralized finance (DeFi) to the metaverse and NFT development. A global AI arms race or a catastrophic AI malfunction would have far-reaching consequences for all sectors, including the digital asset space. Therefore, understanding the nuances of AI policy, the risks of superintelligence , and the importance of AI safety is becoming increasingly crucial for anyone involved in the future of technology and finance. Schmidt’s paper serves as a vital contribution to this critical conversation, urging a more cautious and globally responsible approach to AGI development. In conclusion, the call to avoid a ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ from influential figures like Eric Schmidt is a powerful wake-up call. It underscores the need for a nuanced, globally-minded strategy that prioritizes AI safety and international stability over a potentially perilous race for superintelligence dominance. The future of AI, and indeed the future of technology as a whole, may depend on embracing this more cautious and collaborative path.

Suntory and Sony are two Japanese giants already making moves to stave off potential fallout. While it’s unclear exactly what the US figurehead meant by accusing the Japanese and Chinese governments of “[killing] their dollar, their equivalent of the dollar, whatever,” one thing appears clear: Canada and Mexico will not be the only economies to face Trump trade war fallout. Fiat currencies worldwide are struggling, and of course, the group with the strongest military typically has the “strongest” currency. From a debt-based perspective , neither the yuan, the yen, or the USD are in a position of solvency or strength. Nonetheless, preparations are being made by Japan-based companies to fend off failure in the case of a potentially damaging new tariff. Japanese giants Suntory and Sony make provisions Reuters reports Wednesday (JST) that Japanese electronics behemoth Sony and multinational drinks company Suntory have begun building up supplies in the United States, with Sony increasing electronics and gaming division inventory. Suntory, for its part, has reportedly shipped tequila from it’s Mexico-based operations north of the border. Trump’s comments from the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Monday have only exacerbated fears, with Japan’s government denying the Asian state is “devaluing” the Japanese yen. The US president also mentioned Honda moving production of its next Civic from Mexico to Indiana in the speech, saying: “Well, Honda is coming, and I told you about Apple, that they’re going to be starting to build massively here — $500 billion.” Criticism of Japan may seem confusing at this juncture, as the nation’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has recently stated that the country will increase investment in the United States to an unprecedented $1 trillion dollars. This proclamation was made in the presence of Trump at a joint press conference following a Japan-US summit meeting in D.C in February. Ishiba also noted plans for Japanese automakers Toyota and Isuzu to build plants in America. Trump supporters shift positions Economic freedom and populist protectionism are butting heads in light of Trump’s trade rhetoric, as his mixed support base, some of whom even claim he is “libertarian,” struggle to hold their hodgepodge of mixed values in one place. On the one hand, classically liberal (libertarian) economists overwhelmingly favor free trade, as it tends to benefit everyone in an economy, due to the free flow of goods. However, nationalist interests in supporters who typically view themselves as anti-communist or fascist, have them vocally supporting the 25% trade impositions on Canada and Mexico, which interestingly may be met with even more, retaliatory tariffs, forcing companies like Honda to once again move back to Mexico or the countries they initially fled. Perhaps the most obvious explanation for the contradictory positions and confusing opposition to Japanese interests by Trump, is one that is age old: he’s just playing politics. Unfortunately, the fallout from such games is measured in real people’s lost livelihoods and even lives, when trade wars erupt into armed conflict. And even if Japan is not directly targeted with tariffs, it’s important to note that in a global economy, Mexico and Canada being slammed will still make things much harder for businesses with ties to those zones. Whatever may unfold, Japanese businesses are on guard, with Reuters quoting senior Oxford Economics economist Norihiro Yamaguchi as emphasizing: “Corporates are now more aware that Japan could also be a target.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

41212409,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137371,1741225352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Relief for Miners: US Government Unleashes Seized Bitcoin Mining Hardware,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-government-seized-bitcoin-miners/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency mining community, the U.S. government has started to release a portion of the Bitcoin miners it had previously seized. This news, first reported by Reuters, brings a sense of relief to many in the industry who have been closely following the saga of these detained machines. But what exactly happened, why were these Bitcoin miners seized in the first place, and what does this release mean for the future of crypto mining? Let’s dive into the details. Why Were Bitcoin Miners Seized by the US Government? Late last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), acting on the request of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), initiated a series of seizures targeting Chinese Bitcoin miners at various ports of entry across the United States. The crackdown reportedly led to the seizure of up to 10,000 units of crypto mining hardware . But what prompted such drastic action? Here’s a breakdown of the likely reasons behind the seizures: FCC Regulations: The FCC is responsible for regulating interstate and international communications. It’s plausible that the seized Bitcoin miners were flagged for potential violations of FCC regulations. This could range from issues with equipment certification to concerns about electromagnetic interference. National Security Concerns: While less explicitly stated, national security concerns often play a role in government actions, especially concerning technology imports. There might have been worries about the origin or functionality of these specific units, prompting a closer inspection. Trade Policy and Tariffs: The timing of the seizures coincided with ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. While not directly confirmed, trade policy considerations could have indirectly influenced the scrutiny applied to these imports. Compliance Checks: Routine customs checks can sometimes uncover discrepancies or issues with imported goods. It’s possible that these seizures were part of a broader effort to ensure compliance with import regulations. Release of Seized Bitcoin Miners: A Turning Point? The recent news of the U.S. government releasing some of these seized Bitcoin miners marks a significant development. While details remain somewhat sparse regarding the exact number of units being released or the specific reasons for this change of course, it signals a potential shift in approach. What could be behind this release? Resolution of Regulatory Issues: It’s possible that the companies importing these miners have successfully addressed the FCC’s concerns. This could involve providing necessary certifications, demonstrating compliance, or reaching agreements on specific issues. Re-evaluation of Seizure Justification: Perhaps upon further review, the government agencies involved reassessed the initial grounds for seizure and concluded that releasing some or all of the units was appropriate. Economic Considerations: Prolonged detention of goods can have economic implications for businesses and supply chains. Releasing the miners could be a pragmatic decision to mitigate potential economic disruptions. Diplomatic Factors: International relations and diplomatic considerations might also play a role in such decisions, although this is more speculative without further information. Impact on Crypto Mining Hardware and the Market The release of US government Bitcoin miners, even if it’s a partial release, could have several implications for the cryptocurrency market and the crypto mining hardware industry: Increased Hashrate Potential: These released miners, once operational, will contribute to the overall Bitcoin network hashrate. This could lead to increased network security and potentially faster transaction processing times, although the impact of a few thousand miners on the massive Bitcoin network might be incremental. Boost for Mining Companies: For the companies that own these miners, their release represents a significant win. It allows them to deploy previously stranded assets and resume or expand their mining operations. This can directly impact their profitability and operational capacity. Market Sentiment: The news could be interpreted as a positive signal for the crypto industry. It might suggest a more nuanced or even softening stance from the U.S. government towards crypto mining, although this interpretation needs to be approached cautiously. Supply Chain Dynamics: The episode highlights the complexities of international trade and regulatory compliance for the Bitcoin regulations and crypto mining sector. It underscores the importance of navigating these regulations effectively to avoid disruptions. Navigating Bitcoin Regulations: Actionable Insights This situation provides valuable lessons for businesses operating in the cryptocurrency mining space, particularly concerning international trade and regulatory compliance. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Regulatory Compliance: Thoroughly understand and adhere to all relevant regulations, especially those pertaining to import/export, communications equipment, and technology standards in your target markets. Due Diligence in Supply Chains: Conduct rigorous due diligence on your supply chains, especially when sourcing equipment from overseas. Ensure that suppliers and manufacturers comply with all applicable regulations. Maintain Open Communication with Authorities: Establish and maintain open lines of communication with relevant regulatory bodies. Proactive engagement can help address potential issues before they escalate into seizures or other disruptions. Seek Expert Legal Counsel: Engage legal experts specializing in international trade, customs law, and cryptocurrency regulations. Professional guidance is crucial for navigating the complex legal landscape. Diversify Operational Locations: Consider diversifying your mining operations geographically to mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions in specific jurisdictions. In conclusion, the release of some seized Bitcoin miners by the U.S. government is a noteworthy development in the ongoing interaction between cryptocurrency and regulatory bodies. While the full implications are still unfolding, it serves as a reminder of the dynamic and evolving nature of the crypto landscape. Staying informed, proactive, and compliant is paramount for navigating this exciting yet complex industry.

41212530,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137377,1741225495,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding Crucial SEC Crypto Task Force Discussions on Crypto Regulation with WisdomTree,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-task-force-wisdomtree/,"In a significant move signaling proactive engagement in the evolving digital asset landscape, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Crypto Task Force convened a meeting with representatives from WisdomTree Digital Management and its affiliates on March 5. This crucial discussion, as detailed in the SEC’s official meeting log, centered on navigating the complex terrain of crypto regulation . For those invested in the future of cryptocurrency and digital assets, understanding these regulatory developments is paramount. Let’s delve into what this meeting signifies and what aspects of crypto regulation were brought to the table. Why is the SEC Crypto Task Force Meeting with WisdomTree Important for Crypto Regulation? The fact that the SEC Crypto Task Force is actively engaging with key players like WisdomTree underscores the agency’s commitment to establishing a clear regulatory framework for the burgeoning crypto industry. WisdomTree, a prominent asset manager, has been increasingly involved in the digital asset space, particularly with its interest in exchange-traded products (ETPs) for cryptocurrencies. This meeting is not just a procedural formality; it’s a vital dialogue to shape the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. Here’s why this interaction matters: Proactive Regulatory Approach: The SEC’s Crypto Task Force proactively seeking discussions demonstrates a move towards informed regulation rather than reactive enforcement. This is a positive sign for the industry, suggesting a collaborative approach to understanding and addressing the nuances of crypto assets. Industry Input: WisdomTree’s participation allows the SEC to gain direct insights from industry experts actively working within the crypto space. This real-world perspective is invaluable for crafting effective and practical regulations. Focus on Key Issues: The meeting agenda itself highlights the SEC’s priorities in crypto regulation , including operational aspects of tokenized funds, in-kind transactions for digital asset ETPs, and the application of broker-dealer net capital rules to crypto assets. These are critical areas that need clarity for the crypto market to mature and attract broader institutional adoption. Unpacking the Agenda: What Aspects of Crypto Regulation Were Discussed? The meeting agenda provides a window into the specific regulatory challenges and considerations currently at the forefront of the SEC’s attention regarding crypto regulation . Let’s break down each key point: 1. Operational Aspects of Tokenized Funds Tokenized funds represent a novel approach to investment vehicles, leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalize ownership and enhance accessibility. However, their operational mechanics raise several regulatory questions: Custody and Security: How are tokenized funds securely custodied? What measures are in place to protect investors from theft or loss of digital assets? Valuation and Transparency: How are these funds valued, and how is transparency maintained for investors, especially given the volatility of underlying crypto assets? Compliance with Existing Fund Regulations: Do existing investment fund regulations adequately cover tokenized funds, or are new rules needed? Discussions on these operational aspects are crucial for ensuring investor protection and market integrity within the evolving landscape of tokenized investments. 2. In-Kind Transactions for Digital Asset ETPs In-kind transactions, where investors can create or redeem ETP shares using the underlying assets (in this case, digital assets) rather than cash, are a significant feature of many commodity and now potentially crypto ETPs. However, for digital asset ETFs , this raises unique questions: Market Manipulation Concerns: Could in-kind transactions in the volatile crypto market be more susceptible to manipulation? Valuation and Liquidity of Underlying Assets: How are the digital assets used in in-kind transactions valued, and is there sufficient liquidity in the underlying crypto markets to support these transactions without market disruption? Tax Implications: What are the tax implications of in-kind transactions involving cryptocurrencies for both ETP providers and investors? Addressing these complexities is essential for the SEC to confidently approve and oversee digital asset ETFs that utilize in-kind transaction mechanisms. 3. Application of Broker-Dealer Net Capital Rules to Crypto Assets Broker-dealer net capital rules are designed to ensure that financial firms maintain sufficient liquid assets to cover their liabilities and protect customer funds. Applying these rules to firms dealing with crypto assets presents new challenges: Valuation of Crypto Assets for Net Capital Calculation: How should volatile crypto assets be valued when calculating a broker-dealer’s net capital? Should haircuts (reductions in value) be applied, and if so, at what rate? Custody and Control of Crypto Assets: How does the custody and control of crypto assets by broker-dealers impact net capital requirements? Are existing custody solutions sufficient for regulatory purposes? Operational Risks Specific to Crypto: Do the unique operational risks associated with crypto, such as cybersecurity threats and private key management, necessitate adjustments to net capital rules? Clear guidelines on applying broker-dealer net capital rules to crypto assets are vital for fostering a secure and stable market environment, especially as institutional involvement in crypto increases. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation and Digital Asset ETFs? The meeting between the SEC Crypto Task Force and WisdomTree is a strong indicator that regulatory dialogue is actively underway. It suggests that the SEC is taking a measured and informed approach to crafting crypto regulation , engaging with industry participants to understand the nuances and challenges. This is particularly encouraging for the prospects of digital asset ETFs in the U.S. As the SEC grapples with the complexities of tokenized funds, in-kind transactions, and broker-dealer rules in the context of crypto, these discussions pave the way for: Clearer Regulatory Guidelines: Industry stakeholders can anticipate more specific and tailored regulations for crypto assets, reducing uncertainty and fostering innovation. Potential for Digital Asset ETF Approval: Addressing the regulatory hurdles around operational aspects, in-kind transactions, and net capital rules is crucial for the eventual approval of spot digital asset ETFs in the U.S., which many believe will unlock significant institutional capital for the crypto market. Increased Market Confidence: Proactive engagement from regulators and a clear regulatory framework can boost investor confidence in the crypto market, leading to greater participation and maturity. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Crypto Regulation The SEC Crypto Task Force ‘s meeting with WisdomTree is more than just a procedural step; it’s a crucial dialogue that underscores the ongoing evolution of crypto regulation . By addressing critical issues such as tokenized funds, in-kind transactions, and broker-dealer rules, the SEC is actively working towards a regulatory framework that can accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets while safeguarding investors and maintaining market integrity. For participants in the crypto space, these developments are vital to watch, as they will significantly shape the future trajectory of the industry and the accessibility of digital asset ETFs and other crypto investment products. The engagement signals a move towards a more defined and navigable regulatory environment, which is ultimately beneficial for the long-term growth and stability of the cryptocurrency market.

Notably, cryptocurrency miners are high-powered computers that compete to solve tricky math problems. This process helps maintain the blockchain, the tech behind digital currencies, and miners are rewarded with new cryptocurrency. “Thousands of mining units have been released,” said Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, a cryptocurrency equipment broker. Notably, at one point, up to 10,000 units were stuck at various U.S. ports. He also mentioned that some officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seemed to be against bitcoin mining and made life difficult for the industry. According to Blockspace, U.S. Customs and the Federal Communications Commission began seizing certain bitcoin mining equipment late last year. Notably, some of the machines might have been held back because they contained chips from Sophgo, a Chinese chip company that is restricted from trade. The release of an unspecified amount of cryptocurrency mining equipment is happening during a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, particularly due to the ongoing trade war and security concerns that have been raised by U.S. authorities. These concerns have been present since the later months of the Biden administration. Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor Technology, noted that while some of the seized shipments are now being returned, the majority of them remain held. Both Vera and Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, shared that authorities had cited concerns about radio frequency emissions from the mining machines, which they dismissed, suggesting that the machines’ emissions were not a real issue. This situation is part of a broader context of the U.S. government’s scrutiny of Chinese-made technology, especially in sectors like telecommunications and computing. The U.S. has expressed security worries about foreign-made equipment, particularly from Chinese companies, fearing that they could be used for espionage or other malicious activities. As a result, the government has been imposing restrictions on certain tech imports, and these concerns have extended to cryptocurrency mining equipment as well.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 01:45:14

One crucial tool investors use to gauge market sentiment is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Recently, this index showed a slight uptick, offering a glimmer of hope amidst persistent uncertainty. But what does this rise really mean, and why is the market still gripped by ‘Extreme Fear’? Let’s dive deep into the latest readings and understand the undercurrents shaping the crypto landscape. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of Alternative.me, is designed to measure the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’, suggesting investors are overly worried and potentially leading to undervaluation of assets. Conversely, a score of 100 signals ‘Extreme Greed’, hinting at a possible market bubble due to irrational exuberance. As of March 6th, the index stands at 25. While this is a five-point increase from the previous day, it firmly remains within the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This indicates that despite some positive shifts, a significant portion of the market remains cautious and apprehensive. Decoding the Metrics: What Drives the Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a calculated metric that takes into account a blend of six different market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final index score, providing a holistic view of market sentiment. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. High volatility often correlates with fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current market momentum and trading volume against recent averages. Strong momentum can indicate growing greed, while weak momentum might suggest fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for hashtags related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Positive sentiment contributes to greed, while negative sentiment fuels fear. Surveys (15%): Conducts polls and surveys on crypto platforms to directly gauge investor sentiment. These surveys provide a direct pulse on whether investors are feeling fearful or greedy. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful times, as investors prefer the perceived stability of Bitcoin over altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Increased search interest can sometimes correlate with greed, while declining interest might suggest fear or apathy. Why Does Market Fear Persist Despite a Slight Index Rise? The recent five-point increase in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a positive signal, but it’s crucial to understand why ‘Extreme Fear’ still dominates. Several factors could be at play: Lingering Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions, continue to cast a shadow over all markets, including crypto. This macroeconomic uncertainty fuels investor anxiety. Recent Market Corrections: The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant corrections in recent months. These downturns can leave lasting psychological impacts, making investors hesitant to jump back in aggressively, even with slight positive indicators. Regulatory Scrutiny: Ongoing regulatory discussions and actions around the world can create uncertainty and fear within the crypto market. Unclear regulatory landscapes can make investors wary of potential risks. Bearish Market Sentiment: Prolonged periods of negative price action can create a self-reinforcing cycle of fear. Investors who have experienced losses may be more risk-averse and prone to selling during rallies, further dampening sentiment. Navigating Extreme Fear: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals ‘Extreme Fear’? Here are some actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Periods of extreme fear can be opportune times to employ a DCA strategy. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of price. This can help mitigate risk and potentially capitalize on lower prices over time. Due Diligence and Research: Fear can sometimes lead to panic selling and undervaluation of fundamentally strong projects. Use this time to conduct thorough research on cryptocurrencies you believe in. Identify projects with solid fundamentals, strong teams, and real-world use cases. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Adopting a long-term investment perspective can help you weather short-term fluctuations and avoid emotional decision-making driven by fear. Risk Management: ‘Extreme Fear’ periods highlight the importance of sound risk management. Ensure your portfolio is diversified, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Keep abreast of market developments and news, but be discerning about the information you consume. Avoid being swayed by fear-mongering headlines and focus on credible sources and fundamental analysis. The Path Ahead: Will Greed Return to the Crypto Market? The slight rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a sliver of optimism, suggesting that the extreme bearishness might be easing slightly. However, the market is still firmly in ‘Extreme Fear’. Whether and when we’ll see a shift towards greed depends on a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, technological advancements in the crypto space, and broader investor adoption. For now, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable reminder of the emotional currents driving the market. Understanding these emotions, and acting rationally rather than reacting emotionally, is key to navigating the exciting yet often turbulent world of cryptocurrency investment.

41212532,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137381,1741225550,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Exclusion: Cardano’s Hoskinson Snubbed from White House Crypto Summit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hoskinson-cardano-white-house-summit/,"In a rather shocking turn of events, Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, finds himself excluded from the upcoming White House Crypto Summit. This news, first reported by Unchained, raises eyebrows and sparks questions within the cryptocurrency community. Why would a prominent figure in the crypto space, especially one associated with a major blockchain like Cardano, be left out of such a crucial policy discussion? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential implications of this intriguing development. Charles Hoskinson Excluded: What Happened at the White House Crypto Summit? According to a White House source cited by Unchained, Charles Hoskinson did not receive an invitation to the highly anticipated White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 7th. This revelation is particularly noteworthy given Hoskinson’s significant role in the cryptocurrency industry as the co-founder of Cardano and his vocal advocacy for blockchain technology. The source stated plainly, “They are not involved in anything about trying to influence policy.” This blunt statement suggests a deliberate decision to exclude Hoskinson from the summit, raising questions about the criteria for invitation and the White House’s approach to engaging with the diverse crypto ecosystem. Here’s a quick rundown of what we know: The Exclusion: Charles Hoskinson, a key figure in Cardano and the broader crypto space, was not invited to the White House Crypto Summit. Source of the News: Unchained, citing a White House source, broke the story. Reason for Exclusion (Alleged): The White House source indicated that Hoskinson and potentially Cardano are not seen as relevant to policy influence. Summit Date: The White House Crypto Summit is scheduled for March 7th. The Cardano Paradox: Trump’s Crypto Reserve Claim vs. Summit Snub Adding another layer of intrigue to this situation is a past statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Trump had previously mentioned Cardano’s native token, ADA , as a potential component of a crypto reserve. This public acknowledgement from a prominent political figure seemed to indicate a level of recognition, if not endorsement, of Cardano and ADA within certain political circles. However, Hoskinson’s exclusion from the White House Crypto Summit appears to directly contradict this notion. This discrepancy begs the question: Is there a disconnect between different parts of the U.S. political landscape regarding cryptocurrency? Or does this exclusion signal a shift in perspective, downplaying the significance of Cardano and ADA in the broader crypto policy discussion? Crypto Policy and the Missing Voice: What Does Hoskinson’s Absence Mean? The White House Crypto Summit is intended to be a forum for discussing and shaping crypto policy in the United States. The exclusion of Charles Hoskinson, a figure with years of experience in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, raises concerns about the comprehensiveness and inclusivity of these policy discussions. Hoskinson has been a vocal advocate for sensible crypto regulation and has often engaged in public discourse on the future of blockchain technology. His absence could mean a missed opportunity to incorporate diverse perspectives and expertise into the policymaking process. Potential Implications of Hoskinson’s Exclusion on Crypto Policy Discussions: Limited Perspective: Excluding key figures may lead to a narrower range of viewpoints being considered during policy formulation. Missed Expertise: Hoskinson’s deep understanding of blockchain technology and its potential applications could have been valuable for policymakers. Industry Perception: The exclusion might be perceived negatively by some within the crypto industry, potentially signaling a less inclusive approach to crypto regulation. Focus on Specific Agendas: The summit’s agenda might be skewed towards certain narratives or interests if diverse voices are not represented. White House Crypto Summit: Who’s In and What’s on the Agenda? While Charles Hoskinson’s absence is notable, it’s important to consider the broader context of the White House Crypto Summit . Although details about the specific agenda and list of attendees are still emerging, such summits typically aim to bring together government officials, industry leaders, and experts to discuss the current state of the cryptocurrency landscape and the path forward for regulation. The focus is often on topics such as consumer protection, financial stability, national security, and innovation within the digital asset space. It remains to be seen who *is* included in the summit and what specific issues will be prioritized. However, the exclusion of a prominent figure like Hoskinson does prompt questions about the White House’s priorities and its understanding of the diverse and decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency industry. Cardano’s Future Unaffected? Navigating the Regulatory Landscape Despite Charles Hoskinson’s exclusion from the White House event, Cardano continues to be a significant player in the blockchain space. The project boasts a robust community, ongoing development, and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). While policy discussions at summits like the White House Crypto Summit can influence the regulatory landscape, the fundamental technology and utility of Cardano are independent of these political dynamics. Cardano’s Strengths and Resilience: Technological Innovation: Cardano is known for its peer-reviewed research and focus on secure and scalable blockchain solutions. Strong Community: Cardano has a large and active global community of developers and users. Decentralization: As a decentralized blockchain, Cardano’s operations are not controlled by any single entity or government. Growing Ecosystem: The Cardano ecosystem is expanding with new dApps and projects being launched regularly. Ultimately, while Hoskinson’s exclusion from the summit is a noteworthy development, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency industry is dynamic and multifaceted. The success and adoption of projects like Cardano will likely be determined by a range of factors, including technological advancements, community engagement, and real-world utility, in addition to navigating the evolving regulatory environment. Conclusion: An Intriguing Snub and its Ripple Effects The exclusion of Charles Hoskinson from the White House Crypto Summit is undoubtedly an intriguing development that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community. Whether it’s a deliberate snub, a policy oversight, or a reflection of evolving political dynamics, the absence of a prominent voice like Hoskinson’s from a key policy discussion is certainly noteworthy. It raises important questions about inclusivity, perspective, and the future direction of crypto regulation in the United States. As the White House Crypto Summit unfolds, the industry will be watching closely to see what policies are discussed and whose voices are ultimately heard.

The platform at Mikybull Crypto detected historical similar patterns from when Ethereum broke out in February 2024 shortly before the 300% price jump occurred. A substantial number of investors currently embrace Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its ongoing second presale phase because of its decentralized lending platform. Despite Ethereum’s previous price swings from $1,400 to $80 levels before reaching $4,800 in 2021 only to drop 80% below its peak, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts notice through its structured tokenomics system along with strong presale performance which has surpassed $2.1 million at $0.015 per token. Ethereum’s Volatile Ascent The fundamental technology of Ethereum demonstrates the ongoing battle between recent bullish traits and its previous substantial weaknesses. The asset price maintains its position around $3,200 while experts predict that breaking through this threshold would drive it to reach $5,600. Mikybull Crypto’s analysts discovered identical market trends before an enormous price increase in February 2024. The potential conditions indicate Ethereum can raise its value to $15,000 by 2025. The periodic market volatility of Ethereum has produced multiple booms and busts which make investors anxious about future fluctuations. This latest rally highlights a potential problem because the preceding 16% monthly drop reveals how cryptocurrency markets face sudden downturns which demand investment in modern innovative stable assets. Mutuum Finance’s Calculated Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has adopted a DeFi protocol design to unite lending features with overtly managed token demand while offering its services to capital markets. From Phase 2 of MUTM’s presale investors have acquired 4000 addresses while Phase 2 tokens sell for $0.015 and Phase 3 will be priced at $0.02. The first participants who invest will receive a 300% return when MUTM lists at $0.06 but projection models extend even beyond that timeframe. Experts indicate that platform revenue passes through a buy-and-distribute mechanism which acquires MUTM tokens before distributing them among stakers for continued market demand. The model hardened by overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer features establishes the main attraction of the system. Presale Surge and Tokenomics The protocol succeeded in rapidly attracting investors during its presale phase because of growing market confidence. Phase 2 started at $0.015 entry point which enabled the project to reach $2.1 million in funding while Phase 1 experienced a rapid sellout. Starting at launch price Tokenomics ensures a 4x increase but the analysis after listing reveals potential for the token to reach $2.40 during 2025 which represents a 15900% upside versus present value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) implements mtTokens to create value through accumulating interest since these tokens provide liquidity between different platforms. Users can earn more valuable mtETH tokens by putting their ETH into deposits which users can then freely trade due to their growing worth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents particular methods to counteract crypto volatility even though Ethereum’s technological indicators forecast market appreciation. The lending system at Mutuum Finance depends on overcollateralized loans that require borrowers to pledge assets worth more than the loan amount while working with adjustable interest rates to protect lenders while giving borrowers flexibility. The presale utility attracts participants through a $100,000 giveaway scheme that distributes $10,000 each to 10 investors. The price movement of MUTM depends entirely on user adoption and revenue-based buy pressure rather than market sentiments like Ethereum faces. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes beyond speculative hype to show significant practical project achievements. The presales activity at high velocity and 3900 individual holders prove that the project possesses real market demand which is uncommon for new projects. MUTM token buyers should act swiftly given that future price increases combined with upcoming exchange listings make purchasing tokens for $0.015 more challenging than ever. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers an appealing investment option to those investors looking for controlled entry points coupled with systemic demand creation since Ethereum maintains unquestionable potential. Crypto markets function by supporting stories where Ethereum’s comeback headlines compete against Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which brings forth an investable narrative with extensive risks. The presale results combined with utility-based structure and deflationary token operations of MUTM distinguish itself from Ethereum by relying on market-wide trends. The Phase 2 launch of MUTM allows users to find stability in DeFi’s upcoming advancement that rewards investors through controlled growth instead of uncertain market swings. As Ethereum eyes $7,200, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly charts a course toward redefining value itself.

Interestingly, a crypto analyst on TradingView has highlighted this price support as a make-or-break level for PEPE, suggesting that a breakout above this zone could spark a 400% rally toward $0.0001. This outlook comes after a particularly challenging week for the entire crypto market, during which PEPE extended its losses and dropped to its lowest price point in months. This Level To Trigger 400% Move For PEPE Technical analysis shows that PEPE’s upward trajectory hinges on a bounce at support around $0.00000650. This interesting analysis was highlighted by a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform using the PEPE weekly candlestick timeframe chart. Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise This support level comes into play in light of PEPE’s extended decline since the beginning of the year. Interestingly, technical analysis shows that the decline looks like a repeating pattern of the meme coin’s price action in 2024. The ongoing correction stems from PEPE’s peak price of $0.00002803 in December 2024, which the analyst termed the third drive. Notably, earlier first and second drives in 2024 were also each accompanied by a correction phase after rallies. Interestingly, the meme coin has shown signs of life in the past 24 hours with a push above this support level and climbing into the $0.000007 range. However, the uptrend could not be defined yet, and the crypto analyst noted that any uptrend will depend on how PEPE reacts with a crucial resistance zone between $0.00001150 and $0.00001200. This level has previously acted as support but has now turned into resistance. Therefore, a weekly close above this zone would confirm a bullish breakout and a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. Price Targets If The Meme Coin Breaks Above Resistance A break above $0.00001200 would cement a breakout with more momentum for PEPE. Such a breakout would mark the first bullish catalyst in a while, confirm momentum, and lead to increased buy-side pressure with an aggressive upward move. From here, the next resistance levels are projected to be around $0.00001700 to $0.00002200. A move to $0.00002200 will most likely cascade into more momentum above its current all-time high of $0.00002803. Related Reading: PEPE Flashes Reversal Signal To Recoup The 800 EMA, What This Means For Price The analyst further predicted a price target of $0.0001, provided the bullish momentum sustains itself. However, failure to close above the key resistance level at $0.00001200 could result in a continued downtrend, with PEPE possibly retesting lower support zones around $0.00000650 to $0.00000550. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.000007239, up by 4.4% in the past 24 hours. PEPE’s ability to sustain such an upward trajectory would depend on broader market conditions for Bitcoin and other large market cap cryptocurrencies.

Excitement is building as Grayscale moves forward with its application for a dedicated Cardano ETF under the ticker “GADA” on NYSE Arca. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) is flashing bullish signals, with analysts predicting a potential 16% increase as buying activity picks up. While these established projects aim for new highs, Web3Bay is making headlines for its mission to reshape digital asset trading. With tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) becoming more common and NFTs maturing beyond collectibles, Web3Bay is stepping up to create a next-generation marketplace. This platform aims to connect digital creators, buyers, and asset owners in a seamless ecosystem that could challenge OpenSea’s dominance. Web3Bay: The Future of Digital Asset Trading in 2025 Web3Bay is setting its sights on becoming the go-to marketplace for digital assets, much like Amazon has for e-commerce. By creating a direct and transparent marketplace, it brings together creators, investors, and collectors in one space. With RWAs gaining mainstream traction and NFTs evolving into more functional assets, Web3Bay is building a framework that supports secure and efficient trading. One of Web3Bay’s key strengths is its ability to support NFT applications beyond art and collectibles. The platform is structured to handle digital tickets, memberships, and virtual assets, tapping into the growing demand for real-world applications of blockchain technology. As physical assets like real estate and luxury goods get tokenized, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a hub where buyers and sellers can interact without unnecessary intermediaries. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale is in its 5th stage, with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524. The project has already raised $1.6 million, showing strong backing from early adopters. Upcoming integrations, including PayPal support, signal a push toward mainstream adoption, making this a prime time for investors to get involved before the platform scales. Could a Cardano ETF Take ADA to the Next Level? The anticipation around a potential Cardano ETF is growing as Grayscale files for a dedicated investment product under the ticker “GADA.” If approved, this move would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to ADA without directly managing crypto assets. The fund’s structure includes Coinbase Custody Trust Company as custodian and BNY Mellon as administrator, adding credibility to the proposal. Following the ETF announcement, ADA jumped by 14.38%, hitting $0.8051. Looking ahead, CoinCodex predicts that ADA could climb to $1.900281 in 2025. The community is closely watching the SEC’s decision, as an approval could attract fresh capital and further boost adoption. Will XLM Hit $0.4292? Analysts Weigh In Crypto analyst Ali Martinez sees a potential 16% surge in XLM’s price, pointing to an inverted head and shoulders pattern forming on Stellar’s 4-hour chart. This pattern often signals a reversal from a downward trend, suggesting that a breakout may be on the horizon. Currently, XLM is trading around $0.32, with a key resistance level at $0.37. If this level is breached, the price could rise toward $0.4292, as projected. Despite a 26.6% decline over the last month, Stellar’s network activity is showing strong recovery signals. The number of active addresses has hit a record 9 million, while over $32.54 million worth of XLM has been withdrawn from exchanges, indicating accumulation by long-term holders. Open Interest (OI) has also risen by 3.82%, showing that traders are positioning themselves for a potential breakout. Wrapping Up A potential Cardano ETF could give ADA the push it needs to break through key resistance levels, while Stellar’s technical patterns suggest a possible rally to $0.4292. Both projects offer compelling reasons to watch closely, but Web3Bay is presenting a different kind of opportunity. With its focus on RWAs, NFTs, and a seamless marketplace model, Web3Bay is aiming to redefine digital asset trading. As it continues its presale, currently in Stage 5 with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524, early investors could find themselves well-positioned as the platform gains traction.

As reported by Reuters on Mar. 6, the move, which grants a one-month exemption for U.S. automakers, eased concerns that the trade war could damage domestic manufacturing and weighed on the dollar, fueling demand for risk assets like crypto. The decision came after Trump met with executives from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Investors see the delay as an indication that tariffs may not cause as much economic disruption as anticipated. According to the price tracker on crypto.news, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is currently trading at $91,651, up 5% over the last 24 hours. The broader crypto market also advanced, gaining 2% amid improved risk sentiment. Although it is still in the “Extreme Fear” zone, the Fear and Greed Index increased 5 points to 25, indicating that investors are still being cautious. Crypto-related stocks also saw significant gains, with Coinbase (COIN) rising 4% and MicroStrategy (MSTR) jumping 12%%. At the same time, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell to its lowest level since November, historically a bullish signal for Bitcoin.

As confidence in XRP wavers, Web3Bay continues to gain traction, raising over $1.6 million in its presale as investors seek assets with stronger long-term potential. With XRP slipping and Web3Bay gaining momentum, many are asking: Could Web3Bay be the more reliable choice amid crypto market fluctuations? XRP’s $350 Million Decline Sparks Investor Concerns XRP has been hit hard, shedding more than 7% of its value as it struggles to hold key support levels. This steep sell-off comes as part of a larger crypto downturn, with Bitcoin dipping below $90,000 and Ethereum struggling to maintain its $2,500 support. Market uncertainty has been compounded by the recent collapse of the LIBRA project and the $1.6 billion Bybit hack, creating widespread caution among investors. Data from on-chain analytics shows that XRP’s market cap suffered a $350 million reduction, leaving traders on edge. Analysts warn that if XRP fails to break back above its resistance zone, the asset could face more downside pressure, potentially testing the $1.80 range in the near future. Web3Bay’s $1.6 Million Presale Success Defies Market Trends While XRP battles volatility, Web3Bay continues to capture attention with its impressive presale momentum. Investors looking for stable, high-growth opportunities are turning to Web3Bay, which has now surpassed $1.6 million in funding, demonstrating strong demand for projects with practical applications. Web3Bay is not just another token; it is designed as a decentralized e-commerce solution aimed at reshaping online transactions. By cutting out middlemen, lowering transaction fees, and giving users full control over purchases, Web3Bay presents a clear use case that sets it apart from speculative assets. Unlike XRP, which is heavily influenced by regulatory uncertainties and shifting market sentiment, Web3Bay operates on a model that directly ties its value to real-world adoption. This has made it one of the fastest-growing crypto presales of 2025, with over 390 million tokens already sold. Web3Bay vs. XRP—Which Crypto Holds Greater Potential? One of the key concerns for XRP holders is its struggle to maintain consistent momentum. Despite occasional price spikes, XRP remains highly dependent on external factors such as institutional interest and regulatory decisions. Web3Bay, on the other hand, offers a more structured investment opportunity. Unlike XRP, which relies on market speculation, Web3Bay’s value is driven by adoption in the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. The project’s presale structure also provides a predictable growth path, ensuring that early investors benefit from progressive price increases. Currently, 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.004562, and investors who secure their holdings now stand to benefit significantly. With projections indicating potential returns exceeding 4,200%, Web3Bay presents an alternative that combines utility with high-growth potential. Final Thoughts—Which Crypto Stands Out? As XRP faces a steep decline and overall market volatility remains high, investors are seeking safer and more rewarding opportunities. Web3Bay has positioned itself as a leading option, proving that projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications continue to attract smart investors, even in uncertain times. While XRP may regain its footing, its unpredictable nature makes it a riskier bet compared to Web3Bay’s structured growth model. With $1.6 million already raised and investor interest continuing to rise, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the top crypto opportunities of 2025. With the next presale price increase approaching, the question remains: Will you secure your Web3Bay tokens now or miss out on what could be one of the biggest opportunities in the market?

Gox Moves $1 Billion in Bitcoin Amid Market Turmoil and New Tariffs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mt. Gox, the bankrupt crypto exchange, has started moving Bitcoin again. As per a latest update from Arkham Intelligence, on March 6, 12,000 BTC, worth over $1 billion, was transferred from its wallet (1PuQB), with a transaction fee was just $1.64. At the same time another 166.5 BTC, worth around $15 million, was sent to Mt. Gox’s cold wallet (1Jbez). The remaining Bitcoin was moved to an unknown wallet (1Mo1n), which now holds 11,834 BTC. ARKHAM ALERT: MT GOX MOVING $1B $BTC pic.twitter.com/VpIkHdJQkl — Arkham (@arkham) March 6, 2025 Mt. Gox-linked accounts now hold 36,080 BTC, worth around $3.26 billion, according to Arkham data. This is the first major Bitcoin move from Mt. Gox wallets in a month. The last transfer was only 4 BTC between cold wallets. It’s unclear what the recent transaction was for. In December, Mt. Gox moved about 1,620 BTC through unknown wallets, just two weeks after transferring over 24,000 BTC. The Bitcoin move happened during a week of market ups and downs, caused by new trade tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump, which began on March 4. These tariffs shook high-risk assets like crypto. Bitcoin’s price fluctuated a lot, going from a high of $94,770 on March 3, to a low of $82,681 on March 4. By March 5, Bitcoin had bounced back to over $90,000. New Repayment Deadline Mt. Gox, founded in 2010, quickly grew to become the largest bitcoin exchange by 2013, handling 70% of global bitcoin trades. However, in early 2014, it stopped withdrawals and trading. The platform shut down soon after, and the company filed for bankruptcy, losing over 800,000 BTC. Thousands of creditors are still waiting for their bitcoin to be returned. In October 2024, Mt. Gox announced a new repayment deadline of October 31, 2025.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ARKM|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 03:02:20

The battle between traditional government-issued currencies and cryptocurrency reshapes the financial ecosystem. This is forcing individuals, businesses, and policymakers to rethink the very nature of money itself. While fiat currencies have ruled for centuries under government control, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are challenging this monopoly, presenting a borderless, censorship-resistant alternative. But are cryptocurrencies the future of finance, or do they remain a speculative asset vulnerable to volatility and regulatory crackdowns? This article breaks down the core differences between crypto and fiat, looking at their impact on economic stability, inflation, security, and global adoption. Origin and Control: Who’s in Charge? The key difference between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies is who controls them. Fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR), are government-issued and centrally regulated. Their supply is controlled through monetary policies, such as interest rate adjustments and money printing. Fiat currencies also have unlimited supplies, as governments can print more m… The post Cryptocurrency vs. Government Currency: What’s the Difference? appeared first on Coin Edition .",Learn|News|Cryptocurrency 101,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-03-06 03:26:18

XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has formed a bullish cup-and-handle price action pattern in the four-hour timeframe and is on the verge of a breakout. Amid ongoing price fluctuations, the price has reached the neckline of the pattern. Based on recent price action and historical trends, if the asset breaks out of the pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $2.55 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 12% to reach the $2.83 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View However, the neckline of the pattern coincides with the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in the same timeframe, which also acts as a resistance level. Current Price Momentum XRP is currently trading near $2.52, having registered a modest gain of 1.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 45%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. $13 Million Worth of XRP Inflow The potential reason behind XRP’s struggle to gain momentum is the ongoing inflow from the exchanges. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , investors and long-term holders have potentially offloaded nearly $13 million worth of XRP tokens onto exchanges. This substantial outflow onto exchanges is currently causing prices to struggle, as it has the potential to create selling pressure and drive downside momentum. XRP’s Major Liquidation Levels At press time, traders betting on the long side are currently dominating, while those betting on the short side appear exhausted. Traders are over-leveraged at $2.40, having built $57 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $2.55 is an over-leveraged level where traders have built $8.50 million worth of short positions.

The coin is now inching closer to the $2 mark, recovering from a major drop from its all-time high of $3. Currently, Pi Coin is trading between $1.70 and $1.95, sparking hope among investors for a potential rebound to its peak value. The broader cryptocurrency market remains volatile, with major coins like Bitcoin influencing the price of Pi Coin. Despite this, Pi Coin has established itself as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, even without being listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. The immediate support level for Pi Coin is at $1.60. If selling pressure continues, this level could be tested once again, following recent market trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below 50, signaling weak bullish momentum. Pi Network’s Growing Presence and Potential Analyst Kim Wong said that Pi Network stands out among crypto projects for its aim to build a functional digital economy, allowing Pi coins to be used in real-world transactions, such as purchasing goods and services, and powering decentralized applications (dApps).

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,350 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh upward move above the $2,220 support zone. The price is trading above $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key rising channel forming with support at $2,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,275 and $2,350 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Eyes A Comeback Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $2,350 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $2,220 and $2,250 support levels. A low was formed at $2,003 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,150 and $2,200 resistance levels. It even tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a key rising channel forming with support at $2,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,275 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,340 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,340 resistance might send the price toward the $2,420 resistance. An upside break above the $2,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,500 resistance zone or even $2,550 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,275 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,240 level. The first major support sits near the $2,220 zone. A clear move below the $2,130 support might push the price toward the $2,080 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,050 support level in the near term.

In a recent presentation, Pal walked through a range of macroeconomic indicators, historical price behaviors, and liquidity metrics that he says paint a compelling picture for an extended uptrend in digital assets. Bitcoin Bull Market Depends On M2 At the heart of Pal’s thesis lies the notion of Global M2 money supply, a metric tracking the total liquidity in circulation worldwide. Pal observed that Bitcoin, along with other risk-on assets, tends to correlate closely with changes in Global M2. “If this is the case, then M2 is going to keep going up all f***ing year. If that is the case, then crypto and risk assets like tech will do well all year.” By comparing current liquidity trends to those seen in 2017—when the dollar weakened considerably and equity markets soared in US President Donald Trump’s first term—Pal argues that the macro backdrop appears similarly poised for expansion. According to him, if major economies continue easing, it may drive the next phase of explosive crypto growth. Related Reading: Inverse Head And Shoulders Breakout Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Headed To $300,000 Pal’s thesis revolves around the impact of global liquidity, particularly the role of Global M2 money supply as a leading indicator for Bitcoin and risk assets. He presented a correlation between Global M2 growth and crypto market performance, stating: “If this is the case, then M2 is going to keep going up all f***ing year. If that is the case, then crypto and risk assets like tech will do well all year.” His analysis draws parallels to 2017, when Trump’s fiscal policies and monetary easing led to a prolonged period of dollar weakness, which fueled the crypto cycle. Similar conditions are unfolding now, with expectations of rate cuts and stimulus measures. A crucial factor in Pal’s extended bull market thesis is the business cycle, which he tracks through the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Index. Historically, an ISM reading above 50 signals economic expansion, which correlates with Bitcoin’s price surges. He noted: “Bitcoin goes up as the ISM goes up If the ISM gets up to its normal cycle peak of somewhere between 56 and 65, that will give us the magnitude of the rise in Bitcoin.” Pal suggested that if ISM continues its upward trajectory, Bitcoin’s price could exceed $300,000 or higher. However, he refrained from making precise forecasts, emphasizing that probabilities, not certainties, drive market analysis. Addressing the altcoin market, Pal maintained that Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) remain key components of his portfolio. Despite Solana’s recent drawdown of over 53%, he dismissed fears of a long-term decline: “Solana has overshot versus global M2 […]Solana should outperform Bitcoin for the rest of the cycle and Ethereum too, with Sui outperforming Solana.” His broader view on altcoins is based on risk appetite shifts as financial conditions ease. Historically, altcoins outperform Bitcoin in the latter half of the cycle when investors seek higher-beta opportunities. Pal criticized the notion that there will be no altcoin season in this cycle, stating, “That’s all f****ing nonsense.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s ‘KISS Of Death’? Arthur Hayes Warns Of Recession Before Surge Pal emphasized that large pullbacks are a feature, not a bug of crypto bull markets. He detailed past corrections, pointing out that the current cycle has seen seven 20%+ corrections while maintaining a 600% gain from the lows. He warned traders against leverage and panic selling, reinforcing his “Don’t F* This Up**” thesis: “To make the money, to unf*** your future, you’re going to have to learn to deal with volatility.” He compared the current correction to 2017, which saw multiple 30-40% pullbacks before peaking. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates that the market is the second most oversold in this cycle, suggesting a potential recovery in the coming months. Extending The Cycle To 2026 One of Pal’s most striking assertions is that the current cycle could extend into 2026 rather than peaking in 2025, as many analysts have projected. His reasoning is based on the prolonged period of economic stagnation before growth acceleration. He stated: “The business cycle is taking a long time below 50. It’s starting to expand now. That has probably extended the cycle into 2026.” While he clarified that this is not a prediction but a working hypothesis, the implications could be significant. A longer cycle would allow for higher valuations, a sustained investment influx, and a gradual rather than explosive blow-off top. Pal reiterated that the crypto market follows a predictable pattern, with a year-long “banana zone” of exponential growth. He noted that the current correction phase aligns with past cycles and should lead to a renewed rally by April-May. “We are now in correction phase one […] Then as we go into March, April, May, we start accelerating up again into the next phase of the banana zone.” However, he warned that investors should expect another major correction before the final market top, cautioning against overleveraging and late-cycle exuberance. Summarizing his outlook, Pal urged investors to maintain perspective and resist emotional trading. He emphasized the importance of long-term vision, proper portfolio construction, and patience: “You guys need patience more than anything else and need to understand markets […] Our futures are resting on the same thing.” At press time, BTC traded at $88,617.

The upcoming High Roller Mode will introduce crypto wagering with $CHILL, raising the stakes for both casual players and high-level competitors. SOL Arena integrates the dynamic, community-driven Solana ecosystem directly into the game, where memecoin projects, NFT communities, and token holders unite under shared teams. “Our vision is to merge casual gaming with degenerate memecoin activity and crypto network effects,” said James Au , CEO and Game Director of Chillchat, “to deliver an exciting new player experience that redefines the thrill of ‘winning’.” What’s Next? Token Launch and Mobile Play Following the Challengers NFT mint in February 2025 , SOL Arena’s next significant milestone is the launch of its ecosystem token, $CHILL, at the end of March.

In the first weeks of President Trump’s second administration, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, headed by the staunch Trump supporter and tech-billionaire Elon Musk, has uncovered a plethora of government misspending. Taking inspiration from President Trump’s money-saving agenda, Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, has filed a request to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to submit the total number of American tax dollars spent on crypto enforcement actions over the past four years. Coinbase Issues Public Record Request A La Doge The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by tech wizard Elon Musk, has made a clear impression on the crypto industry. After damning reports of government misspending came to light thanks to Mr Musk’s determination and grit to dismantle corruption in the US government, many others are now also questioning whether misspending could have occurred in other branches of government. Coinbase can now breathe a sigh of relief after the SEC dropped its latest enforcement case against the exchange. But no, says Coinbase: there's no time to relax. The exchange wants the SEC to offer a report detailing every dollar and resource it has devoted to enforcing and investigating the broader crypto industry in recent years. The exchange has taken the step to receive the information from the agency by filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request , aimed at getting hold of the SEC’s financials concerning enforcement actions against crypto firms. Detailed Request Coinbase’s request seeks clarification on the expenses the SEC incurred from April 17, 2021, to January 20, 2025, linked to investigations into crypto activities. Coinbase’s request is comprehensive and seeks to include various aspects surrounding the SEC’s actions, including: The number of investigations launched against crypto firms; Number of employees involved in the enforcement actions; Additional detail on third-party contractors engaged in enforcements and investigations; Total and complete financial expenditures on these actions. Paul Grewal took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to speak further about these actions. In a thread, Grewal posted: We know the previous @SECgov ’s regulation-by-enforcement approach cost Americans innovation, global leadership, and jobs, but how much did it cost in taxpayer dollars? Today @Coinbase submitted a FOIA request asking the SEC to explain how much its war on crypto cost taxpayers.… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 3, 2025 Adding; “What do we hope to find out? How many investigations and enforcement actions were brought – and how much they cost; how many employees worked on these investigations/enforcement actions – and how much they cost; how many third-party contractors were used in these investigations/enforcement actions – and how much they cost.” Adding; “We also want to know more about the previous SEC’s infamous “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit” within the Enforcement Division – what was their budget, how many employees worked on it, how much did those employee hours cost?” Concluding with the following statement: “We’ll never stop fighting for government transparency on behalf of our customers and this industry. It may take time to get the full picture, but I think we’ve shown that we will do what it take for as long as it takes. You can read our FOIA request here.""

This first-of-its-kind event is expected to play a crucial role in the future of U.S. crypto policy, possibly launching a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Several key figures in the industry, including members of former President Donald Trump’s crypto task force, are expected to attend. However, as the guest list has started to take shape, one notable name is missing: Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson. According to Unchained, a White House source confirmed that Hoskinson was not invited to the summit, nor has Cardano been involved in any policy discussions or meetings with the administration. “They are running around town trying to push their own sort of narrative. They are not involved in anything about trying to influence policy and they are not invited to Friday’s summit,” the White House source told Unchained. Hoskinson’s absence is particularly surprising given recent comments from President Trump. On Sunday, Trump mentioned that Cardano’s ADA, would be part of a crypto reserve, which led many to expect Hoskinson’s attendance at the event. Confirmed Guests for the Summit Despite the exclusion of Hoskinson, several high-profile crypto industry leaders will be in attendance. The confirmed guest list includes: Brad Garlinghouse – CEO of Ripple Michael Saylor – Founder of MicroStrategy David Bailey – CEO of Bitcoin Magazine Matt Huang – Co-founder of Paradigm JP Richardson – CEO of Exodus Kyle Samani – Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital Zach Witkoff – Co-founder of World Liberty Financial Sergey Nazarov – Co-founder of Chainlink Brian Armstrong – CEO of Coinbase Vlad Tenev – CEO of Robinhood Arjun Sethi – CEO of Kraken Kris Marszalek – CEO of Crypto.com Hoskinson had previously hinted that he might attend a fundraising dinner for the pro-crypto PAC MAGA Inc., but the White House confirmed that he was not invited to that event either. Key Focus of the Summit The summit is set to run from 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET on March 7 and will be led by David Sacks, President Trump’s appointed AI and crypto czar. One of the main points of discussion will be the handling of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated in a recent interview that Bitcoin would be treated differently than other altcoins, as it is a significant part of President Trump’s crypto strategy.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 04:04:17

The price is now rising and might clear the $2.550 resistance zone. XRP price started a decent upward move from the $2.20 support zone. The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.480 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it clears the $2.550 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.80 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.60 and $2.50 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $2.25. Finally, the bulls appeared near the $2.20 support zone. A base is forming and the price is now recovering losses above $2.30. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.00 swing high to the $2.211 low.

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level. The next resistance is $2.70 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.00 swing high to the $2.211 low. A clear move above the $2.70 resistance might send the price toward the $2.80 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.880 resistance or even $2.920 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.480 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.40 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.40 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.320 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone.

The price of Cardano has soared by more than 40% from last week and analysts think ADA is not done yet . RTX has entered the PayFi market as a stealthy competitor against established altcoins like Stellar and Ripple while offering promising profit potential. Let us examine Cardano price current growth trend alongside Remittix’s discreet market rise in 2025. Current Cardano price Data Points Toward Positive Outlook; ADA Will Surpass The $2 mark. Cardano has taken the spotlight following President Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement. Cardano experienced an 80% price increase within two hours when it joined BTC, ETH, XRP and SOL on the exchange platforms which caused widespread market interest.. The Cardano price currently maintains a price at $1 while its market capitalization has reached $36.16 billion with $4.8 billion in daily trading volume. ADA has risen to $1 from its previous position at $0.64 thus becoming the reserve’s most successful cryptocurrency with strong recovery. Many analysts predict a 200% price increase for Cardano while forecasting it will reach $2.2 by mid-2025 and $3 by year end. The reserve introduces a pioneering approach that might prompt worldwide acceptance of its model. The announcement’s pro-crypto vibe has fueled this Cardano price upward rally. Cardano’s price strength shines with a circulating supply of 35.94 billion ADA. Public discussions link Cardano’s current market rise above the other reserve coins to its sustainable blockchain technology and smart contract capabilities. Market experts warn that the $2 billion FTX unlock process may yet harm price gains but the Cardano price outlook stays optimistic at this time. Remittix Is The Low Profile Potential PayFi Powerhouse Of 2025 The rising popularity of Cardano does not overshadow Remittix (RTX) as it develops its distinct market position. Remittix presale initiated at $0.0694 successfully attracted almost $13.5 million while attracting more than 30,000 holders who have purchased over 515 million tokens which increased 362% from its initial price of $0.015. Remittix stands apart from ordinary altcoins because it leads the PayFi movement. Users will be able to send cryptocurrency which automatically transforms into national currencies available in more than 30 different countries at affordable rates. The platform serves as a financial bridge for freelancers and families who want to avoid bank expenses while aiming at the $190 trillion global remittance sector. Cardano’s $30+ billion cap towers higher than RTX’s current presale numbers, but this just means Remittix’s room for growth is way higher and price changes will feel more agile and earn bigger yields. Remittix operates through practical methods while Cardano relies on reserve-driven boosts for its operations. Remittix provides an innovative solution that connects cryptocurrency transactions to traditional cash flow while delivering a new approach. Looking Forward; Why Remittix Will Soar Past $0.5 Soon What’s Remittix’s deal? Money transfer process is straightforward because cryptocurrency converts instantly into traditional money without bank delays. Cross-border workers along with families who need to transfer funds overseas benefit from Remittix by saving their wallet funds from unnecessary fees. The steady climb of Remittix price from its current position under 10 cents to reach $0.5 offers investors a more dependable investment opportunity than Cardano price gains. The market scarcity of RTX tokens may increase their value because demand continues to grow. Jump aboard RTX presale right now before the opportunity runs away.

Dogecoin, Cardano & XYZVerse Surge as Key Indicator Flashes Bullish",https://nulltx.com/1-target-in-sight-dogecoin-cardano-xyzverse-surge-as-key-indicator-flashes-bullish/,"Could Dogecoin, Cardano, and XYZVerse be on the brink of a major breakout? These digital assets have experienced a significant surge, boosted by a crucial market signal pointing toward bullish momentum. With prices climbing and key thresholds in sight, the stage is set for potential landmark achievements. What implications might this have for the broader market? XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin’s Wild Ride: From Meme to Crypto Sensation Dogecoin began in 2013 as a joke. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it used the Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin was designed to be plentiful, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. At first, it was just a “memecoin.” But in 2021, its value skyrocketed. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, reaching a market value over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media and support from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s rise showed the power of community and how the internet can influence finance. Dogecoin’s technology is simple. It doesn’t have features like smart contracts. But its strength is in its community and widespread appeal. In the current market, some investors still find Dogecoin attractive because of its active fanbase. However, its unlimited supply means it may not hold value as well as coins with a fixed supply, like Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies offer more advanced technology and real-world uses. But if the social media buzz continues, Dogecoin could stay strong. Its story reminds us that in crypto, fun and community can drive value as much as technology. Cardano’s ADA: The Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrency Changing the Game Cardano is a rising star in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible and sustainable blockchain designed for smart contracts. Developers can build apps, create crypto tokens, and design games on it. Its coin, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake ADA on the network. Cardano stands out because it’s eco-friendly. It uses Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake system that saves energy compared to traditional methods. Cardano’s innovation lies in its two-layer system: one for transactions, one for smart contracts. This design could allow it to process up to a million transactions per second. Since March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market, ADA looks attractive due to its scalability and green approach. As concerns about energy use in crypto grow, Cardano’s solution is timely. While Ethereum has recently shifted to proof-of-stake, Cardano’s layered architecture and early adoption of these principles make it stand out, making ADA a promising option. Conclusion The bull run of 2025 boosts DOGE and ADA, but XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans in crypto.

Sui (SUI) Primed for Rebound Despite Recent Dips Sui is currently priced between $2.66 and $3.59, facing a dip but holding on. The price has dropped over the past month and week, but a six-month rise of nearly 200% shows resilience. The RSI suggests it’s undervalued, presenting a potential for growth. The current nearest resistance lies just under $4, and if Sui breaks this, it might aim for $4.91. With improving technical indicators, a rebound could drive a price increase of over 30% from current levels. Support holds at $2.13 to protect further dips. While recent trends show a fall, signs of a possible altcoin season bring hope for Sui’s rise. Mantle Set to Soar or Stumble: Crypto’s Underdog Tale Mantle (MNT) is dancing between $0.68 and $0.90, showing some mixed signals. The MACD is in the red, implying caution. But, the RSI at 46.46 suggests it’s nearing a potential bounce. For now, the price looks pressured, having dropped more than 10% in a week. In the next move, breaking the $1.02 resistance could trigger a rally, possibly taking it up near the $1.24 mark, a 38% leap from current levels. However, slipping past the $0.58 support might spell more trouble. Momentum indicators show sideways movement. It’s a waiting game for now, and crypto enthusiasts are eager to see where this coin goes next. Conclusion While SUI and MNT show limited short-term potential amid market pressures, Catzilla presents itself as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility in governance, incentives, and staking, Catzilla unites enthusiasts to dismantle toxic systems.

Two standout projects have recently emerged for those looking to dive into this vibrant sector: Arctic Pablo Coin and Pudgy Penguins. Each offers distinct features and potential benefits for investors seeking the top meme coins to invest in this week. Arctic Pablo Coin: Embarking on a Frosty Financial Expedition Imagine traversing icy tundras, uncovering mystical secrets hidden beneath snow-covered lands. That’s the story of Arctic Pablo ($APC), a meme coin designed to turn myths into money. As Pablo travels through legendary locations, each presale phase offers a piece of this adventurous narrative, transforming every coin into more than just currency—it’s a ticket to a mythical journey. Arctic Pablo’s presale is ingeniously structured around Pablo’s expedition, with each phase representing a new location on his map. Currently, the presale has reached ChillVille, the 13th phase, with tokens priced at $0.000070. Early investors have a golden opportunity, as the launch price is set at $0.008, offering a staggering potential return on investment (ROI) of over 11,285.71% from this stage to the listing price. For instance, a $1,000 investment now would yield approximately 14,281,270 APCs, which could be worth $114,250.16 upon launch. Arctic Pablo employs a deflationary token burn mechanism to enhance scarcity and value. Unsold tokens are permanently eliminated weekly during the presale, and any remaining tokens post-presale will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment. This strategy aims to boost investor value and ensure long-term sustainability. Additionally, Arctic Pablo offers a staking program with an attractive 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Investors can stake their APC tokens and watch their investments grow, with all staked coins vested for two months from the launch date. This initiative rewards holders and encourages long-term commitment to the project. Arctic Pablo places a strong emphasis on community involvement. The project offers referral incentives, allowing participants to earn rewards by inviting others to join the journey. This approach fosters a collaborative environment and accelerates the project’s growth by leveraging the power of community networks. It is one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week. Pudgy Penguins: From NFTs to Meme Coin Stardom Pudgy Penguins began as a collection of 8,888 unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain in August 2021. The project quickly gained traction, becoming a cultural icon within the crypto community. In April 2022, Pudgy Penguins underwent acquisition by Luca Schnetzler for a sum of 750 ETH, equivalent to $2.5 million at the time. Building on its NFT success, Pudgy Penguins introduced its official coin, PENGU. This move allowed the ever-expanding Pudgy Penguin fanbase and the hundreds of millions of people outside of crypto to join “The Huddle.” PENGU is a symbol for community, memes, and good vibes. As of March 5, 2025, PENGU is trading at approximately $0.006743, with a 24-hour trading volume of $104,977,998.07. The token reached an all-time high of $0.06845 on December 17, 2024, and has since experienced a decline of about 90.4%. Despite this, the community remains bullish, with 89% expressing positive sentiment towards PENGU. Conclusion: Seizing the Meme Coin Moment Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin and Pudgy Penguins stand out as top meme coins to invest in this week. Arctic Pablo offers a unique adventure-driven narrative, structured presale phases with escalating prices, a deflationary token burn mechanism, and a lucrative staking program with 66% APY.

It forms a bullish pattern on the 4-hour chart, but there’s no assurance if it will come into play. Altcoins are back in a recovery mode after witnessing a serious downfall after opening short this week. However, Link remains bearish on the daily chart but has managed to stay above $13 over the past week. This price level is now considered as support. The recovery came after witnessing a dramatic sell-off from $17.5 two days ago. The bulls intercepted the drops yesterday and pushed back. They are now taking charge on the day. Though the pressure is not strong yet to consider a buy. A push above the previous weekly high should set the stage for retracement before resuming bearish. On the 4-hour chart, Link signals a potential bullish move with a double-bottom formation, but it is not certain if it will play out. A break above its neckline should validate a temporary shift while the buyers regroup. Losing the current holding support could invalidate the bullish move, hence advancing drops to a new multi-month low. Technically, the price has reached an oversold region on the daily chart. We can expect a small recovery while the trend remains bearish. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The main resistance level to watch for now is $17.5. If the price breaks higher, $19.8 is the next resistance to keep in mind, followed by $22.3. For pullback, there’s close support at $15.4. A break below the holding $13.1 support could slip the price to $11. If this level fails to produce a bounce, it may navigate $10 for support.

ETH experienced a rollercoaster performance earlier this week before rebounding with a 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This recovery follows a broader market correction that initially led to fear among investors. While Ethereum’s performance remains closely linked to Bitcoin’s price action, recent on-chain data suggests that ETH may enter a renewed accumulation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly RSI Drops To Lowest Level Since May 2022 – More Selling Pressure Ahead? MVRV Ratio and Institutional Accumulation Trends A post uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform by a contributor known as Mac has particularly pointed out Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which suggests the asset is currently undervalued. The latest data indicates that large-scale investors are increasing their ETH holdings, signaling potential support at key price levels. According to Mac, these accumulation patterns could influence Ethereum’s trajectory in the coming weeks. Mac revealed that the MVRV ratio, a key on-chain metric used to assess whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued, has fallen below 1 for Ethereum. Historically, such levels indicate an undervalued zone, meaning that Ethereum is trading close to the average purchase price of all holders, including institutional investors. ETH MVRV: Reaching a Highly Undervalued Zone “When MVRV falls below 1, it signals entry into an undervalued zone in the cycle, indicating an opportunity to buy at a level close to the average purchase price of all holders (including whale investors).” – By @MAC_D46035 pic.twitter.com/urj348TZng — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 5, 2025 The analyst also mentioned that in past market cycles, when Ethereum’s MVRV dropped below 1, it was followed by notable price recoveries. Additionally, there has been a surge in the number of ETH accumulation addresses—wallets that receive ETH but have never withdrawn. This suggests that large investors and institutions are strategically increasing their holdings, particularly at the current price range of $2,200–$2,300, where the realized price for whale investors is concentrated. This level is expected to act as a strong support zone, reinforcing the possibility of sustained accumulation. Market Conditions and Long-Term Ethereum Outlook Beyond accumulation trends, macroeconomic factors continue to play a role in shaping Ethereum’s price movements. Mac noted that liquidity policies in the US, particularly the Trump administration’s trade and monetary policies, have so far influenced risk asset performance, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Below Parallel Channel – Is ETH Collapsing To $1,250? Stricter monetary policies and inflation concerns could contribute to “sharp price drops.” Despite this possibility, Mac concluded, noting: However, Ethereum still maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is a proven network with thousands of mature DeFi projects. As such, institutional investors are likely to accumulate more in this undervalued zone. Therefore, from a long-term perspective, the outlook for Ethereum remains positive.

With president Donald Trump’s administration changing regulatory attitudes, a new SEC crypto task force in place, Coinbase is mapping out its execution strategy. Alesia Haas, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, confirmed the decision at the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference on Wednesday, saying Coinbase had originally wanted to go public with a security token. “We tried to go public with a security token. We tried to go public on our own products. And we could not, and we ran into brick walls,” said Alesia. “The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shut down those plans.” The SEC’s legal battle with Coinbase ended in a major court victory for the company last month. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong addressed this during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, saying, “We fully won that case. It was dismissed with prejudice. We did not pay a single dollar in settlement. We did not change a single aspect of our business.” So this victory cleared the way for Coinbase to pursue security tokens again. The company believes the current Congress is the most pro-crypto ever, with Trump pushing to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Brian said, “We have the House, the Senate, and the Executive all fully excited and aligned on this.” A key part of Coinbase’s regulatory focus is stablecoin legislation. Brian explained, “Creating stablecoin regulation will be a huge unlock for a digitized dollar.” Coinbase is also pushing for clear market structure laws to define which crypto assets count as commodities, securities, or payment stablecoins. In the earnings call, Brian described this as “key to understanding who is regulating you.” Payments are another major growth area. Brian told Coinbase shareholders that: “The majority of all payments are going to be happening on stablecoins eventually.” He pointed to the speed, low fees, and global reach of stablecoin transactions, adding, “Sending USDC on Base takes less than one second and costs less than one cent.” Coinbase’s revenue strategy and market expansion Brian laid out Coinbase’s 2025 priorities: driving revenue, expanding crypto utility, and scaling its infrastructure. The company’s trading, staking, and stablecoin businesses each pulled in over $700 million in 2024, and it is adding new features to grow those numbers in 2025. Coinbase is also expanding derivative trading and plans to support millions of tokens by integrating decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Brian said, “We’re adding best-in-class derivative trading support for customers that are power users or sensitive on fees.” Another important business area is Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), which Brian compared to Amazon Web Services (AWS). “This is what Amazon did with AWS, allowing our infrastructure to be utilized by third-party companies,” Brian said. He believes this could become a major revenue stream as more businesses integrate crypto APIs for custody, trading, staking, and payments. The company’s subscription service, Coinbase One, now has 600,000 paying subscribers. Brian described it as “Amazon Prime for crypto”, saying, “It creates a sticky customer. Once they become a Coinbase One member, they do more trading volume with us.” The service offers zero-fee trading, improved rewards, and premium support, which Coinbase says will help lock in users. Alesia jumped in to explain that international expansion as another revenue driver. Just last December, Coinbase secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider license in Argentina and the UK and is working on a MiCA license in Europe. Brian pointed out that Coinbase now has a repeatable playbook for entering new markets. “Every market we entered two years ago—Brazil, Canada, Australia, Singapore—has already become profitable.” Coinbase’s next steps and future priorities With a war chest of $9 billion, Coinbase is looking at acquisitions too. Alesia described the company as “the most acquisitive in crypto” and said it evaluates deals based on customer growth, new licenses, and talent acquisition. “We have always had an appetite for M&A. And it’s in support of our product road map and is in support of: Can we add customers? Can we add assets? Can we add products? Can we add licenses? Can we add talent? And so the tuck-ins that you mentioned, we’re really pleased to find opportunities to add talent that can accelerate our product roadmap,” Alesia said. Coinbase is also strengthening its policy efforts. The company’s StandWithCrypto.org now has 2 million voters advocating for pro-crypto candidates, with a goal of 4 million by midterm elections in America next year. Brian said, “We’re going to continue to donate to Fairshake, the Super PAC that had excellent results in the last election.” Looking ahead, Brian said the biggest challenge is focus. “We have too many opportunities in front of us to pursue simultaneously.” Alesia agreed, saying, “We need to make sure we are marching towards our biggest priorities and not getting distracted.” Brian then told shareholders, “And so we try not to get caught up in the hype, but we also try not to get caught up in any despair when it happens in crypto. And right now, I’d say we’re more in like danger of being in hype. It’s a very positive moment. And so we’re just being very deliberate about how we grow this business, how we allocate capital to the next year.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $635 resistance. BNB price is moving higher above the $585 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $595 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $600 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $588 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Surge After forming a base above the $550 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $565 and $570 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $588 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $637 swing high to the $548 low. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $600 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. However, the bears seem to be active near the $605 and $606 levels. The price is now trading above $600 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $606 level. The next resistance sits near the $616 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $637 swing high to the $548 low. A clear move above the $616 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $635. A close above the $634 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $665 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $606 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $600 level. The next major support is near the $595 level. The main support sits at $588. If there is a downside break below the $588 support, the price could drop toward the $570 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.

Forget waiting for Bitcoin to double in five years. The real game is in fast-moving, community-driven tokens with explosive potential. Enter BTFD Coin, Gigachad, and Ponke—three meme coins you need to have on your radar right now. BTFD Coin’s presale is in full swing, with the Bulls stampeding toward the finish line. Over $6.26 million has already been raised, with Stage 14 nearly sold out. That means two things: 1) You need to move FAST, and 2) There’s still time to double your tokens using the LAUNCH100 bonus code . But don’t blink, or you might miss it. It’s time to break down why this meme coin (and its wild Bulls Squad) is leading the pack, and why Gigachad and Ponke are also worth a serious look. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad’s Charge Toward Crypto Glory You know what they say—Buy The Dip. That’s exactly what BTFD Coin is all about: taking advantage of opportunities when others hesitate. And right now? This is one of those moments. Stage 14 of the presale is almost sold out, and once it hits the exchanges, analysts predict an opening price of $0.0006, with moonshot potential to $0.006—that’s a jaw-dropping 3650% ROI if you get in now at $0.00016. The Bulls Squad: Your Crypto Hype Team Picture this: You’ve got $3,000 sitting in your wallet, wondering where to go. Enter the Bulls Squad—a team of four mascots designed to hype up the BTFD ecosystem. Baby Bull is all about growth, stacking your early investment into serious gains. Raging Bull rides the market waves with power moves. Nerdy Bull breaks down the data so you don’t have to, and Peoples Bull? He’s the ultimate community leader, keeping the Bulls united. Now, do some math (don’t worry, Nerdy Bull’s got you covered). $3,000 at today’s presale price ($0.00016) gets you 18.75 million BTFD tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that stash turns into $11,250. If it rockets to $0.006? You’re looking at $112,500. Not bad for a meme coin backed by a rock-solid community and an insane 100% bonus using the LAUNCH100 code. BTFD’s Secret Weapon: Staking & Play-to-Earn BTFD has an actual ecosystem that rewards investors at every corner. Staking rewards? 90% APY . A Play-to-Earn game? Yep, and it feeds right back into the BTFD economy. Plus, in a bearish market, securing a low-entry price during presale is a genius move. This presale is closing fast. Don’t sleep on this opportunity—BUY NOW. Gigachad: The Alpha Energy of Crypto If you’ve spent any time online, you know the Gigachad meme—the epitome of confidence and dominance. That’s exactly what the Gigachad crypto project is all about. Trading at $0.018203 with a market cap of over $169 million, Gigachad has carved out a space for itself with a meme-backed identity that screams power. With a maximum supply of 10 billion tokens and only 9.3 billion in circulation, scarcity could drive the price higher. The last 24 hours have been a bit red, but if you’re a true Gigachad, you know that dips are where the magic happens. If you’re looking for the best cryptos for beginners with established credibility, high liquidity, and a devoted following, Gigachad is a strong bet. Ponke: The Meme Coin with the Tightest Community Community is everything in meme coin culture, and Ponke has it locked down. With a market cap of $65 million and a circulating supply of 555.5 million tokens, this one is all about holding strong and growing together. Ponke’s price is sitting at $0.117658, and with a 24-hour trading volume of over $8 million, it’s clear the market is watching. This token is driven by a dedicated army of holders who believe in the long-term value of the Ponke ecosystem. If you’re after a meme coin that thrives on trust, stability, and long-term momentum, Ponke could be your pick. Claiming the BTFD Coin 100% Bonus: Here’s How Visit the presale page .

The cycle repeats itself, time and time again, with a level of predictability that borders on comforting. A meme coin takes off, a new wave of speculation follows, and the game resets. Now, we find ourselves at the start of another cycle. Doge Uprising ($DUP) is surging as its presale gains momentum, while Pudgy Penguins and Peanut the Squirrel steady themselves and try to stop the bleeding from last week. Which of these projects can turn speculative enthusiasm into something more substantial? Doge Uprising ($DUP): The Rising Power If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you know that meme coins are about more than just memes. The most successful projects tap into something deeper, something that extends beyond speculative trading and into the psychology of belonging. Doge Uprising understands this. Presale buyers are moving in quickly, and the demand is heating up as prices rise in each stage. Then there’s the 30% staking rewards, making $DUP not just a meme coin but an ecosystem that rewards long-term holders. A dystopian narrative that keeps engagement levels high—because storytelling, as much as tokenomics, drives the best crypto plays. A great meme coin needs to create its own gravity, a reason for people to stay. Doge Uprising is proving that it understands this game better than most. Pudgy Penguins: The Blue-Chip Meme Project That Refuses to Die There was a time when Pudgy Penguins NFTs were the underdog, the long shot, the unexpected breakout. Now, though, the brand is established, and the Pudgy narrative remains one of resilience rather than meteoric rise. It certainly needs its resilience this week after an 18% drop, which compounds its 88% fall from a peak of $0.05738. Pudgy Penguins’ belligerent holders hope and pray that it won’t fade away anytime soon. Regardless, the real high-reward plays aren’t found in established projects, no matter how they’re faring—they’re found in projects on the rise. Peanut the Squirrel: A Wild Card in the Meme Market Every meme coin needs a gimmick. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) has one, and it’s exactly what you’d expect. The narrative here is simple: Squirrels hoard nuts, traders hoard tokens. It’s the kind of self-aware absurdity that crypto traders eat up. And to be fair, PNUT has a shot at becoming a sleeper hit. Compared to all the red seen across the market this week, PNUT has flown back up almost 20%. It’s small-cap and under the radar, which means the room for growth is substantial. It plays into the accumulation meme—perfect for a market addicted to narratives. But it lacks the structured mechanics of Doge Uprising, meaning its success is purely hype-dependent. Why Doge Uprising Has the Edge in 2025 The difference between a coin that pumps and a coin that lasts is utility. That’s where Doge Uprising pulls ahead. $DUP offers staking rewards, something neither Pudgy Penguins nor Peanut the Squirrel provides. $DUP has a structured presale, meaning early buyers aren’t left to battle whales post-launch. The crypto market moves fast, and new meme coins rise overnight. But Doge Uprising is making all the right moves at the right time, and that could make all the difference. Can Memes Make 100x Dreams?

The payments firm recently announced the National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA), a nonprofit aimed at educating the public about digital assets, with Ripple contributing $50 million in funding. Meanwhile, comments from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, reaffirming the company’s right to sell XRP for operational purposes have sparked debate among investors. Ripple’s XRP Sales Spark Investor Concerns Amid CTO’s Blunt Remarks Ripple Labs’ right to sell XRP tokens for operational capital has become a heated topic after the company’s chief technology officer (CTO), David Schwartz, confirmed that the company is not obligated to act in investors’ interests. His remarks, coupled with recent discoveries of massive XRP reserves linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, have stirred uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. The debate was ignited when Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, raised concerns about Ripple’s freedom to offload XRP tokens without obligation to token holders. In a March 5 post on X, Rochard wrote, “XRP isn’t a security because Ripple doesn’t actually owe you ‘utility’ or anything else.” “They are free to dump on you and you have no right to do anything about it other than join them in dumping XRP,” he warned, adding that investors should recognize they are “not investing in Ripple,” but rather receiving tokens “created out of thin air” with no guaranteed value. Rather than refuting Rochard’s claims, Ripple CTO David Schwartz—known by the online alias “JoelKatz”—surprised many by agreeing with the sentiment. He affirmed that Ripple has no obligation to XRP holders beyond its own business goals. “100% correct. IMO, Ripple can, will, and should act in its own interest,” Schwartz wrote. “You should not expect Ripple to act in your interest to the detriment of its own interest or those of its shareholders.” The blunt acknowledgment from a top executive has unsettled some investors, who fear that Ripple’s continued sales of XRP could exert downward pressure on the token’s price. Historically, large XRP sales by Ripple have sparked price declines, as increased token supply dilutes demand. Investor anxiety escalated further after blockchain investigator ZachXBT disclosed a previously dormant XRP wallet valued at over $7 billion. The massive holdings, potentially linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, have raised questions about the long-term intentions of early XRP stakeholders. “With the announcement of the US Crypto Reserve, here’s your reminder that XRP addresses activated by Chris Larsen still hold 2.7B+ XRP ($7.18B), and these addresses tied to him transferred $109M+ worth of XRP to exchanges in January 2025,” ZachXBT revealed in a March 3 Telegram post . While some XRP supporters believe Larsen may no longer have access to these funds—since most of the wallets have been inactive for over six years—others worry about the potential market impact if such a vast amount of XRP is sold. XRP’s Short-Lived Rally Amid Trump’s Crypto Reserve Proposal Despite the concerns surrounding Ripple’s XRP holdings, the token recently saw a price surge following news that US President Donald Trump had directed his Working Group on Digital Assets to include XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) in a proposed US strategic crypto reserve, alongside Bitcoin. The announcement triggered a temporary rally in the altcoin market, with XRP climbing to a high of $2.99 on March 2. However, the enthusiasm quickly faded, with the token retreating to $2.50 at the time of writing. Market analysts remain cautious about the sustainability of the rally, citing the need for congressional approval before any US government crypto reserve can be established. Aurelie Barthere, a principal research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, noted that the process could be prolonged and complex. “I think constituting a reserve by buying new tokens is a complex process that will need Congress’s vote, so it will take time. I would be a bit wary of the sustainability of today’s move,” Barthere said. As Ripple continues to assert its right to sell XRP for operational purposes, investor sentiment appears divided. On one hand, Ripple’s ability to generate liquidity through token sales helps sustain its operations and fund ecosystem developments. On the other, persistent sell pressure from Ripple and early stakeholders risks undermining long-term investor confidence in XRP. With regulatory scrutiny still looming over Ripple’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and questions surrounding the company’s influence over XRP’s supply, traders remain wary of future volatility. As the debate unfolds, the key takeaway from Schwartz’s comments is clear: Ripple will always act in its own interest. Whether that aligns with the interests of XRP holders is another matter entirely. Ripple Launches National Cryptocurrency Association With $50M Grant to Promote Crypto Education In related news, Ripple Labs has announced its involvement in launching a new nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public about cryptocurrency’s role in empowering individuals and businesses. The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) aims to provide accessible information on crypto adoption and ensure Americans stay informed about developments in the sector. The announcement, made on March 5 via X by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, revealed that he will serve as president of the nonprofit while continuing his legal duties at Ripple. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse further disclosed that the blockchain payments firm would fund the NCA with an initial $50-million grant to support its educational initiatives. According to the NCA’s official website, the organization has been established to help Americans understand cryptocurrency by sharing real-world adoption stories. While the group did not explicitly state any plans to directly engage in politics, it emphasized the importance of keeping the public informed about upcoming changes in the crypto industry. Despite these claims, Ripple has recently become increasingly active in political contributions, particularly in the United States. The company contributed $45 million to Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC) focused on influencing voter sentiment in the 2024 election cycle. Alderoty also personally donated $300,000 to a committee backing Donald Trump, further fueling speculation about Ripple’s political involvement. Additionally, both Alderoty and Garlinghouse met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January and later attended his inauguration events in Washington, DC, as official guests. The NCA is registered as a 501(c)(4) organization, a classification under US law that allows unlimited corporate and personal donations while remaining exempt from donor disclosure requirements. These types of organizations are often used for lobbying, issue advocacy, and political engagement, raising questions about whether the NCA could eventually take on a more political role in the crypto industry. The timing of the NCA’s launch coincides with major developments in the US regulatory landscape regarding cryptocurrency firms. Under Trump’s administration, the SEC has ended several high-profile enforcement actions, including lawsuits against Coinbase, Cumberland DRW, and Consensys. However, Ripple remains in legal limbo as the SEC continues to pursue its appeal in a $125-million judgment against the firm. While many crypto-related cases have been dropped, Ripple’s legal battle remains unresolved, making its recent political engagements and the formation of the NCA even more significant. XRP’s Role in the National Crypto Stockpile Proposal As Ripple navigates its ongoing legal battle, its ties to the Trump administration continue to deepen. CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed his attendance at a March 7 crypto summit at the White House, where discussions on the future of digital assets will take place. Perhaps most notably, Trump announced that XRP would be one of five cryptocurrencies included in the proposed “national crypto stockpile.” While the proposal has drawn enthusiasm from XRP supporters, many legal experts question its feasibility and legality. Critics argue that Congress would need to approve any such reserve, and government involvement in selecting specific cryptocurrencies could raise concerns over favoritism and regulatory overreach. Ripple’s moves in the political and regulatory spheres suggest a shift from being a blockchain payments firm to a major crypto policy influencer. Through the National Cryptocurrency Association, the company is positioning itself as an advocate for crypto education and regulatory clarity in the US. With a $50-million funding boost, the NCA has the potential to become a significant voice in shaping public perception and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency. However, its political undertones, ties to Trump, and Ripple’s ongoing SEC battle ensure that the organization’s true intentions will remain a topic of intense debate in the months ahead. As Ripple continues to assert its influence over crypto policy and regulation, the impact of the NCA and its broader implications for the future of digital assets in the US will be closely watched.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-06 05:30:00

Most new cryptocurrency users adopt centralized exchanges for coin storage, and their reasons are understandable. For instance, crypto exchanges are most users’ gateway into the crypto industry. They serve purposes like providing options to buy and trade cryptos easily. However, it is crucial to understand the inherent risks of leaving one’s crypto assets on such exchanges. Why Users Choose Centralized Exchanges Apart from buying and trading cryptos, most centralized exchanges provide extended services that benefit crypto users. Staking, lending, margin trading, and consistent liquidity represent some features that attract crypto users to centralized exchanges. Such users store their assets in custodial wallets on the exchanges to make it easy for them to carry out their activities.

Trump’s Reserve Plans On Sunday, President Trump shared some plans for the reserve on social media. He revealed that the reserve would include alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, SOL, and ADA. Trump later clarified that BTC and ETH, being valuable, would be the main focus of the Reserve.

In parallel, a heated debate over crypto regulation and national security unfolded in Congress, with Representative Sean Casten warning of crypto’s role in illicit finance, while Representative Warren Davidson pushed back by arguing for financial privacy. US Sanctions Darknet Marketplace Operator The United States imposed sanctions on Behrouz Parsarad, which is an Iran-based operator of the now-defunct darknet marketplace Nemesis, along with his cryptocurrency addresses, which recently benefited from Bitcoin price fluctuations. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on March 4 that Parsarad established Nemesis in 2021, and used it as a platform to facilitate the sale of drugs, false identification documents, hacking resources, and other illicit services catering to cybercriminals. (Source: US Department of The Treasury ) With the sanctions in place, US citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with Parsarad or any companies where he has more than a 50% stake. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the sanctioned assets include 44 Bitcoin and five Monero addresses that received more than $850,000 between July of 2022 and March of 2024. The total volume of cryptocurrency handled by Parsarad is estimated to exceed $1.6 million, largely due to price appreciation over time. The majority of Parsarad’s crypto transactions were tied to Nemesis, but he also sent over $12,000 to various darknet marketplaces like ASAP Market, Incognito Market, and Next Generation. His activities also showed indirect exposure to cryptocurrency mixers, which is a method often used to obscure the origin of illicit funds. OFAC revealed that before a joint US, German, and Lithuanian law enforcement operation shut down Nemesis and seized its servers in March 2024, the marketplace grew to host 30,000 active users and 1,000 vendors. The platform had built-in money laundering features that allowed criminals to conduct transactions with relative anonymity. (Source: Chainalysis ) In addition to providing a hub for cybercriminals, Parsarad was actively involved in laundering virtual currencies for narcotics traffickers and other illicit actors operating on Nemesis, according to OFAC. Authorities estimate that he amassed millions of dollars throughout the marketplace’s existence. Despite law enforcement actions, he reportedly continued efforts to re-establish his operations. While Western law enforcement agencies have cracked down on darknet marketplaces, the ecosystem is still highly active. TRM Labs’ 2025 Crypto Crime Report estimates that darknet markets generated more than $1.7 billion in revenue in 2024. This was only a slight increase from the previous year. Russian-language darknet marketplaces continue to dominate, benefiting from limited enforcement action by Russian authorities, while Western darknet markets face growing instability. The start of 2024 saw multiple high-profile exit scams , including the sudden disappearances of Bohemia Market and Cannabia Market in January, which Dutch authorities later linked to an ongoing investigation. In March, Incognito Market also collapsed under suspicious circumstances, with its administrator ”Pharoah” allegedly attempting to extort users before shutting down the platform. Despite the enforcement efforts and operational disruptions in Western markets, darknet marketplaces are very resilient, with new actors constantly trying to fill the void left by shuttered platforms. US Customs Releases Seized Bitcoin Miners US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reportedly began releasing Chinese-made crypto mining equipment after months of detainment at various ports of entry. According to Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, thousands of mining units have been released after the seizure of up to 10,000 units. Kulyk suggested that some CBP officials were intentionally creating obstacles for the Bitcoin mining sector. Ethan Vera , chief operating officer at Luxor Technology, confirmed that while some shipments were being released, the majority remained held. The delays primarily affected Bitmain Antminer application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and were reportedly linked to a US Department of Commerce investigation into Bitmain-related chip designer Sophgo. The investigation began in October when chips ordered by Sophgo in Taiwan were found in a Huawei AI processor. Huawei has been under US sanctions since 2019, though Sophgo denied having any business ties with the Chinese tech giant. Despite these issues, ASICs from other Chinese manufacturers were not affected by CBP’s actions. Some companies faced financial strain because of the prolonged detainment. One firm even reported in November that it accumulated over $200,000 in holding fees for 200 ASICs that are still awaiting release. The CBP’s actions were reportedly carried out at the request of the US Federal Communications Commission Agency, which only added another layer of regulatory scrutiny to the situation. (Source: Blockspace ) The release of the miners is happening during the Trump administration’s ongoing trade policies, including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. The administration's trade measures with Canada and Mexico are also proceeding as planned. Given that China supplies 98% of the chips used in crypto mining, the disruption in shipments posed very major concerns for the industry. Bitmain, which is the largest manufacturer of these chips, has since expanded its production into the US to mitigate future delivery issues, with hopes of strengthening partnerships in the sector. The United States still plays a dominant role in global Bitcoin mining operations, with almost 38% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate originating from the country. Additionally, four of the most valuable Bitcoin mining firms—MARA Holdings, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, and Riot Platforms—are based in the US. US Lawmakers Clash Over Crypto and National Security In the middle of these sanctions developments, US Representative Sean Casten expressed his concerns that crypto-friendly regulations pose a national security threat. Casten made this statement during a March 5 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee , while debating the “Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act of 2025.” He accused President Donald Trump and Elon Musk of weakening anti-money laundering laws and financial surveillance measures. He also argued that the proposed crypto regulations will make it nearly impossible to trace the origins of funds being transferred, and claimed that all ransomware attacks in the United States are funded by cryptocurrency . Casten even criticized his colleagues for advocating policies that will reduce oversight and make illicit financial activities easier to conduct. Representative Casten His comments drew a lot of criticism from pro-crypto Representative Warren Davidson, who pushed back against Casten’s stance. Davidson accused Casten of advocating for a surveillance state and argued that the US should not follow China’s example in regulating financial transactions. He urged lawmakers to uphold constitutional principles rather than expand government control over financial activities. The debate over financial surveillance happened during broader concerns about government overreach and digital privacy. In April of 2024, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden warned that the agency was on the verge of expanding its control over the internet. He pointed to changes in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the ambiguous definition of “electronic communications surveillance provider,” which he argued could compel people working with service providers to act as government surveillance agents. Snowden has long been critical of centralized digital systems and in November 2024, he called for decentralization as a safeguard against the dangers of concentrated digital power, including artificial intelligence. David Holtzman , a former military intelligence officer and chief strategy officer at Naoris, echoed Snowden’s warnings in December 2024. Holtzman argued that AI-driven surveillance poses an unprecedented threat to privacy and human freedom, and stated that decentralization is the only effective countermeasure against the rise of authoritarian digital control.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-06 05:36:19

However, it looks poised for a retracement but is yet to chart gains today. Doge went through a serious breakdown last week and charted a double-digit loss. It later managed to round up the week on a strong note after a bounce back from a low of $0.183. The primary meme coin encountered resistance and crossed into the new week bearish. It lost momentum but later reestablished support above the recent low due to a rejection. This led to a bounce and is now looking poised for a buy following a notable increase in the last 24 hours. A retracement movement is slowly underway. However, Doge’s bearish swing is still intact on the daily chart following a lower low and lower high movement from its peak level of $0.49. The potential retracement movement should bring a slight relief. Failure to push higher could bring another impulsive movement in the form of a lower low. This could lead to an extension of the bearish swing, which might cause another serious bleeding in the mid-term. While the bulls are yet to gain control of this market, the price must climb back above the previous monthly high before considering a shift in the trend. Having lost 52% in 90 days, Doge is currently indecisive. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview There has been little-to-no movement since the start of today. A surge from the current trading level could bring a retest at $0.24. Higher levels for a retracement are $0.305 and $0.4. Towards the downside, the $0.183 level is providing support. A crack from there may cause another roller coaster to $0.16 and maybe $0.13. Key Resistance Levels: $0.24, $0.305, $0.4 Key Support Levels: $0.183, $0.16, $0.13 Spot Price: $0.2 Trend: Bearish Volatility:Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On Mar. 2, Trump directed the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to create a reserve comprising key cryptocurrencies. While initial reports highlighted assets like Ripple ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ), Trump later clarified that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum would be central to the initiative. The move has sparked controversy, with some claiming that the reserve may increase the value of assets owned by Trump and his associates. According to reports, Trump and his cronies own more than 60% of WLFI, which raises questions regarding a potential conflict of interest. However, The Trump Organization claims that the president has distanced himself from commercial activities and has denied any misconduct. His children, a separate ethics attorney, and an outside investment firm currently supervise WLFI’s management. Despite these assurances, watchdog groups remain skeptical, pointing to past instances where Trump’s business and political interests appeared intertwined.

Now, imagine there’s a new highway built just for you—no traffic, no delays, just smooth sailing. That’s Avalanche (AVAX) in the world of crypto. It’s designed to be faster, cheaper, and more scalable than many of its competitors, including Ethereum. But does it live up to the hype? Let’s dive into everything you need to know about Avalanche. What is Avalanche? Avalanche is a blockchain platform that’s designed for speed, low transaction fees, and scalability. Think of it as Ethereum’s faster, younger cousin. It allows developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and even launch their own blockchains (subnets) while keeping everything running smoothly. It was built to solve some of the biggest problems in crypto: slow transaction speeds, high fees, and network congestion. Ethereum, for example, sometimes struggles with high fees and slow transactions during peak times. Avalanche aims to fix that by offering near-instant finality and extremely low costs. At its core, Avalanche has its own cryptocurrency called AVAX. It’s used for staking, paying fees, and securing the network. But the real magic of Avalanche lies in its unique structure. Unlike traditional blockchains, Avalanche operates on three different blockchains, each with a specific purpose. We’ll get into how that works in a bit. History of Avalanche Avalanche was created by Ava Labs, a company founded by Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell University professor and blockchain expert. The project started in 2018, and by 2020, it officially launched. Here’s a quick timeline: 2018 – The Avalanche consensus mechanism was first introduced by a team of researchers. 2019 – Ava Labs raised funding and started working on the network. 2020 – Avalanche launched its mainnet, making it publicly available. 2021 – Avalanche gained massive traction, with AVAX’s price skyrocketing and partnerships forming. Since then, it has become one of the top blockchains, attracting developers, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts. History of Avalanche 2018 – The Avalanche consensus mechanism was first introduced. 2019 – Ava Labs raised funding and started working. 2020 – Avalanche launched its mainnet. 2021 – Avalanche gained massive traction. How Does Avalanche Work? Unlike traditional blockchains, Avalanche doesn’t rely on a single chain. Instead, it uses three different chains to improve efficiency: X-Chain (Exchange Chain) – This handles asset creation and transfers, similar to how Bitcoin is used for transactions. C-Chain (Contract Chain) – This is where smart contracts are executed, making it compatible with Ethereum’s DApps. P-Chain (Platform Chain) – This manages validators and helps create custom subnets (individual blockchains). Why does this matter? Because by splitting tasks between these chains, Avalanche avoids congestion, making transactions super fast and cheap. For example, Ethereum processes around 15 transactions per second (TPS). Avalanche? It can handle over 4,500 TPS. That’s a game-changer. Advantages of Avalanche Avalanche has some major advantages that make it stand out: Speed – Transactions settle in less than two seconds. No more waiting for minutes or even hours. Low Fees – Compared to Ethereum’s sometimes ridiculous gas fees, Avalanche keeps costs low. Scalability – The network doesn’t slow down even when usage increases. Ethereum Compatibility – Developers can easily move their projects from Ethereum to Avalanche. Security – Avalanche’s unique consensus mechanism makes it more resistant to attacks. Eco-Friendly – Unlike Bitcoin, which uses proof-of-work (PoW), Avalanche uses proof-of-stake (PoS), which is much more energy-efficient. Disadvantages of Avalanche Competition – Ethereum, Solana, and others are also working on scalability solutions. Centralization Concerns – Some critics argue that a small number of validators control most of the AVAX supply. Adoption – While growing, it still needs more developers and projects to truly compete with Ethereum. Is Avalanche a Good Investment? This is the big question: should you invest in AVAX? Like any crypto, AVAX has had its ups and downs. It saw huge gains in 2021, reaching an all-time high of around $146. However, it also faced major corrections. Here’s why some investors are bullish: Strong technology – Avalanche’s speed and low fees make it attractive for DApps. Growing ecosystem – More projects are launching on Avalanche. Institutional interest – Big players are taking notice. But there are risks too: Crypto volatility – Prices can swing wildly. Regulatory uncertainty – Governments may crack down on crypto. Competition – Ethereum and others aren’t standing still. If you believe in Avalanche’s long-term potential, it could be a solid investment. But always do your research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Is Avalanche a Good Investment? Here’s why some investors are bullish: Strong technology Growing ecosystem Institutional interest But there are risks too: Crypto volatility Regulatory uncertainty Competition The Future of Avalanche Avalanche has a bright future, but it won’t be an easy ride. Here’s what could happen next: More Adoption – If more developers and institutions join, Avalanche could challenge Ethereum. Better Upgrades – Avalanche continues to improve its scalability and security. Stronger Partnerships – More collaborations could boost its ecosystem. Price Growth? – If demand increases, AVAX could see price appreciation. Of course, nothing is guaranteed in crypto. Avalanche has potential, but it also faces challenges. Final Thoughts Avalanche is like the high-speed train of the crypto world. It’s fast, efficient, and designed to handle huge amounts of traffic without slowing down. If you’re into crypto, it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on. Will it replace Ethereum? Maybe not. But will it play a major role in the future of blockchain? Very likely. So, whether you’re an investor, developer, or just curious about crypto, Avalanche is one name you should know. FAQs What is Avalanche (AVAX) and how does it work? Avalanche is a fast, low-cost blockchain using three chains (X-Chain, C-Chain, P-Chain) to improve scalability and efficiency. How is Avalanche different from Ethereum? Avalanche is faster (4,500 TPS vs. Ethereum’s 15 TPS), has lower fees, and supports subnets for custom blockchains. Is AVAX a good investment? AVAX has strong tech, growing adoption, and institutional interest but faces risks like volatility and competition. What is the future of Avalanche?

He said that the NWF’s savings level did not allow considering risky investments such as crypto, which he said were ‘too volatile’. The deputy Finance Minister confirmed that the NWF would maintain its current regulatory structure, which included 60% yuan and 40% gold. Kolychev also added that he had not heard of any discussions about creating a strategic crypto reserve in Russia. He emphasized the importance to Russia–from the point of view of sovereign budget reserves–that the assets invested in these reserves could be sold very ‘quickly and without a large price revaluation.’ Russia to retain investment strategy for the National Welfare Fund Vladimir Korechev, 🇷🇺 Deputy Minister of Finance, told the media on March 4 that the Ministry does not consider or intend to use crypto as an investment tool for the national welfare fund, because of volatility. The main reserves are still RMB and gold — David Lee (@DavidLe76335983) March 5, 2025 Kolychev revealed that the Russian Finance Ministry had no immediate plans to buy or hold any crypto assets as part of the NWF’s investments but has claimed that this could change if a key condition is met. He said that it was premature to talk about the possibility of including crypto assets, which he considered to be too volatile and risky. The deputy minister explained that the NWF’s liquid funds should be topped up to 7-10% of Russia’s GDP before Moscow considers buying ‘riskier’ assets like crypto. After that, investing NWF funds in less liquid and more profitable assets would be possible. However, Kolychev also pointed out that Russia was ‘still far’ from reaching its desired levels of diversified reserve portfolios, which was why Moscow only bought gold and yuan reserves for the time being. He maintained that he had not caught wind of any discussions about creating a Russian crypto reserve, similar to what President Trump’s administration had conceived in the United States. “When we get there, we will be able to think about different assets, including crypto. However, for now, the volatility signs are not favorable.” – Vladimir Kolychev President Trump signed an executive order in February ordering the creation of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) within the next year, hinting that it could potentially buy TikTok. Trump told reporters that the U.S. was ‘going to create a lot of wealth for fund’ although the executive order’s text was sparse on details, simply directing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to submit a plan for ‘such a fund within 90 days’, including recommendations on funding mechanisms, investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model. Russia remains skeptical about a strategic crypto reserve According to Kolychev, the Russian Central Bank will make the final decisions on including crypto in the NWF reserve. However, the Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina is reportedly a known crypto-skeptic who has attempted several times to orchestrate a total China-style ban on crypto in Russia. The Russian government ruled out the possibility of a strategic crypto reserve back in December 2024, noting that it would take a cautious stance and wait for other nations to take the lead in buying Bitcoin (crypto). Anton Siluanov, the Russian Finance Minister, stated that the country would be ‘better off keeping its powder dry.’ Siluanov told a Financial University student audience that ‘the issue of creating a crypto reserve could be considered in the future’ but added that the matter was not currently ‘on the table’. He pointed out that Russia did not take those kinds of risks despite the Americans talking about building a national Bitcoin reserve now. VanEck analysts estimated that the U.S. could cut its debt by 35% by 2049 if Washington starts buying Bitcoin. U.S. lawmakers have already ‘set the stage’ for the SBR by crafting bills that would prepare the legal framework for such a state and/or federal investment. Russian lawmakers have also reportedly urged their government to act fast to keep up with Washington. However, Siluanov said that ‘maybe someday’ the Russian government ‘will come around to the idea.’ Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Following the announcement, Arbitrum’s price soared 12.98% to $0.4258.

Another positive catalyst is that Arbitrum formed a falling wedge pattern, which is made up of two falling and converging trendlines. These two lines are nearing their confluence levels, signaling a potential rebound that can push the Arbitrum price to $1.2470. On-chain data among layer-2 networks | Source: Artemis Meanwhile, on-chain data from Artemis suggests that traders jumped on the recent news, with daily transactions climbing 25% to 2.8 million over the past week. The top three most active addresses appear to be linked to Tether’s and Circle’s smart contracts, hinting at increased stablecoin conversions, which might signal traders’ willingness to take advantage of the price movement. What is ARB Founded in 2016 by Steven Goldfeder, Harry Kalodner, and Joshua Goldfeder, Arbitrum is a layer-2 blockchain designed to help Ethereum handle more transactions at lower costs. It addresses Ethereum’s high fees and congestion by offloading some processing and data storage from the main Ethereum network. Since Ethereum’s smart contract execution requires nodes to process every step, transaction costs can quickly add up. By handling some of this work off-chain, Arbitrum aims to reduce congestion, offering lower fees, and improving overall efficiency.

The XRP price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP price has surged 2.79% in 24-hours to $2.51, with trading volumes at $5.63B. Ripple’s XRP finally neared the long-awaited $3 mark after President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President announced a new U.S. strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP and other digital assets . Also, a number of SEC cases that had cast doubt on the future of leading cryptocurrency companies have been dropped, giving hope for a favorable outcome in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. Amid this, Brazil’s securities regulator has approved the first spot XRP ETF , indicating a rising demand from institutions. After the US SEC acknowledged an XRP ETF filing by Grayscale and the NYSE, top analysts are predicting that the XRP price might hit $10 if it gets approved. Considering all these positive developments, our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “ Will XRP reach $10 in 2025? ” by providing short term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $2.46 Market Cap $141.02 billion Trading Volume $14.24 billion Circulating Supply 57.94 billion XRP All-time High $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time Low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 24-hour high $2.95 24-hour low $2.43 XRP Price Analysis XRP price at the time of press is changing hands at $2.51 with a gain of 2.79% over the previous day. If the bullish momentum sustains, XRP could eye at its next resistance levels at $2.65 followed by one at $2.80. Overcoming which, the doors would open for the $3 milestone. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, XRP price will remain range bound between its key support levels at $2.25 and $2.30. XRP Price Prediction 2025 A few factors will likely shape XRP’s market performance in 2025. The main factor that will decide XRP’s trend in 2025 is the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . Successively, analysts are expecting a resolution in March, considering that the SEC has dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. However, there’s more in store, as the U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned XRP being included in the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. Moreover, Ripple and Ondo Finance will be bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to XRPL, to improve speed, efficiency, and adoption by institutions. Adding to this, backed by BlackRock, OUSG has expanded to XRPL to provide spot settlement and lower costs for institutions. If things go in favor of Ripple, XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness a strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market.

He argues that government control over digital assets could undermine decentralization. Notably, his statement follows reports that Ripple allegedly pitched Solana (SOL) as part of a national reserve to justify XRP’s inclusion. This debate unfolds just ahead of the US Crypto Summit on March 8, an event gaining traction after Donald Trump’s recent crypto policy remarks. Solana Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko On US Strategic Reserve Anatoly Yakovenko recently shared his views on X, listing his preference for handling a strategic reserve. Yakovenko strongly believes the best approach is to have no reserve at all. According to the Solana co-founder, government oversight of crypto could spell disaster for decentralization, contradicting the core principles of blockchain technology. However, as a secondary option, he suggests that individual states, rather than the federal government, could manage their own Strategic Reserves. This, he believes, would act as a hedge against potential mistakes by the US Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, if a US Strategic reserve is inevitable, Yakovenko emphasizes that it should be based on measurable and rational criteria. He points out that such benchmarks could even favor Bitcoin, but stresses the need for objectivity. Ripple’s Alleged Push For SOL in US Reserve Anatoly Yakovenko’s statement comes in response to a recent report alleging that Ripple promoted Solana’s inclusion in the US Strategic Reserve. According to sources, the move was an attempt to make XRP’s inclusion seem more legitimate. This revelation has sparked debate within the crypto community, raising concerns about lobbying efforts in shaping national crypto policies. With Ripple’s ongoing legal battles and its push for regulatory clarity, the company’s reported strategy is drawing mixed reactions. Some see it as a practical approach to gaining government recognition, while others argue it could lead to favoritism in the crypto space. Besides, the Solana co-founder’s comment also comes amid heating momentum between XRP community and Bitcoin maxis . The BTC advocates have long countered XRP’s inclusion in the US Strategic Reserve, criticizing Ripple and its executives of lobbying efforts. US Crypto Summit In Focus The discussion around a US Strategic Crypto Reserve gains momentum as the US Crypto Summit approaches. Scheduled for Friday, the event is expected to bring together President Trump, policymakers, industry leaders, and analysts to discuss the future of digital assets in the country. Meanwhile, Trump’s recent proposal to include SOL, XRP, and Cardano (ADA) in a national reserve has already stirred controversy. While his stance signals potential government support for crypto, it also raises questions about the implications for decentralization and regulatory oversight. Besides, the summit further gained traction as Donald Trump’s family project World Liberty Financial betted $20 million on Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. While some deem this a regular accumulation process, many market watchers anticipate something big to come at tomorrow’s US Crypto Summit.

He stressed that the experiment is only at the discussion stage at the Finance Ministry and Bank of Russia, however. The discussion has been underway for months. Russian Deputy Finance Minister and director of the ministry’s Financial Policy Department Alexei Yakovlev spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a financial forum held by the Expert RA credit rating agency. He said an experimental legal regime was under discussion that would allow certain Russian investors to trade cryptocurrency. Trading would be for the super-qualified Trading by super-qualified investors is under consideration. There is no definition of super-qualification, however. Yakovlev said, “Not necessarily banks, but more professional market participants. They could be physicists but with a very, very, very high level of qualification.” At present, a qualified investor in Russia has to have property valued at 12 million rubles ($133,111 at current rates), but that benchmark will be raised to 24 million rubles next year. Yakovlev said an experimental legal regime, super-qualified investors, and the elimination of risks are necessary before a proposal can be made to the government. So far, the idea is “in its infancy,” he added. Domestic trading is not a new idea The Russian government has long discussed crypto trading. International settlements using cryptocurrency are allowed on an experimental basis under legislation introduced in July. That legislation also foresaw experimental licensing of crypto exchanges or another trading system for “specially qualified” investors. In September, Yakovlev’s predecessor as Financial Policy Department director Ivan Chebeskov, stated , “We prefer an integrated approach without any experimental regimes because as much as you can experiment, the whole country is basically already doing it.” By contrast, Yakovlev said on March 5, “Allowing digital currency into domestic circulation is a completely different story and requires much more scrupulous work, which we are carrying out.” It is legal for Russian citizens to buy and own cryptocurrencies but not to trade them. Cryptocurrency exchanges are operating in Russia now, but they do so in a legal gray zone. State-run cryptocurrency exchanges have been proposed at existing exchanges in Moscow and St. Petersburg. International trading got a lukewarm reception International crypto settlement is a poor choice to help with sanctions evasion due to the transparency of blockchain technology, lawyer Alexander Nektorov told Kommersant newspaper. “It will be possible to track the chain of transactions on the blockchain, as well as, in some cases, establish the entity that owns the wallet used for cryptocurrency transactions,” he said. Nonetheless, Sberbank, VTB and Alfa-Bank, some of the country’s leading banks, have expressed interest in participating in the experiment. State-owned Sberbank also volunteered to be part of the domestic trading experiment. A Russian Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) has also been eyed as a way to get past the sanctions. Its launch has been delayed. CBDC is “often seen as a way to evade sanctions, columnist Taisiya Romanova told RBC, but “at the moment, there are simply no partners for it.” Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev told reporters on March 4 that Russia is not considering creating a cryptocurrency reserve like the United States. Crypto assets are too volatile, he explained. The National Welfare Fund, a sovereign wealth fund, is made up of 40% Chinese yuan and 60% gold. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Timing is everything in crypto, and knowing which projects have momentum can make all the difference. Let’s dive into the top contenders ready to take off. What Is The Best Crypto to Buy Right Now Finding the best crypto to buy right now means looking beyond the hype and identifying projects with real momentum.

Despite its humorous name, FartCoin is building momentum, and its presale is gaining traction every day. With over $1.2 million raised so far, it's on its way to its next milestone of $1.5 million. Currently priced at $0.00145, FartCoin offers a solid entry point before the price jumps to $0.00175. Analysts predict the launch price could hit $0.004, showcasing substantial upside potential for early investors. Unlike other meme coins that rely purely on social media, FartCoin adds value by engaging its community and creating a fun, interactive ecosystem.

Crypto trading can be a tricky business, with many investors chasing after the latest Bitcoin or volatile meme coins, only to face disappointing returns.

With the current presale price at $0.00313 and a projected launch price of $0.007, the potential for growth is undeniable.

Litecoin has been a key player in the crypto market for a long time, but a new rival, FXGuys, is drawing attention with its fresh take on DeFi besides in-house trading. FXGuys is now in Stage 3 of its pre-sale, priced at $0.05, and has collected more than $4 million. Many investors ask: Which of these two assets might best boost their investments? Litecoin’s Position in the Market Litecoin keeps its role as a quicker and more effective choice than Bitcoin. As one of the first digital coins, it holds a solid reputation, many users along with a loyal group. Its small fees plus fast transfers make it a favorite for payments. At press time, LTC price is at $102 with a market capitalization of over $7.7 billion. Even with its steadiness, Litecoin does not offer lively rewards or ways to share earnings like new projects such as FXGuys do. The FXGuys Advantage: A Revolutionary PropFi Project FXGuys is more than an altcoin. It stands as the leading PropFi project that connects decentralized finance with personal trading. With a special program that funds trading, FXGuys gives traders up to $500,000 in cash so they can try the financial markets without the risk of using their own money. This method attracts both experienced and new traders in search of funds, which makes FXGuys a tool that supports actual trading activity. A key aspect of FXGuys is its staking feature. When users commit the $FXG token, they earn a share of 20 % of profits plus fees from broker trades. This setup builds a steady flow of income and makes FXGuys one of the top DeFi tokens that offers clear benefits beyond mere hype over price changes. Institutional-Level Trading Without Barriers Unlike traditional proprietary trading firms, which often require extensive background checks and capital contributions, The FX Guys introduce a fully decentralized model with no KYC requirements. Traders can instantly fund their accounts using fiat (over 100 local currencies) or crypto, ensuring seamless participation. Additionally, instant funding prop firms typically have strict limitations, but FXGuys provides access to multiple trading platforms, including MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade, depending on geographic location. The Trade2Earn program further enhances the appeal of FXGuys by rewarding every trade with $FXG tokens, ensuring liquidity and consistent demand. This makes it an attractive option for those looking for high-potential altcoins that serve a functional purpose in the financial ecosystem. FXGuys vs. Litecoin: Which One Should You Choose? Litecoin remains a safe choice for investors who need steadiness, but its chance to grow is small compared to a new platform like FXGuys. Top trading companies want new ideas. FXGuys leads this turn, giving revenue-share stakes, trader cash support, and a broker-backed crypto trading group. With more people using it and planned rewards, FXGuys shows a better promise for those seeking high returns. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Final Thoughts For investors checking out crypto options, comparing FXGuys to Litecoin shows an important difference. Litecoin is well known and mainly works as a currency for buying and selling, with few extra uses. FXGuys, however, changes the way one trades in addition to using DeFi , with real benefits through its prop trading funding plan staking rewards as well as immediate funding model. As FXGuys moves forward in its presale phase, the time to buy $FXG tokens at a low cost grows shorter. With a reliable funding method, an increasing user base along with a staking system that benefits long-term owners, FXGuys aims to become a leading DeFi coin with great potential. Investors seeking an asset to boost their portfolio should check out FXGuys before its price increases.

XRP price rebounds as $2 emerges as a new baseline; Ripple investors are happy but are still hedging their bets with DTX Exchange. Table of Contents XRP gains 11% with technical adoption DTX Exchange: Closing window of opportunity Conclusion The Ripple network’s regulatory struggles and the XRP price free-fall have been major discussion points recently. However, experts who claimed that XRP price would rebound soon have been proven to be right, as the XRP price seems to be on a rebound from the $2 range it hit before the weekend. Ripple charts are green for the first time in several days as the XRP price rose over 11% in daily trading. However, many investors who have been burnt by the free-falling prices are cautious. They are choosing projects with clearer gain paths over potential performance, especially as Ripple’s case with the SEC continues to drag. Most profit-seeking investors are rushing to join the bonus and final presale round of DTX Exchange. This project is drawing in investors with its useful features and huge growth potential. While XRP is on the path to recovery, DTX is also on course to establish itself as a major player in the market. XRP gains 11% with technical adoption Ripple’s XRP price recovered to $2.17 as technical adoption news emerged from South Korea. While the XRP price recovery is highly welcome for its long-suffering investors, it could likely drop again as investors try to quit their positions with some gains. In addition, the XRP price is down by 30% from the early February price ranges. The lowering market volume is a welcome sign, however, as it seems investors are willing to wait things out. Ripple’s market volume is down by 19%. Another elephant in the room is its excess supply, which concerns many trading experts. You might also like: Solana volume makes new highs but leading weekly gainers are JUP, DTX Exchange DTX Exchange: Closing window of opportunity While Ripple and its XRP price charts show some welcome recovery, DTX Exchange is ready to close down its presale. With almost 60% of tokens sold from the bonus round, investors need to move fast to get in position for clear 200% listing gains. Seasoned investors are shifting focus to DTX, with its high utility features that allow for higher adoption and, therefore, a clear use case. DTX Exchange has been in the news for its feature-rich hybrid trading platform, which will allow users to trade multiple asset classes, including cryptos and stocks. DTX Exchange also has optimized conventional trading exchange features, such as an automated investment manager and copy trading features, which help to improve the investment process. Copy trading allows users to follow the investment strategies of experienced traders and apply them to their portfolios. Early buyers are likely to see quick gains after launch and get access to phenomenal discounts and voting rights. Conclusion The XRP price chart is a delight to watch right now, but many diehard Ripple supporters are now questioning the stability of its growth potential. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange’s presale success underscores a market hungry for platforms that prioritize flexibility over dogma. Bonus tokens are available for $0.18, and the listing price is $0.36, making it a simple 200% gain for current investors once the project launches.

According to data from Defi Llama, in February, Ethereum’s ( ETH ) total value locked fell to $50 billion from a peak of $71 billion in January. Additionally, decentralized exchange volumes have been declining as capital flows into alternate ecosystems such as layer 2s and Solana ( SOL ). DEX volume fell from $92 billion in December to $82 billion in February, a 11% decline. Ethereum network fees, on the other hand, have decreased from $142 million in January to barely $46 million in February, indicating a decline in demand. The upcoming Pectra upgrade , which is expected to enhance network functionality and fee efficiency, might be a short-term catalyst. However, it is still unclear if these upgrades will be enough to stop the decline in DeFi activity. Furthermore, technical issues or delays could slow down the momentum and maintain ETH within its current range.

Ethereum technival analysis. Credit: crypto.news Despite the price uptick, low trading volume suggests hesitation among buyers. ETH needs a strong push past resistance to sustain gains, or it risks another pullback. A decisive break above $2,846 may open the path to $2,946, while failure to hold current levels could lead to a retest of $2,200 support. Meanwhile, sentiment remains mixed ahead of the White House Crypto Summit on Mar. 7. Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed the formation of a national crypto strategic reserve , with Ethereum being among the cryptocurrencies. Although some see this as a sign of a possible reversal, analysts caution that if enough regulatory clarification is not reached, the summit may become a “sell-the-news” event and lead to further downturns.

Pal’s post comes just 24 hours after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shared his plan to reduce interest rates in the US. Crypto market rebounds after Trump tariffs spook global financial markets, send US dollar tumbling The crypto market cap plunged from above $3.2 trillion to below $3 trillion in the last few weeks, TradingView data shows. Last week, the digital asset space’s total valuation plummeted to a low of around $2.55 trillion following US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. China, one of the nations slapped with tariffs, immediately retaliated and imposed 10-15% tariffs on US farm products. China’s embassy also said on X, “If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.” Trump’s tariffs have subsequently ignited fears of a global trade war, which has negatively impacted the US dollar index. According to TradingView data , the index has fallen more than 3% in the past week. While the US dollar index falls, the crypto market seems to be recovering. In the last 24 hours, the market cap has risen over 5%. Bitcoin has also erased its losses from the past week to trade at $92,563.12 as of 12:45 a.m. EST.

Ever wondered how global events ripple through different markets? Today, we’re diving into the exciting world of Forex, where Asia FX is making waves! Buckle up as we explore how the dollar’s dramatic dollar slide to a 4-month low, spurred by Trump tariff relief, is creating ripples across the financial landscape and what it means for you. Why is Asia FX Experiencing Such a Powerful Surge? Let’s cut to the chase: Asian currencies are flexing their muscles! We’re seeing a notable uptick in Asia FX , and it’s largely thanks to the weakening US dollar. But why is the dollar losing its grip? The answer lies in recent economic developments and a shift in market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown: Trump Tariff Relief: Easing trade tensions, particularly those initiated during the Trump era, are playing a significant role. When tariffs are reduced or removed, it signals a potential for increased global trade. This often weakens the dollar as investors anticipate a less protectionist US economic policy. Dollar Weakness Narrative: The narrative around the US dollar has shifted slightly. After a period of strength, driven by high interest rates, there are now expectations of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This anticipation naturally leads to a dollar slide as investors look for potentially higher yields elsewhere. Asian Economic Resilience: Many Asian economies have shown resilience and even strong growth despite global headwinds. This economic strength makes their currencies more attractive to investors seeking diversification and growth opportunities. Think of it like this: imagine a tug-of-war. For a while, the dollar team (strong US economy, high interest rates) was pulling hard. Now, the Asia FX team (improving trade outlook, resilient Asian economies) is gaining momentum, causing the dollar to lose ground. The Dollar Slide: What’s Driving the Downward Trend? The dollar slide isn’t just a blip; it’s a notable trend driven by a confluence of factors. Understanding these factors is crucial, especially if you’re involved in currency trading or keeping an eye on global markets. Let’s break down the key drivers: Easing Inflationary Pressures: While inflation remains a concern globally, there are signs that inflationary pressures in the US might be easing slightly. This reduces the urgency for aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which in turn can weaken the dollar. Anticipation of Fed Rate Cuts: The market is forward-looking. Traders are increasingly pricing in potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the near future. Lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns, contributing to the dollar slide . Geopolitical Factors: Global geopolitical events and shifts in international relations can also influence currency valuations. Easing trade tensions, as mentioned earlier with Trump tariff relief, is one such factor. Conversely, any new geopolitical instability could trigger a flight to safety, potentially strengthening the dollar again. To illustrate, consider the table below showing how key Asian currencies have performed against the US dollar recently: Currency Recent Performance vs. USD Key Drivers Korean Won (KRW) Significant Gains Strong export data, easing geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula. Taiwan Dollar (TWD) Moderate Gains Robust tech sector performance, stable economic outlook. Singapore Dollar (SGD) Steady Gains Sound monetary policy, safe-haven appeal in Asia. Chinese Yuan (CNY) Slight Gains Government stimulus measures, gradual economic recovery. This table clearly shows the positive momentum behind Asia FX and highlights the tangible impact of the dollar slide . Trump Tariff Relief: A Game Changer for Currency Markets? The mention of Trump tariff relief might raise eyebrows. How does this policy shift impact currency markets, especially Forex market dynamics? Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, have a wide-ranging impact: Trade Flows: Tariffs disrupt traditional trade flows. When tariffs are imposed, imports become more expensive, potentially reducing trade volumes. Conversely, tariff relief can stimulate trade, making international transactions smoother and potentially boosting global economic activity. Currency Valuation: Tariffs can impact currency valuations in several ways. Initially, tariffs might strengthen the domestic currency as imports become pricier and domestic goods more competitive. However, prolonged trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs can harm economic growth and weaken the currency in the long run. Trump tariff policies were a major factor in trade tensions, and their easing is now contributing to the current dollar slide . Investor Sentiment: Trade policies significantly influence investor sentiment. Protectionist trade measures can create uncertainty and risk aversion, while moves towards free trade and tariff relief are generally seen as positive for global growth and market stability. The current Trump tariff relief is being interpreted as a step towards a more predictable and less confrontational trade environment. In essence, Trump tariff relief is acting as a catalyst, signaling a potential shift towards a more open global trade environment. This shift is weakening the dollar and providing a tailwind for Asia FX . Navigating the Forex Market: Opportunities and Strategies in a Shifting Landscape For those involved in currency trading or managing international assets, the current Forex market dynamics present both opportunities and challenges. The dollar slide and the rise of Asia FX require a nuanced approach. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially when it comes to currencies. Consider diversifying your holdings across different currencies, including Asia FX , to mitigate risk and potentially capture gains from different market movements. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on global economic news, central bank policies, and geopolitical developments. Factors like inflation data, interest rate decisions, and trade policy announcements can significantly impact Forex market trends. Technical Analysis: Utilize technical analysis tools and charts to identify potential entry and exit points in currency trading . Look for trends, support and resistance levels, and other technical indicators to make informed trading decisions. Risk Management: Always practice sound risk management. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and avoid over-leveraging your positions. The Forex market can be volatile, and managing risk is paramount. Let’s consider an example: Imagine you believe the dollar slide will continue and Asia FX will strengthen further. You could consider a long position in an Asian currency like the Korean Won (KRW) against the US dollar (USD). However, remember to do your own research, analyze market conditions, and manage your risk appropriately. The Future Outlook: Will Asia FX Continue its Ascent? The million-dollar question: Is this Asia FX rally sustainable? Will the dollar slide persist? While no one has a crystal ball, we can analyze current trends and expert opinions to get a sense of the future outlook: Continued Dollar Pressure: Many analysts believe that the dollar may remain under pressure in the near to medium term, especially if the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. This would continue to support Asia FX . Asian Economic Growth: The growth trajectory of Asian economies will be a crucial factor. If Asian economies continue to perform strongly, their currencies are likely to remain attractive to investors. Global Trade Dynamics: The evolution of global trade relations and policies will also play a significant role. Further easing of trade tensions and a move towards more open trade could be positive for Asia FX . Volatility Risks: It’s important to remember that Forex market s are inherently volatile. Unexpected events, geopolitical shocks, or shifts in economic sentiment can quickly change market dynamics. Be prepared for potential volatility and manage your risk accordingly. In conclusion, the current surge in Asia FX and the dollar slide are significant developments in the Forex market . Driven by Trump tariff relief and shifting economic dynamics, these trends present both opportunities and challenges for investors and traders. By staying informed, employing sound strategies, and managing risk effectively, you can navigate this evolving landscape and potentially capitalize on the exciting movements in the world of currencies.

Analyst ‘Ali Martinez’ spotlighted a remarkable spike in TRON network activity as it scales new highs, whilst ‘Crypto Patel’ revealed that a $1 price target is potentially achievable this bull cycle. As a result, traders and investors optimistically eye the Justin Sun-backed token amid a broader market recovery. Analyst Forecasts TRX Price To $1 At the time of reporting, TRX price witnessed a 2% uptick and exchanged hands at $0.2458. The coin bottomed and peaked at $0.2407 and $0.2465 intraday. Notably, the rising trajectory aligns with the broader crypto market’s recent recovery-like trend. Simultaneously, analyst Crypto Patel took to X , revealing that TRON is showcasing a strong momentum and a $1 price target potentially looms. According to the price chart shared by the analyst, the coin’s price holds strong support at $0.140. A sustained hold above this level remains bullish. Source: Crypto Patel, X The best ‘buy zone’ lies at $0.160 – $0.180, given the opportunity presents itself, per the analyst. Notably, the current price levels are considerably above the mentioned support zone, whilst sustained demand could propel new highs. Can The Analyst’s Prediction Come True? Intriguingly, it’s noteworthy that the analyst predicted a 200-300% surge in TRX price during October last year. Back then, the coin’s price traded around the $0.16 level, per CoinMarketCap data. Subsequently, the price hit a $0.426 level as of early December 2024. This past chronicle is worth considering, although the price soon fell amid broader market trends. TRON Network Activity Surge Bolsters Bullish Prediction On the other hand, TRON network activity rose substantially, reaching a 2-month-high as of March 4. According to analyst Ali Martinez, 2.94 million active addresses were recorded on the network recently. This data suggested rising market interest in the Justin Sun-led crypto project, paving a bullish road ahead. Source: Ali Charts, X Crypto Market Recovery Bolsters Hope Simultaneously, the broader crypto market’s recovery -like trend has solidified investors’ optimism on TRX price. Bitcoin and altcoin witnessed notable gains amid pro-crypto developments in the U.S. Donald Trump’s strategic crypto reserve announcement appears to have substantially boosted the market sentiment. Moreover, the looming U.S. crypto summit set for Friday has also glimmered hope over the market’s future prospects. Crypto market participants continue to monitor TRON extensively amid broader developments, signaling that a bull run to $1 is possible.

Ethereum price has also gained by 4.6% to around $2,300. All the top-ten cryptos by market cap have also registered strong gains, with Dogecoin (DOGE) leading the pack with a staggering 10% rise. Despite these market-wide gains, volatility risks remain. Mt. Gox has moved $1 billion in BTC, triggering concerns of a looming selloff. Retail traders also appear to be leaving the market amid declining volumes on PumpFun and a drastic drop in the meme coin market cap. Crypto Prices Face Volatility Risks as Mt. Gox Moves $1B Bitcoin Defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt.Gox has moved 12,000 BTC valued at approximately $1.09 billion. According to Arkham , these coins were moved to a new wallet address, sparking speculation of upcoming creditor repayments. Mt.Gox Bitcoin The Mt.Gox Bitcoin repayments could increase volatility in the crypto market. The creditors that have waited for more than a decade may opt to sell once they receive BTC. This large sell-off could trigger a short-term drop in crypto prices. Moreover, if these coins end up in the market at a time when the demand is low, it could impact Bitcoin’s rally towards $100,000. PumpFun Volumes Plunge 94% – Can Solana Price Sustain Gains? Transaction volumes on the Solana meme coin launchpad PumpFun have declined by 94% as most crypto prices tumbled. These volumes are now at their lowest level in nearly a year, suggesting that interest in meme coins is dropping. PumpFun Volumes PumpFun volumes peaked in January after the release of Solana meme coins like TRUMP and MELANIA. However, interest has gradually faded as these meme coins lost nearly all of their gains barely one month after launching. These declining volumes have sparked a bearish Solana price prediction after it dropped by 27% in one month. At press time, SOL trades at $149 after a 4.7% drop in 24 hours. Meme Coin Market Cap Drops by $59B As Dogecoin Price Rebounds The total meme coin market capitalization has dropped by $59 billion from its 2025 peak of $116 billion amid falling crypto prices. At press time, the total meme coin market cap stood at $57 billion after falling by more than 50% year-to-date. Meme Coin Market Capitalization This decline shows traders have become hesitant to buy meme coins . However, the declining interest is prevalent in newer meme coins, as the hype fades, interest has returned to older meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). At press time, Dogecoin price had posted a notable 10% gain to trade at $0.21, while Shiba Inu price had surged by 5%. What’s Next for Crypto Prices Crypto prices show signs of heightened volatility. The $1 billion BTC transfer by Mt.Gox could stir panic selling and cause Bitcoin to fall below the $90,00 psychological level again. Given that altcoins have been tracking Bitcoin price, signs of weakness could also plunge altcoin prices. Meme coins are no longer draining liquidity from the broader market. Reduced interest in new meme coins has led to PumpFun transaction volumes falling by 94%. Older meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen renewed interest, which may bode well for price.

Analysis from digital assets trading firm STS Digital suggests that Friday's White House crypto summit could lead to heightened activity. U.S. President Donald Trump, who promised a strategic crypto reserve in the lead-up to the November election, will host top players from the industry, including Coinbase, Chainlink and Exodus. The latest rumor suggests that at the summit, Trump may announce the creation of a strategic bitcoin (BTC) reserve, shifting away from the Sunday disclosure that hinted at the basket of altcoins like XRP, Cardano""s ADA and Solana (SOL) along with BTC and ether (ETH) as the core. The pricing of BTC, ETH and SOL options on Deribit suggests traders are bracing for a volatile weekend in the aftermath of the summit. ""Options markets are showing the nerves (and illiquidity) going into the weekend and the raft of potentials. The Friday vs Saturday IV [implied volatility] Spread is nearly 25 vols wide across the board with Friday expiries missing the expected variance,"" Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital, told CoinDesk. Implied volatility, a metric derived from the pricing of options, indicates how much traders expect the asset's price to fluctuate over a specific period. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. Early Thursday, bitcoin options expiring Friday suggested an annualized implied volatility of 56%, while those expiring on Saturday traded at 80% volatility. The 24-point gap indicates expectations for increased price turbulence following Friday's summit. A similar pattern was seen in ether and solana options. The table shows implied and forward volatilities for BTC, ETH, and SOL and straddle breakevens (expected price swings). Forward volatility is calculated by comparing the implied volatility of options with different maturities and indicates the expected volatility over the period between the two specified expiration dates, in this case, Friday and Saturday. The 105% BTC forward volatility translates to a 5.5% price movement expected between Friday 08:00 UTC and Saturday 08:00 UTC. (Deribit options expire at 08:00 UTC). In other words, BTC could swing nearly $5K in either direction following the summit. ETH and SOL volatilities are pricing a move of $135 and $13, respectively. Per Anderson, expectations for large volatility often end up in disappointment. ""Quite often, large expected volatility like this is a disappointment in crypto as expectations > reality. That said, the breakevens do not feel large and options are by far the safest play for directional views in this environment,"" Anderson said, pointing to risks involved in taking directional bets in options expiring Mar. 14. ""We would expect option prices further out in tenor to come lower after the event as fears subside and volatility decays,"" Anderson noted.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Trump|Options,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|ETH|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 07:52:19

To be included in the reserve, a cryptocurrency must have maintained an average market cap of at least $500 billion over the past calendar year. Bitcoin is currently the only asset that qualifies. Initially, the bill proposed a 10% allocation and included stablecoins and staking options, but an amendment reduced the allocation to 5% and removed these provisions. Further, HB302 requires the assets to be held by a qualified custodian or in an exchange-traded product.

President Trump announced he had directed a working group to move ahead with a Crypto Strategic Reserve – a very bullish signal for market participants. In his first days in office, President Trump made numerous policy changes, enacted several executive orders and has the country buzzing with news and updates from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Tech-wunderkind Elon Musk heads DOGE and aims to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the ""Save America"" Movement."" The almost daily revelations of the extent of the mismanagement of taxpayer money are serving Trump well, as the transparent sharing of this information with US citizens allows the average American to see and witness the chaos that went on under previous administrations. Trump's initial moves in the infancy of his term have certainly garnered him some new support, and his continued commitment to other campaign promises also goes a long way in improving his approval rating. Trump's Proposed National Strategic Reserve of Cryptocurrencies On Sunday, March 3, President Trump announced on Truth Social that ""a U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry."" Trump also announced that he has ""directed a Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve."" According to Trump's announcement, the ""… Reserve that includes Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). "" The Reserve will also include Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), according to President Trump's executive order on digital assets in January 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) Will Likely Make Up Entire Reserve According to Bitwise CEO Matt Hougan, investment chief at Bitwise, recently said that while Trump's Crypto Reserve Announcement is bullish, Hougan cautioned that the market is ""misreading things."" Hougan explained his views thoroughly in a March 5 market note . The Bitwise bigshot said while President Trump did include several large-cap altcoins such as XRP, ETH, SOL, and ADA, the President's planned Reserve may eventually mainly consist of ""entirely Bitcoin."" In his market note, Hougan elucidates. ""Market participants have soured on the announcement because the proposed reserve holds more than Bitcoin."" Adding; ""The inclusion of small-cap assets in the announcement unnecessarily complicated matters."" Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) Would Be The ""Heart of the Reserve"" President Trump's initial announcement said the Reserve would include Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA). The President later added that BTC and ETH would be ""the heart"" of the crypto reserve. In his clearly and well-set-out memorandum, or market note, Hougan explains that the first proposal is never the final proposal. Hougan predicts that the big names in the industry will have something to say about the Reserve, and it might receive some industry pushback. Hougan opines the ""boldness of the initial proposal has widened the Overton window for what the reserve can be."" He continues by asserting, ""Until Sunday, the very idea of a strategic crypto reserve seemed unlikely. Now, a bitcoin-only reserve sounds almost conservative. After the dust settles, I suspect the final Reserve will be nearly entirely bitcoin, and it will be larger than people think."" Hougan further argues that despite industry leaders' worries over a Bitcoin-only reserve, it is nothing of concern. Hougan poignantly rests people assure by saying: ""In the end, this is bullish.""

The recent price movement has drawn attention to shifting supply dynamics, particularly between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH). This trend, analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor XBTManager, provides insights into Bitcoin’s current market cycle and what could come next. Related Reading: Crypto Markets Are Misreading Trump’s Strategic Reserve, Says Bitwise CIO Short-Term vs. Long-Term Holders: A Market Balancing Act According to XBTManager, Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH) has triggered an increase in STH supply while LTH supply declines. This transition typically signals a market shift, as long-term holders begin selling their assets while short-term traders accumulate. This dynamic has historically played a role in determining peak levels, as increased activity from short-term holders suggests heightened speculative interest. XBTManager explains that analyzing who is buying and selling Bitcoin is crucial in identifying market trends. As long-term holders sell their BTC, the supply moves into the hands of short-term traders, who often react more quickly to price fluctuations. This shift indicates that Bitcoin may be in a pullback phase following its recent ATH, leading to a potential period of price consolidation. Additionally, institutional buyers and ETFs have continued to accumulate Bitcoin, behaving similarly to short-term holders during this phase. MicroStrategy (MSTR), a major corporate Bitcoin investor, has also followed retail buying patterns. While institutional inflows support Bitcoin’s price, XBTManager warns that a prolonged consolidation period is possible due to liquidity demands. The analyst suggests that once STH begins selling and LTH starts accumulating again, the market may stabilize, creating a more favorable environment for long positions. What’s Next for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s supply shift suggests a cooling-off phase, market participants are watching for signs of a potential trend reversal. A report from CryptoQuant highlights that real spot demand has been declining, meaning that despite recent price gains, sustained upward momentum may be difficult unless demand returns. Additionally, IntoTheBlock recently revealed a surge in active Bitcoin addresses following last week’s price drop. This increase suggests heightened on-chain activity, often seen in periods of market transition. Whether this signals a renewed accumulation phase or continued volatility remains to be seen. Last week’s drop triggered a surge in active addresses, pushing the daily average to its highest level since December, when Bitcoin surpassed $100k. This uptick in on-chain activity coincided with an increase in zero-balance addresses, indicating capitulation. pic.twitter.com/eiESdiwERN — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 4, 2025 For now, supply trends, ETF inflows, and liquidity conditions are worth monitoring to assess Bitcoin’s next move. If long-term holders re-enter the market and demand recovers, Bitcoin could see renewed upward momentum.

While the top altcoins like ETH, SOL, LTC, etc., and a few more attract marginal gains, altcoins like Ondo & Movement have triggered over a 20% upswing in the past 24 hours and are trying hard to keep up the momentum. What’s next for these altcoins? Will ONDO Price Mark a New ATH? Ondo Finance is one of the leading tokenizations of Real World Assets (RWA), which is leading the cryptos with over 20% gains. The major reason behind the surge is the token achieving a major milestone, which sheds light on the rising investor confidence. In a recent update, ONDO’s total value locked (TVL) has reached an all-time high of over $1 billion, making an extraordinary rise from the lows of around $185 million. This showcases the rapid growth within the RWA space, as the ONDO price is also flashing massive bullish signals. As seen in the above chart, the ONDO price is trading within a descending parallel channel and is trying hard to reach the resistance. Meanwhile, the technicals have turned bullish as the DMI is about to undergo a bullish crossover. Besides, the RSI is maintaining a strong ascending trajectory. Meanwhile, the bearish divergence in the ADX raises some concerns, suggesting a drop in the pace of the rally. Therefore, the ONDO price is believed to test the resistance but may fail to surpass it as the volume remains within a restricted range. However, if the volume increases, then the ONDO price may trigger a breakout and may probably form a new ATH above $2. Movement (MOVE) Price Aims for a 35% Upswing After a bullish start, the MOVE price began to trade within a descending parallel channel following a rejection from the highs. While the price is trying hard to validate a strong ascending trend that could push the price above $0.5 and eventually break the resistance and, in turn, break the bearish pattern. Besides, the decreased volume raises some concerns, but with the growing bullish market sentiments, the MOVE price is also expected to demonstrate massive price actions. As mentioned above, the MOVE is also stuck within a descending parallel channel. The Bollinger Bands have begun to squeeze, hinting towards a drop in volatility. This suggests the price is undergoing a strong consolidation phase and is preparing for a breakout. Meanwhile, the CMF has risen above 0, hinting towards the growing strength of the bulls against the bears. Therefore, the buying pressure is slowly mounting, which may push the price towards the resistance of the channel and eventually trigger a breakout above $0.6. Therefore, the prices of ONDO & Movement remain stuck within a similar pattern and are undergoing a strong consolidation phase. Hence, a breakout appears to be imminent after the accumulation reaches it’s edge.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ONDO|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 08:02:06

However, despite the ongoing downturn, there is a noticeable resilience among short-term holders (STHs), who have continued to accumulate Bitcoin, hinting at the possibility of a recovery in the near future. Despite the losses, the growing number of new wallets, particularly those holding small amounts of Bitcoin, reflects strong belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential, with over 50,000 new wallets joining the network over the past month. Bitcoin's price has been moving around key resistance levels, particularly nearing a critical price point that could trigger a breakout. If the cryptocurrency can break through this resistance, it could rise to even higher levels, potentially heading toward the $100,000 mark. However, if the resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break through, it may experience further declines and test lower support levels. This uncertainty in price movement creates a situation where short-term holders are vital in sustaining the market’s optimism. Despite the challenges, Bitcoin’s network growth and the increasing number of wallets indicate that short-term holders are holding strong, and their involvement remains crucial for a possible rebound. Although Bitcoin has experienced sharp declines, the number of wallets holding smaller amounts has increased, signaling that more investors are joining the market despite the fluctuations. This growing participation suggests that, even during times of market struggle, many investors remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential . The price has recently shown signs of recovery, but the real test lies in whether it can break through resistance levels and hold above them to maintain its bullish momentum. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold its ground above certain support levels, it may see a further dip. Despite these risks, the overall sentiment remains that Bitcoin's price could eventually surge if bullish momentum returns. Bitcoin's price movements and the growing participation of short-term holders reflect the market's ongoing struggles but also a potential foundation for a comeback. While Bitcoin's price faces significant resistance, its ability to rally could be a key sign of strength for the broader cryptocurrency market. The commitment of short-term holders is a crucial factor in Bitcoin’s ongoing volatility and potential recovery, as these investors continue to demonstrate their confidence in the asset despite the short-term price fluctuations.",,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-06 08:02:26

WLFI has purchased $10 million Wrapped Bitcoin (110 WBTC), $10 million Ethereum (4468 ETH), and $1.5 million Movement (3.42 million MOVE). Arkham Intelligence noted that the crypto project has already spent a total of $336 million to invest in 9 tokens. “Despite the market drawdown from Trump’s tariffs, he keeps buying back ETH through his company on every dip. This should clearly signal only a bullish sentiment and shows how serious he is about crypto.” – Rekt Fencer , Founder of X DAO There is no way to know whether WLFI sold the assets because the project transferred most of the tokens to Coinbase Prime some time ago. World Liberty Financial also acknowledged that they have not sold any of their assets so far. The analytic platform expects WLFI’s current paper loss to reach $88 million if the assets have not been sold. The firm noted that Ethena might experience the largest loss percentage, around 63%. Ethereum is also expected to have the largest loss amount, $67.35 million ETH, roughly a 31% drop. It’s worth noting that the additional investment of $21.5M tokens by WLFI came in the wake of the upcoming White House Crypto Summit in the early morning of March 7. Rekt Fencer, Founder of X DAO, mentioned that the crypto summit will be the biggest catalyst and a key turning point for the crypto markets this week. He also expects a shocking outcome in the crypto market because Bitcoin and the crypto reserve will be in discussions at the summit. Fencer pointed out some probable results at the summit, such as a 0% tax for U.S. crypto projects, clarity on BTC reserve implementation, and new details on the crypto reserve. He also believes that WLFI’s additional investment indicated a bullish sentiment on crypto even after a market drop from Trump’s tariffs. Trump hosts the White House Crypto Summit tomorrow Donald Trump revealed on Sunday some plans for the reserve to include alternative digital assets such as XRP, SOL, and ADA. He also added that BTC and ETH “will also be at the heart of the Reserve.” The event will also discuss the development of regulatory frameworks surrounding virtual assets and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong highlighted on Sunday that BTC would probably be the best option for a strategic reserve because it’s simple and has a clear story as a successor to gold. Armstrong also argued that if people preferred more variety, they could do a market cap-weighted index of digital currencies to keep it unbiased. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged on Tuesday that Bitcoin would be treated differently than the altcoins the President mentioned in his announcement. Lutnick said that Trump spoke about a BTC reserve all during the campaign trail, and “I think you’re going to see it executed on Friday. The summit will feature CEOs, investors and other influential figures from the crypto space, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, and Exodus CEO JP Richardson. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett also revealed that the roundtable will include more than 25 participants, including members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets.

Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will hit his price target in December 2025 when the median line of the Gaussian channel peaks.

Last week, Dave the Wave suggested that BTC may be following in the footsteps of its August 2024 correction when it dipped to the 0.382 Fibonacci level before launching fresh rallies. “A BTC observation. Now a 38% real correction of the move up as per last time.” Traders use the Fibonacci retracement tool to spot potential entry and exit points based on the Fibonacci ratio.

This partnership with Bridge allows users to pay directly from their non-custodial wallets, using cards and bank transfers, without needing to hand over control of their assets. This move aligns with the growing demand for stablecoin payments, as more consumers seek to use digital assets in their daily lives. Wirex’s partnership with Bridge ensures seamless integration , offering users greater access to digital payments and contributing to the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. The expansion comes at a time when the US is focusing on stablecoin regulation, which could speed up their adoption. Stablecoin regulation in the US is expected to drive greater market growth , with various industry leaders like Circle, Coinbase, and Ripple collaborating with lawmakers to shape new policies. Regulatory clarity could further boost the integration of stablecoins into mainstream financial systems, encouraging more businesses to enter the market. With Visa's reach, Wirex users can now make purchases at over 80 million merchants worldwide. As of early 2024, Stripe, a leading payment provider, acquired Bridge for $1.1 billion, solidifying the growing role of stablecoin payment systems in everyday transactions. Wirex’s US expansion has the potential to significantly drive revenue growth , as the market for digital payments continues to grow. The company’s co-founders noted that the strong demand for stablecoin payments and the adoption of digital assets are key drivers for the expansion into the US, making it a critical market for the company. In addition, the US stablecoin market has surpassed a total market cap of $225 billion, and regulatory clarity could further increase adoption. Major financial institutions, such as Bank of America, are also closely monitoring the space. Bank of America’s CEO stated that they could launch their own stablecoin if favorable regulations are put in place. Wirex’s move signals the increasing importance of the US market for stablecoin adoption, with more Web3 businesses likely following suit as regulations evolve.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-06 08:05:29

The scammers used the account to promote a fake cryptocurrency called “National Hong Kong Coin”, prompting a swift warning from the government. Notably, the scammers announced the launch of the fraudulent coin on Solana, garnering widespread attention. However, Hong Kong Legislative Council member Ng Kit Chuang clarified that the government hasn’t issued the cryptocurrency. Fake National Hong Kong Coin: What to Know Earlier today, a fake X account impersonating Hong Kong’s Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced the launch of the National Hong Kong Coin on Solana. In an attempt to legitimize the deceptive claim, the scammers used a photograph of the Chief Executive. In addition, the scammers wrote on X, “This strategic step marks a new era in digital innovation and economic growth for Hong Kong”. Subsequently, Legislative Council member Ng Kit Chuang has reassured the public that the government has made no official announcement regarding the issuance of a cryptocurrency. He warned investors to be cautious and not fall victim to such scams, emphasizing the importance of verifying information through official channels before making any investment decisions. Government Warns Against Fake National Hong Kong Coin Following the scammers’ false announcement on the Hong Kong Coin, the government issued a warning. In an official statement, the SAR government clarified that the Chief Executive’s account is fake and the shared information about the crypto launch is completely false. Legislative Council member Ng Kit Chuang’s clarification comes amidst growing concerns and queries from citizens and Web3 industry experts about a fake social media post claiming the launch of the National Hong Kong Coin. The government has firmly debunked the claims as fraudulent, and Ng has urged the public to remain cautious and vigilant. The Rise of Government Crypto Scams It is noteworthy that the fake Hong Kong Coin incident is part of a broader trend of crypto scams that involve impersonating celebrities and government officials to dupe investors. Recently, scammers promoted a fake meme coin impersonating Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Scammers created a fake account , “SaudiLawConf”, to promote a fraudulent crypto called “Saudi Arabia Meme Coin”. However, the legitimate Saudi Law Conference soon discovered that their X account had been hacked and issued a warning about the crypto scam. Similarly, the launch of Libra token , promoted by Argentinian President Javier Milei, has also created controversy. The token, which jumped by 3000% to an ATH of $4.5, soon reached its low, when the pulled $87M worth of LIBRA, leaving investors with significant losses.

Here's Why!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ripple-xrp-was-invited-to-fridays-grand-summit-but-this-altcoin-included-in-the-reserve-was-not-heres-why/,"The White House Cryptocurrency Summit, which will be hosted by Donald Trump on Friday, is being followed with great curiosity in Bitcoin and altcoins. As anticipation grows in the crypto market ahead of the summit, Trump is expected to launch a US strategic crypto reserve at the event, which will be the first of its kind. While the guest list for the summit, which will be attended by many important names from the cryptocurrency industry and politics, has begun to take shape, it was seen that a notable name was missing. This was Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was not invited to the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Unchained reported, citing a White House source with knowledge of the guest list. The Cardano founder’s non-invitation comes despite Trump posting on Truth Social on Sunday in which he announced that ADA would also be part of the crypto reserve. “They're running around town trying to push their own narrative. They're not involved in anything that's going to influence policy and they weren't invited to Friday's summit,” a White House source told Unchained. Hoskinson’s absence is particularly surprising given President Trump’s recent comments, as he was expected to attend the event following Trump’s announcement that ADA would be part of a crypto reserve. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve would elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” Trump wrote in a post on Sunday. According to the confirmed guest list, the summit will include “Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor, Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang, Exodus CEO JP Richardson, Multicoin Capital Managing Partner Kyle Samani, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) co-founder Zach Witkoff, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi, Crypto .com CEO Kris Marszalek.” *This is not investment advice.

Despite this, there remains a strong belief in the potential for sustainable growth, especially as the volatile nature of crypto tends to weed out underperforming projects, leaving room for more promising ones. As the industry endures a bear market, it can actually help refine the space and eliminate weaker projects, which could ultimately pave the way for long-term innovation. AI agents were once considered the next big thing in Web3, but their sudden decline has led some to believe that the sector may have been nothing more than a speculative bubble. The massive drop in market cap in just a few months has led to widespread doubts, and many in the community wonder whether the demand for AI agents will be overtaken by other trends, such as meme coins. Despite this, not all is lost for AI agents, and the ongoing volatility presents an opportunity to filter out unsustainable projects and spotlight the ones with strong fundamentals . Developers and investors who remain dedicated to the space still see potential, especially in the area of DeFi-powered AI agents (DeFAI) . According to DeFi Warhol, a developer in the space, the initial rush to adopt AI agents led to inflated expectations, but now that the dust has settled, there’s a chance for serious, well-built projects to rise above the noise. The first phase of hype was followed by disillusionment when the market turned bearish, but Warhol believes that the current climate presents an opportunity to invest in projects with solid, sustainable foundations . AI advocates such as 0xJeff are optimistic about the future of AI, particularly through the lens of DeFi integration . He points out that combining the power of AI with mature sectors within decentralized finance can unlock tremendous value, given the enormous market size. The value of DeFi’s TVL (total value locked) is estimated to be around $100 billion, and integrating AI with DeFi could significantly enhance user experience by simplifying complex financial instruments. The fusion of DeFi and AI offers a potential path forward for AI agents to break out of their current slump and become more accessible and useful to the average user. One of the biggest advantages of combining AI with DeFi is that it could help demystify complex financial products like liquid staking, yield farming, and stablecoins , making them easier to understand and use. AI could provide the interface for more intuitive interactions, making complicated processes more digestible for everyday users. During ETHDenver, the Ethereum community’s largest event, AI integration in DeFi was a key topic of discussion, indicating that the hype surrounding AI in crypto isn’t completely dead. While the market may have cooled, serious, thoughtful development in the sector is still underway, particularly in DeFAI. In the end, while the AI agents sector has experienced a significant downturn, the current market challenges could lead to the emergence of more viable and functional projects in the long run. By focusing on practical use cases like DeFi integration, AI agents can maintain relevance in the evolving world of crypto, where the best projects will thrive, and the weaker ones will be weeded out. The AI agents bubble may have popped, but the opportunity for meaningful growth and innovation in this space is far from over.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-06 08:09:08

In a recent budget hearing, Sun expressed concern about the increasing number of crypto-related frauds in the country. She warned that the risk of losing money in scams was high and that victims often had little chance of recovering their funds. Her warning comes as crypto scams reportedly made up a quarter of Singapore’s total fraud losses last year. Sun’s statements reflect a growing sense of caution among government officials, despite Singapore’s previous reputation as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction. While Sun’s remarks were focused on public protection, other political figures have taken a harsher stance. Member of Parliament Tan Wu Meng suggested that crypto fraudsters should face severe punishment, including caning, depending on the severity of their offenses. This shift in tone has raised questions about whether Singapore’s stance on cryptocurrencies is starting to change. However, it is too early to tell whether this will result in an official policy overhaul. Although Singapore has long been known for its progressive attitude toward blockchain and crypto, there has been increasing concern about the rise of crypto-related scams. In fact, Singapore has been one of the leaders in granting crypto business licenses in Asia, and the country was named the “world’s most crypto-friendly country” earlier this year. Despite this, incidents of crypto fraud are on the rise, with law enforcement investigating several crypto firms for possible financial crimes. Sun emphasized that crypto scams have become more advanced, making it harder for the average person to spot fraud. In the past, many scams were easily recognizable due to language or accent issues, but these scams have become more sophisticated over time. Additionally, victims are increasingly willing to hand over their money to scammers, with reports stating that 80% of the funds lost in crypto fraud cases were voluntarily given by the victims. At the moment, no new policy changes have been announced, but the government has indicated that more legislative measures may be on the way to address the issue of crypto fraud. Sun urged citizens to use the anti-fraud resources provided by the government to protect themselves from scams. However, some reports suggest that the government is leaning towards more punitive measures, potentially involving stricter regulations or penalties for those involved in crypto fraud. While there has been no formal policy shift, Singapore’s government appears to be increasingly concerned about the risks posed by cryptocurrencies, especially in terms of scams and fraud. The combination of high-profile political figures pushing for stronger measures and growing public concern about crypto fraud suggests that future legislation may take a harder stance on crypto-related crimes. Despite this, it is important to note that Singapore’s crypto-friendly reputation has not been fully overturned yet, and the country still remains a key player in the global blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Overall, it’s clear that the Singapore government is grappling with the challenges posed by the rise of crypto scams, but the full impact of these recent warnings and potential regulatory changes remains to be seen. While the country’s reputation as a crypto hub remains intact for now, the situation is evolving rapidly, and citizens and businesses will need to stay vigilant as the government assesses its approach to crypto regulation. Regulatory shifts, political figures advocating for harsher penalties, and public concern about crypto fraud indicate that Singapore’s crypto policies may be in for significant change in the coming months.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-06 08:12:48

Here’s the Impact,https://timestabloid.com/5-37-billion-xrp-in-24-hours-heres-the-impact/,"On March 3, over $5.37 billion worth of XRP was transferred, marking a significant surge in network activity. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted this in a recent post on X, sharing a chart illustrating the sharp increase in XRP transactions. The timing of this surge is particularly notable, as it coincided with a market collapse that some have attributed to market manipulation . Over $5.37 billion worth of $XRP was transferred in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/P1NnZpeY6V — Ali (@ali_charts) March 5, 2025 Recent Market Trends On March 2, XRP experienced a sharp increase, reaching $2.97—its highest price since early February. This rally coincided with President Donald Trump’s announcement of a national crypto reserve , which includes XRP and four other major cryptocurrencies. However, shortly after this jump, the price crashed, leading to speculation that large holders may have aided the sudden volatility. Now, the asset shows signs of recovery, and the movement of billions in XRP suggests that major investors are actively repositioning themselves. Whale Accumulation During Market Uncertainty Whales have been accumulating XRP in substantial amounts. Recent reports indicate that whales acquired roughly 1 billion XRP as the price dropped and began to recover. These strategic purchases suggest that institutional players and high-net-worth investors see potential in XRP despite recent price fluctuations. The correlation between sudden price movements and large transfers has raised concerns about possible market manipulation. Some analysts believe that the rapid price jump on March 2, followed by an immediate decline, was triggered by coordinated whale activity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This pattern has been observed in the past, where significant price swings align with heavy accumulation or distribution by large holders. However, the recent price action suggests XRP is leaning toward a bullish turn. XRP’s Current Market Phase With large quantities of XRP being moved, analysts debate whether the asset is in a local distribution phase . This phase typically occurs when major investors start selling after a price surge, potentially leading to a correction. However, given the renewed accumulation by whales, the market may still be in an accumulation phase, where investors buy in anticipation of future gains. XRP has begun its recovery, aided by accumulation and the excitement surrounding the announcement of the national reserve. If whales continue accumulating, the buying pressure could push the price up further. The asset is trading at $2.46, up 6.19% from yesterday, and still climbing.

The surging demand for energy-intensive GPUs that feed the AI beast risks straining national grids and testing sustainability goals over the coming decade. Not so long ago, it was Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that were attracting flak for their energy footprint. While Bitcoin mining remains a power-hungry process, Ethereum has moved on to greener pastures following its transition to Proof-of-Stake. But no sooner had the environmental lobby gotten over its critique of crypto, it’s found another adjacent industry to attack in the form of AI.And it’s hard to dispute the facts as they stand: AI has one hell of an appetite for energy. From training massive language models to powering real-time inference in data centers, AI’s energy consumption is skyrocketing. All transformative technologies, to be fair, entail a massive spike in production – a trend that can be traced as far back to the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century. It’s the price of progress.Nevertheless, the rate at which AI’s energy footprint has increased poses a pressing question: how can the world meet this energy need sustainably and reliably? The answer lies in a blend of technological foresight and strategic energy investment. And one energy source in particular has the potential to meet that need. It is, unsurprisingly, nuclear. What’s perhaps more surprising is the opportunity it presents shrewd investors to load up on U3O8 – yellowcake used in uranium production – without needing a geiger counter and a lead suit. AI Is Coming for Your Energy We commonly envision AI as an energy saver, freeing us from the drudgery of planning meals, preparing reports, and designing school newsletters. But we rarely consider that for everything AI gives back to us in free time, it consumes in other ways. GPUs, such as those in Nvidia’s H100, draw 700 watts each, and a single data center can house thousands. Do the math, as they say. While AI’s relationship with energy is complex , regions where there is a high concentration of data centers place a significant impact on the local grid. Data centers are typically clustered together for efficiency reasons, which demands reliable energy infrastructure that can keep up. Renewables such as wind and tide aren’t cut out for this sort of work. Nuclear, on the other hand, is a perfect fit with its ability to crank up capacity at the push of a button. As the U.S. seeks to recenter itself as a tech hub, with a particular focus on AI and crypto, it’s safe to say its energy footprint is only going to climb. Particularly as new chip manufacturing plants come onstream to keep the AI juggernaut ticking over. Today’s energy mix, dominated by fossil fuels, with nuclear a distant third behind renewables, faces a reckoning. Solar and wind, while growing, are intermittent, leaving gaps that can’t sustain AI’s round-the-clock demand. Battery storage, also advancing, can’t yet bridge the lulls for data centers needing constant power. Fossil fuels, meanwhile, clash with net-zero targets, with this tension pitting AI’s promise against sustainability. Which is why the demand for a reliable and scalable energy solution brings us back to nuclear. Uranium Demand Ramps Up Given its zero-emission design and predictable output, it’s no wonder nuclear energy is being mentioned in the same breath as AI. The future technology of the 1950s is now the power source for the future tech of the 2020s. As a result, uranium – the primary fuel for nuclear reactors – is seeing renewed interest, particularly as countries pursue net-zero goals. One of the interesting side-effects of uranium’s increased demand is that it’s presented an opportunity for astute investors to capitalize on rising global energy consumption, exacerbated by an increase in AI. Enterprising RWA platforms have latched onto this, with the likes of xU308 enabling traders to acquire tokenized uranium. Operating on the Tezos blockchain, xU308 presents a compelling case for uranium investment, noting that it has delivered more than 3x the return of the S&P 500 in the last five years. 1/4 ⚛️ Built on @etherlink and powered by @Tezos , is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for trading tokenized physical uranium. This platform makes it possible for retail investors to access uranium without having to spend more than 5 tez. 🧪 pic.twitter.com/vVc1i4bAUB — Tezos (@tezos) December 5, 2024 As more RWAs arrive onchain, including many associated with the AI economy – such as NVIDIA stock and tokenized GPU compute – uranium presents an asymmetric bet on rising demand for artificial intelligence. For investors seeking portfolio diversification coupled with a future-proofed bet on growth in global energy demand, uranium looks like a reliable choice. Lowly correlated with other commodities, it appears largely immune from geopolitical crises and tariff wars. In the long-term, anticipated improvements in solar, wind, and battery technology may allow renewables to take over from fossil fuels. But for the next 5-10 years, it’s clear that there’s a gap to be filled between fossil fuels, with their dirty but effective capacity, and renewables with their capricious promise of a greener world. Into that gap nuclear effectively slots, providing the short to medium-term answer to the world’s energy demands. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Gox-linked wallets highlight the evolving regulatory and market dynamics within the cryptocurrency sector. While South Korean authorities are closely monitoring Japan’s stance on crypto ETFs as they weigh potential approval, the defunct exchange Mt. Gox has transferred 12,000 BTC amid a week of market volatility. South Korea Moves Closer to Decision on Bitcoin ETFs Amid Changing Global Stance on Crypto Regulation South Korea is edging closer to making a decision on the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the nation’s regulators closely monitoring developments in Japan. According to a report from Maeil Business Newspaper (MK), South Korean authorities are studying Japan’s evolving stance on digital assets as they deliberate on the potential introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in the country. The Maeil Business Newspaper reports that South Korea’s financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), has been analyzing Japan’s recent legislative trajectory concerning digital assets. This includes reviewing policy trends from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) and sharing insights with relevant institutions in South Korea. Japan has traditionally maintained a conservative approach toward cryptocurrency regulations. However, recent discussions suggest a potential shift, with the FSA considering positioning cryptocurrencies as financial products alongside securities. This move could pave the way for the approval of crypto ETFs in Japan, a prospect that South Korea is observing with keen interest. On Feb. 10, Japanese publication Nikkei reported that Japan's financial regulators might lift the ban on crypto ETFs, allowing them to be traded similarly to traditional financial instruments. The discussions in Japan are expected to continue through the first half of 2025 before a concrete legislative plan is proposed to the National Assembly in 2026. While South Korea has yet to make a definitive move on Bitcoin ETFs, top financial officials acknowledge the growing global trend toward these investment vehicles. At a recent virtual asset committee meeting, Kim So-young, vice chairman of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), reiterated the country’s cautious approach. “I have continued to say that I would carefully review [spot Bitcoin ETFs], and it is similar in the broader context. There are countries that have not yet introduced it. There are England and Japan,” Kim said at a press conference following the meeting. The comments shed light on the regulatory balancing act South Korea faces. On the one hand, the country recognizes the potential benefits of regulated Bitcoin ETFs, such as providing safer investment options for retail and institutional investors. On the other hand, authorities remain wary of the risks associated with cryptocurrency market volatility and potential financial crime. The push for regulatory clarity in South Korea comes at a time of political turmoil. The country’s crypto regulatory landscape has been evolving rapidly following the dramatic arrest of former President Yoon Suk Yeol on Jan. 15. Yoon was detained after allegedly attempting to impose martial law in the country, an event that has significantly reshaped the nation’s political scene. Despite the political turbulence, South Korea’s financial regulators have maintained their focus on strengthening crypto oversight. On Feb. 13, the Financial Services Commission announced new guidelines permitting universities and charitable organizations to sell cryptocurrency donations starting in the second half of 2025. The move marks a significant step in integrating digital assets into broader financial and philanthropic ecosystems. At the same time, enforcement actions against crypto platforms have continued. On Jan. 16, Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was served with a suspension notice for alleged violations of Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. In response, Upbit filed a lawsuit against South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit in an effort to overturn the sanctions, arguing that the regulatory action was overly restrictive. South Korea's Growing Crypto Market and ETF Potential South Korea is one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets, with more than 30% of its citizens reportedly investing in digital assets. The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies has fueled demand for regulated investment products like Bitcoin ETFs. If South Korea decides to approve Bitcoin ETFs, it could significantly boost institutional participation in the country’s crypto market. South Korea's interest in Bitcoin ETFs follows a broader global trend. The United States approved its first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, a landmark development that attracted billions of dollars in inflows. Similarly, other countries, including Hong Kong and Canada, have already introduced regulated Bitcoin ETFs. For South Korea, approving Bitcoin ETFs would provide investors with a more structured and transparent way to gain exposure to Bitcoin while benefiting from regulatory oversight. However, authorities remain cautious, weighing potential risks such as market manipulation, fraud, and investor protection concerns. While South Korea has not yet made a final decision on Bitcoin ETFs, ongoing discussions and Japan’s evolving stance could influence the country’s regulatory direction. If Japan proceeds with lifting its crypto ETF ban, South Korea may feel added pressure to follow suit, especially given its reputation as a global financial and technology hub. As regulatory conversations continue, the South Korean government is expected to take a measured approach, ensuring that any move toward Bitcoin ETF approval aligns with its broader financial stability goals. In the meantime, investors and industry stakeholders will be watching closely for further developments that could shape the future of crypto investment in the country. With global adoption of Bitcoin ETFs on the rise, the question remains: Will South Korea take the leap, or will it continue to observe from the sidelines? Mt. Gox Moves 12,000 Bitcoin Amid Market Volatility, Stirring Speculation on Creditor Repayments In other Bitcoin news, the long-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has once again made significant Bitcoin movements, transferring 12,000 BTC worth over $1 billion on March 6. The latest transfer, first flagged by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, comes amid a turbulent week in the crypto market, raising speculation about its implications for creditors awaiting long-overdue repayments. According to Arkham Intelligence, the Mt. Gox-linked wallet (1PuQB) conducted the large transfer with a transaction fee of just $1.64. As part of the transfer, 166.5 BTC—approximately $15 million—was moved to a Mt. Gox cold wallet (1Jbez), while the remaining 11,834 BTC was directed to an unidentified wallet (1Mo1n). This transaction marks the first notable Bitcoin movement from Mt. Gox-controlled wallets in a month. The previous transaction, in early February, saw just 4 BTC shuffled between cold wallets, an insignificant sum compared to the latest move. The motivations behind this transfer remain unclear, though it adds to a growing pattern of Bitcoin activity linked to the collapsed exchange. Mt. Gox-related wallets currently hold approximately 36,080 BTC, worth around $3.26 billion, per Arkham data. Past large-scale movements from these wallets have often preceded creditor repayments, fueling speculation that further distributions could be on the horizon. This is not the first time that Mt. Gox-related wallets have seen major movements in recent months. In December, the exchange transferred approximately 1,620 BTC through unknown wallets. Just two weeks earlier, it had moved more than 24,000 BTC—one of the largest transactions associated with the exchange in years. The timing of these transactions often raises concerns in the market, as creditors continue to await their long-overdue repayments. The official Mt. Gox trustee had previously extended the repayment deadline by a full year, pushing it back to Oct. 31, 2025. While the purpose of the latest transfer remains undisclosed, past transactions of this nature have sometimes been associated with preparatory movements for creditor distributions. Bitcoin's Volatility Amid Macroeconomic Uncertainty The timing of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin movement coincides with a week of heightened volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride, hitting a high of $94,770 on March 3 before plunging to $82,681 on March 4. Since then, it has rebounded. One key driver of this market turbulence has been geopolitical and macroeconomic factors. On March 4, new trade tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump took effect, rattling global markets and affecting high-risk assets like Bitcoin. While digital assets are often touted as a hedge against traditional financial instability, they remain highly sensitive to broader economic trends and policy shifts. With Bitcoin transfers from Mt. Gox-linked wallets making headlines once again, creditors are watching closely for any signs of progress in the repayment process. Although the official deadline for creditor distributions remains set for late 2025, the recent movements could hint at preparatory steps being taken behind the scenes. Given the significant number of Bitcoin still under Mt. Gox’s control, further transactions in the coming months could provide additional clues about the exchange’s repayment strategy. For now, the market remains on edge, with investors keeping a close eye on blockchain movements tied to the infamous exchange. As Bitcoin continues its volatile price swings, traders and creditors alike are left wondering: is this the beginning of long-awaited repayments, or just another chapter in the Mt. Gox saga?",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ASIA|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-06 09:30:00

Some market watchers suggested that its price could be preparing for a massive surge to a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Cardano 125% Pump Coming? Analyst Says ADA ‘Could Be Poised’ For Rally To $2.20 Stellar Getting Ready For 300% Breakout Stellar has seen a 9% surge in the past day, recovering from this week’s market dump and rallying to the $0.30 mark again. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Stellar could witness a 300% breakout soon as the cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish pattern. After the November 2024 breakout, XLM started to form a bullish flag, with the 600% post-US election rally forming the pattern’s flagpole. Since then, Stellar has been consolidating between the $0.63 and $0.25 price range, forming the pattern’s flag. Since hitting its 3-year high in December, XLM has seen a 52% price decrease, failing to break above its downtrend line. During the February market retraces, the cryptocurrency retraced nearly 40% from its monthly opening, hitting its lowest price action since November. Over the weekend, Stellar followed the rest of the crypto market, fueled by US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve comprised of “made in the USA” cryptocurrencies like XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). XLM surged around 25% from the range’s lower levels to $0.37, retesting the $0.35 key resistance. The $0.32-$0-35 range has been a key zone for the cryptocurrency since the Q4 2024 breakout, serving as a crucial support level until turning into resistance in February. As the analyst pointed out, “A sustained break above the $0.42 resistance could trigger a bull run to $1.60.” Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency’s recent performance has failed to reclaim a key level in the mid-zone of its 3-month price range. XLM Following 2017’s Playbook? XLM failed to hold the $0.35 level amid the Monday market dump, retracing 20% and erasing the Sunday gains. Breaking above this resistance could send Stellar’s price to the bull flag’s upper range while failing to reclaim it could send the price to the pattern’s lower range between $0.20 and $0.23. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency continued bleeding and retested its recent lows as support. XLM bounced from $0.27 above the $0.30 level on Wednesday morning, attempting to reclaim it. Technical Analyst Charting Guy highlighted that XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently broke out of a 96-day downtrend “while price consolidated in the golden pocket with time capitulation getting to people.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price ‘Between Heaven And Hell’: $2,000 Level Retest Key For ETH’s Next Move He also noted that XLM’s bull flag “coincidentally targets” the 1.272 Fibonacci level at around $2.46. After its recent performance, the cryptocurrency appears to be following its 2017 pattern, which adds “more confluence to 1.272 fib target,” he explained. In Q4 2017, Stellar saw a similar price breakout, followed by a consolidation period within a bullish flag. XLM then broke out of this pattern and rose over 190% to ATH in early 2018. To the analyst, “Once we break above the top of the golden pocket, it’s game on.” At the time of writing, Stellar trades at $0.30, a 2.4% increase in the weekly timeframe.

The markets rallied, buoyed by positive news from the White House, while plummeting sharply due to stringent steps taken in trade with other countries. Meanwhile, the ongoing manipulation phase has happened previously in the past, which has resulted in a massive explosion. Hence, the BTC price appears to have reached the edge, which could elevate the levels towards a new ATH soon. The BTC price has been trading within a narrow range, suggesting the bulls could be accumulating strength before the next price action. With a rise above $90,000, the price has seen a momental shift and is expected to trigger a strong bullish trend if it rises above the pivot. Currently, Bitcoin has entered one of the most important ranges ahead of the White House Crypto Summit. Hence, the revelation about the Crypto Statergic Reserve is expected to kick off a strong rally, probably above the psychological barrier at $94,200 initially and later close to $99,000. The Bitcoin price has remained stuck within a defined price range between the 200-day & 50-day MA, which are acting as strong support and resistance at the moment. Although the price rebounded from the support, the bullish validation has yet to occur, which could take some more time. The BMSB is about to flip to bullish as the levels are heading towards a bullish crossover. However, the RSI remains stuck below the descending trend line, which has been a strong resistance from long. A rise above the line may only validate a change in the trend, and until then, the token may remain consolidated below $93,300. The next few days are expected to be highly volatile as the upcoming Crypto Summit is hosted by the U.S. President, Donald Trump. Almost all the crypto personalities, including the founders & CEOs of Ripple, Cardano, Ethereum, etc., and many more, are expected to be part of it. Moreover, the president is expected to reveal a Bitcoin Statergic Reserve, which is expected to increase the market volatility. On the other hand, Trump’s World Liberty Financial bought $10 million worth of BTC, ETH, & MOVE, which raises the possibility of a breakout. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is expected to receive yet another bullish boost soon after the summit that may elevate the levels above the bearish influence.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ETH|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 09:34:06

The fund's distributions are primarily return-of-capital, making it tax-efficient but volatile, with income dependent on Bitcoin's volatility. Compared to MAXI, YBTC's capped upside limits its potential, making it less attractive despite its higher yield and frequent payouts. Aggressive investors might consider a small allocation in YBTC, but conservative investors should avoid it; I rate YBTC a hold. Introduction Recently, I covered a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) income fund called MAXI. After that article, I began to hear about other Bitcoin income ETFs, and in particular the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF (YBTC) came up several times. I'm always searching for ETFs to build better portfolios with, and if this fund could replace MAXI in my portfolio, it's worth taking a look at. As far as I can tell, YBTC is the oldest Bitcoin covered call ETF on the market, so it has that going for it at the very least. Launched a little over a year ago in January 2024, YBTC has performed decently, returning 42% to shareholders in total return (which includes dividends paid, but not reinvested), and losing a little under 14% in price. This kind of erosion is expected for covered call funds, typically, and returns are expected to come primarily in the form of distributions. Data by YCharts Compared to BTC itself, the fund found itself lacking somewhat, returning less than half what BTC did over the same timeframe. That is to say, however, that owning BTC does not necessarily produce income on its own. While YBTC underperformed on the total return front, it did produce a very high yield all the while. YBTC Dividends & Yield YCharts only allows me to show TTM (""trailing twelve months"") distribution rates, so this is zoomed into 2025, since there is no data from before that due to how young the fund is. The current rate, based on the TTM formula , is almost at 55%, having previously reached a high of nearly 57%. Data by YCharts The distributions come weekly, which can be relevant to some investors, especially those needing the income in order to pay for expenses, and prefer the weekly cash infusions over monthly like MAXI pays. In the two charts below, the ""D"" symbol denotes a distribution event. Data by YCharts The fund has only been paying weekly since 2025, and issued dividends monthly before that. That's why the actual dividends will be much higher than current ones, which are lower per payment since there are more of them. When looking at the full version of that chart, going back to inception, we see the older dividends at a much higher rate. Don't expect the fund to go back to those anytime soon, unless they go back to monthly distributions. The average of $0.50/share is much closer to the norm moving forward than the all-time $1.308/share average dividend. Data by YCharts The fund is actively managed, meaning that its dividends will be volatile, sometimes going as high as it was in April 2024, or as low as recently, a massive gap even when adjusting for the change from monthly to weekly payments. When looking at yields, make sure you understand which metric you are looking at for the fund, and what it represents. YCharts uses TTM, but the Roundhill website seems to be using a FWD or ""forward"" metric, as it advertises a far lower rate. Roundhill Investments Also, note the very low 30-Day SEC Yield. This is due to the way that rate is calculated, which only includes distributions of investment income. This means that the options income, premium received from the covered call strategy, doesn't count as it is classified as return-of-capital (""RoC"") when distributed to shareholders. YBTC Tax Considerations When looking at the YBTC 19a-1 forms, where they classify their distributions, we see that returns from the last distribution were entirely RoC. Roundhill Investments They did experience a year-end investment income distribution, paid out on 12/31. This should be expected for the future end-of-year dividends as well, but the other weekly distributions will likely continue to be RoC. Roundhill Investments RoC isn't a bad thing, necessarily; this is not the fund just paying shareholders their own capital, it is how options premium is accounted for. Options premium distributions are taxable as RoC, and so Roundhill among other managers distributing options-based ETFs are opting to keep their distributions as close to 100% RoC as possible. It just changes how taxes are paid. Distributions that include RoC are counted against the cost-basis of your shares, and only create a taxable event when you sell those shares. This means that the income is tax-deferred until the sale of the shares, or until your cost-basis becomes zero. If you get to zero on your cost-basis, new RoC distributions would be considered long-term capital gains, according to this IRS publication . A nondividend distribution reduces the basis of your stock. It is not taxed until your basis in the stock is fully recovered. This nontaxable portion also is called a return of capital; it is a return of your investment in the stock of the company. If you buy stock in a corporation in different lots at different times, and you cannot definitely identify the shares subject to the nondividend distribution, reduce the basis of your earliest purchases first. When the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, report any additional nondividend distribution you receive as a capital gain. Whether you report it as a long-term or short-term capital gain depends on how long you have held the stock... Example 1. You bought stock in 2010 for $100. In 2013, you received a nondividend distribution of $80. You did not include this amount in your income, but you reduced the basis of your stock to $20. You received a nondividend distribution of $30 in 2023. The first $20 of this amount reduced your basis to zero. You report the other $10 as a long-term capital gain for 2023. You must report as a long-term capital gain any nondividend distribution you receive on this stock in later years. Of course, this is only relevant to investors holding this fund outside a tax-advantaged account. It does mean that YBTC is ""tax-efficient,"" so to speak, because it offers investors the flexibility of choosing when to create the taxable event, and at what may be a lower rate, depending on your tax situation. For most folks, their long-term capital gains tax rate will be lower than their income tax rate. YBTC Strategy & Holdings Followers of mine should have seen me write about the YieldMax family funds before. Roundhill operates essentially the same strategy as YieldMax funds do, which is that they open synthetic long positions using bought calls and sold puts on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and the Bitcoin US ETF Index ( CBTX ), and sells call against those positions. If you want a deeper explanation and breakdown for this strategy, I suggest reading my article on AMZY , a YieldMax fund with the same principal strategy. This strategy results in YBTC's holdings looking like this, entirely options. Presumably, they are also holding 100% of NAV in cash to secure all of these options. That is also presumably where the net investment income is coming from in the year-end distributions. Roundhill Investments YBTC Risks There are several risks associated with this fund that investors need to consider when investing in YBTC. The first is that its upside exposure to Bitcoin is capped. Roundhill publishes the cap daily on its website . This shows us how much upside is left on the contracts traded; the fund is actively managed and trades essentially every day. Holdings and the caps are updated daily on the website, however, so it's relatively easy to keep track of if one wanted to do that. Roundhill Investments This cap is what leads to the inevitable underperformance of most of these kinds of funds to their reference assets, because they still incur all the downside of the reference asset, only buoyed by the income received. Data by YCharts They often lose more than they gain, since the gains are capped, which leads to losses that grind down the fund's price over time. Data by YCharts There is also great risk in the options strategy, as it is complex and is subject to price changes based on the underlying options math as opposed to spot exposure. Consider that volatility in the underlying asset, Bitcoin, creates higher premiums for YBTC, and thus more income. However, the opposite is also true, in that low volatility leads to lower income. Volatility can change the return profile of the fund dramatically, which is not present in holding Bitcoin on its own. One of the reasons I prefer MAXI is due to it not having an upside cap on BTC, and instead generating its income from options spread sold on indices and commodities. That has led to periodic outperformance and underperformance of Bitcoin itself, whereas YBTC has only trailed the asset. Data by YCharts Investors need to be comfortable with the possibility of this continuing, as well as the risk of inconsistent dividends due to their value being reliant on Bitcoin's volatility. Investors will have a very hard time anticipating future incomes because of this. Suitability I am recommending that investors carefully consider YBTC. Aggressive investors could consider up to a 3% allocation in a diversified portfolio, and moderate investors could consider up to a 1% allocation. Conservative investors are cautioned to stay away from cryptocurrencies entirely, let alone Bitcoin funds that sell options like YBTC. In my own portfolio, MAXI holds a 2.5% allocation. You can check that out here . I am giving YBTC a hold rating as I believe it is doing its job of generating Bitcoin income, but that a better alternative in MAXI exists that doesn't suffer from the same cap to Bitcoin. Conclusion Ultimately, the Roundhill Bitcoin Income Strategy ETF ( YBTC ) is a very high yield opportunity, and one that may pay off, but may not. Its upside cap to Bitcoin is very low, considering how volatile Bitcoin itself is, and its volatility toward the upside is one of the primary benefits to owning it in the first place. YBTC earns a hold because I believe that we have a better ETF on the marketplace for this job, but I can see why some investors would be interested in the fund for its high, weekly distributions. A rate of 55% is nothing to sneeze at, and YBTC is one of few funds that can claim that they distribute income every week.

Caitlin Long – Building the Bridge Between Traditional and Digital Banking Last but not least, Caitlin Long is one of the top women crypto personalities in the world. She is a veteran Wall Street executive with over 20 years of experience and later joined the crypto space as a crypto banking innovator. Long founded the Custodian Bank, a Wyoming-based bank that is both a digital asset custodian and a traditional financial institution. As a digital asset custodian, it manages keys and tokens and provides conventional banking services. Final Thoughts This blog mentioned six of the most influential women in the crypto space, but there are many more who have done equally appreciative work. These women have shaped the DeFi industry, and their role goes far beyond holding digital assets. With their vision for development, they will play a significant role in expanding and evolving the crypto industry. So, on Women’s Day, let’s celebrate the pioneers who are building the future of finance and influencing others to do the same.

The expected easing comes as markets reprice at least three Fed rate cuts for 2025 and Germany and China take the fiscal easing route to shore up their respective economies. In other words, the ECB's impending easing could only add to the ongoing global liquidity easing, offering bullish cues to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. ""Overall, liquidity conditions are supportive and rising, to keep risk and crypto pushing higher, despite this recent correction on growth concerns,"" founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoclub said in Thursday's edition. Volatile bond markets The European Union's headline inflation is still not at the central bank's target of 2%, which raises concerns about the impending rate cut and its impact on the European bond markets. Germany’s 10-year bund has climbed to 2.8%, its highest since 2011, pricing in more supply in the wake of Germany's fiscal stimulus announcement. The spike has narrowed the U.S.-German yield spread in favor of the euro, driving the dollar index lower. That, coupled with the tariff threat, has the DXY index falling faster than in President Trump's first term. The U.K. bond yields have also topped those of the U.S. Meanwhile, Japan’s 10-year bond has surpassed 1.5%, a 17-year high, as the Bank of Japan struggles to rein in inflation after three rate hikes after almost ten years of negative interest rates.

He believes that a crypto reserve will lead to the failure of decentralization once the government is put in charge of it. Yakovenko proposed that the state should run its own reserve as a hedge against the Fed making a mistake.

No reserve, because if you want decentralization to fail you’d put the government in charge of it. 2. Or states run their own reserve as a hedge against the fed making a mistake 3. Or if there has to be a reserve, it’s based on objectively… https://t.co/LfYXCIeRnG — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) March 6, 2025 Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has distanced himself from a potential crypto reserve in the United States and gave his reserve order of preference. He argued that a crypto reserve could eradicate decentralization once the U.S. government is put in charge of it. “I don’t care what they are, they can even be constructed such that only bitcoin satisfies them right now, they just must be objectively measurable and rationally justified.” -Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs Yakovenko also added that the United States could run its own crypto reserve as a hedge against the Fed making a mistake in the future. He believes that the state should base the reserve on objectively measurable requirements if there has to be a reserve. The crypto firm co-founder also highlighted that the Solana ecosystem will get it done “if there is a target to beat.” Crypto analytic platform Polymarket estimated that 64% of Bitcoin is being used as a U.S. reserve, with Ethereum following at 42%. The firm also identified the chances of XRP and SOL being included for a reserve at 29% and 28%, respectively. The crypto industry is bracing for the White House Crypto Summit on Friday to get further details on the makeup of the reserve, including whether additional tokens will be added. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick mentioned that a Bitcoin strategic reserve was something Trump was interested in since he spoke about it all during his campaign trial. Lutnick believes that the other tokens “will be treated differently –positively, but differently.” Ripple pitches to Trump to include SOL in the crypto reserve plan Crypto journalist Laura Shin mentioned that Ripple pitched SOL as part of a national reserve in the United States. Shin argued that sources familiar with the conversations revealed that Ripple made the move to make the inclusion of XRP in a reserve seem more legitimate. Two sources familiar with the matter disclosed that Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty reportedly pitched to the President to include SOL in the crypto reserve plan announced on Sunday. Both Ripple executives argued that the inclusion of Solana will give it more legitimacy among the crypto community. The incorporation of Solana as a reserve helped the digital asset firm convey that it was advocating for a crypto reserve that included other virtual tokens. The crypto firm issuer of the XRP token has gained criticism over the years for being a speculative asset with insufficient usage to justify its $145 billion market capitalization. Trump mentioned three tokens, XRP, SOL, and ADA, for potential crypto reserves, but the tokens are not considered stores of value. The inclusion of the tokens has raised questions from Ripple leaders about whether the reserve is a serious project and if it will accumulate large gains. The leaders were also wondering if the reserve is simply a way to give early investors and the insiders behind the tokens a public relations boost. Garlinghouse said on Sunday that the crypto industry will achieve its goals and beyond “IF WE WORK TOGETHER.” He also appreciated the President’s vision of a government digital asset reserve representative of the industry. Ripple’s CEO said that “maximalism is the enemy of the industry’s progress” and was glad to see the U.S. finally moving past Bill Hinman and Biden’s SEC’s “very broken thinking.” National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden raised his concerns about Solana’s venture capital influence in November last year. He called out Solana’s reliance on venture capital and suggested that it compromised the network’s decentralization. Snowden also described the digital asset as “born in prison,” implying that its independence on VC funding could limit its autonomy and alignment with blockchain’s principles.

Analysts see parallels to 2017, predicting a potential surge to somewhat ridiculous levels. On the other hand, some warn of a bearish H&S pattern, suggesting a pullback unless XRP clears $2.85. What Could Be Next for XRP? Despite the experienced volatility, Ripple’s native token remains one of the best-performing leading cryptocurrencies, with its price soaring by almost 15% in the past week and currently trading at around $2.57. Perhaps the most evident factor contributing to its rally is Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration will create a strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP (among other assets). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Pro-Ripple market observers (who are usually quite vocal) have noted the token’s resurgence and made interesting price forecasts for the near future. The X user JAVON MARKS suggested that the pattern XRP broke out of in November 2024 resembles that of 2017. As such, the analyst expects a bull run “greater than many think or even imagine to possible.” CrediBULL Crypto said the asset’s valuation has declined by 15% from where they took profit, and the trader now doubts they will get another chance to increase their exposure at prices below $2. “OI has completely reset back to levels it was at before our 5x impulse off the lows, spot premium is steadily increasing here at the highs, and funding is even flipping negative,” they stated. Overall, the analyst claimed that XRP looks “incredibly healthy here, and any dips that we may get are a gift.” For their part, EGRAG CRYPTO recently outlined a truly shocking prediction. The X user maintained that XRP could be gearing up for its next “big leap” due to several factors, such as a retest of “the bull market support band” and a “noise consolidation” at the $2-$3.40 range. They reminded that in 2017, the coin followed “a classic Fib extension move, smashing Fib 1.618, consolidating, then making another parabolic move to Fib 2.236.” The analyst thinks that if history repeats, this could result in a price explosion in the $27-$222 range. Such high levels would require XRP’s market cap to skyrocket to at least $1.5 trillion. The current capitalization of the asset is less than $150 billion, making the prediction somewhat unlikely. A Reversal in the Cards? Contrary to the overall bullishness among industry participants focusing on XRP, some believe a pullback is not out of the question. One X user recently suggested that the asset’s pattern remains on “H&S watch,” envisioning a potential bearish reversal. The market observer claimed that XRP should soar above $2.85 to negate the chances of a correction.

BTC rose to $92,700 before profit-taking saw it decline to $90,800 in European morning hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) surged as much as 10% to lead gains among majors, with Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and ether (ETH) rising 6%. XRP and BNB Chain’s bnb showed muted gains with a 2.5% jump, underperforming a 3.5% rise in the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) . Thursday’s price action helped buoy bulls after crypto markets roller-coasted this week as President Donald Trump revealed plans for a strategic reserve of tokens, including XRP, ADA and ETH, on Sunday, sending the market higher by 12%. But that euphoria was doused as traders awaited concrete plans and a fresh round of U.S. tariffs went into play, with broader markets retracting on Tuesday. There has been a steady ascend in crypto markets, in line with a CoinDesk analysis , as watchers expect clear plans to emerge at Saturday’s summit. “Investors view this as an asymmetric event with high stakes,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in Wednesday broadcast message, referring to the summit. “Will it serve as the unexpected catalyst that sends prices soaring, or will it expose crypto’s fragility and trigger a deeper sell-off?” “Lens out. Corporate bond spreads are widening, with high-yield spreads now sitting at 290 bps above Treasuries, while the investment-grade vs. high-yield spread stands at 200 bps. While this isn't signaling panic, it's a trend worth monitoring closely,” QCP cautioned. FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich noted that bitcoin's share of the crypto market exceeds 60%, which is typical in periods of fear, while ether’s share has dropped to a five-year low of 9% — a troubling sign for altcoin investors as any inflows are bound for BTC. “Bitcoin continues to flirt with the 200-day MA, popping out on Tuesday shortly after touching that level below $83,000. Wednesday morning's market dynamics reflect cautious attempts to form a bottom,” Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email. “A return to the area above the 50-day at $97,000 is a marker of bullish success,” he added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|XRP|ADA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 09:40:54

Expert Insights,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-price-surge-is-now-the-perfect-time-to-invest-expert-insights/,"The post XRP Price Surge: Is Now the Perfect Time to Invest? Expert Insights appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the start of this month, the XRP market has seen a growth of 18.45%. On the second day of the month alone, the market surged by approximately 34.08%. In the last seven days, with an impressive growth of 13.4% , it has outperformed top cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB and Solana. A video recently shared on X by a crypto expert, identified as STEPH IS CRYPTO, suggests that it is the ideal time to enter the XRP market. Here is everything one should know about his commentary! XRP’s Bullish Chart Pattern The crypto expert pointed out that a falling wedge pattern has formed in the XRP market. A falling wedge is a chart pattern where the price action is consolidating between two downward-sloping trendlines. This pattern is generally considered bullish, meaning it often precedes a price breakout to the upside. The expert advised investors to ignore the fake breakouts, like the one occurred on March 2. He asserted that if the XRP price closes above the $2.5 level , the next target could be as high as $3.38. Short Squeeze Could Push XRP Higher Projecting the current Binance XRP/USDT Liquidation Heatmap chart signal, which shows the concentration of a significant amount of liquidity in short positions, the expert noted that many traders are betting on XRP’s price to decline. He opined that if market makers target this liquidity, it could trigger a short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when a rapid price increase forces traders with short positions to buy XRP to cover their losses. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Ripple vs SEC Lawsuits To Resolve in March Hint Pro-XRP Lawyer , Fear & Greed Index Suggests a Buying Opportunity #XRP : 3 REASONS TO GO ALL IN NOW!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/cMsAT98Dp2 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) March 5, 2025 The Crypto Fear and Greed Index now stands at 25. This figure indicates that fear is the dominant feeling among crypto traders right now. Yesterday, the index was at 20. Last week, it was at 10. The expert invited attention to this index. Historically, extreme fear leads to price rebounds. In conclusion, XRP is showing signs of a bullish breakout , and market conditions suggest a potential price rally.

Russia ‘s largest and sanctioned cryptocurrency exchange Garantex has temporarily shut down all of its services after Tether froze over 2.5 billion rubles worth of USDT. “Dear users! We have bad news,” Garantex said in a March 6 statement on Telegram. “Tether has waged war against the Russian crypto market and blocked our wallets for more than 2.5 billion rubles.” The exchange announced it is “temporarily suspending all services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals,” while its team works to resolve the issue. “We are fighting and will not give up!” it added. Garantex also warned Russian users that “all USDT in Russian wallets is now at risk.” As of press time, Tether made no public statements on the move. The stablecoin issuer has previously faced scrutiny for its transactions with Russian-linked entities.

Despite the restrictions, it continued operations, serving Russian users via sanctioned Russian banks. The shutdown follows the European Union’s recent decision to add Garantex to its sanctions list, part of a broader effort to target financial networks linked to Moscow. U.S. Treasury’s OFAC first blacklisted Garantex in April 2022, citing its role in processing transactions tied to illicit actors and darknet markets, including funds linked to the Russian Ransomware-as-a-Service group Conti and the now-defunct Hydra marketplace.

While Bitcoin soared past $90,000, altcoins also exploded: the XRP coin retested $3, while the SHIB coin targeted a breakout above $0.000015. Amid this bullish outlook, demand for new AI coins like IntelMarkets (INTL) exploded. Offering a cushion against market shocks and promising significant gains as a low-cap, it has been dubbed the best ICO to invest in. In addition, its quantum-proof crypto custody solution sets it apart from popular trading protocols—the next-gen exchange. IntelMarkets (INTL): Introducing the First Quantum-Proof Crypto Custody Solution IntelMarkets (INTL) stands out for its innovative blend of AI and DeFi. Aiming to transform the $36 billion crypto trading scene, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels, not forgetting its quantum-proof crypto custody solution. Meanwhile, it has higher growth prospects than the SHIB coin and XRP coin, contributing to the rising demand. In the tenth stage of the ICO, over $11.2 million has been raised in early funding, with a token priced at $0.091. Experts consider it a steal at the current price, tipped for a 55x rally after Tier-1 exchange listings. With plenty of room to run, it is among the best altcoins to invest in—a must-have this cycle. Besides its future growth, it intends to transform the crypto trading landscape. It will introduce the first quantum-proof crypto custody solution: the Quantum X wallet. Designed to address the risk from the advancement in quantum computing, it has been called a trailblazer. At the same time, it will feature the first native AI blockchain and advanced trading bots trained on over 100,000 data points. Ripple (XRP): Shaking Off Bearish Pressure The XRP coin wasn’t unscathed during the latest bloodbath, retesting lower price levels. However, with the bull back, it retested $3, although now hovers around $2.6 after a slight decline. Meanwhile, top analysts are optimistic, maintaining a bullish stance. Cdelipa, a leading expert, expects the XRP coin price to reach $5 in the next 3 months. Meanwhile, TylieEric suggests a bounce in the XRP coin price after the recent correction, targeting a rally toward $10 and $15. Also, technical indicators like the 200-SMA and 100-EMA signal a bounce in the XRP coin price. Despite the potential upswing, investors are betting more on IntelMarkets (INTL) due to its upside. The emerging cryptocurrency defies broader bearish trends and with plenty of room to run, it is among the best coins to invest in this year. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Targeting the $0.000015 Support The memecoin sector was hit the hardest during the latest market decline. However, an overall market rally pushed the SHIB coin upward. It retains around $0.000014 and is on track to flip $0.000015 into support Given bullish technical indicators like the 9-HMA and neutral RSI, the SHIB coin might experience further upswings. Also, top analysts like Smellyrino suggest a rally toward $0.000016 during its next leg up. Cr0w_agent, sharing a similar sentiment, targets a big leap in the SHIB coin price in the coming days. However, considering the rising interest in IntelMarkets, a top ICO, it might be a better bet than the SHIB coin. Moreover, it has higher growth prospects as a low-cap—perhaps the best new crypto to invest in. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Crypto Unicorn After Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP) Buzzing with optimism, IntelMarkets (INTL) has been hailed as the next big thing. Its bullish AI narrative and quantum-proof crypto custody solution put it in the spotlight. It experiences rising demand despite SHIB coin and XRP coin soaring, poised for a 55x rally after listing.

Kate Cooper, the newly appointed CEO of OKX Australia, believes the election could be a pivotal moment for institutional participation in the digital asset sector. In a recent interview , Cooper expressed hope that long-awaited crypto legislation—two years in the making—will finally see the light of day. She noted that the industry has been demanding clear and fit-for-purpose regulations, which could open the doors for greater institutional involvement. Institutional Crypto Adoption Ahead? “There is already an inflow of retail users thanks to the current bull market,” she said, adding that a well-defined regulatory framework would encourage large financial institutions to enter the space with confidence. Cooper’s background positions her as a key voice in this discussion. Before joining OKX, she worked at two major Australian banks—NAB and Westpac—where she focused on digital assets and innovation. She also previously served as the Australian CEO of Zodia Custody, an institutional crypto platform. “Certainly, when I was at NAB, the key barrier to really entering or moving beyond the proof-of-concept stage was regulatory clarity,” she emphasized. Crypto Voters Could Influence Election Outcome in Australia With the election expected to be closely contested, crypto investors could play a crucial role in deciding the next government. A YouGov poll conducted on February 19 revealed that 59% of current crypto holders are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports digital assets. The race is tight, with the center-right coalition currently leading 51% to 49% against the ruling center-left Labor party, according to another YouGov poll. Whichever party secures victory may have a significant influence on shaping Australia’s approach to crypto regulation. Cooper predicts that if the winning party implements new crypto laws, stablecoin adoption in Australia could surge. She pointed out that stablecoins have already seen massive global adoption in 2024, with $27.6 trillion in annual transfer volume—outpacing Visa and Mastercard combined. While Australia currently has no plans to create a national crypto reserve , Cooper believes the country needs a clear strategy to cement its position in the digital economy.

Following its brief recovery to $170 after the US strategic crypto reserve fund was announced, the altcoin price has dropped back to the $140 region. Similarly, the DOGE price has fallen to the $0.2 level. On the flip side, IntelMarkets (INTL) has remained resilient. It has weaved through the bear market, giving early investors 900% returns on their investments. As a new-generation AI-based trading platform, IntelMarkets could be the next big thing in the investment market. Its price is expected to skyrocket by 20x after launch, positioning it as the best crypto investment now. Solana (SOL) Price Drops As Strategic Fund Loses Steam Over the past week, the Solana price has witnessed high volatility. Bears and bulls have been battling for dominance. The Solana price dipped to lows of $120. However, the announcement of a strategic crypto reserve fund by President Donald Trump triggered a massive Solana price pump. As a result of the announcement, the Solana price briefly crossed the $190 mark. However, as the hype faded, the Solana price returned back to lows at $140. For the bulls to return, the Solana price must form a strong support above $150. According to CENK, the Solana price could skyrocket to $280 in the next few weeks. Another expert, called Trader Tardigrade, says a big Solana price move is coming. He noted that the current oversold RSI had propelled the Solana price to new levels in the past. Trader Tardigrade expects the altcoin price to soar to $440 in the coming months. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Drop, Number Of New Addresses Plummets Dogecoin (DOGE) briefly enjoyed the price pump from the strategic crypto reserve, rising to $0.24. DOGE being classified as a collectible by the SEC also played a part in the increase. However, the memecoin has been on the decline. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the DOGE price has plummeted by 17.8% on the weekly chart. The memecoin now trades at the $0.200 range. In addition to the DOGE price drop, there has been a massive decline in the number of new addresses created on the Dogecoin network. In a recent tweet, Ali Martinez posted a chart from Glassnode, which revealed that over 1.29 million addresses were created on November 21, 2024. However, the figure dipped to 30,815 on February 23, 2025. Looking ahead, market experts like Olivier D Maximus say the DOGE price could increase soon. According to him, the DOGE price is trading in an ascending channel and is at the lower part. Olivier notes that the DOGE price has to cross $0.3350 for an uptrend to begin. If this happens, the DOGE price might soar to $0.65 in the next few weeks. IntelMarkets (INTL) Brings Advanced Tools To Retail Traders IntelMarkets (INTL) is revolutionizing the cryptocurrency trading market through the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized finance (DeFi). This new platform provides traders with market analysis and trading tools that were previously available only to large investors. IntelMarkets has a decentralized marketplace for AI agents. The marketplace provides ready-to-use agents that are built for high performance and can find opportunities and make trades in the market. It also has customizable agents that can be set to suit the investor’s needs and objectives for investment and trading. Another proof of IntelMarkets’ focus on the implementation of advanced technologies is the cooperation with NVIDIA. The platform uses NVIDIA’s H200 GPUs to guarantee real-time updates and trading experience. This improves the AI platform as it helps in the fast analysis of large data sources to give traders the right information. Meanwhile, IntelMarkets has a native token called INTL. It is currently in the presale stage and is priced at $0.091. With over $11.2 million raised, IntelMarkets is one of the best DeFi projects to watch out for. IntelMarkets Tagged As the Next Best Crypto To Buy While the Solana price continues its range-bound movement, IntelMarkets stands out as the next moonshot coin. Its AI trading tools and adoption of advanced technologies have piqued the interest of investors. Notably, only those who join the crypto ICO now can get the highest returns after launch.

For instance, it is clear DOGE bears remain strong with its value on a downtrend. Meanwhile, XRP managed to see some green charts thanks to the recent Donald Trump announcement for a US crypto reserve which will feature this token. , Although market experts like CryptoELITES and Captain Faibik remain optimistic for DOGE and XRP, all eyes are on a new presale token, IntelMarkets (INTL) . Since it was recently listed on CoinMarketCap, millions of new traders gravitated towards this phase ten presale star. As it aims to redefine crypto trading forever, many investors think it may have a higher upside potential than DOGE and XRP. IntelMarkets (INTL) Skyrockets 911% in Value Months Before Listing While the Dogecoin price and the price of Ripple are showing some volatility, IntelMarkets (INTL) is gaining all the attention – for a good reason. This altcoin was recently listed on CoinMarketCap which is a bullish development for any token. As a result, millions of new traders could gravitate to this project. Hype was already high for IntelMarkets, as it will bring something innovative to crypto trading—the first AI-driven trading platform. On it, traders will get to experience self-learning robots that improve their performance over time, as well as the Intell-M® channel analysis tool, which provides consolidated insights from 10K data platforms. With all these features, IntelMarkets could stand out from its rivals like Coinbase. The INTL native token will power this platform. Holding this token brings governance voting rights and access to new IntelMarkets features first. Thus, over 8M INTL tokens have been sold in phase ten of its presale. Currently, INTL costs just $0.091, a 911% rise from its starting price of $0.009. But, this altcoin price will increase to $0.10 in the next phase and go on to $0.11 once a Tier-1 CEX lists it. That’s an easy 20% profit and much more coming. CryptoELITES: The Dogecoin Price Could Hit $5 Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the best meme coins, but its value has dropped. CoinMarketCap shows that the Dogecoin price fell over 35% on the one-month chart. Its value moved between $0.30 and below $0.20 during that time. However, crypto analyst CryptoELITES remains bullish on Dogecoin (DOGE). According to his X post, this meme coin has started its big move and may see a breakout soon. As per CryptoELITES, the long-term target for the Dogecoin price sits at $5. Although this Dogecoin price prediction is turning some heads, many investors are looking at INTL instead. The Dogecoin price will grow slower as its market cap is around $30B. This means DOGE will need a lot of new money to roll in. The Price of Ripple (XRP) Could See a Rally, Expert Claims Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is showing some slight gains on the price charts. In the past seven days, its value has jumped from around $2.10 to over $2.30. In other words, as per CoinMarketCap, the price of Ripple increased nearly 10% in just a few days. The community is still watching Ripple (XRP) because of what analysts like Captain Faibik said. Notably, Faibik made an X post saying that the price of Ripple may jump more since it has formed a bullish pennant on its daily timeframe. He foresees a 100% rally for the price of Ripple. Some traders are still skeptical about the movement of the price of Ripple. This is because its value has surged over 250% on the YTD chart. Therefore, its highest upswings may have passed. Because of this, traders are turning to INTL more. Is IntelMarkets (INTL) Set to Outpace Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP)? With the Dogecoin price and the price of Ripple both remaining in limbo, the door has opened for IntelMarkets (INTL) to gain attention. This project will stand out from DOGE and XRP as it has a smaller market cap. As a result, INTL will see faster price gains with less money. Unlike these top altcoins, INTL is also tied to the AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. Thus, its long-term growth potential and stability look amazing. Due to all these factors, some investors think INTL has a higher upside potential than DOGE and XRP. If it manages to see the same growth as other exchange tokens like BNB did, its upcoming 20% growth could just be the tip of the iceberg.

Announced on Mar. 6 on Solv Protocol’s official Medium page, this partnership aims to bridge Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum’s ( ETH ) expanding decentralized finance ecosystems. Through this integration, SolvBTC holders can stake their assets, earn rewards, and access cross-chain liquidity within the Soneium ecosystem. SolvBTC is a token that is 1:1 backed by Bitcoin, earned when users deposit Bitcoin into Solv Protocol. Furthermore, SolvBTC Liquid Staking Tokens, SolvBTC.LSTs, will make advanced yield strategies possible, improving Bitcoin users’ scalability and flexibility. A key part of the initiative is Solv’s Staking Abstraction Layer, which makes it easier to stake on several blockchains. SAL enables Bitcoin owners to participate in DeFi more easily, extending the cryptocurrency’s capabilities beyond simple holding or trading.

Solana's (SOL) dramatic climb from a few pennies to over $200 demonstrated how high-potential blockchain businesses can generate life-changing returns. Top Solana investors are now acquiring Rexas Finance (RXS), a new cryptocurrency priced below $0.30. Many wonder whether it can mirror SOL's amazing run. Early Solana Rally: A Case Study in Explosive Growth. Solana hit the market in 2020 for a mere $0.22 per token. Few investors recognized its potential then, but its groundbreaking proof-of-history (PoH) consensus and rapid transaction speed immediately distinguished it from competitors. By the end of 2021, having surged to an all-time high of $260, SOL had generated over 118,000% gains in less than two years. Early acceptance by institutional investors, ecosystem expansion, and Solana's capacity to manage 65,000 transactions per second at a fraction of Ethereum's cost helped explain Solana's ascent. As the need for scalable blockchain applications developed, Solana positioned itself as the preferred choice over Ethereum, propelling its price into uncharted territory. Investors are looking for the next high-potential blockchain business, and Rexas Finance is a good contender. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Unique Newcomer with Massive Potential. Rexas Finance, like Solana, is entering the market with innovative utility. Unlike hype-only coins, Rexas Finance focuses on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, offering a tangible use case predicted to dominate the next wave of cryptocurrency adoption. Rexas Finance allows users to tokenize real estate, commodities, and financial instruments at its foundation, making them more accessible, liquid, and transparent. The platform includes a no-code token generator, which enables organizations and people to establish blockchain-based assets easily. Utility: The Key to Long-Term Success Solana's scalability helped it flourish. Rexas Finance stands out by emphasizing the tokenization of tangible assets, which will be a $50 billion sector by 2025 and rise to $16 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance's cross-chain capability makes it a versatile and easily accessible platform for global investors. Rexas Finance has included a capability to manufacture and trade asset-backed NFTs via Rexas Gen AI offers. These NFTs let investors engage in high-value assets without full ownership expenses by representing ownership of fractionalized real estate, fine art, and commodities. Furthermore, new blockchain initiatives have a unique venue on the Rexas Launchpad to raise money and start effectively. Like Solana's early adopters, this function provides early investors access to high-potential entrepreneurs and allows them to engage in verified initiatives at the ground level. Rexas Finance also provides staking and liquidity mining services through token ownership, enabling users to generate passive revenue. Staking RXS tokens allows investors to profit from yield farming, governance involvement, and ecosystem incentives, developing a strong incentive to hold and help maintain the integrity of the network. Strategic Decisions: Setting Rexas Finance Up for Great Rally Zero Venture Capital Funding Unlike many altcoins, which rely on venture capital (VC) funding, Rexas Finance chose a public presale. This assures that early investors do not face huge token dumps from institutional backers, who frequently sell their holdings after the listing. By focusing on a fair start, Rexas Finance has created a community-driven environment with high investor confidence. Increasing Visibility Being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko improves Rexas Finance's market visibility. Early postings on these sites help projects gain traction, attract retail investors, and build credibility in the cryptocurrency field. Certik Audit: Strengthening Security and Trust Security is a primary consideration for blockchain initiatives, and Rexas Finance has completed a Certik audit , one of the most respected security evaluations in the crypto business. This validation assures the project is free of serious weaknesses, making it a more secure investment choice than unaudited initiatives. Multistage Rexas Finance Presale: $46M+ Raised Since its inception in September 2024, the Rexas Finance presale has sparked intense interest among early investors. The project has completed eleven presale stages ahead of schedule, with the twelfth now 90% completed. As of this writing, $46.1 million has been raised from selling 450 million tokens. The presale price has increased from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20, showing investors are becoming more interested. With the last presale stage nearing completion, Rexas Finance's excitement grows as it prepares to list on at least three tier-1 exchanges on June 19, 2025. Can Rexas Finance Produce Solana-Like Returns? Solana's success sprang from innovative technology, solid institutional support, and a growing ecosystem. Rexas Finance is on a similar path, with its revolutionary RWA tokenization architecture, community-first strategy, and high-profile security validation. Analysts anticipate that RXS might reach $50 by 2025, riding the wave of RWA adoption and strategic exchange listings. Expert forecasts suggest the token's deflationary nature could result in a multi-thousand percent gain in the coming years. Conclusion Solana demonstrated that early acceptance in a high-utility blockchain project can lead to substantial advantages. Rexas Finance offers a similar opportunity, combining real-world utility, significant presale momentum, and strategic market entry. With its imminent exchange launch and rising demand for RWA tokenization, RXS could be the next big thing in crypto. Act fast before the anticipated rally.

The altcoins are also well in the green on a daily scale, with XRP going close to $2.6, while SOL is near $150. BTC Above $90K It has been a wild ride in the cryptocurrency space in the past several weeks. Just this past Sunday, when BTC’s price had calmed at around $85,000 following the previous rollercoaster, President Trump confirmed plans to create the US crypto strategic reserve and namedropped several assets, including bitcoin. Its price reacted with an immediate surge that drove it north by ten grand within hours. After reaching that multi-day peak, though, the bears stepped up and pushed the cryptocurrency down by $13,000. As a result, BTC found itself dropping to $82,000 on Tuesday. The bulls managed to defend that level and didn’t allow any dip beneath $80,000. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover some ground and spiked above $90,000 during the Thursday Asian trading session. Its ascent was stopped at $93,000, but the asset still trades above $90,000 despite a minor rejection. Its market capitalization has tapped $1.8 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is above 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Turn Green Most altcoins have also charted impressive gains over the past few days and since yesterday. Chainlink and Avalanche are now leading the way from the larger-cap alts. LINK has jumped by another 7% and now sits above $17. AVAX has neared $22 after a 5.5% increase. XRP, SUI, SOL, and DOGE have risen by about 3-4%, while ETH, TRX, and LTC are also in the green. Even more impressive gains come from MOVE, ONDO, and CRO, all of which have jumped by double-digits in the past day.

Airdrop farming is quickly becoming the most effective way to accumulate free tokens, and Ethereum remains the dominant network for high-value airdrops. Investors who understand the potential of curated, automated airdrop participation are already positioning themselves for the next big wave of free crypto rewards. While many projects require users to manually track and claim airdrops, one altcoin is revolutionizing the process. Skyren DAO has built an ecosystem that automates airdrop collection, ensuring that SKYRN holders receive steady rewards without constantly monitoring the market. This shift in strategy is attracting serious attention from DeFi investors — and it’s happening just as Ethereum’s ecosystem prepares for another expansion. Why the Ethereum Network Is the Best Place for Airdrop Farming Ethereum remains the strongest blockchain for launching and distributing new tokens. The majority of top-performing airdrops in recent years — including Uniswap (UNI), Optimism (OP), and Arbitrum (ARB) — all originated from Ethereum-based projects. Airdrop hunters understand the power of Ethereum’s ecosystem, but there’s one challenge: participating in every major airdrop takes time, effort, and transaction fees. That’s where Skyren DAO’s solution stands out. Skyren DAO’s Role in the Airdrop Farming Boom Skyren DAO was designed for hands-free airdrop farming. The project’s infrastructure automatically collects airdrops from partnered Ethereum-based projects, rewarding SKYRN holders without them needing to hunt for new opportunities manually. How Skyren Makes Airdrop Farming Effortless Automated Airdrop Collection – Instead of requiring users to manually claim rewards, Skyren’s smart contracts handle the process , delivering tokens directly to holders. Curated Airdrop Selection – Skyren’s partnerships ensure that only high-value, legitimate airdrops make it to investors, reducing the risk of scams. Staking and Yield Boosts – SKYRN holders can stake their tokens to increase their eligibility for premium airdrops, making participation even more profitable. For investors who have missed out on past Ethereum-based airdrops, Skyren presents a turnkey solution to ensuring they never leave money on the table again. For an in-depth look at how automated airdrop strategies are changing DeFi, check out Crypto Chino’s latest analysis . Phase 5 Presale: Secure SKYRN at $0.048 Before the Next Price Increase Skyren DAO’s Phase 5 presale is now live, with SKYRN available at $0.048.

Presale investors will receive priority access to high-value airdrops and staking benefits, making it the best way to capitalize on Ethereum’s next wave of token distributions. Final Thoughts: The Evolution of DeFi Rewards Ethereum has already proven itself as the go-to blockchain for airdrop farming, but Skyren is making the process easier and more profitable. By automating token claims, curating high-value airdrops, and integrating staking bonuses, SKYRN is transforming how passive investors generate rewards in DeFi. Investors who want to maximize their exposure to Ethereum’s best opportunities should act now — before the SKYRN presale reaches its next phase.

With Pi Day (March 14) around the corner, investors are eagerly awaiting a major announcement. Adding fuel to the excitement, market analyst Kim H Wong believes Pi Coin is on track to secure listings on Binance, Coinbase, and other leading platforms. Pi Network Major Listings: Expert Weighs In Renowned crypto analyst Kim H Wong recently shared his insights on Pi Network’s potential listing. According to Wong, Pi stands apart from other crypto projects due to its real-world utility and massive community support. He pointed out that crypto aims to build a functional digital economy where users can trade goods and services using Pi Coins. Unlike many speculative tokens, Pi focuses on practical applications, including decentralized applications (dApps). User Base & Following In Focus Another critical factor is its immense user base. Wong highlighted that the Pi Network app has been downloaded over 150 million times, boasting 65 million active users. In addition, Pi secured a monumental milestone , with its X following soaring to 4 million. This makes it among the top followed cryptocurrencies on X. Meanwhile, Wong also emphasized Pi Coin’s trading activity, noting that it has been listed on multiple centralized exchanges (CEXs) since February 20, 2025. Despite not being available on Binance or Coinbase, Pi’s 24-hour trading volume has recorded a massive surge. He also added that Pi Coin ranks as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and if meme and stablecoins are excluded, it ranks eighth. Given these factors, Wong believes it’s only a matter of time before major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase list Pi token. He further stated that if they fail to do so, they would be missing out on a massive opportunity. Potential Impact Of A Binance Listing If Binance and Coinbase list Pi Network, it could dramatically boost investor confidence and increase trading volume. Typically, assets listed on these exchanges experience significant price surges due to increased visibility and liquidity. Additionally, speculation is growing about Pi’s potential inclusion in the US Crypto Reserve list. Given Donald Trump’s recent support for US-issued cryptocurrencies, some believe Pi could play a role in the evolving digital asset landscape. Pi Coin Price: What Lies Ahead? Pi’s ranking as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency is noteworthy, considering all the top 10 cryptos are listed on Binance. This has led many to believe that Binance will eventually add Pi to its trading platform to stay competitive. Also, the community lauded that without these major listings, the crypto has achieved new heights in the market. Besides, with Pi Day approaching, all eyes are on Pi Network’s next move. If a major exchange listing is confirmed, it could trigger a strong rally for Pi. Pi Coin’s value today hovered near the flatline at $1.93 and its trading volume fell 1% to $772 million. Notably, the crypto has touched the brief $2 mark in the last 24 hours.

Cronos ( CRO ), the native token of Cronos Chain , soared by 15.8% on Thursday amid speculation that it could be included a strategic crypto reserve, recently unveiled by the U.S. President Donald Trump . Per crypto.news price tracking page, the price of CRO jumped to $0.09 on March 6, with its trading volume soaring by nearly 100%, according to data from crypto price aggregator platforms. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1897473838595674310 You might also like: Crypto.com and Kalshi face CFTC scrutiny over Super Bowl event contracts The pump comes a few hours after Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed in an X post that Crypto.com’s chief executive Kris Marszalek “will be attending the White House Crypto Summit on Friday,” without disclosing the sources. As a result, Marszalek joins a growing list of more than a dozen crypto executives set to attend the event, alongside Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. Despite the speculation, CRO has not been officially confirmed as part of the national crypto reserve. However, Trump’s earlier statements suggest that U.S. authorities may incorporate multiple tokens, as he noted that the strategic crypto reserve will include “other valuable cryptocurrencies,” in addition to Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). While initial expectations centered on Bitcoin as the sole asset in the reserve, Trump’s comments expanded the range of tokens that could potentially be included.

Ex-White House Director Hints at Resolution,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/xrp-news-is-the-sec-dropping-ripple-case-ex-white-house-director-hints-at-resolution/,"The post XRP News: Is the SEC Dropping Ripple Case? Ex-White House Director Hints at Resolution appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a recent podcast interview on The Wolf of All Streets, former White House Director of Communications, Anthony Scaramucci, made a claim that the SEC might have dropped its lawsuit against Ripple (XRP). This news has created a buzz in the crypto community, especially after a series of recent events that hint at major developments. During the podcast, when Scott Melker mentioned the SEC dropping cases against Coinbase, Gemini, ConsenSys, and others, Anthony Scaramucci interrupted and said “Ripple” twice, suggesting that the SEC may have already dropped its case against Ripple. While the case between Ripple and the SEC is technically still ongoing, many believe that the lawsuit could be quietly dropped, possibly in favor of a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP. If Scaramucci’s assertion is true, this could mean substantial gains for XRP holders, though confirmation from the SEC is still pending. The news has drawn mixed reactions, especially from Bitcoin maximalists, who believe Bitcoin should dominate the crypto space. However, many others see a future where multiple cryptocurrencies, including XRP, can coexist. The White House Crypto Summit on March 7, 2025, will also likely discuss creating a U.S. strategic crypto reserve, which could influence cryptocurrency regulations, including XRP. As a result, it’s expected that the SEC may soon end its case against Ripple, although no official statement has been made yet. As the Ripple-SEC case continues to unfold, the crypto world waits for more details. Will the SEC officially drop the lawsuit, or is this all just speculation? Time will tell, but the developments so far suggest that Ripple’s battle may be nearing its end, with the potential for big shifts in the crypto market.",News|Uncategorized|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 10:08:18

Authorities and regulators have warned traders not to get scammed by the fake coin. On March 6, Hong Kong lawmaker and active crypto supporter Johnny Ng warned traders that an account impersonating the Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee was promoting a Solana ( SOL )-based coin claimed to be the region’s “National Hong Kong coin.” Ng confirmed that the coin was false and that the Hong Kong government is not involved in the launch at all, labeling it a scam . “The government has made it clear that this information is absolutely false and is intended to deceive. Citizens are reminded to be cautious and not to be misled by such scams!” said Ng in his recent post . The account Ng was referring to boasts the username “JohnLeeKa_Chiu.” The impersonator posted about the launch of what it claimed was going to be the “National Hong Kong coin” March 6 at 3:00 AM Hong Kong time. He said the token would be available to trade on the Solana blockchain. “This strategic step marks a new era in digital innovation and economic growth for Hong Kong.

What Is the Most Critical Level to Watch for ETH? Glassnode Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-did-ethereum-whales-behave-in-the-recent-drop-what-is-the-most-critical-level-to-watch-for-eth-glassnode-explained/,"One of those that suffered the biggest decline during the correction in Bitcoin and altcoins was undoubtedly Ethereum (ETH). While the Ethereum price retreated to the $2,000,000 level, the increasing expectation before the White House Crypto Summit to be held on March 7 has led the ETH price to reach the $2,300 level. While Ethereum has been experiencing volatile movements, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained what ETH investors have been doing during the recent price fluctuations. Stating that Ethereum investors are actively managing their positions, Glassnode said that it lowered its cost basis by purchasing the dip. After Ethereum surged to $2,500 before the recent drop, it pulled back to $2,050, a level seen in November 2023. Glassnode said that according to data, Ethereum investors with an initial cost base of $3,500 sold throughout February but then bought the dip and re-entered at $2,500 and $2,050. At this point, Glassnode said investors have lowered their cost basis by 10% to $3,200. Additionally, Glassnode said that a major resistance area has formed at $2,800, where investors have accumulated around 800,000 ETH. This suggests that $2,800 will be a critical level for investors to watch if the price of Ethereum recovers. Signals Bullishness for Ethereum! On-chain analytics firm Santiment also weighed in on Ethereum, saying that the downward trend in social media signals a potential bullish trend for ETH. According to Santiment, Ethereum sentiment has fallen to yearly lows, lagging behind other top cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap. However, Santiment noted that sentiment on social media for ETH has deteriorated, which is a good sign for ETH and points to a potential reversal in price. Ethereum sentiment has declined to year-low levels as the asset has underperformed relative to other top caps. For those patiently holding their $ETH , the bearishness being projected across social media is a good sign of a potential turnaround once crypto markets stabilize. pic.twitter.com/iRaKTvb0Tu — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 6, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

As per the last check during the Asian afternoon session, its gains stood at over 33% from its local low on Tuesday. The altcoin’s market cap was seated at over $1.15 billion, while its daily trading almost tripled, hovering over $258 million. Today’s gains were triggered after U.S. President Donald Trump linked crypto project ‘World Liberty Financial’ purchased $1.5 million worth of MOVE tokens, among other altcoins, from a newly created multi-signature wallet. With the White House Crypto Summit just a day away, MOVE has sparked speculation in the crypto community that it could be part of the crypto strategic reserve plans that President Trump recently revealed to position the U.S. as the “Crypto Capital of the World.” The summit, set for Friday, March 7, will be chaired by venture capitalist David Sacks and Congressman Bo Hines. It’s expected to bring together crypto founders, CEOs, investors, and policymakers to discuss the future of digital assets in the U.S. and marks another step in Trump’s push to make America a leader in digital finance. With pro-crypto sentiment gaining ground in policymaking circles, investors seem to be betting that MOVE could also benefit from potential government-backed initiatives—especially since it aligns with the “ Made in USA ” narrative.

Meanwhile, Santiment data shows a 146% increase in daily active addresses, which is often seen during times of increased trading activity among holders. Source: Santiment MOVE was trending on X and CoinGecko even though its social sentiment was negative at press time. Typically, this means the price gains followed recent events. MOVE price analysis Technical indicators show that the altcoin is recovering from its bearish momentum, which has prevailed since early January of this year. On the 4-hour/USDT price chart, MOVE has once again broken above the descending trendline that had been forming with lower highs and lower lows since Jan. 6, which traders view as a precursor for a trend reversal. MOVE price, BB and MACD chart — March 6 | Source: crypto.news MOVE was trading close to the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting strong buying pressure, with new money flowing into its market. The MACD lines have also pointed upwards, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line while remaining above the price line, confirming a possible trend reversal—especially as the altcoin’s trading volume has spiked over the past day. Further CoinGlass data shows that investors have been accumulating MOVE, with net outflows from exchanges totalling nearly $11.5 million over the past 12 days, showing that its investors believe in more potential future gains ahead. Hence, MOVE could potentially rally to its psychological resistance at $0.55, a level it failed to break on March 3. If it manages to move above this level, the next target for MOVE would be $0.68, a resistance level it struggled to break multiple times in early February.

Online casinos have so much to offer players that the industry is now competitive with more traditional forms of gambling, including land-based casinos. As more players have joined online casinos, so the market has diversified. One of the more recent developments has been the creation of crypto casinos. Crypto casinos have capitalised on the increased popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among the wider public. These casinos generally combine a cryptocurrency purchasing or trading platform with an online casino that accepts cryptocurrencies. The entire site uses blockchain technology, giving users an anonymous and secure platform to play on. Cryptocurrency has always occupied an unsettled space in the financial world but this doesn’t mean that these casinos are any riskier than regular online casinos. The current political situation in the United States has had dramatic negative impacts on the cryptocurrency market but we’ve already seen similar dips followed by even bigger recoveries. During this low point, it’s likely that many new investors will be drawn in by the low prices and the potential for recovery. For those new to cryptocurrencies or those experienced investors who have never tried crypto casinos, this guide will have everything that you need to know about online crypto casinos. We’ve used the expertise of the researchers at JohnSlots to create this guide, and readers are encouraged to consult their dedicated guides for further information about individual casinos. Security at crypto casinos One of the reasons that most crypto investors cite for getting involved in cryptocurrency is because of the security it offers. Cryptocurrency exists using blockchain technology. The blockchain acts as a ledger, with each link being a record of what account has touched that coin. It makes it nearly impossible for cryptocurrency to be stolen without leaving a clear trail. Since crypto casinos function using blockchain technology as well, they have the same security features. Crypto casinos also offer far more anonymity than traditional online casinos. Traditional online casinos require extensive proof of identity and address in order to withdraw any funds. This can feel very invasive. Crypto casinos, on the other hand, have strict systems in place to preserve player anonymity. A user name and wallet ID are the only forms of identification that are required, since the blockchain provides any required verification of ownership of the cryptocurrency account. Currencies you can use Regular online casinos have begun to accept certain cryptocurrencies in order to remain competitive against crypto casinos. However, they typically only have the capacity to accept the most popular and widespread coins. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most widely accepted at regular online casinos. Crypto casinos recognise the variety of coins on the market and the popularity of alt coins, independent coins and regionally popular coins. Most of the big crypto casinos have platforms where users can invest in the cryptocurrencies that they want to use. This makes it very streamlined and easy. The commonly accepted cryptocurrencies at crypto casinos are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Tether, Binance Coin, USD Coin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Solana and Tron . Some crypto casinos even accept user suggestions to add coins to their accepted currencies list. Some crypto casinos will also accept a very limited selection of fiat currencies. This is to facilitate conversion of cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and to act as a bridge for players who are still uncertain about investing in cryptocurrencies. Using multiple currencies Crypto investors usually have one coin that is closest to their heart, but they also understand the importance of having a diverse portfolio in a fluctuating market. While investing in multiple cryptocurrencies is the norm, it is not common to use more than one cryptocurrency at a crypto casino. At most crypto casinos, the player selects which cryptocurrency they will be using with that account. The account is linked to a dedicated wallet associated with a single cryptocurrency. In rare cases, a crypto casino will accept more than one currency per account. Only using a single currency at a crypto casino is the smartest thing a player can do – it’s difficult enough to keep track of a casino budget in one currency, so adding a second cryptocurrency has the potential to create confusion. Games at crypto casinos When crypto casinos first appeared on the market, their game selection was incredibly limited. Most developers did not create games that were compatible with blockchain casino platforms. This meant that the sites had to create their own games or host the same limited selection of games as all other crypto casinos. As they’ve grown in popularity, crypto casinos have been able to offer far more games to their players. Software providers have realised that crypto casinos were an untapped market with the potential to be incredibly lucrative. Today, crypto casinos can offer slots, table games and live dealer games from the same big name developers as traditional online casinos.

Kraken even provided trading fee credits alongside the payouts to avoid profiting from the distribution process. The first repayment round, which started on Feb.18, covered approved Convenience Class claims valued at $50,000 or less. Small claimants will receive full repayment plus post-petition interest of 9% per annum by April 11. Larger claimants (with claims valued above $50,000), including institutional investors and VC firms, have been not been issued any repayments as of yet. Complex legal disputes and asset recovery efforts have delayed the distribution to larger investors. But with the next repayment round slated for May 30 , larger investors will start receiving their funds (+9% interest accrued per annum), with roughly $16 billion earmarked for total distributions.

With its price lingering currently at $0.2155, far from its all-time high of $0.7376, the powerhouse meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) has faced notable challenges in recent months. Even after a modest 9.33% increase in the last 24 hours, DOGE has struggled to maintain momentum enough to recover from an 18.93% decline over the past month. Additionally, Dogecoin’s technical outlook is mixed, with crypto analysts noting that DOGE must hold above the $0.20 support level to avoid further losses. While some predict a slow recovery, with price targets of $0.50 to $0.82 by year-end, $2 seems increasingly unlikely—at least for now. Furthermore, recent market conditions and macroeconomic factors, including inflation and liquidity constraints, have added to the pioneer meme coin’s challenges. Moreover, as whales continue to accumulate DOGE tokens, the overall market sentiment remains cautious, with many questioning whether the hype surrounding Dogecoin can drive it to new heights. In recent news, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, recently proposed a collaboration with Elon Musk to make Dogecoin the currency of X. If this ambitious partnership comes to fruition, it could dramatically impact Dogecoin’s future, possibly giving DOGE the boost it needs to reach new heights and solidify its place in the mainstream financial ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano founder, proposes to Elon Musk making Dogecoin the currency of X in an exciting post on X; posted by dogegod (@_dogegod_) on X As 2025 progresses, the real question remains: Can Dogecoin break out of its slump, or is the $2 target simply out of reach? While Dogecoin’s journey to $2 seems increasingly uncertain, its future remains tied to market sentiment and the strength of its community. On the other hand, JetBolt (JBOLT) is forging new ground with its groundbreaking presale, reeling in crypto whales with its zero-gas technology.

As Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to maintain momentum above $0.20, its $2 dream seems further out of reach. Meanwhile, JetBolt’s (JBOLT) presale continues to captivate whale interest, with its zero-gas technology and growing ecosystem showcasing distinct innovation in today’s market.

As one prominent market participant observed, a bullish uptrend might take longer as sentiments in the United States remain primarily bearish. “Bitcoin market will likely remain slow until sentiment in the U.S. improves.” Ki Young Ju wrote, pointing to the underwhelming absence of significant on-chain activity as a key indicator. Notably, current market sentiments in the U.S. largely differ from those observed in the latter part of the previous year. Between November and December 2024, they leaned more positively as Bitcoin reached an ATH of $105,000. https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1896846195877937300?s=46&t=qzsvHvtDB3yjTaoaylh-2g Interestingly, key indicators are still neutral as displayed on the Coinbase premium index chart covering network activity from March 2nd to March 4th, 2025. Ju maintains that neutrality “suggests that the bull cycle is still intact.” Additionally, fundamentals have remained strong, and more mining rigs have resumed online activity. Should the bull cycle finish at this point, Ju asserts that the trend will not mirror the sentiments of key market participants. “If the cycle ends here, it’s an outcome no one wanted—not old whales, mining companies, TradFi, or Trump. (FYI, the market doesn’t care about retail.)” He wrote. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s historical volatility index has now risen to 3%, as a result, price upswings have hit their highest levels of BTC volatility since early December. At report time, Bitcoin, up by 4.50% today, is valued at $91,408 per coin. The asset saw a major price swing today, surging to $92,500. $85,765 remains a key support level to watch out for, as a break below this point could indicate a potential downside. Conversely, a break above $93,165, a key resistance level could suggest a bullish trend reversal.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|USA,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|MINING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-06 11:32:16

According to local news agency Maeil Business Newspaper (MK), the Democratic Party's Governance Plan Center will hold a seminar titled 'Trump 2.0 Crypto Finance Era, South Korea's Response Strategy' to discuss Korea's crypto policy in response to the Donald Trump administration. It was stated that the seminar will discuss the potential inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves managed by the Bank of Korea and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The seminar will also discuss ways financial institutions can use Bitcoin as an ETF, bond collateral asset, and foreign exchange transaction tool. Additionally, the development of Korean stablecoins and methods for raising institutional capital using Real World Asset tokens will be discussed. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has previously denied creating a national Bitcoin reserve. FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan said that South Korea is not keen on the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. The FSC chairman also said that South Korea will wait to see how other countries and the market react to Trump's BTC reserve plan before taking action on Bitcoin.

Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA price is attempting to surge toward $3.5; however, it faces repeated rejections. As a result, the price has been dropping. Will TIA price recover? If buyers maintain the current momentum and push the price toward the resistance of $3.5, we might see a strong recovery. Will TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment?

Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction March 2025 $2.4 $3.1 $4.5 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025.

Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

The new development comes after Donald Trump’s announcement to integrate a Strategic Crypto Reserve in the long term. A notable price surge was recorded shortly after, with leading assets BTC, ETH, and XRP securing gains of 10%, 13%, and 34%, respectively. Gains previously sustained have since been lost as traders rushed to initiate sales across various exchanges. Shortly after Trump’s announcement, Bitcoin inflows on exchanges moved from 500-1000 to a staggering 6,739 BTC. Within a 1-hour timeframe, ETH saw inflows soar to 300,000 ETH. Similarly, exchanges ushered in 2 billion XRP in inflows, with hourly inflows nearing 193 million. Per CryptoQuant’s report, the recent drop in asset prices suggests that spot demand has carried through into contraction territory. Market reacts to the inclusion of altcoins to the highly anticipated Strategic Crypto Reserve Trump’s remarks have been a major topic of conversation among key market players. The President’s decision to include ETH, XRP, ADA, and SOL in the crypto reserve has warranted criticism from key figures. Analyst Peter Brandt questioned Trump’s credibility while raising concerns about including altcoins such as ETH and XRP in the crypto reserve. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, along with the Winklevoss twins, the founders of the Gemini exchange, have taken to X to express support for Bitcoin as the only asset fit to be included in the crypto reserve. “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve. Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar and that digital asset is bitcoin.” Tyler Winklevoss tweeted. While the altcoins above are listed on Gemini, Winklevoss maintains that for an asset to be considered “Strategy Reserve” material, it “needs to be hard money that is a proven store of value like gold.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-06 11:37:00

Discussions about banning deepfakes have been circulating for some time, but—so far—nothing concrete has been implemented. AI-generated history Just as sinister as deepfakes, however, is AI’s overall role in preserving facts. Indeed, while many consider artificial intelligence to be unbiased, AI is subject to the very same biases and lies as its creators. DeekSeek exemplifies this. An AI tool developed by the Chinese, it will refuse to utter any mention of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, for example, essentially erasing this incident from history. In fact, users can watch the chatbot do this before their very eyes. While governments have been rewriting history for centuries, from burning books in the Nazi era to changing text with the Gutenberg Press, AI represents a new dynamic in the permanence with which this can be done digitally and the speed at which false information can reach people via the internet. In addition, AI is used by many for research, relied upon as a reliable information source, and is increasingly used in classrooms. Despite these ethical concerns, however, tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services are steamrolling forward and integrating AI tools like DeepSeek into their cloud services. This means that anyone using their infrastructure—and that’s basically the majority of people with access to the internet—will be exposed to an AI tool that will only tell the truth if it’s programmed to. How can we trust a biased tool to preserve historical information or data? Blockchain-based solutions It’s clear that in a future where humans and AI increasingly co-exist with each other, we have to find another way of preserving information, images, and—most importantly—historical facts. A solution where this data cannot be erased, tampered with, or re-written—and blockchain is the only technology that provides this solution today. A blockchain is an immutable ledger where information can never be deleted or altered. Any transaction or other data is stored in the blockchain forever once it has been recorded. A fitting way to preserve history in a world where records depend on the whims of politicians and other powerful individuals. This is perhaps the most noble of use cases for blockchain’s censorship resistance—not an attempt to evade, but to preserve. Several ventures are already working on creating blockchain-based solutions specifically designed to preserve history and facts. This includes Story, a blockchain designed to turn intellectual property from writing, music, paintings, or simply ideas into tokenized assets to be stored and even traded on-chain. A permanent cloud Meanwhile, Arweave is a blockchain that offers a solution to store any data in a decentralized cloud forever—or for at least 200 years, guaranteed. This model contrasts traditional cloud services, like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services, which underpin the entire internet. If you have photos or Word documents stored on your Google Drive, for example, they are stored in the cloud—but this cloud storage is vulnerable to breaches, synching problems, or accidental—or deliberate—deletions. Data stored in the cloud can also be censored or deleted by a government or other authority, which puts a big question mark over the idea of storing any important facts of historical data “in the cloud.” Permanent, decentralized cloud solutions eliminate all these problems. Once it’s uploaded, it is stored forever—it cannot be tampered with, deleted, or altered in any way. You can always say who uploaded the data and when and what the original information contained in it is. It’s a perfect solution for information that needs to be preserved, like historical records. It’s also impossible to pass deepfakes off as a real thing on a permanent blockchain cloud network because it would be immediately clear who the creator of the fake video or image is. Equally, the origin of legitimate announcements could be easily verified, so never again would anyone have any doubts about the orders a president is giving to his troops in the middle of a major conflict. Finally, this tamperproof method of data storage also guarantees the provenance of information, which can be incredibly important in arbitrating “he said, she said” debates which so often stand in the way of verifying historical facts. At a time when these facts are increasingly under threat from technology that can create life-like deepfakes of politicians and celebrities, it’s time we explore the only solution that can truly preserve history.

After months of anticipation, analysts suggest that bullish catalysts—including new ETF proposals and renewed institutional interest—may finally propel Ripple’s native token to fresh highs. Meanwhile, XRP isn’t the only contender to watch: an up-and-coming AI Agent Launchpad called XRPTurbo (XRT) is generating headlines for its ambitious DeFi roadmap, with experts forecasting possible 100x gains during its presale stage. [Join Xrpturbo Presale] Is a $4.20 Breakout for XRP Inevitable? Despite some recent market volatility, XRP has managed to sustain a solid price floor, inching up around 6.6% in the past week. The crypto community is abuzz with rumors that the SEC is reviewing additional XRP ETF filings—a move that many believe could open the floodgates for institutional money. If approved, these ETFs might introduce a level of mainstream acceptance for XRP, providing the token with the momentum it needs to shatter its long-standing resistance levels. Still, doubts linger. Skeptics point out that regulatory uncertainty continues to hang over Ripple’s head, despite various legal victories in recent months. Will the SEC’s final stance be enough to quash the rally, or can XRP maintain its upward trajectory? Why XRPTurbo (XRT) Presale Could 100x As XRP grab the spotlight, analysts are pointing to another opportunity: XRPTurbo (XRT) . Touted as an AI Agent Launchpad on the Ripple blockchain, XRPTurbo merges advanced AI solutions with XRP’s quick settlement times and low transaction fees. The project’s roadmap includes yield-farming automation, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and on-chain analytics—features that many experts believe could catalyze a new wave of DeFi growth. What’s more, industry watchers note that XRT’s ongoing presale has garnered significant attention from early adopters. The token’s supply and pricing structure favor broad participation, potentially mirroring the dynamics that propelled certain meme coins and DeFi tokens to staggering gains. With major DEX listings expected post-presale, some are betting on a 100x surge if market conditions remain favorable. [Buy $XRT Tokens] Don’t Miss the Next Big Leap The crypto market is, as always, a realm of ‘what ifs.’ Will XRP finally breach $4.20 in March and reclaim its position among top-tier assets Or might XRPTurbo carve out its own legacy with an explosive 100x presale run? For risk-tolerant investors, the window of opportunity may be closing fast. While skeptics urge caution—citing regulatory risks and market volatility—the allure of high-reward ventures continues to drive capital toward projects that show both innovation and community support. As the countdown to March begins, one thing is certain: the crypto landscape never remains still for long, and fortunes can shift in a matter of days.

It bears mentioning that large holders have been aggressively selling since last year. Following XRP’s 500% price rally in November, whales have slowed accumulation. The current pattern suggests that XRP is in a local distribution phase—a core part of the market cycle. The distribution phase follows the accumulation and markup phases. At this time, sellers and buyers trade sideways, with heightened hope, greed, and fear as market players anticipate a price hike. While many bullish price indicators are spotted during this phase, the market typically shifts as negative sentiment intensifies. With the market poised to witness breakouts, consolidations, and pullbacks around this time, the distribution phase could last for weeks or months, after which the markdown phase begins. On-chain metrics show spike in trading volume as XRP holds support at $2 A key trend worth attention is the massive surge in trading volume as XRP holds support around the $2 price level. The trend indicates that demand for the asset is still strong. Last month, XRP recorded a sharp price decrease from February 25th to February 27th, as selling pressure intensified and market trades halted accumulation. As a result, expectations for March are mixed. At the time of this report, XRP, the third largest crypto by market cap, has seen daily gains cross 5%. XRP also beat BTC and ETH to become the highest weekly gainer, raking in 8.10% in weekly gains.

Despite the market crash, WLFI continues to invest heavily in crypto, showing confidence in its long-term growth. WLFI Tripled Ether Holdings In a Week According to on-chain data from Lookonchain, WLFI recently transferred $25 million USDC into a newly created multi-signature wallet, signaling its intent to expand its crypto portfolio. The fund executed major purchases, including; https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1897462956021137889 4,468 ETH for $10 million at an average price of $2,238 per ETH. 110.6 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for $10 million at $90,420 per BTC. 3.42 million MOVE tokens for $1.5 million at $0.439 per token. With about $3.5 million USDC still available, speculation is rising that WLFI could continue adding to its holdings soon. Currently, ETH remains WLFI’s largest holding with $16.34 million , followed by $14.8 million in WBTC and $13.25 million in USDT stablecoins. WLFI Faces Heavy Losses Despite buying more crypto, WLFI is facing over $89 million in unrealized losses across nine tokens. This comes at a time when the crypto market is struggling due to big events like the $1.4 billion Bybit hack, the largest in crypto history, and other economic concerns. While many investors are moving toward real-world assets (RWA) for safety, WLFI is taking a different path, believing in a long-term crypto comeback. WLFI’s Crypto Fund Expands Strategy WLFI’s recent investments come after launching its Macro Strategy fund , which focuses on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and selected altcoins. The goal is to build a strong and balanced crypto portfolio while exploring new opportunities in DeFi. Meanwhile, speculation is growing that Trump’s family may launch “one or more giant businesses” on Ethereum and even hinted at the possibility of Ethereum being used in government operations noted by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|USDC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 11:46:47

Aside from a significant price bump, $ADA’s investor volume also skyrocketed, which has spiked everyone’s interest in what’s being touted as one of the best cryptos to buy now . Keep reading to find out everything about Cardano’s 2025 price prediction. We’ll paint a clear picture (combined with both fundamental and technical analysis) to understand where $ADA could be headed next. Cardano 2025 Price Prediction at a Glance Here’s a brief summary of all the important factors at play for Cardano and the effect they should have on its price this year: Cardano is respecting the 50 EMA on the weekly chart – BULLISH It has bounced off a well-established support/resistance zone – BULLISH We’re seeing the ‘break and retest’ pattern on both the weekly and daily charts – BULLISH The important resistance level of $1.30 is hovering above current prices – BEARISH All major moving averages are sloping upwards on the daily chart – BULLISH Inclusion in Trump’s US Crypto Reserve – BULLISH Potential launch of a Cardano ETF – BULLISH As you can see, a vast majority of signs are pointing north, so Cardano is rightly expected to generate handsome yields in 2025 (and beyond). Although it’s difficult to put a finger on an exact price target, our analysis (which you’ll see below) suggests that Cardano could reach as high as $3.10 in the coming few months. Diving Deeper Into Cardano’s Chart Technical analysis 101 dictates that we use the higher timeframes (the weekly and the daily) to form the primary context about a stock/crypto’s current and future prices. $ADA’s Weekly Chart Screams Bullishness One look at $ADA’s weekly chart, and it immediately comes across as a crypto ready to explode . The biggest bullish sign is how well it’s respecting the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The crypto has taken support on the 50 EMA twice in the last four weeks. Plus, two important short-term moving averages – the 20 EMA and the 10 EMA – are both pointing upwards, signaling immense bullish strength. Another reason for joy among $ADA supporters should be that the crypto has found support at a previous resistance zone, i.e., between $0.60 and $0.80. Moreover, this isn’t just a normal resistance; it’s where $ADA’s last higher high was, which means we have a classic ‘break and retest’ pattern in front of us. This is an extremely well-known technical analysis pattern, one that traders often look at for fresh entries. Buying a crypto when it’s ‘retesting’ essentially means getting it at a discounted price, which increases the overall profits you can churn out of it. This is also a pattern we can use for predicting where Cardano’s next potential rally could take it. Essentially, we could see a move similar to the one in November last year, meaning $ADA can surge past $1.730 in just the next month or two. For a longer-term Cardano price prediction, we can use the Elliott Wave theory , which suggests that we could be seeing the onset of an impulse (or motive) wave. If this holds true, $ADA can even reach its all-time highs of $3.10 in 2025. Perhaps the only thing to watch out for is that $ADA’s current resistance level of around $1.30 is a major one. After all, that’s where the crypto really fell from (almost 80%) in March 2022. It’s also where $ADA’s November 2024 rally eventually faded. Lots to Cheer for on Cardano’s Daily Chart as Well $ADA’s daily chart, unlike $ETH’s, aligns with its weekly chart to confirm the larger bullish picture. The crypto has broken out of its recent downtrend, which was frankly just a correction so long as we put the weekly chart into perspective. Additionally, Cardano is showing a similar ‘break and retest’ pattern on the daily chart as it is on the weekly. This happens to be a great confluence (or double confirmation). Furthermore, all the major EMAs, including the 200 EMA, which is the granddaddy of all moving averages, are sloping upwards. According to this chart, Cardano is looking ripe to capture the recent highs of $1.3278 in the first half of 2025. Once that’s accomplished, we should see the crypto holding well to aim for the $1.730 level. Cardano’s Market Sentiment Of course, the biggest piece of positive news for Cardano buyers is its recent inclusion in Trump’s US Crypto Reserve. The announcement saw $ADA rise by over 70% in a day. It’s currently trading at $0.9546 . Even better, this upmove in price was accompanied by large institutional buying. Put together, whales have bought around 420M $ADA in the last week . Investor interest in Cardano is swelling up, meaning we can expect current prices to hold and rise higher. Additionally, the prospective launch of a Cardano ETF (exchange-traded fund) later this year could easily see the crypto surge past all price targets. On February 11, Grayscale announced that it wants to launch an ADA ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. An ETF would further crank up investor participation in Cardano, as those interested in $ADA would be able to invest in it without having to buy the token. Currently, only Bitcoin and Ethereum have ETFs. Cardano could well be the third one to join the list. It’s also worth noting that Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, said that he didn’t know Trump would include $ADA. Cardano’s founder being unaware of its inclusion in the Crypto Reserve could be a very positive sign. After all, it shows that the crypto was picked purely because of what it brings to the table. Is Cardano the Best ‘Science’ Coin? Experts Say MIND of Pepe May Offer Better Returns Although Cardano is undoubtedly a great opportunity to invest in a development-first ‘science’ coin that grows slowly and steadily over time, there are other more profitable investments out there, like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . $MIND is the next biggest AI agent project that can be your trading partner. By leveraging its self-evolving and autonomous build, $MIND will interact with crypto influencers online (on dApps and platforms like X). It will analyze every single market sentiment and bias to then cut through all the noise and identify the best cryptos to invest in .

The MIND of Pepe presale has already amassed over $7.1M, and it shows no signs of slowing down. 1 $MIND is currently available for just $0.0034539 – here’s how to buy it . Putting aside the crypto market’s bullish signals, volatility is often the ultimate portfolio killer. Whether you invest in $ADA or $MIND (or both), make sure you only put in an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, we urge our readers to do their own research before investing. None of the above is financial advice, after all.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-06 11:48:06

Meanwhile, Elluminex, a DeFi hub on the TON blockchain, progresses through its presale, with 5.4 million $ELX tokens sold. Both projects highlight contrasting approaches to decentralizing finance—one navigating legacy challenges, the other building anew.

With SolidProof-audited contracts and a $0.08 next-stage price, Elluminex balances accessibility and deflationary rigor – key for attracting TON’s Telegram-linked user base. Also, in contrast to XRP, the Elluminex core team includes a skilled developers from major blockchain projects, all holding a lot of experience in DeFi, smart contract creation, and inter-chain operability. Divergent Paths, Shared Ambitions XRP’s institutional DeFi push contrasts Elluminex’s grassroots ecosystem build. Yet both face scalability tests. XRP’s cross-border settlements require banking adoption; Elluminex needs to lure developers to TON. Analysts compare $ELX’s presale to Solana’s 2021 growth, where DEXs like Raydium spurred 86% TVL , resulting in SOL gains. For investors, XRP offers regulatory-risk exposure, while Elluminex presents untapped network potential. Neither guarantees success, but their trajectories could redefine how DeFi bridges traditional and blockchain finance. Elluminex: A Better Call Over XRP? XRP’s DeFi integration hinges on legal outcomes, while Elluminex bets on TON’s scalability. The former battles legacy perceptions; the latter avoids them entirely. As XRP eyes $3.55 and Elluminex advances its presale, both underscore DeFi’s evolution—one adapting existing systems, the other constructing anew. For cautious optimists, these parallel journeys highlight blockchain’s dual future: reforming finance from within and rebuilding it from scratch.

40820674,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24778,1741262040,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What is USDT0?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/token/what-is-usdt0/,"USDT0 is a bridged version of Tether’s USDt stablecoin, designed to extend USDt’s availability to blockchains where it is not natively issued. It operates on a “lock-and-mint” mechanism, meaning that USDt is locked on Ethereum while an equivalent amount of USDT0 is minted on the destination chain. This system is powered by LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard, which facilitates secure and seamless cross-chain transfers. Unlike standard USDt, USDT0 is not directly issued or redeemable by Tether but is managed by Everdawn Labs, making it a distinct asset that requires users to swap between USDT0 and USDt through a conversion tool. USDT0 aims to address interoperability challenges in the blockchain ecosystem by enabling easier transfers of stablecoins across different networks without relying on fragmented liquidity pools or traditional bridges. It has been introduced on blockchains such as Ink, Berachain, and MegaETH, with plans for expansion to additional networks. The OFT standard ensures that USDT0 maintains a 1:1 backing with USDt on Ethereum, and transfers are validated by a decentralized security model involving oracles and relayers. This approach reduces the complexity of cross-chain transactions while enhancing liquidity management. One of the key distinctions of USDT0 is that it is not available for direct trading. Instead, it serves as a transport mechanism to facilitate the movement of USDt across different ecosystems. Users can deposit or withdraw USDT0 on supported exchanges, such as Bitfinex, and utilize a currency conversion tool to swap it for standard USDt. This design allows for the seamless use of USDt on networks where native issuance is not feasible, providing users with more flexibility without compromising the underlying backing of the stablecoin. The introduction of USDT0 carries implications for both blockchain users and platforms. For users, it offers a more efficient and secure means of transferring stable value across chains, reducing the risks associated with third-party bridges. For exchanges and Decentralised Finance (DeFi) platforms, it simplifies integration and liquidity management by unifying stablecoin supply across multiple networks. While USDT0 reflects a growing focus on cross-chain interoperability, its distinction from standard USDt, particularly the involvement of a third-party issuer, requires users to remain aware of the underlying mechanics and any associated risks when interacting with the asset. What is the USDT0 Token? Unlike standard USDt, which is directly issued and redeemable by Tether on supported networks like Ethereum and Tron, USDT0 operates through a “lock-and-mint” mechanism. When a user transfers USDt to a non-native blockchain, the equivalent amount of USDT0 is minted on the non-native destination chain, while the original USDt is securely locked on Ethereum. This ensures that each USDT0 token maintains a strict 1:1 backing with USDt on Ethereum, preserving the stable value peg to the US dollar. USDT0 is built using the OFT standard developed by LayerZero, which allows tokens to move seamlessly across multiple blockchains. This standard eliminates the need for traditional bridging solutions, which often involve liquidity pools and can expose users to risks such as bridge exploits or price slippage. Instead, USDT0 enables users to transfer stablecoins between supported blockchains efficiently and securely, with transactions validated through LayerZero’s decentralised messaging and verification system. The initial launch of USDT0 began on networks like Ink and Berachain, with further expansion to additional blockchains anticipated. The introduction of USDT0 addresses the growing demand for interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem, allowing USDt to operate more efficiently across different networks. It offers a practical solution for users seeking to move stablecoins between ecosystems without relying on fragmented bridging systems or managing liquidity pools. This development reflects the ongoing evolution of stablecoins as the blockchain industry continues to prioritize cross-chain functionality and interoperability. Get started with USDT0: Create a Bitfinex account here . Verify your account to Basic Plus. On the Currency Conversions dropdown menu, for “From” choose Tether USDt. For the “To” dropdown menu, choose USDT0 on either Arbitrum One, or Ink. Be aware that you cannot currently exchange USDT0 between the Arbitrum One and Ink variants. Convert USDt to USDT0 here USDT0 Tokenomics USDT0’s tokenomics are structured around a “lock-and-mint” model designed to ensure that each USDT0 token is fully backed by an equivalent amount of USDt on Ethereum. This system maintains a strict 1:1 peg between USDT0 and USDt, which itself is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. When a user moves funds into USDT0, the corresponding USDt is locked on Ethereum, and an equivalent amount of USDT0 is minted on the destination blockchain. This ensures that the total supply of USDT0 across all chains is always matched by an equivalent reserve of USDt, preventing inflation or the creation of unbacked tokens. This model allows USDT0 to function as a stable representation of USDt across multiple networks, supporting interoperability without compromising the underlying stability of the Tether ecosystem. The minting process begins when a user initiates a cross-chain transfer by locking USDt on Ethereum. This is done through a smart contract that holds the locked USDt securely. Once the transaction is validated, the LayerZero messaging protocol sends a message to the destination chain. Upon receipt of this message, the USDT0 contract on the target blockchain mints an equal amount of USDT0 tokens, reflecting the locked funds on Ethereum. This process is designed to be secure and reliable, utilizing LayerZero’s OFT standard and dual verification networks (DVNs) to confirm that the correct amount of USDt is locked before USDT0 is issued on the new chain. This ensures that no tokens are minted without proper collateral. Redemption follows the reverse process. When a user seeks to move USDT0 back to Ethereum or convert it to USDt, the USDT0 tokens on the source chain are burned. Once this burn is confirmed, a LayerZero message is sent to the contract holding the locked USDt on Ethereum, instructing it to unlock and release the equivalent amount of USDt to the user. This burning mechanism ensures that USDT0 tokens are only created when backed by USDt and are destroyed when redeemed, maintaining the supply balance across chains. This system prevents excess issuance of USDT0 and upholds the 1:1 backing, reinforcing the stability and reliability of the token as it moves across different on-chain ecosystems.

Pi Network’s X (Twitter) account following has surpassed 4 million, outpacing major cryptos like ETH, SHIB, and XRP. Is PI Ready to Rally Again? Pi Network’s native token began trading on February 20, nearly six years after the controversial crypto project’s birth. Some of the exchanges that embraced the asset upon the launch of the Open Network include Bitget, OKX, and MEXC. The price of PI registered substantial fluctuations in its first trading days, plummeting below $0.65 and rising to an all-time high of almost $3 on February 27. In the following days, the valuation retraced to approximately $1.50 before consolidating to the current $1.90 (per CoinGecko’s data). PI Price, Source: CoinGecko According to some industry participants, it might be time for another resurgence. The X user Coinvo claimed that PI “is bouncing perfectly off the point of control.” The investor suggested that the level stands at $1.58. Another market observer, using the X moniker MOON JEFF, thinks the current price represents a great buying opportunity. They believe PI’s spike above $5 is just a matter of time. Last month, the X user Pi Blockchain predicted that the next wave could send the value to $4 or even $40. Others have been even more bullish, envisioning an explosion to a whopping $314.159 – a number symbolically linked to π (Pi) ≈ 3.14159. It is important to note that such a figure would require PI’s market cap to skyrocket above $2 trillion (assuming the circulating supply is around 7 billion coins). As of writing these lines, its capitalization stands at around $13.4 billion, making the forecast highly implausible (to say the least). Pi Network’s Latest Achievement The project has become more popular lately, perhaps due to the major milestone mentioned above. As CryptoPotato recently reported , Pi Network’s followers base on X (formerly Twitter) has surpassed 4 million people. In comparison, well-known cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) trail behind. Pi Network is particularly popular in Asia, with South Korea, Vietnam, China, Japan, India, Singapore, and other nations becoming strongholds. Not long ago, Wu Blockchain estimated that the project’s users in South Korea exceeded 1.3 million, outpacing the local customer base of behemoth exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.

Schiff’s surprise comments have added fire to an already furious debate about the federal government’s role in digital assets as the White House gears up for its March 7 crypto summit . Although still skeptical of most cryptocurrencies, Schiff compared Bitcoin’s addition to U.S. reserves with the country’s gold holdings, a rare shift in his skeptical attitude. Trump sparks controversy with crypto reserve blunder as Schiff softens on Bitcoin The pending White House Crypto Summit has brought attention to the changing role of the federal government in digital assets. Things took an unexpected turn when Donald Trump flubbed the rollout of a Strategic Crypto Reserve by omitting Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap in his first announcement. Trump wrote on Truth Social, “A Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.” That exclusion immediately produced confusion and contention across the industry. Nearly two hours later, the President attempted to clarify, writing: “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other critical cryptocurrencies, will be part of the Reserve.” In an unexpected reversal, Schiff reluctantly conceded the case for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, likening it to the country’s gold reserves. Schiff has repeatedly derided BTC as a speculative asset devoid of true value, but this time, he appears to have conceded that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is becoming an irresistible trend. However, he did not spare harsh words for other digital assets in the reserve, which he said were “pure speculation with no real backing.” Schiff also warned about the broader economic challenges ahead, stating: Trump hasn’t prepared Americans for just how bad things are going to get, or the level of austerity that would be required to repair the damage done by decades of bad fiscal and monetary policy. The coming shot of fiscal and monetary “stimulus” will be the overdose that kills us. Peter Schiff White House Crypto Summit set to define Bitcoin’s role in U.S. strategic reserve In January, the Trump administration published Executive Order 14178, which set the stage for the U.S. Crypto Stockpile. Framed as a hedge against inflation and a measure of financial resilience, the initiative has ignited a heated debate over the reserve’s makeup. While it’s clear that Bitcoin dominates the crypto market, the debate remains over whether other digital assets deserve the same status in the U.S. reserve. “That’s because Bitcoin is the foundation of the crypto economy,” said Michael Saylor, CEO of Strategy. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, took a strong stand, saying “only Bitcoin” belongs in the reserve. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , in turn, proposed a more measured take, commenting that while Bitcoin is the “right tool” — “I appreciate the administration’s broader intent.” Overdrawing the “war chest” reserve will ultimately be 99.9% Bitcoin and larger than most people think, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. Secretary of the Treasury Howard Lutnick confirmed BTC’s special status in the reserve in a statement. He also said that President Trump is “interested in a Bitcoin strategic reserve” and that more details on other cryptocurrencies will be released soon. After the White House’s announcement, the leading crypto surged to $94K, fueled by optimism over institutional recognition, but it soon recovered to $78K. Growing concerns over federal intervention and asset selection caused a swift pullback. Led by Crypto Czar David Sacks and Executive Director Bo Hines, the fraternal pair will host a White House summit with heavy hitters in the financial and industry policy-making wings. The full guest list remains under wraps, and speculation has swirled around who will be present to help clarify U.S. crypto policy. However, several industry luminaries have confirmed they will be attending the event publicly. As a result, the summit will reportedly confirm the White House crypto initiative front and center, which would be a milestone in U.S. financial strategy.

The bill, House Bill 302, will now head to the full House floor for a vote, making New Hampshire one of seven U.S. states actively pushing for Bitcoin-related legislation. New Hampshire to Adopt Bitcoin? If the bill clears all legislative hurdles, the New Hampshire treasurer would have the discretion to allocate up to 5% of the general fund, revenue stabilization fund, or other authorized state funds into Bitcoin or precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. While the bill does not explicitly mention Bitcoin, it stipulates that eligible digital assets must have maintained an average market capitalization of $500 billion over the past calendar year—a threshold only Bitcoin currently meets. The bill, introduced by Republican Keith Ammon and co-sponsored by Democrats Chris McAleer and Carry Spier, originally proposed a 10% allocation cap but was later revised to 5%. Ammon stated that the bill underwent amendments to remove stablecoins and staking provisions, aligning it with a more conservative approach to state-backed Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin Gaining Political Traction Across Multiple U.S. States New Hampshire now stands alongside North Carolina , Oklahoma, and Texas, all of which are awaiting full House votes on their respective Bitcoin-related bills. Meanwhile, Utah and Arizona have already advanced similar legislation, reflecting a broader state-level movement toward Bitcoin adoption in government treasuries. Momentum for Bitcoin-friendly policies has also picked up at the federal level. On March 2, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for a Crypto Strategic Reserve , which would include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. However, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan suggested that the reserve would likely be composed almost entirely of Bitcoin, reinforcing its dominant position in the digital asset landscape. New Hampshire’s Treasurer Monica Mezzapelle has signaled potential interest in Bitcoin investments should the bill pass, marking a potential shift in how U.S. states approach cryptocurrency as part of their financial strategy.

Analyst Names 5 Altcoins That Could See 10x Gains in March!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sol-rally-slowing-down-analyst-names-5-altcoins-that-could-see-10x-gains-in-march/,"As interest in SOL’s rapid growth begins to wane, investors are looking for the next big opportunity in the cryptocurrency market. A noted analyst has pinpointed five altcoins that could potentially increase tenfold in value this March. These emerging tokens may offer substantial returns, capturing the attention of those keen on capitalizing on the latest trends. XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 10 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.0025, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Sui: The User-Friendly Blockchain Set to Transform Crypto Sui is a new blockchain platform that’s making waves in the crypto world. It’s designed to be secure, powerful, and able to handle lots of users worldwide. What makes Sui special is its focus on making things easy for everyone. Instead of using complicated processes, it uses simple models to manage data. It also uses a secure programming language called Move to fix common problems in other blockchains. Sui stands out because it puts the user first. With features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions, it removes the usual hassles of using blockchain apps. This means more people can access and enjoy Web3 applications. In the current market, where usability and scalability are key, Sui looks promising. Compared to other coins, Sui offers a blend of strong technology and great user experience. As the crypto market evolves, coins like Sui that focus on accessibility could be the ones to watch. SEI: The Lightning-Fast Blockchain Transforming Trading SEI is breaking new ground as the first Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for trading. Aiming to give exchanges an edge, it can handle a massive number of orders per second with a transaction finality of just 380 milliseconds. Built with a deep commitment to security and backed by large institutions, SEI is poised to revolutionize how trading platforms operate on the blockchain. In today’s market, SEI’s specialized technology positions it as a promising contender. Its focus on speed and security addresses key challenges faced by decentralized exchanges. Some believe that if SEI reaches its upper price targets, it could see significant growth by 2030. Compared to other coins, SEI’s unique approach and potential for high performance make it an attractive option for those interested in innovative blockchain solutions. MANTRA: Bridging Institutions to Web3 with Security and Speed MANTRA is a new blockchain designed with security at its core. It aims to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a good fit for institutions and developers. By offering a permissionless blockchain that supports permissioned applications, MANTRA combines openness with control. This allows big organizations to benefit from blockchain technology without compromising on compliance. Built on the Cosmos SDK, MANTRA is compatible with other networks and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. It uses a Proof-of-Stake system for security and can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second. With built-in tools, developers can create and manage assets that meet regulations. The user experience is also improved to help newcomers and institutions join Web3 easily. In the current market, where security and compliance are becoming more important, MANTRA stands out. Compared to other coins, its focus on real-world applications and regulatory adherence could make it attractive to those looking for a robust and scalable blockchain solution. Pi Network: The Social Cryptocurrency You Can Mine on Your Phone Pi Network is a mobile-first cryptocurrency that allows anyone to mine Pi tokens without needing special hardware or draining their phone’s battery. Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates, it aims to make digital currency accessible to everyone. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining process, Pi users simply check in daily on the app to verify their presence. By building trust circles with 3-5 reliable contacts, users contribute to a global trust graph that secures the network without massive computing power. The potential of Pi Network lies in its innovative approach to decentralization and user engagement. By leveraging the Stellar Consensus Protocol, Pi creates an interconnected community where users are rewarded for their contributions, such as growing trusted networks and running full nodes. As the project moves toward its open network phase, it presents an intriguing development in the cryptocurrency landscape. Compared to other coins, Pi’s emphasis on accessibility and energy efficiency aligns with current market trends favoring sustainable and user-friendly blockchain solutions. While it’s still in its early stages, Pi Network’s unique model makes it a project worth watching in the evolving crypto market. Conclusion Though SUI, SEI, OM, and PI show promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for massive growth through a unique, community-driven ecosystem.

Analysis Firm Warns!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-for-bitcoin-ethereum-and-solana-after-the-great-white-house-crypto-summit-analysis-firm-warns/,"As US President Donald Trump becomes one of the most influential factors in the cryptocurrency market, his statements and moves can cause the market to rise or fall. At this point, while expectations are increasing that Trump may announce the creation of a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve before the White House Cryptocurrency Summit that Trump will host on March 7, STS Digital warned investors after the White House crypto summit. Digital asset trading firm STS Digital has warned of increased market volatility for Bitcoin (BTC) following the crypto summit held at the White House on March 7, Coindesk reported. STS Digital said that after the peak, the price could experience price fluctuations of around $5,000 up and down. Deribit options data suggests investors are bracing for post-peak volatility, said Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital. Anderson noted that investors are also preparing for volatility in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in addition to Bitcoin. “Options markets are showing tension and illiquidity heading into the weekend. “Implied volatility was measured at 105% for BTC, which corresponds to an expected price movement of 5.5% between Friday 8:00 UTC and Saturday 8:00 UTC. At this point, BTC could swing around $5,000 in either direction after the peak. ETH and SOL prices could also swing $135 and $13, respectively.” *This is not investment advice.

A surge like this is proof of how well the market can survive despite all odds. $DADDY is not an enigma in its success, as there are more meme coins capable of replicating this success. $CHONE has a statistically high chance of yielding a higher return than the current gains of $DADDY. $DADDY Leading the Charge For Market Recovery $DADDY has been green all week despite a downtrend in the market . As a coin personally promoted by Andrew Tate, $DADDY has experienced phenomenal growth in the last seven days. The market has outliers like $DADDY, which are always pushing forward when the market seems to be in a state of decline. One marker for growth would have to be the airdrops that occurred over 6 days ago. Over $1 million worth of $DADDY was distributed, likely pushing the value of the coin upwards. $DADDY has taken the initiative to make sure their numbers stay high. They also have an active community since Andrew Tate is promoting it. $DADDY’s success isn’t the type that can’t be replicated by other coins in the market. While it has kept itself safe from market conditions, the pump might be reaching its end. Regardless, a lot of money is still changing hands as the 24-hour trading volume is at $5.5 million, and the market cap is at $39.1 million. $CHONE Could Outshine Recent Gains In the Meme Market While the market is feeling good about $DADDY, there are newer, finer coins like $CHONE that are more than capable of taking over the media. $CHONE especially has a refreshing narrative that exceeds the potential of its rivals in the market. $CHONE is the kind of meme coin that is most attractive to experienced traders, with its market cap below $500k. It’s the best type of meme coin to ape into, as it is the kind that experiences massive blowouts. Daily trading volume is just under $68k, with a price hike of 9.8% in the last 24 hours. $CHONE has a chilled outlook but it has been designed for efficient growth. Its use of AI emphasizes its potential for growth even though its avatar is a chill drone. $CHONE is bound to experience growth in the near future and will be able to surpass market players like $DADDY. Meme Coins Still Have A Stake In Crypto’s Future The market is steadily recovering, and more meme coins are gaining liquidity from big players. $DADDY might be proof that the market is getting back on its feet, but $CHONE would be the coin used to restore investors’ egos. As more market players emerge, experiencing exponential growth, $CHONE will become a stable figure, like $DADDY, climbing the ranks to establish itself. $CHONE currently sits at a good entry point of $0.00045, encouraging traders to take advantage of a high-growth potential.

You bet your tail is out there, just waiting to explode. The trick is sniffing out the ones with real potential before the pack catches on. Some meme coins are all bark and no bite, but how about a few? They’re ready to run wild. One of those top dogs is Dawgz AI, a meme coin with actual utility. With staking rewards for ETH buyers and high-frequency trading bots making moves 24/7, it’s got serious bite. 1. Dawgz AI Not all meme coins are created equal. Some are just funny names and hype, while others actually make you money. Dawgz AI is in the second category; it’s built to win. Why Dawgz AI Stands Out Most meme coins rely on pure luck. Dawgz AI? It’s got high-frequency trading bots working 24/7, making real moves so you don’t have to. And while other coins hope for value, $DAGZ delivers; with staking rewards for ETH holders, passive income comes easy. Pro Tip: Early dogs get the best bones. Dawgz AI’s presale momentum is strong; miss it, and you’ll be chasing gains later. What Makes It Better? Dawgz AI isn’t just some meme coin gamble. It’s got strong tokenomics, an 8.888B stock, and actual utility, which 99% of meme coins lack. While others bark, Dawgz AI fetches profits . Fun Fact: The project has already raised $2.3M in presale. Next stop? $2.6M and a price jump. While others hope to moon, Dawgz AI is built for it. 2. Bonk Coin Some dogs never stop chasing the ball. Bonk is one of those, a Solana-powered meme coin that’s been around long enough to prove it’s got staying power. But does it have what it takes to lead the pack in 2025? Why People Like Bonk Strong community: People love a good underdog story, and Bonk has that vibe. Solana-backed: It runs on fast, low-fee transactions, which is a big plus. Hype cycles: Every now and then, Bonk gets a new wave of attention. Pro Tip: The best crypto to buy now for 2025 is one with both hype AND utility. Fun Fact: Bonk had a crazy rally in 2023, but what’s next? Dawgz AI is still in the early, explosive phase, so don’t miss it. 3. Fartcoin Yes, Fartcoin is real. It’s loud, it’s ridiculous, and somehow, people are actually buying it. But is it just a joke, or could this be the next big meme coin? Why People Love Fartcoin Let’s be honest: Fartcoin is all about fun. It leans into the absolute chaos of meme culture, and sometimes, that’s enough to pump a coin. Maximum meme potential: If you thought Dogecoin was funny, this one takes it to another level. A loyal fanbase: Some people are ride-or-die for the meme, and that can create real buying pressure. Hype-driven gains: It only takes one viral moment to send a meme coin flying. Fun Fact: In 2024, a random meme coin jumped 5,000% overnight because Elon Musk tweeted a single emoji. That’s crypto for you. Fun Fact: AI-powered crypto coins are expected to dominate in 2025. Why? Because they actually do something. Comparison Table: Dawgz AI vs. Bonk vs. Fartcoin The best cheap crypto to buy isn’t the one that just makes you laugh; it’s the one that actually makes you money. Feature Dawgz AI Bonk Coin Fartcoin Utility AI-powered trading bots Meme-only Meme-only Staking Rewards Yes, for ETH holders No No Presale Momentum $2.3M raised, next target $2.6M Already launched Already launched Community Support Growing rapidly Large following Small, but loyal Long-Term Growth Potential Strong Questionable Very risky $DAGZ wins this round. Which Coin Is Most Profitable in the Future? When it comes to future profitability in crypto, Dawgz AI stands out as the most promising investment opportunity. While many coins rely on hype, Dawgz AI is built on real utility, AI-driven innovation, and a strong meme culture, making it a high-growth contender in the market. Unlike typical meme coins, Dawgz AI combines humor with cutting-edge AI technology, creating a unique blend of entertainment and utility. The project has already gained massive attention, with investors recognizing its potential for outsized returns. With smart investors eyeing Dawgz AI as the next major breakout, now is the time to secure your position before prices surge. Would you rather chase past trends or get ahead of the next big thing? The answer is clear - Dawgz AI is the coin to watch for future profits. Which Penny Crypto Has 1000x Potential? Everyone wants to find the next cheap coin that explodes overnight. But not all low-cost cryptos are built to last. Dawgz AI has everything a breakout meme coin needs: a strong presale, real AI-powered trading, and staking rewards for ETH holders. Unlike random low-cap coins that rely on hype alone, Dawgz AI combines meme culture, AI-driven technology, and strong community backing, making it a legitimate contender for massive growth. AI + Meme Power – Combining AI innovation with the viral appeal of meme coins, Dawgz AI taps into two of the biggest trends in crypto. Early-Stage Opportunity – Still in presale, Dawgz AI offers a ground-floor entry before major exchange listings. Massive Market Interest – Investors are recognizing its potential, and early momentum suggests it could be the next breakout success. Proven Growth Model – History shows that the best meme coins with strong communities and use cases can explode in value - Dawgz AI fits the bill perfectly. Final Thoughts What is the best cheap crypto to buy now? That’s easy: Dawgz AI is the top dog in this race. It’s got staking rewards, AI-powered trading bots, and real momentum, making it more than just another meme coin. Bonk? It’s got history but no real utility. Fartcoin? It’s hilarious, but do you really want to bet your portfolio on a joke? The best meme coins aren’t just funny; they’re profitable. Dawgz AI delivers both. Pro Tip: The best crypto to buy right now is the one that’s still in presale before the big price jump. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While venture capitalists chase the next theoretical moonshot, seasoned investors have spotted something extraordinary – a presale token that’s already making money, not just promises. The battle lines have been drawn between BitLemons (BLEM) , with its functioning casino platform generating real revenue today, versus innovative contenders like Solaxy (SOLX) and BTC Bull (BTCBULL) with their unique value propositions. As the clock ticks down on BitLemons’ Stage 2 presale, investors are asking a crucial question: why gamble on tomorrow’s promises when you can bank on today’s profits? Is Real Revenue Better Than Speculative Promises? BitLemons ($BLEM) stands out in the crowded presale marketplace as the only option with a fully operational product generating actual revenue today . Unlike competitors still in development phases, BitLemons’ crypto casino is processing transactions and creating value 24/7. With over 8,000 games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic, BitLemons is disrupting the $450 billion traditional casino market through its innovative GambleFi protocol. This isn’t just another token hoping to find utility – it’s a revenue-generating machine with clear tokenomics: 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) allocated directly to tokenomics 15% for strategic token buyback & burn (creating deflationary pressure) 15% for staking rewards (incentivizing long-term holding) How Does Solaxy (SOLX) Compare to BitLemons’ Proven Model? Solaxy (SOLX) presents an innovative technical solution as a Layer 2 scaling platform built on Solana, designed to enhance blockchain efficiency and transaction speeds: Technical Innovation: Solaxy aims to improve Solana’s performance through off-chain processing, transaction bundling, and modular infrastructure – addressing real scalability challenges in the blockchain space. Clear Tokenomics Structure: With a total supply of 138,046,000,000 tokens strategically distributed (30% for development, 25% for staking rewards, 20% for treasury), Solaxy demonstrates thoughtful financial planning. Staking Benefits: Solaxy’s dedicated staking program with dynamic APY rewards provides an attractive incentive for long-term holders. While Solaxy’s technical roadmap is impressive with smart contracts audited by Coinsult, its full Layer 2 blockchain launch isn’t expected until Q2-Q3 2025. BitLemons offers immediate benefits through its dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof and an operational platform that’s already generating revenue today. Can BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) Deliver on Its Bitcoin-Based Promises?

Bitcoin, the crypto market leader, briefly topped $92,700, extending the recovery from lows around $81,500 on Tuesday. MOVE, CRO, ONDO and Render traded 10% to 17% higher as of writing. Broadly speaking, AI, gaming and Layer 2 coins are the best-performing crypto sub-sectors for the past 24 hours. The positive move could be attributed to rumors that President Donald Trump will unveil a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve during Friday’s White House crypto summit. Meanwhile, hopes that Trump's tariffs will likely not endure have helped restore the risk sentiment on Wall Street and Germany and China's fiscal rockets have offered support to Asian and European equities. Still, we haven't seen a notable decline in the volatility indices. At press time, Volmex's BVIV index, which measures the implied or expected 30-day price turbulence, held just five points below Tuesday's high of 66% but well above the February low of 49.6%. Perhaps traders see Friday's crypto summit as the make-or-break moment for crypto, as the President, having promised big for months, is now expected to deliver the goods as soon as possible. In traditional markets, VIX, Wall Street's fear gauge, held at 23.65 Wednesday, the highest since mid-December, according to data source TradingView. Meanwhile, the MOVE index, which measures the 30-expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury notes, remained elevated at 104, the highest since November (check chart of the day). The elevated volatility in bonds is particularly concerning as it is known to cause financial tightening and weigh over risk assets. For now, however, a weaker dollar seems to be compensating for that. Still, the sticky vol indices in traditional markets raise an important question: Is the market's concern solely about tariffs, or are there underlying worries related to a significant slowdown driven by other factors such as potential fiscal consolidation? The spread between yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note and the three-month Treasury bill has again turned negative, inverting the yield curve to suggest recession - consecutive quarterly contractions in the GDP. ""[This is] generally not a good sign,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter said in Wednesday's edition. Early this week, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model signaled a nearly 3% contraction in the U.S. GDP in the first quarter. The number is due for an update today. Recession fears will likely strengthen if we don't see an improvement today, potentially pressuring risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Acheson summed up the situation best: ""We are still navigating the tussle between narratives – on the one hand, risk-off sentiment driven by macro uncertainty could keep BTC and other crypto assets depressed for a while. On the other hand, the “safe haven” narrative is gaining strength, as positive news from the White House highlights the astonishing shift in official support."" Stay alert!

The launch of sGHO, featuring no withdrawal or deposit fees, is part of Aave DAO's aggressive growth strategy to drive GHO adoption during a depressed yield market. Alongside sGHO, Aave is pursuing other initiatives to expand GHO's user base, such as introducing it as a gas token across different blockchains and integrating it into various ecosystems, while also approving a treasury rebalancing to reduce risks and improve liquidity on Aave v3. Derivatives Positioning Funding rates for most major tokens, except ADA, XRP and TON, are positive, per data source Velo Data. The negative figure for the three coins suggests bias for shorts and potential for a short squeeze should the spot price hold resilient. BTC, ETH funding rates remain mildly positive. Market stability has yet to bring a notable increase in the CME BTC and ETH's future open interest. This shows institutions are likely still wary of potential downside risks.

These are representatives and/or core developers of Hedera ( HBAR ), Algorand ( ALGO ), Aptos ( APT ), and MultiversX ( EGLD ), respectively. “There are many domain experts who need to be in the room, like Leemon Baird from HBAR, or Silvio Micali from ALGO, or Avery Ching from APT, or Beniamin Mincu from EGLD.

Many unconfirmed lists of supposedly invited names to the White House Crypto Summit have been circulating on the web. Nevertheless, most are either highly speculative or intentionally fake lists, requiring caution. Right now, one of the most trusted sources on the matter is Eleanor Terrett, from Fox Business , verifying each name. Eleanor has been checking the candidates and confirming each one individually through a series of posts on X. So far, the journalist has confirmed the following participants for Donald Trump’s White House Crypto Summit: Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO; Arjun Sethi, Kraken CEO; Michael Saylor, Strategy Founder and Executive Chairman; Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO; Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink (LINK); Kyle Samani, Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital; Zack Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial (WLFI); JP Richardson, Exodus CEO; Matt Huang, co-founder of Paradigm; David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine; Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini; Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini; Kris, CEO of CryptoCom. Notably, there are no Ethereum ( ETH ), Ripple’s XRP , Solana ( SOL ), or Cardano representatives among Terrett’s confirmations. This is surprising, considering Trump has shown support to these cryptocurrencies, hinting at adding them to the U.S. reserves. Nevertheless, it is still soon to take conclusions as the confirmations are increasing overtime. The market has all eyes on the meeting that could open doors for both bullish or bearish decisions moving forward.

On March 6, the overall market cap for memecoins nearly reached $62 million, surging by 5% in the past 24 hours of trading. Among the top traded tokens, FARTCOIN ( FARTCOIN ) rose by nearly 27% to a price of $0.35 while the official Trump coin ( TRUMP ) went up by 2.3%. TRUMP is currently trading hands at $13.70. The meme coin market went through a major slump following a series of “presidential meme coin” drops, starting from the official TRUMP meme coin to the LIBRA meme coin endorsed by Argentinian President Javier Milei. It seems the market is recovering slowly from the crash. More recently, an Argentine federal prosecutor Eduardo Taiano told media outlets that he was intent on freezing around $110 million in assets as part of an ongoing investigation into the Argentinian President’s involvement in the collapse of the LIBRA meme coin, according to local media outlet Clarin . You might also like: MELANIA team tokens worth $39m unlock amidst LIBRA collapse Not only that, the prosecutor has also submitted a request to access to President Milei’s deleted social media posts, specifically the ones which indicated he allegedly promoted the Solana ( SOL ) -based memecoin. As part of the the probe, authorities would be able to freeze funds in digital wallets linked to the meme coin scandal. On-chain data shows that there were at least eight wallets linked to the LIBRA team which made a profit of $107 million before the token’s eventual downfall. Recently, funds amounting to $4.5 million were moved from one of the wallets to a new digital address. It was later reportedly used to purchase the POPE meme coin, which could indicate possible money laundering efforts. The POPE meme coin is currently trading hands at $0.18. What is the LIBRA meme coin scandal? The scandal was dubbed “Libragate” by traders and has led to Argentinians calling for the impeachment of President Javier Milei. It started when Milei shared a post on his social media account on Feb. 15 at 5:01 EST, promoting a token that he claimed would help boost the “Argentine economy by funding small projects.” However, the memecoin crashed not long after its launch, wiping out $4.4 billion in market capitalization thus affecting the overall meme coin market. According to a Nansen report , between Feb. 14 until Feb. 18, around 86% of LIBRA traders suffered losses amounting to $251 million.

Ondo ( ONDO ) price was trading at $1.60 on Thursday, marking a 30% increase from its lowest level this year. However, strong technical and fundamental indicators suggest a potential rebound in the coming weeks. A key factor supporting a potential recovery is the continued growth of Ondo Finance’s ecosystem. According to DeFi Llama, the total value locked in Ondo’s ecosystem has surpassed $1 billion for the first time. This marks a significant increase from $541 million at the start of the year. Ondo TVL chart | Source: DeFi Llama This growth is driven by its two tokenized assets: Ondo Short-Term US Treasuries Fund (OUSG) and Ondo US Dollar Yield Token (USDY.) USDY currently holds over $589 million, while OUSG has $419 million in assets.

USDY offers an annual percentage yield of 4.35%, while OUSG yields 4.03%. Ondo’s price could also be influenced by investments from Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial. WLFI now holds 342,000 ONDO tokens, valued at over $400,000. Ondo was one of the top donors to Trump’s inauguration committee, which has fueled speculation that the project may be considered for inclusion in the U.S. strategic crypto reserves. Ondo price analysis Ondo price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ondo Finance has been in a strong downward trend in recent months, in line with a broader market decline. On the positive side, the coin has formed a falling wedge pattern, which comprises two descending and converging trendlines. A bullish breakout usually happens when the two lines are nearing their confluence levels. Ondo price has also formed a cup and handle pattern, another popular continuation sign. The upper side of this pattern is $1.4825, while its depth is 65%. There, measuring this distance from the upper side of the cup brings the Ondo price target at $2.4610, up by 113% from the current level.

In a recent post , Yakovenko clarified his stance regarding President Trump’s plans to establish a national crypto reserve that would include major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Cardano ( ADA ) as well as Solana ( SOL ). He also confirmed that he was not asked on whether SOL would be included in the crypto reserve line up. “No reserve, because if you want decentralization to fail you’d put the government in charge of it.” said Yakovenko. According to the Solana co-founder, if there truly has to be a crypto reserve then it should be created based on “objectively measurable requirements” in order for the project to be fair and decentralized for all parties involved. “I don’t care what they [the measures] are, they can even be constructed such that only bitcoin satisfies them right now, they just must be objectively measurable and rationally justified,” Yakovenko stated.

At press time, Yakovenko has not confirmed his attendance for the White House Crypto Summit set to be held on March 7. Meanwhile, a number of other crypto figureheads such as Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor, Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong have confirmed their attendance among others. Earlier today, crypto journalist Laura Shin claimed that sources say Garlinghouse urged President Trump to include Solana in the crypto reserve in order to make the inclusion of XRP in the reserve “seem more legitimate.” When asked whether that was true, Yakovenko said that he was not asked about the inclusion of Solana in Trump’s national crypto reserve nor was he the one that pitched it.

NYSE Arca has filed a proposal to list and trade shares of the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF, renewing the interest in the DOGE price. The approval of the ETF product could be a big thing for Dogecoin. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is a new platform that is merging traditional finance with blockchain technology under the same roof. The recent increase of listing price to $0.36 has increased the demand in the project. DTX Exchange’s 2x profit is the biggest attraction, making it a better option than slow DOGE price growth. DOGE Price Shows Bear Dominance Despite Dogecoin ETF News The weekly candle of the DOGE price shows that it has dropped from a high of $0.24 to $0.185, a drop of 19.40%, reflecting how strongly sellers drove the price lower after the recent surge. The optimism surrounding the Dogecoin ETF filing by Bitwise has failed to ignite any momentum in the DOGE price. Bitwise filed a registration with the regulators for the Dogecoin ETF in late January. If approved, the proposal would mark one of the first meme coins and Dogecoin ETFs to be listed in the U.S., granting regulated access to Dogecoin to the investors. ETF approvals have always seen delays in the US, and a delay in Dogecoin ETF can push the DOGE price towards new lows. Currently, the lower trendline of the wedge pattern is acting as a strong support; a breakdown from this will create a long-term bearish trend or consolidation in the DOGE price. Expert investors have already booked profit and are rotating funds into potential utility projects like DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange: A Better Alternative to Dogecoin While the DOGE price has long struggled to gain momentum, DTX Exchange (DTX) is rapidly expanding its trading ecosystem. What distinguishes DTX from other platforms is its first-mover advantage in the hybrid trading space. The platform's hybrid protocol allows users to trade 120k+ assets, such as stocks, gold, crypto, and forex, in one place. No other platform currently offers multi-asset trading, which gives DTX Exchange a unique advantage in the market. Unlike meme coins, which rely on hype and community support, DTX Exchange has already shown its capability with the launch of its proprietary Phoenix Wallet. The wallet has already been downloaded by 385,000 people, showing strong support for the project. Additionally, in the recently held blockchain testnet, DTX’s VulcanX achieved 200,000 TPS, breaking previous records. DTX Exchange offers real-world use cases and follows a clear roadmap, making it one of the most promising projects of 2025. With trading innovation, a profit-sharing model like a VIP rebate is another major attraction for investors as they can generate consistent income through this model. In the last round, $0.18 is the cost for each DTX token, purchasers will benefit as they are sold at a price lower than the listing price. The launch price is $0.36, and the traders will get a 200% at the time of listing. With a unique market positioning, the DTX Exchange could be able to uplift to $3, a gain of approximately 1,500%. Conclusion While the Dogecoin ETF has sparked investors' interest, the DOGE price remains volatile without any real utility. Many investors are turning to DTX Exchange , attracted by its limited supply and high growth potential. The platform aims to be a one-stop solution for traders, confirming the growing demand for multi-asset access. Investors have to enter the presale soon as the bonus round is the last chance to enjoy massive gains before the 2x listing.

Liv has officially introduced cryptocurrency trading services via its Liv X app, allowing customers to buy, hold, and sell digital assets, the firm said in a press release shared with Cryptonews.com. The feature, which became available on March 5, is powered by Aquanow, a licensed crypto asset service provider. Liv X Platform to Support Five Cryptos at Launch Initially, the platform will support five major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. To ensure the security of digital assets, Liv has partnered with Zodia Custody, a regulated cryptocurrency custodian that received a strategic investment from Emirates NBD in late 2024. The UAE has emerged as a significant hub for cryptocurrency adoption, driven by progressive regulations and increasing institutional and retail investor interest. A survey conducted by the International Financial Group Ltd found that one in ten UAE residents has invested in digital currencies, with Emiratis displaying the highest level of interest. Furthermore, a report by Chainalysis estimates that between July 2023 and June 2024, the UAE received over $30 billion in cryptocurrency transactions, placing it among the top 40 countries globally and making it the third-largest crypto economy in the MENA region. “With the highest crypto adoption rate in the UAE, we are keen to launch our own virtual asset offering to capitalise on this trend,” Marwan Hadi, Group Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management at Emirates NBD, said.

The platform offers innovative financial products such as Money Ahead Deposits, Goal Accounts, Digital Gold Investment Accounts, and a Cashback Card that provides up to AED 1,500 per month in rewards. “Incumbent institutions like Emirates NBD will play a pivotal role in driving the next wave of digital asset adoption and Aquanow is proud to be the leading crypto provider chosen by financial institutions both here in the GCC and globally,” Phil Sham, Chief Executive Officer of Aquanow, said. Saudi Economist Urges Gulf States to Develop Unified Crypto Payment Regulations Last month, Ihsan Buhulaiga, a former member of the Saudi Shura Council and a noted economist, called for Gulf Arab states to establish a unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, arguing that the region needs a coordinated approach to the growing use of digital assets as a payment tool. He urged GCC countries, which include Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman, to collaborate on crypto regulations. Despite Saudi Arabia’s strict stance against cryptocurrency transactions, other Gulf nations, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have introduced regulatory measures to govern digital asset usage. As reported, the UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the European Union’s (EU) newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.

For Dogecoin, large transactions have plummeted nearly 88% since mid-November 2024, leading to diminished liquidity and investor confidence. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is witnessing a rapid increase in whale interest. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale, MUTM tokens are priced at $0.015, with a projected launch price of $0.06, offering investors a potential 300% return on investment. The project has raised more than $2.2 million and attracted over 4200 holders in record time. This promising outlook is attracting significant attention from large investors seeking new opportunities in the crypto market. Ethereum and Solana: once giants, now facing whale exodus Both Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), two of the largest movers in the cryptocurrency space, are also feeling the pinch as whale activity is not present. Ethereum has lost 12% over the last 24 hours to $2,111, as large investors are seemingly being held back in an uncertain market environment. Solana (SOL) is little better off as its whale accounts, or addresses that have more than 10,000 Solana, have plummeted significantly, leading to flat price movement. Currently, Solana hovers around $139, struggling to maintain its previous momentum. High-value investors are scanning the horizon for better opportunities, with these declines and many seem to be eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big play. Mutuum Finance presale gains traction as investor interest skyrockets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is experiencing a surge in investor enthusiasm, with its presale gaining significant momentum. Over $2.2 million has already been raised, with more than 4200 investors securing early positions. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2, demand continues to grow as investors anticipate the next price increase. With a projected launch price of $0.06, early participants stand to gain up to 300%, with additional upside potential once the token reaches major exchanges. Mutuum Finance is transforming decentralized lending with a unique dual-lending model that incorporates both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model employs smart contracts to optimize liquidity pools with efficient use of capital by real-time manipulation of interest rates that dynamically adjust according to market conditions. P2P bypasses middlemen so that the users can enter lending contracts directly with complete openness and full autonomy over terms. With the option of fixed and floating interest rates, the system is ideal for a broad variety of risk profiles and provides users with greater financial flexibility. Audited smart contracts also provide better security for a secure and convenient lending experience. Growth potential & exclusive investor rewards Mutuum Finance is building a solid foundation with plans for strategic token buybacks, staking rewards, and prominent listing on exchanges. To commemorate its rapid expansion, the site launched a $100,000 giveaway, giving 10 lucky winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a referral program that boosts member involvement through incentives for bringing in new investors to the site. With increasing demand for novel DeFi solutions, Mutuum Finance will become an important stakeholder in the digital finance industry. As whale interest in Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) declines, it’s clear that large investors are moving toward new opportunities. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raising over $2.2 million and attracting 4,200+ holders, its Phase 2 presale at $0.015 is rapidly gaining traction. Investors who act now stand to gain 300% before launch, with even greater upside potential post-listing. With its innovative DeFi lending model and strategic growth plans, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the next big crypto play. Secure your MUTM tokens today before the price increases.

L2 Impact On AI Projects,https://coingape.com/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-spotlights-l1-vs-l2-impact-on-ai-projects/,"Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has recently shared vital insights on the impact of L1 vs L2 for AI projects looking to venture into the blockchain industry. In an X post this Thursday, CZ cracked on how AI projects could leverage two branches of the same tech differently. Notably, L1 offers sovereignty whilst L2 offers efficiency, a topic of constant debate across the broader sector. Binance Founder Spotlights Impact Of L1 vs L2 Capabilities On AI Projects In his X post on March 6, CZ tapped into the question: “Does it matter if a new AI project is an L1 or an L2?” The Binance founder revealed that the ultimate goal for an AI project is to leverage blockchain in aiding with better AI economics rather than the project core being used to develop a better blockchain. L1 vs L2 Saga: Here’s What To Know “Having your own L1 feels like you have more sovereignty, more decentralization,” CZ added. However, this also paves the way for a lot more effort in regards to nodes, validators, etc, indicating more computational and financial load. On the other hand, L2 eliminates “all that work,” CZ stated. This statement indicates that the utilization of L2s eliminates all computational and financial costs, unlike L1s. Moreover, the Binance founder also spotlights how users can enjoy benefits such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), perpetual futures (perps), and other existing DeFi tools. CZ concluded by saying, “Is L1 cooler than L2 or the reverse? Old topic, but wondering if sentiment has changed or not,” setting off waves of discussions across the broader sector. CZ Offers Advice Amid Recent Market Turbulence On the other hand, Changpeng Zhao took the stage to offer investment advice amid the recent market dip. Intriguingly, rather than offering investors assurance, the Binance founder urged market participants to reduce their investment sizes if the dips seemed worrying. “Dips are a part of free markets,” CZ added, while also rationalizing the broader volatility. For context, the crypto market saw a bloodbath in February, attributable to macro heat and liquidity hurdles. Nevertheless, Bitcoin and Altcoin prices recovered as March kicked off, aligning with Donald Trump’s U.S. crypto reserve and crypto summit plans. Traders and investors stay on their toes amid broader developments while CZ continues to spark buzz market-wide with his comments. The post Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Spotlights L1 Vs.

33767162,[object Object],1741267836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Addresses Holding Over 10,000 ETH Droped To 919 In Two Weeks – Insights",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-addresses-holding-over-10000-eth-droped-to-919-in-two-weeks-insights/,"Ethereum (ETH) has struggled below the $2,300 mark for the past few days, following two weeks of massive volatility and aggressive price swings. After a period of uncertainty, Ethereum remains in a downtrend, with bulls unable to reclaim key resistance levels. Since the start of February, ETH has lost over 40% of its value, reflecting the broader market weakness and increasing negative sentiment toward the asset. The lack of bullish momentum has left traders cautious as Ethereum continues to trade near multi-month lows. On-chain data from Glassnode reveals a concerning trend—the number of addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH has dropped to 919, down from 999 in late February. This significant decline suggests that large holders have been offloading their ETH, likely due to strong selling pressure and fear-driven market conditions. With Ethereum facing continued resistance and heavy selling, all eyes are on whether ETH can stabilize or if further downside is ahead. The coming days will be crucial in determining if Ethereum can reclaim key price levels or if selling pressure will push the asset even lower. Traders are watching for a potential shift in momentum, but for now, Ethereum remains under bearish control. Ethereum Whales Sell During Price Breakdown Ethereum is trading at low levels after failing to reclaim the $2,500 mark, leaving the market uncertain about its next move. Analysts remain divided, with some calling for a continued drop as ETH’s price action remains unstable, while others see signs of a potential recovery forming at key support levels. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data from Glassnode, revealing that the number of Ethereum addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH has dropped to 919, down from 999 in late February. This suggests that whales have been selling heavily during the latest correction, likely driven by fear and liquidity issues. The capitulation of big players is often a bearish sign, signaling uncertainty among institutional investors and raising concerns about further downside risk. 10K | Source: Ali Martinez on X"" width=""980"" height=""551"" srcset=""https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=1200 1200w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=640 640w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=980 980w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=750 750w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=1140 1140w"" sizes=""(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"" /> Despite this wave of selling, Ethereum has held a key demand level around $2,200, suggesting that a potential reversal could be forming. If ETH manages to stabilize at this level, it could build momentum for a rebound in the coming weeks. The next few weeks will be crucial for ETH’s price action. If bulls regain control, Ethereum could attempt another push toward $2,500 and beyond. However, failure to hold current levels could result in another leg down, extending its bearish phase and keeping traders on edge. Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,300, stuck in a range after failing to hold above $2,500 or break below $2,000. The market remains uncertain, with volatility swinging ETH’s price up and down, preventing a clear trend from forming. For bulls to confirm a recovery rally, a push above the $2,500-$2,600 range is essential. Reclaiming this zone would signal strong buying momentum, potentially shifting sentiment back in favor of bulls. Without this move, Ethereum remains at risk of continued consolidation or another leg down. However, for now, the main focus is on holding the $2,200 demand level. This key support zone has kept ETH from breaking lower, but if it fails, selling pressure could intensify, pushing Ethereum toward sub-$2,000 levels. With market uncertainty still high, traders are watching whether ETH can stabilize above $2,200 or gain momentum toward higher resistance levels. Until Ethereum breaks out of its current range, volatility is expected to continue, keeping both bulls and bears cautious about the next major price move.

As XRP keeps gaining momentum, another token gaining attention in the news is DTX Exchange. With 700,000+ holders already registered, DTX is made to be quick, secure, and fully transparent. Its non-custodial design ensures users never have to lose ownership of their funds, and its on-chain order book ensures transparency of trades for all. The presale is sold out but this is the final chance to get before listing on DTX at $0.36, as DTX is in its bonus stage. DTX Exchange: The Rare 4x Opportunity Before Listing Imagine buying a token early, seeing it double in price before launch, and then realizing you could have made 4x instead of 2x. That’s exactly what DTX Exchange is offering right now. And because the presale is set at $0.18 with the listing price of $0.36, investors already have a 2x return in hand. But by buying with promo code ""LIST2X,"" investors double their token amount, and that 2x becomes a flat-out 4x profit before DTX lists on major exchanges. DTX is redefining the crypto trading rules. Unlike traditional platforms that store user funds, DTX is completely non-custodial, and therefore each trader has complete control of their assets at all times. Another standout feature is DTX's distributed liquidity pools, which are designed to eliminate price slippage and give traders the best possible execution. The numbers do not lie; 700,000+ holders are already part of the DTX ecosystem with demand continuing to increase. The project has already surpassed $15.2 million in presale, an obvious reflection of its strong investor confidence. Because DTX is in its bonus stage, this is the final opportunity to join before it lists on major exchanges like ByBit and Binance at $0.36. U.S. Government Policy Change Pushes XRP Higher XRP price is surging aggressively following a major policy move by the U.S. government in favor of digital assets. The government stated that Ripple's XRP would be part of a new Crypto Strategic Reserve that would bring billions into the economy. Investors did not hesitate to grab the opportunity to buy more XRP, hoping to drive its price higher. By doing so, Ripple's XRP is a more valuable finance asset, according to MarketWatch. XRP price had remained dormant before this news, but now XRP is currently at around $2.47 and has gathered close to an 8% increase in the last 7 days. Institutional investors like finance institutions and hedge funds will start investing in Ripple's XRP, experts predict. Source: CoinMarketCap Investors are expecting that XRP price will keep rising on account of clearer regulation and wider acceptance in finance, as reported by Barron. Now that the U.S. government has officially given its seal of approval for Ripple's XRP, many believe that it will stay strong for the long term. The market shows a clear pattern, XRP price is now no longer a speculative risk but a true digital currency with true use in the financial market. More investors jumping in, and Ripple's XRP just continues to increase. Conclusion The US government's policy move will pump billions into the XRP price, pushing Ripple even further into the spotlight. But while XRP continues to gain attention, DTX Exchange is building itself up to be the next big thing. Particularly because of its staking rewards program where the owners can receive passive returns and value appreciation. With 700,000+ holders already joined, demand is more pressing than ever. This is the final pre-listing opportunity to invest, and through the ""LIST2X"" offer, investors are given twice their DTX balances along with a 100% return before trading begins.

The trading platform also halted all trading services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals. The latest freeze action aligns with recent EU and OFAC sanctions targeting Russian financial entities evading restrictions. Despite enforcing USDT freezes on illicit transactions, Tether remains non-compliant with the EU’s MiCA regulations. On March 6, Russian crypto exchange Garantex reported that stablecoin giant Tether had frozen access to its wallets holding over 2.5 billion rubles ($27 million) in USDT. The platform warned Russian users that their USDT holdings could also be at risk, as Tether’s freezes may continue targeting funds linked to sanctioned entities. This latest block comes after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the Garantex exchange in 2022, accusing it of facilitating over $100 million in illegal transactions. Garantex Exchange Temporarily Suspends Services According to an announcement on its Telegram channel, the Garantex exchange has temporarily suspended all trading services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals.

ALL TRADING AND WITHDRAWAL SERVICES HAVE NOW BEEN SUSPENDED ON THE PLATFORM. pic.twitter.com/6iyjQnDcBE — Karan Singh Arora (@thisisksa) March 6, 2025 The platform’s team is actively working to resolve the issue, but no timeline has been provided for when services might resume or how the matter will be addressed. Tether has not yet released an official statement regarding the frozen Garantex exchange wallets. However, financial experts believe the freeze is directly linked to recent international sanctions and violations. EU and U.S. Crack Down on Garantex Exchange Over Sanctions Evasion Early last month, the EU introduced its 16th package of sanctions in response to Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. As part of these measures, the Garantex exchange was sanctioned due to its close financial ties to Russian banks already under EU restrictions. Authorities accused the platform of facilitating transactions that helped Russia circumvent financial sanctions, enabling sanctioned entities to move funds despite international restrictions. This marked a major moment in regulatory history, as it was the first time the EU sanctioned a cryptocurrency exchange. The recent action against the Garantex exchange mirrors a similar crackdown by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in April 2022. According to OFAC investigations, over $100 million in Garantex transactions were linked to illicit activities, including nearly $6 million from the Russian ransomware group Conti and approximately $2.6 million from Hydra, a now-defunct Russian darknet marketplace. To put these developments into a deeper context, a 2024 report by Chainalysis highlighted how Russia and Iran have been leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and no-KYC exchanges to sustain financial operations despite international sanctions. The report estimated that sanctioned entities in both countries received $15.8 billion in cryptocurrency throughout the year, making up nearly 39% of all illicit crypto transactions. The latest EU restrictions and the Tether freeze on Garantex exchange wallets are expected to further cut Russia’s access to Western banking systems, cryptocurrencies, and other financial tools. Tether Freezes: A Recurring Pattern in Crypto Crime Crackdowns Tether freezes are not uncommon, and the action against the Garantex exchange is part of a larger pattern. In November 2023, Tether froze $225 million in USDT in collaboration with OKX, targeting a human trafficking ring in Southeast Asia running a global pig butchering scam. The freeze was carried out at the request of the U.S. Secret Service and marked the largest seizure of Tether’s USDT to date. JUST IN: Tether freezes $225 million in $USDT linked to human trafficking group. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) November 20, 2023 More recently, in February 2025, Tether froze approximately $46 million USDT by blocking 11 TRON addresses and seven Ethereum addresses associated with illicit activities. In the same month, another 181,000 USDT was frozen due to its links to the ByBit hack , which resulted in losses of $1.46 billion. Regulatory Scrutiny on Tether’s USDT and Its Compliance Challenges Despite these enforcement actions, Tether has faced criticism over its transparency and regulatory compliance. The company has been under scrutiny for not fully disclosing the composition of its reserves, raising concerns about the stability of Tether’s USDT. Additionally, it has encountered compliance challenges with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations , which require major stablecoin issuers to hold at least 60% of their reserves in bank deposits. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, has opposed this requirement, arguing that it could expose stablecoin issuers to increased financial risks. MiCA Regulations: Tether CEO Criticizes Bank Deposit Requirement for Stablecoins Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino( @paoloardoino ), has criticized the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, particularly challenging the rule requiring stablecoin issuers to hold reserves… pic.twitter.com/XgXZ08mcam — EchoeWeb (@Echoeweb) June 5, 2024 As the situation unfolds, users of the Garantex exchange remain in limbo, awaiting further updates on whether Tether freezes will continue and whether the exchange can resolve the issue. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does Tether decide which wallets to freeze? Tether freezes wallets based on law enforcement requests, regulatory actions, or suspected illicit activity. While the company has not fully disclosed its internal decision-making process, past freezes suggest it closely collaborates with U.S. and global regulators. Can affected users recover their frozen USDT? Once USDT is frozen, recovery depends on whether Tether receives clearance from authorities or finds sufficient justification to release the funds. In most cases, frozen assets linked to sanction violations remain inaccessible indefinitely. Could other stablecoin issuers follow Tether’s lead in freezing sanctioned wallets? While Tether is the most active in enforcing freezes, other issuers like Circle (USDC) and Paxos (USDP) have also cooperated with regulators in freezing wallets. However, decentralized stablecoins like DAI may not be as easily controlled by centralized entities. What impact do Tether freezes have on the broader crypto market? Tether freezes can create panic among traders, leading to liquidity disruptions on affected exchanges. They also raise concerns about censorship risks in crypto, potentially driving users toward more decentralized alternatives.

While Bitcoin remains Scaramucci’s largest holding, with over 50% of his portfolio allocated to BTC, he has also invested in Solana ( SOL ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), and Polkadot ( DOT )—assets chosen primarily for their utility. Speaking on the Bankless podcast in early January, Scaramucci highlighted Solana as his top choice among layer-one blockchains, citing its speed and low transaction costs as key advantages. His outlook on Bitcoin remains equally optimistic, having predicted last year that BTC would surpass $100,000 in 2024, fueled by surging demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). Looking ahead, he believes pro-crypto policies under a new administration could drive Bitcoin’s value even higher, potentially doubling by 2025. However, despite his optimism for digital assets, he warns that Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies, particularly a blanket tariff approach, could introduce economic headwinds, potentially pushing the U.S. into a recession—a factor that has weighed heavily on market sentiment. Anthony Scaramucci’s portfolio performance in 2025 For investors who mirrored Anthony Scaramucci’s crypto portfolio with a $1,000 investment made on January 1, 2025, the results have been rough, with all his favored assets deep in the red. Bitcoin is down 2.84% year-to-date, trading at $91,419, amid persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly plunged below $85,000 after Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico, triggering a market-wide selloff and wiping out over $985 million in liquidations . The downturn erased gains from a short-lived rally sparked by Trump’s March 2 announcement of a strategic crypto reserve , which had initially boosted sentiment in the digital asset market. However, Bitcoin rebounded sharply, surging to $92,700 after Trump postponed new automobile tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month, easing investor concerns. Altcoins take a harder hit While Bitcoin has managed to recover some losses, Solana, which Scaramucci and SkyBridge Capital have favored over Ethereum ( ETH ), has taken a significant hit, dropping 23% to $148. BTC and SOL price year-to-date (YTD) charts. Source: Finbold Other altcoins in his portfolio have performed even worse. Avalanche has plunged 38% to $22, while Polkadot has fallen 31% to $4.58, as risk-off sentiment and regulatory uncertainty continue to weigh on the broader crypto market. AVAX and DOT price year-to-date (YTD) charts. Source: Finbold A $1,000 investment : Where does it stand now? Taking all these factors into account, a $1,000 investment split evenly between Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot would have suffered a 23.34% loss, bringing the portfolio’s total value down to $766.58. While his high-conviction bets on Bitcoin and select altcoins have delivered strong returns in past bull cycles, the portfolio’s performance equally highlights the vulnerabilities of a narrowly focused approach. A more diversified portfolio , incorporating stablecoins and a broader mix of cryptocurrencies, could help cushion against sharp market swings. Still, with signs of a short-term recovery taking shape, the focus now shifts to whether this rebound can gain momentum and turn into a sustained rally in the months ahead.

Through staking, RCOF holders can further profit from 10% Annual Percentage Yields (APY), generating a sustained revenue stream and improving liquidity in the ecosystem. Moreover, RCOF is the main currency used for reward distribution, cashback, and promotional offers, so offering even more value to members of the RCO Finance community.

Upbit held over 5.9B XRP in its reserves, nearly double the reserves on Binance. | Source: Cryptoquant XRP is also the most actively traded asset on Upbit, with over $651M in daily volumes. Upbit almost matches Binance in terms of XRP activity, and it also offers a Korean won premium for the asset. XRP has been revived with a narrative of being a “Made in USA” crypto. The native token, which was at one point airdropped widely, only regained its value status after the US Securities and Exchange Commission withdrew intentions of prolonging a lawsuit that ran for years. Upbit also retains its advantage after Binance restricted and delisted XRP pairs. Currently, Upbit is driving a significant part of XRP activity based on Korean won pairs. The premium on Upbit lifted XRP to as high as $2.65, while most exchanges traded the asset at around $2.58. The Korean won is also growing its share of XRP activity, often rising above 20% of all trading volumes. The Korean won increased its share of XRP trading, as South Korean exchanges reacted to the popularity of XRP. | Source: Cryptocompare XRP also had a sudden spike in trading as of March 6, becoming the most actively traded asset in the Korean markets. The exchanges are isolated from international liquidity due to banking requirements, but they often reflect global crypto trends with even greater trading enthusiasm. Upbit boosts buying for ‘Made in USA’ crypto Upbit is showing a trend for active trading for some of the assets labeled as “Made in USA.” The recent spike in XRP activity tracked US attempts to onboard top assets for a government reserve. XRP also rallied after mentions of new crypto-friendly legislation . Other South Korean exchanges choose different paths for carrying XRP. Kucoin divested its holdings in the past few months. Bithumb started accumulating again at the end of 2024 and now carries over 1.5B XRP. Among top trending tokens, Upbit also saw a spike in trading volumes for Ondo (ONDO). The asset has links to US-based crypto activities and is one of the tokens held by Trump’s World Liberty Fi. ONDO traded at $1.19 on Upbit, with a small premium against the general price of $1.17 on other exchanges. Ondo Finance was not mentioned in the potential US strategic reserve, though it was one of the leading platforms for real-world asset tokenization. In addition to active trading, Upbit’s wallets also accumulated currently trending assets. Upbit currently carries over 391M ONDO, up from 280M at the beginning of the year. Ondo’s founder Nat Eliason will attend the White House crypto meetup, which will include top founders and influencers like Ripple Labs’ Brad Garlinghouse also confirmed to be in attendance. XRP recovers open interest The recent market enthusiasm for XRP is helping the asset recover its open interest . Within hours, XRP added $100M to its positions, from $1.44B to $1.54B. XRP still carries over 68% in long positions, causing some concerns about liquidations. The recent rally also caused $1.82M in liquidations in the past hour, as XRP became the most liquidated asset in the short term. This time, the XRP price expansion is causing a clearance of short positions , affecting those that were bearish about the asset. XRP currently rides on the narrative of wider US-based adoption. The price is having a short-term breakout, with some predictions of trading above $3. Currently, the retail sentiment for XRP is neutral, but smart money traders remain bullish.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-spot-etfs-continue-to-make-outflows-as-market-anxiety-continues-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced significant net outflows on March 5, signaling continued investor caution amid recent market volatility. Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs See $101.6 Million Net Outflow on March 5 According to the latest data, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $38.3 million, while Ethereum spot ETFs saw even larger outflows, reaching $63.3 million. This brings the total net outflows for both assets to approximately $101.6 million in a single day. Market Sentiment and ETF Trends The outflows reflect the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market as investors potentially reallocate funds or take profits amid price volatility. Ethereum’s higher rally compared to Bitcoin suggests that investors may be more hesitant about ETH’s near-term prospects. The decline in ETF inflows follows a strong start to the year, which saw record demand for Bitcoin ETFs after they were approved in the U.S. in January. However, recent market corrections combined with macroeconomic concerns and regulatory scrutiny have led to increased selling pressure. Analysts will be watching closely to see if this trend continues or if investors will turn to spot ETFs as a long-term risk strategy. Despite the recent outflows, institutional interest in crypto ETFs remains strong, and upcoming regulatory decisions on Ethereum ETFs in particular could shape the market’s direction in the coming months. *This is not investment advice.

The growing adoption of its blockchain and increasing institutional interest have positioned SOL as a key contender in the next market rally. However, while SOL’s growth potential is promising, another emerging crypto is capturing the interest of investors seeking even higher returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rapidly growing DeFi project, is attracting investors looking for significant upside. With a decentralized lending platform and a structured financial model, the project is positioned to see major adoption. As its presale continues to gain traction, analysts predict MUTM could reach 150x in the upcoming bull run, making it one of the most talked-about investment opportunities in the space. Solana (SOL) Analysts have projected an 80% surge for Solana (SOL) as market conditions improve and investor confidence grows. The prediction is based on increasing network activity, expanding use cases, and strong technical indicators pointing toward a potential breakout. With Solana’s blockchain gaining more adoption in DeFi and NFT sectors, its long-term prospects remain positive, driving speculation of significant price appreciation. Institutional interest in Solana has also played a role in shaping this forecast. Large investors have been accumulating SOL, further reinforcing the bullish outlook. Additionally, upcoming network upgrades and enhanced scalability solutions are expected to strengthen its ecosystem, potentially pushing its price higher in the next market rally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Solana is expected to see significant gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a high-growth contender with far greater upside. The project is building a decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem that allows users to earn passive income, access liquidity, and participate in a structured DeFi economy. Unlike many speculative tokens, MUTM is backed by a functional model that provides real financial utility. One of the main factors behind MUTM’s projected 150x surge is its presale performance. Over $2.2 million has been raised so far, with more than 4,200 holders securing early positions. Currently priced at $0.015, the token is set for a 50% increase in the next presale phase, creating urgency among investors before it reaches wider exchange accessibility. Mutuum Finance isn’t just another DeFi project—it’s creating a peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform designed to revolutionize decentralized finance. By allowing users to supply liquidity and earn APY, while enabling borrowers to access funds with overcollateralized loans, the platform ensures a sustainable financial model. Additionally, a stablecoin integration is being developed, further strengthening the project’s ecosystem and increasing demand for MUTM. What makes this projected 150x surge even more compelling is that the beta version of the lending platform is expected to launch alongside the token’s official release. This will drive immediate demand, as users will be able to engage with the platform from day one. With increasing adoption and exchange listings planned, the price of MUTM is anticipated to skyrocket post-launch, following a path similar to early-stage DeFi projects that saw exponential growth. With Mutuum Finance’s presale accelerating, investors recognize that early entry presents the greatest opportunity for substantial returns. As the next phase approaches, with a 50% price increase to $0.02, those who buy in now stand to benefit before the token reaches public markets. Given the project’s structured financial model, presale momentum, and upcoming platform launch, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most promising investments in the next bull run. For those who missed early opportunities in assets like Solana, Mutuum Finance offers a second chance to invest in a high-potential DeFi project before mainstream adoption sends prices soaring.

DOGE has remained a top-10 asset by market cap but its price swings have been unpredictable despite its proven resilience. However, DOGE lacks the utility, staking mechanisms, and structured rewards currently sought by investors. Meanwhile, DOGE holders want yield-generating ecosystems that offer more than market-driven price fluctuations. Real investment opportunities are, therefore, shifting toward DeFi protocols that generate passive income since memecoins primarily thrive on speculation. The shift to DeFi investments has led traders Solaxy and Skyren DAO which offer long-term sustainability, DeFi participation, and high-yield staking opportunities. Solaxy scales Solana’s network for a high-speed future The Solana ecosystem has continued to see significant growth despite frequent network congestion and high transaction demand revealing the chain’s scalability problem. Solaxy aims to solve these bottlenecks by offering a Layer-2 scaling solution that bundles transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Solana’s mainnet. Solaxy’s technology enhances transaction speed while reducing congestion, making it a crucial part of Solana’s long-term expansion. Solaxy’s successful approach is reflected in the platform’s generation of $22 million from presale order, which also highlights investor confidence in its potential. The Solaxy ecosystem prioritizes security and efficiency, and its smart contracts have already been fully audited by SolidProof to ensure smooth transactions and efficient functionalities. Solaxy has also partnered with Best Wallet to enable the direct purchase of SOLX tokens within the wallet application. Solaxy’s low transaction fees, enhanced scalability, and strong backing from the Solana community have placed it ahead of other DeFi protocols. Skyren DAO offers passive income, staking rewards, and airdrop automation Skyren DAO is built on Polygon’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure, which provides a seamless environment for staking and automated airdrop collection. Skyren is unlike many other DeFi projects that require constant participation because it ensures that investors earn rewards without active management. Skyren’s staking mechanism allows users to lock SKYRN tokens and receive consistent APY rewards, turning passive holdings into steady income streams. Skyren DAO’s ‘governance participation structure’ plays a key role in giving token holders the power to vote over staking rates, airdrop partnerships, and future protocol upgrades. Skyren’s airdrop collection is fully automated to ensure that SKYRN holders receive tokens from vetted projects across Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains. The user-friendly Skyren platform also eliminates the manual tracking and claiming of airdrops. Skyren DAO’s priority on security and transparency is reflected in how thorough its smart contracts are audited to avoid vulnerabilities. Skyren’s system is also KYC compliant which ensures that users ‘remain accountable’ and ‘adhere to regulations’. Each of the three tokens plays a critical role in crypto Dogecoin, Solaxy, and Skyren DAO serve a different role in the crypto ecosystem. Solaxy and Skyren DAO provide real utility and earning opportunities although Dogecoin remains a popular memecoin. Feature Dogecoin (DOGE) Solaxy (SOLX) Skyren DAO (SKYRN) Primary Use Case Digital currency Solana Layer-2 Scaling DAO, Staking & Airdrop Rewards Blockchain Dogecoin Network Solana Polygon Passive Income No Yes, via staking Yes, via staking & airdrops Scalability Low High, via Layer-2 High, via Polygon Governance Community-driven, but no voting Limited Full DAO voting power Smart Contract Audits Not required Completed by SolidProof Completed by Solidproof, Cognitos and Cyberscope Team Verified No No Yes Presale Fundraising None $20M+ Active at $0.048 Dogecoin’s strength lies in its large user base but the ecosystem lacks the structured earning opportunities currently sought by DeFi investors. Solaxy provides infrastructure for Solana’s long-term growth while Skyren DAO is a direct source of passive income for investors. DOGE holders explore Solaxy and Skyren DAO Dogecoin has proven its longevity despite investors seeking alternative projects that provide structured rewards rather than relying on price appreciation alone. Solaxy presents a long-term scaling solution for Solana, which addresses real network inefficiencies while integrating staking rewards. Skyren DAO focuses on passive income generation, automated airdrops, and providing staking rewards on the Polygon chain. Dogecoin holders are diversifying their positions into the Solaxy and Skyren DeFi projects that offer ongoing rewards and governance participation. Investors secure SKYRN at $0.048 before the presale ends Skyren DAO’s Phase 5 presale is closing soon and it offers one of the most attractive entry points in DeFi. SKYRN investors who secure their tokens now will gain exclusive access to staking pools and premium airdrops before the token launches on exchanges. How to Buy SKYRN Before the Presale Ends Go to Skyren.io and access the presale page. Connect a Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Select a preferred cryptocurrency for payment. Confirm the transaction and receive SKYRN instantly. Stake or hold for long-term rewards. Investors who enter before the presale ends will secure the best positioning before SKYRN reaches public trading. Final Thoughts: Dogecoin’s Community Expands Into DeFi Dogecoin remains a symbol of community-driven crypto success, but many investors are now focusing on structured DeFi opportunities. Solaxy is solving Solana’s issues, making it a critical piece of blockchain infrastructure, while Skyren DAO is building an ecosystem where passive income is automated and effortless. With SKYRN’s presale ending soon, Dogecoin holders looking for long-term returns are securing their positions before the market catches on. The next evolution in DeFi investing is here. DOGE, Solaxy, and Skyren DAO are leading the charge — secure your position before it’s too late.

Although that phrase might sound somewhat shady, it’s actually a positive development that embodies what crypto initially stood for: freedom. These types of casinos allow people to bet using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or some of the alt coin alternatives in a way that doesn’t require them to hand over any personal information. In some cases, not even a name. But it’s not all upside in the eyes of the more traditionally minded. To them, although these anonymous sites provide some benefits such as privacy and indeed freedom, with the abandonment of the regulation of conventional gambling outfits, they also come with certain risks. The Appeal of Anonymous Crypto Casinos One of the main attractions of anonymous crypto casinos is the privacy, but also the flexibility they offer. Traditional online casinos require players to provide personal information and undergo verification processes. In contrast, many more libertarian-minded crypto casinos allow users to gamble without revealing their identity or which country they live, enabling a higher degree of anonymity. Secondly, and purely from a playing perspective, it’s also significantly quicker to register. Casino players really enjoy signing up fast, so that they can jump on the games they like without waiting around for any regulatory checks. This is especially true with players that opt for crypto. The lack of Know Your Customer (KYC) checks is a significant plus point and similarly, withdrawals are faster processed when there are no wait times for identity documentation to be verified. Additionally, crypto transactions often bypass traditional financial institutions, resulting in faster deposits and withdrawals with lower fees.For many players, these kinds of benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks that may arise from the lack of regulatory oversight. Lack of Regulation: A Double-Edged Sword Many crypto casinos do not have a centralized controlling body in the same manner as the brick and mortar land-based casinos or their traditional online counterparts. These sites are often licensed by highly regarded and trusted bodies such as the reputable EU-focused Malta Gaming Authority ( MGA ), the strategic gaming approach used in Canada or indeed the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). It’s certainly true that there are many crypto casinos that are licensed, however, it’s almost always by some of the less strict authorities (Curacao and Anjouan as two prominent examples). However, plenty of them – specifically those with the anonymous tag – do not have a proper license at all. This can unfortunately mean that players can become victims of unfair practices, or find themselves in a hopeless situation trying to get their money out from casinos acting unlawfully. However, as previously explored, the lack of regulation can also be appealing. Players are not bound by geographic or betting restrictions that licensed casinos impose, making it easier to gamble freely, especially in countries where gambling is restricted or illegal. On top of that, some game providers place geographic restrictions on their content – similar to streaming services – and anonymous casinos often allow VPN usage to help players navigate around this. Anonymity as an Enabler? The ability of anonymous crypto casinos to worsen gambling habits is a significant worry for some. On the more traditional casinos discussed previously, where fiat is the more common currency form, there are self-exclusion features often present. In addition, there is regulatory intervention where needed and even the often debated NHS are meant to assist any players who might have a problem with gambling. There are also tools suggested by Gamble Aware that help players stop gambling by self-restricting access from sites for some time by choice. The situation puts compulsive gamblers at even greater risk when they lack the safety nets available on most traditional sites. It’s unfortunate that a large number of anonymous cryptocurrency gambling platforms ignore this and leave players with no way of controlling their betting habits. On top of this, the use of crypto transactions in these games may enhance players’ ability to keep their gaming behavior secret as concerned friends and relatives don’t have any means for monitoring it. Freedom vs. Safety The freedom to gamble anonymously is a significant draw, allowing players to avoid the limitations imposed by regulatory bodies. For some, this freedom is empowering, providing greater control over their gambling experience. However, this freedom comes with responsibility. The lack of consumer protections and transparency can lead to increased exposure to unfair practices, fraud, and financial loss. Additionally, without the safety nets offered by regulated platforms, players may find it harder to avoid gambling addiction. This, it would seem, comes down to the eternal debate between freedom and safety that dominates various spheres of politics from how to school children to fears over an overly watchful ‘nanny state.’ Summary As much as they have their advantages like being very confidential, independent and having no or few rules, anonymous crypto casinos still pose some challenges. Since there’s a lack of regulatory oversight, players are not protected like they are on traditional fiat casino sites and aren’t exposed to self-exclusion tools. This, in the worst cases, means they become more likely to develop problem gambling. Although anonymous crypto casino sites give freedom of choice, it’s always important to properly consider these sites and treat such sites with a little bit of extra caution – particularly for newcomers to the scene. It's important for all individuals who want to participate in online gambling using cryptocurrencies to maintain a balance between the temptation of remaining unknown and the necessity for responsible gambling.

This has caused some EL clients to have issues including transactions in blocks. ” - reported EF protocol support manager Tim Beiko. The reason was the ”oddities” of the said contract, which issued two events (transfer + escrow) rather than one. As a result, some EL-clients ”choked” and stopped enabling transactions. It took six hours to fix the bug. The activation of Pectra in Sepolia followed similar actions in Holesky on 24 February, which at some point led to a failure with slot finalisation ”due to a configuration issue on three major clients”. Specialists also had to issue a software update. Despite the bugs discovered, the team did not postpone the rollout of the update to Sepolia to a later date. Pectra is formed from the names of two previously planned hardforks Prague (for the execution level) and Electra (for the consensus level). The EIPs include improvements in the context of account abstraction , make significant changes to validators, and aim to improve overall network performance. Earlier, the security team opened a bounty programme to stress-test the hardfork until March 24 with a prize pool of $2 million.

This move is part of a global trend where central banks are loosening financial policies to support economic growth. In the U.S., traders expect at least three interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2025, while Germany and China are relying on government spending to keep their economies stable. We cut our key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points. We are doing this because inflation is on track to settle at around our 2% target, and the economy is facing headwinds. Read today’s monetary policy decisions https://t.co/rbgOSXWVRF pic.twitter.com/cHr9hMD42H — European Central Bank (@ecb) March 6, 2025 As per the press release , the ECB has lowered its key interest rates by 0.25 basis points, bringing the deposit facility rate to 2.50%, the main refinancing rate to 2.65%, and the marginal lending rate to 2.90%, effective March 12, 2025. What This Means for Markets Lower interest rates generally lead to increased money flow, which can boost stock markets and riskier assets like cryptocurrencies . Analysts suggest this easing cycle could push crypto prices higher, despite ongoing concerns about slowing economic growth. However, not everyone sees this as entirely positive. Inflation in Europe is still above the ECB’s target of 2%, and aggressive rate cuts could create problems in the long run. ECB coming up! -25bp rate cut expected Economic projections expected to be shaved Tariffs are a BIG concern…but activity hasn't been that bad. Germany's BIG stimulus package could make them less pessimistic Will the rate cut be enough to halt the rally in EURO? pic.twitter.com/bJhsLp7A1b — Kathy Lien (@kathylienfx) March 6, 2025 Bond Markets in Chaos The bond market is already reacting. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield has surged to 2.8%, its highest in more than a decade. This has narrowed the gap between German and U.S. bond yields, which in turn is putting downward pressure on the U.S. dollar. The situation is similar to what happened during Donald Trump’s first term when global financial shifts influenced currency values. Meanwhile, the U.K. is also seeing higher bond yields, now surpassing those of the U.S. Over in Japan, the country’s 10-year bond yield has hit 1.5%, the highest level in 17 years. The Bank of Japan, which recently raised interest rates after years of keeping them low, is now struggling to control inflation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Dubai’s Banking Giant Emirates NBD Ushers in a New Era with Crypto Trading on Liv X , Uncertain Road Ahead While the ECB’s rate cut may bring short-term relief, the overall financial situation remains unstable.

Although crypto benefits from easier financial conditions, unexpected market shifts could still trigger uncertainty.

One of the main drivers of the years-long rally has been expectations of lower interest rates. In… pic.twitter.com/ocpwxQmrJy — Max Wienke (@maxwi_etoro) March 4, 2025 Max Wienke explains that while the ECB is expected to cut interest rates in March, the future remains uncertain. Inflation in the Eurozone has dropped slightly to 2.4%, supporting further cuts, but factors like Trump’s unpredictable trade policies and the Ukraine war create complications. Divisions within the ECB are growing, making it harder to predict the pace of future cuts. A key concern is that aggressive easing could fuel inflation, while slow cuts might hurt growth. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, a new Web3 mobile provider, Coldware (COLD) , is rapidly gaining attention. Institutional investors are beginning to recognize the unique potential of Coldware (COLD) , as it positions itself alongside established tokens like Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) in the Web3 space. Coldware (COLD): A New Frontier for Institutional Investment While Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) remain prominent players, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a favorite for Web3 investors. The IoT-based blockchain platform is merging decentralized finance (DeFi) with Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, creating a highly scalable and secure platform for the next generation of blockchain applications. Unlike traditional blockchain solutions that focus purely on financial transactions, Coldware (COLD) is designed to integrate with IoT devices, making it highly adaptable for a variety of industries, including supply chain management, smart cities, and digital infrastructure. The unique capabilities of Coldware (COLD) make it an attractive option for institutional investors looking to diversify their portfolios into the Web3 and IoT sectors. The growing Coldware (COLD) led to an increasing amount of institutional support. With its innovative approach to DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), Coldware (COLD) offers a practical solution that merges the IoT space with blockchain technology, paving the way for future developments in Web3. XRP Faces Volatility and Technical Challenges Ripple (XRP) has long been a favorite among crypto investors, thanks to its focus on fast and affordable cross-border payments. However, the token is currently facing some technical challenges. A bearish divergence has emerged on the weekly chart, signaling potential downward momentum. According to chart expert Bluntz, XRP is at risk of a sharp decline, possibly falling to $1.00 by the end of March 2025. While XRP has been resilient, recent technical patterns suggest a potential trend reversal, especially with a head-and-shoulders pattern indicating that the coin could experience significant bearish pressure. Despite the market's initial excitement following Ripple's inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserves, uncertainty around its price trajectory persists. As XRP faces downward pressure, some institutional investors are shifting their focus toward other projects, such as Hedera (HBAR) and Coldware (COLD) , both of which offer significant potential for growth and innovation in the Web3 space. Hedera's Scalability and Governance Model Hedera (HBAR) continues to be one of the most scalable blockchain platforms, with its unique governance modelthat sets it apart from other blockchain projects. Hedera’s consensus algorithm allows it to handle enterprise-level applications, while its governance council, which includes prominent global organizations like Google, IBM, and Boeing, ensures a high level of reliability and trust for institutional investors. **Hedera’s recent partnership with Swift, a leader in cross-border payments, has further solidified its reputation in the industry. The increased institutional interest in HBAR, alongside the rise of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, has positioned Hedera to become a key player in Web3 and enterprise adoption. As HBAR approaches new resistance levels and technical indicators suggest further upward movement, many are optimistic about its future. With its focus on scalability, security, and real-world use cases, HBAR remains a top contender for institutional investors looking to back a sustainable blockchain solution. Conclusion: Why Institutional Investors Are Shifting to Coldware (COLD) While Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) continue to be strong contenders in the cryptocurrency space, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a top-tier alternative. Institutional investors are increasingly recognizing the real-world applications of Coldware, especially in the IoT and DeFi sectors. With its focus on scalability, security, and cutting-edge technology, Coldware is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for Web3 solutions. As more institutional investors back Coldware (COLD) , it could become the leading Web3 mobile provider, challenging the likes of Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR).

According to his recent post, XRP has broken the 4-hour resistance level, a key sign that it could be gearing up for a strong rally. He also pointed out that XRP must break above $3.3999 for further gains. XRP’s Broke 4-hour Resistance Ripple native token XRP, has been moving up and down in price recently. However, technical signals now show that it might be ready for a big upward move soon. According to Dark Defender, XRP has made a key move by breaking the 4-hour resistance, signaling the start of a strong uptrend. Hi all, $XRP broke the 4-hour resistance. 3.3999 must be broken, and the RSI has the Golden Cross, which is Bullish. Thus, XRP will soon be ready to proceed to an all-time high. Supports: $2.22, Resistances: $3.3999, $5.85 Enjoy! pic.twitter.com/1BFS4B6TqP — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) March 6, 2025 Therefore Defender analysis suggests that the XRP needs to maintain the key levels at $2.22. Thus the next major hurdle is the $3.30 resistance level, which XRP must surpass to gain further momentum. If it clears this barrier, XRP could see a surge toward $5.85 , a level that has been identified as a major resistance zone. Additionally, the RSI ( Relative Strength Index ) has formed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that suggests strong upward momentum. This pattern indicates that buyers are gaining control, increasing the chances of a breakout. Market Activity Hinting Bearish Sign Even though XRP has a bullish chart, it is struggling to rise. One reason could be the recent exchange inflows. Data from Coinglass shows that investors have deposited nearly $13 million worth of XRP on exchanges, which may increase selling pressure and slow its growth. Also, the OI-Weighted Funding Rate dropped from 0.0103% on March 3 to -0.0022%, showing more selling. The ratio also fell below 1.0 to 0.9798, which could mean XRP might drop further if it keeps falling. XRP Price Momentum With a weekly gain of 17% XRP is trading $2.61 reflecting a gain of almost 5%.

The new feature, a ""mini app"" accessible via the World App wallet, will offer special features to holders of World Network's digital passport, which lets users scan their iris in exchange for an account that verifies their ""proof-of-personhood."" World Chat is the latest iteration of World's ongoing quest to help people discern bots from humans in the age of AI. ""By connecting to World ID, World Chat allows you to know when you’re chatting with a verified human,"" World developer Tools for Humanity said in a statement to CoinDesk. Those who haven’t peered into World's iris-scanning Orb will still have access to the new chat feature. The new messaging app takes design cues from Apple's iMessage, which uses blue chat bubbles for iPhone users and green bubbles for everyone else. ""Conversations with verified World ID holders feature a blue chat bubble as well as a unique World ID gem in the upper right corner,"" Tools for Humanity explained. ""Conversations with non-verified accounts feature a grey chat bubble and no such gem."" Mini Apps were launched back in October 2024, and there were more than 250 million Mini App opens in the first two months of 2025, according to Tools for Humanity. “The World App has grown so much over the past year, we've continuously heard requests for a DMs layer. And we think that for some actions like sending money, that is just way more natural and fun than going to a wallet, and sending a transaction,” Tiago Sada, the head of product at Tools for Humanity, told CoinDesk. “People have been asking for the chat product specifically.” World Chat will be available on the World App for Android and iPhone iOS users starting Thursday. In addition to World Chat, World and social protocol Friends With Benefits, are teaming up with Alchemy, Bain Crypto Capital, Blockchain Capital and Variant Fund to launch an incubator program called World Build. The program includes hackathons, building retreats, and a demo day and is meant to encourage developers to build ""Mini Apps.""

Bitwise’s allocation, the size of which was not disclosed, is leveraging a Maple bitcoin-backed lending product, and represents a significant milestone in the adoption of on-chain credit by institutional allocators, said Maple CEO Sid Powell. Maple’s BTC backed lending product is available to accredited investors in the U.S. As digital versions of real world assets become a normal component of traditional finance, firms are looking beyond things like tokenized Treasury Bills, particularly as interest rates have been dropping while DeFi yields are seeing a resurgence. Bitwise is a big believer in the future of asset management moving on-chain, Powell said, where products are transparent and firms can find opportunities that don’t exist in traditional finance. “In this case, the yield from lending against bitcoin is not a product that's already available anywhere else in traditional finance,” Powell said in an interview. “Maple packages this product in a way that's consumable by institutional asset managers.” The move required Bitwise to do some pretty serious due diligence and background work, Powell said. “It was about 12 months of discussions and work in the background between our teams to pull this together,” he said. “Bitwise is incredibly thorough and this process involved working with their operations team, their legal and compliance team, their risk team, as well as tax advisors.” As well as its high profile crypto ETFs, Bitwise has over $12 billion in client assets across separately managed accounts, private funds, hedge fund strategies, and staking.",Finance|Maple|Bitwise|DeFi,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 14:00:00

The platform will burn 20 million AX tokens, reducing supply to 9,999,999. AX stakers can earn tiered $AURUS rewards, with the highest tier offering 8 per staked AX. $AURUS will enhance staking, liquidity, and governance while integrating with DeFi. AURUS, a prominent Web 3 platform, is bracing for a major shake-up of its operations. The firm that specializes in the tokenization of gold and other precious metals has announced it will be migrating from its legacy AX token to a new standard $AURUS, by the end of March 2025. That transition will proceed through a token generation event (TGE) throughout the month. The platform explained that evolution through a statement on its website saying, “Built on the BASE network, $AURUS aligns with our goal to drive sustainable value and expand liquidity across our ecosystem” It further clarified that the $AURUS TGE will burn ⅔ of its AX token, reducing the digital asset’s supply by 20,000,000. The final burning event will trim AX’s current supply to 9,999,999 tokens, a figure it says represents the purity of gold. To achieve that, AURUS will burn 5,000,000 AX tokens weekly, increasing the asset’s scarcity and boosting its demand and, therefore, long-term value. Why burn now? “The $AX token burn was AURUS’s reward to its faithful community ahead of moving to $AURUS and upgrading the tokenomics,” AURUS said. The firm also shared its enthusiasm for the upcoming change. It added that it would combine $AURUS’s features to create a stable, growth-enhancing, and community-enriching environment. This would thus be looking to the token to provide incremental new utility, from stacking and liquidity provision to streamlined governance. Exclusive rewards for AX stakers AX holders will profit from the revenue the AURUS protocol generates, mainly from its tGOLD token, a gold-backed digital asset that exposes holders to the wider Web3 and DeFi sector. It is about to launch on BASE with an updated mechanism for collecting and paying out rewards in Eth. AX stakers can also qualify for the $AURUS token tiered rewards program that works as follows: Currently, over 3,960,000 $AX are staked, with the final stages of Tier 2 offering 8 $AURUS per $AX staked. Investors can still claim only 40,000 $AX in Tier 2 rewards paying out at this rate. Once this allocation is reached, the rewards will drop to Tier 3, offering 4 $AURUS per $AX. Get ready for the $AURUS launch With the $AURUS launch scheduled for April, NOW is the best time to stake and earn your rewards. You can do this by purchasing AX and staking it now on the AURUS dashboard . Powered by a team of passionate developers, AURUS is a platform that’s breaking new ground in the tokenization of commodities . It’s a comprehensive ecosystem combining the timeless value of real-world assets (RWAs) with the boundless possibilities of blockchain technology.

The uncertainty has left traders cautious, with many waiting for a strong signal of recovery before re-entering the market. Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, shared insights on X, revealing that Dogecoin may be gearing up for a rebound. According to his analysis, the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on a high time frame, suggesting that DOGE could be nearing a potential reversal. If bulls step in at current levels and capitalize on this setup, DOGE could see a strong recovery in the coming days. Is Dogecoin Preparing For A Recovery Rally? Dogecoin has been at its lowest since late 2024 as bullish sentiment fades, following a 60% decline from its multi-year high of $0.48. The correction has been brutal, with meme coins bleeding the most amid broader market weakness. DOGE now struggles to reclaim crucial liquidity levels, making it difficult to start a recovery rally. Market participants are closely watching for a decisive move, as analysts and investors remain on the sidelines, waiting for confirmation of either a break above crucial supply or a breakdown below current demand levels. Until a clear trend is established, uncertainty dominates DOGE’s price action. Despite the bearish outlook, Martinez’s insights suggest Dogecoin may be gearing up for a rebound. According to his analysis, the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the 4-day chart, which could indicate that selling exhaustion is near. The TD Sequential is a well-regarded technical analysis tool that helps traders identify trend exhaustion and potential price reversals. On higher time frames, this indicator has historically been very effective, meaning this could present a major buying opportunity if DOGE follows its typical pattern.

If buyers step in and confirm the TD Sequential’s buy signal, Dogecoin could see a strong recovery in the coming days. However, failure to reclaim key levels may lead to further downside pressure, delaying any meaningful rebound. DOGE Holding Crucial Demand Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.209 after a period of volatile price swings, briefly dipping below $0.20 before recovering above $0.22. The market remains uncertain, with bulls attempting to regain control after weeks of selling pressure. For DOGE to confirm a strong recovery, bulls must reclaim the $0.25 level and establish it as a solid support zone. This would open the door for a push above the 200-day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), key resistance levels that could trigger a breakout to higher price targets. If DOGE successfully clears these technical barriers, momentum could shift in favor of buyers, leading to a more sustained uptrend.

However, losing the $0.20 level again would be a bearish signal as it would indicate a lack of strong demand at current prices. If this scenario plays out, DOGE could drop further into lower demand levels around $0.14, a price zone that previously acted as a major accumulation area.

This recovery is happening as Donald Trump prepares to unveil the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve during the White House crypto summit. This article explores some of the best altcoins to buy now to turn $10K to $100K before March 31. 3 Altcoins to Buy Now as Bitcoin Hits $90k to Turn $10K to $100K Bitcoin price has two key potential catalysts. US bond yields are falling, hinting that the Fed will cut interest rates soon. BTC and other risky assets do well when the Fed embraces a dovish tone. Also, Donald Trump will host his crypto summit , where he is expected to unveil the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and discuss deregulation issues. Some of the best altcoins to buy now are Chainlink (LINK), Ondo (ONDO), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is one of the best crypto to buy now and see big gains. One of its latest catalyts is that Emirates NBD, a large Dubai bank, has launched crypto trading services. This is a big deal for Chainlink since it entered into a partnership with it in December. Chainlink is providing it with oracle services and is also a member of its Digital Asset Lab. Chainlink price may also do well as centralized exchange reserves dropped. CoinGlass data shows that balance reserves are 148 million, down from 168 million in November. That is a sign that many LINK holders are not selling the coin, which is a bullish sign. Chainlink Balances Ondo (ONDO) Ondo is another top altcoin to buy and turn $10K to $100K. It is a Made in USA coin that is part of Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial portfolio . Additionally, it has become a major player in the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, an industry that is expected to do well in the next few years. Ondo’s network is also seeing more demand from investors as the total value locked (TVL) has jumped to $1 billion for the first time. This is a sign that investors are interested in it. Ondo Total Value Locked Additionally, Ondo has formed both a falling wedge pattern and a cup and handle. These two are some of the most popular bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. The short-term Ondo forecast is $1.4792, up by 25% from the current level. It will then retest its all-time high at $2.14 and then continue soaring to $4.3, as shown below. Ondo Price chart Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Bitcoin Cash is one of the top altcoins to buy and convert $10K into $100K in March. The main case for BCH is that there is a probability that one or more financial companies will apply for a spot BCH ETF, which has high chances of approval. That’s because BCH is similar to Litecoin and Bitcoin, and is therefore, not seen as a security. Bitcoin Cash price has also formed a major bottom at $284, meaning that a rebound to the neckline point at $640 is possible. That rally would imply a 61% surge from the current level. Summary Altcoin prices will likely do well if Bitcoin sustains its rally above $90,000 and moves above $100,000. Such a move would raise odds of it moving above its all-time high, which will push more altcoins higher.

Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev has publicly announced that there are no plans to incorporate cryptocurrencies into the National Welfare Fund (NWF). This decision, revealed through a report by Wu Blockchain on X, highlights Russia’s continued caution towards the volatile nature of the crypto market and its preference for traditional investment avenues. Let’s dive into the details of this significant announcement and explore what it means for the future of crypto regulation in Russia. Why Russia Crypto Regulation Excludes National Welfare Fund? The core reason behind Russia’s decision lies in the perceived cryptocurrency volatility risks . Vladimir Kolychev explicitly stated that the high volatility associated with cryptocurrencies makes them unsuitable for a strategic fund like the NWF. This fund, designed to support the pension system and finance major infrastructure projects, prioritizes stability and long-term value preservation. Cryptocurrencies, known for their dramatic price swings, do not align with these objectives. Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons cited for excluding crypto from the National Welfare Fund: Volatility Concerns: The primary concern is the unpredictable price fluctuations in the crypto market. Sudden drops could significantly erode the fund’s value, jeopardizing its primary goals. Lack of Stability: Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies are still considered a nascent and speculative asset class by many financial institutions and governments. The NWF aims for stable and predictable returns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. This uncertainty adds another layer of risk, making it less appealing for a national fund with a long-term horizon. Focus on Traditional Assets: The NWF’s current investment structure is geared towards more established asset classes, providing a sense of security and predictability that cryptocurrencies currently lack in the eyes of the Russian Ministry of Finance. National Welfare Fund Crypto: A Strategic Reserve? Interestingly, Kolychev mentioned that he is unaware of any discussions regarding the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve , similar to proposals once considered during the Trump administration in the United States. This comparison is noteworthy as it places Russia’s current stance in a global context. While some nations have explored or are exploring the potential of holding crypto as a strategic asset, Russia is clearly not on that path, at least for its National Welfare Fund. This raises a critical question: Is a strategic cryptocurrency reserve a viable concept for nations? Let’s consider the arguments for and against: Arguments for a Strategic Crypto Reserve Arguments against a Strategic Crypto Reserve Diversification: Crypto could offer diversification beyond traditional reserves like gold and fiat currencies. Technological Advancement: Embracing crypto could position a nation at the forefront of financial technology. Potential for High Returns: While volatile, crypto assets have the potential for significant long-term growth. Decentralization: Crypto’s decentralized nature could offer resilience against geopolitical risks and traditional financial system vulnerabilities. Extreme Volatility: As highlighted by Russia, volatility poses a significant risk to reserve value. Security Concerns: Crypto storage and security are complex, raising concerns about potential theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of consistent global regulation creates ambiguity and risk. Market Manipulation: The crypto market is susceptible to manipulation, which could destabilize reserves. Vladimir Kolychev Crypto Stance: A Consistent Approach? Vladimir Kolychev ‘s statements reflect a generally cautious and conservative approach from the Russian Ministry of Finance towards cryptocurrencies in the context of national financial instruments. While Russia has been exploring crypto regulation and even considering digital ruble initiatives, this latest announcement reinforces a clear separation between these exploratory efforts and the management of core national wealth funds. It indicates a strategic prioritization of stability and risk mitigation for the NWF over the potential benefits of crypto exposure. However, it is crucial to note that this decision pertains specifically to the National Welfare Fund. Russia’s broader stance on cryptocurrencies is more nuanced. The country is actively working on regulating the crypto space, with discussions around mining, taxation, and even the potential use of crypto for international settlements. Therefore, while crypto is deemed too risky for the NWF, it’s not being entirely dismissed within the Russian financial ecosystem. Navigating Crypto Investment Strategy Amidst Global Uncertainty Russia’s decision offers valuable insights for individual and institutional investors formulating their own crypto investment strategy . The emphasis on volatility and risk management, highlighted by Kolychev, is a crucial consideration for anyone venturing into the crypto market. Here are some actionable insights: Risk Assessment is Key: Understand your risk tolerance before investing in crypto. Recognize that significant price swings are inherent to this market. Diversification Matters: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Long-Term Perspective: Consider a long-term investment horizon. Crypto markets can be highly cyclical, and short-term volatility might be less concerning for long-term holders. Stay Informed on Regulation: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in your jurisdiction and globally. Regulations can significantly impact the crypto market. Due Diligence is Essential: Thoroughly research any crypto project or asset before investing. Understand the technology, team, and market dynamics. In conclusion, Russia’s decision to exclude cryptocurrencies from its National Welfare Fund underscores a pragmatic approach focused on minimizing risk and prioritizing stability for its sovereign wealth. While this may be seen as a setback for crypto adoption by some, it also serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties that still characterize the crypto market. For investors, this news reinforces the importance of cautious, informed, and risk-aware strategies when navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of digital assets.

Here Are Those Tokens,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trump-familys-crypto-investment-project-wlfi-invested-in-9-more-altcoins-here-are-those-tokens/,"The Trump family’s crypto investment project, WLFI, has allocated a total budget of $336 million to purchase nine digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), TRON (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), AAVE, Ethena (ENA), BlueMove (MOVE), Ondo (ONDO), and Sei (SEI). Trump Family's Crypto Fund WLFI Invests $336 Million in Nine Tokens However, if these assets were to be liquidated at current market prices, WLFI would face an unrealized loss of approximately $88 million, with Ethereum (ETH) taking the largest share of this decline at $67.35 million. Market Volatility Hits WLFI Portfolio The investments come amid heightened market volatility, with recent price swings affecting WLFI’s holdings. While the fund has not signaled any intention to sell, the losses highlight the risks of large-scale crypto investments. Closely watched by industry insiders, the WLFI marks a significant foray into digital assets by the Trump family, in line with Donald Trump’s increasing engagement with the crypto industry. Despite the current volatility losses, market analysts suggest that WLFI’s long-term strategy could still be profitable if the crypto markets recover. The project’s investment options reflect a mix of blue-chip cryptocurrencies like ETH and WBTC, as well as emerging tokens like ENA, MOVE, and ONDO, suggesting a diversified, high-risk approach. With Trump’s recent proposal for a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, the Trump family’s involvement in digital assets is garnering the attention of both investors and policymakers. *This is not investment advice.

Unlike previous bull markets, the focus has been very much on Bitcoin, seemingly with only the merest sniff of an altcoins season, which has so far failed to arrive. Is there still hope for prominent altcoins such as $TON, $RENDER, and $RUNE? A different bull market makes it difficult for alts to thrive The days when plenty of altcoins would go parabolic as Bitcoin took a pause may never be seen again. Literally thousands of percent in gains were made, in many cases, on just a dream and a promise. This all took place when crypto was still in its infancy, and the vast majority of investors were speculating on this new and innovative asset class. Fast forward to the bull market of 2024/2025, and investors are a lot more wary. Of course, there is still rampant speculation, but this has mostly been targeted at niches such as the Memecoins, where crazy gains have still been made. However, for most of the altcoins that were prominent in the last bull market, and some from the one previous to that, with few exceptions times have not been good. $TON, $RENDER, and $RUNE, are three altcoins that are still generally well thought of, given their technology and use cases. Can any of these three altcoins make it back to their respective highs? $TON back to launch price Source: TradingView $TON is still a relatively new cryptocurrency, having been launched late in 2022. Since that time, the price chopped sideways for more than a year, before firing to the upside in early 2023. The resulting run took $TON almost 300% higher to a price of $8.28. However, that huge run was cancelled out through the rest of 2024 and now into 2025. In fact, $TON even went down to touch the price where it was launched all the way back in December 2022. As things stand, it does look as though the bottom might have been reached, with a touch and ensuing bounce from the descending trendline. In addition, the RSI at the bottom of the chart registered the lowest low in the indicator, also since the launch. Therefore, there could well be some strong upside left in $TON if the bull market does continue through the major part of this year. That said, at this stage of the bull market, for $TON to be at these depths does not bode well. A bounce may be likely from here, but surpassing the all-time highs is probably a long shot. Still hope for $RENDER Source: TradingView As it stands, the $RENDER chart does not look particularly good either. The price broke underneath the $4.40 level, and over four consecutive weeks, this level has proved to be strong resistance. That said, the price has been gathering within a descending wedge, from which it recently broke out of. The question now is whether this will be yet another rejection from the horizontal resistance, or whether the price is just confirming the breakout? In favour of the breakout, the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing that the indicators have bottomed. A cross up of these indicators, allied with a breakout of the wedge and the horizontal resistance, should take the price back to at least $6.68. A disastrous chart for $RUNE Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $RUNE is nothing short of disastrous. Down 94% from the top in the midst of a bull market does not inspire much hope. As can be seen above, a series of lower highs and lower lows are continuing to take place. On top of this, the current price action is in the shape of a bear flag. Absolute bottom support is just below this. Unless this breaks upward, and the Stochastic RSI also crosses up, it is hard to see where the upside comes for $RUNE.

After a period of consolidation, bulls are strongly attempting to reclaim control, aiming for a breakout beyond key resistance levels. However, the road ahead is not without obstacles. A critical resistance zone looms, and whether UNI can push past it or face another pullback remains the big question. Market sentiment is shifting as buying pressure increases, but the presence of strong resistance could determine the next phase of price action. If UNI breaks through, it could open the doors for a sustained rally, while failure to do so might lead to another retest of lower levels. Price Targets: How High Can Uniswap Go? Uniswap’s recent recovery from $6.7 has sparked bullish optimism, but how far can the price climb if it successfully breaks through resistance? The first key target lies at $8.7, a crucial resistance level that has previously acted as support and rejection. A decisive move above this zone could pave the way for $10.3, a level that may determine whether UNI can sustain further upside. Related Reading: Uniswap Price Surges Past $10 — Bullish Pattern Suggests Further 30% Gain If buying momentum remains strong, the next major hurdle is around $12.3, a psychological barrier and a key resistance from past price action. Beyond this level, the rally is expected to extend, potentially opening the door for $15.7 and beyond. However, UNI’s ability to reach these targets depends on broader market conditions, trading volume, and bulls countering selling pressure. A rejection at resistance might lead to a retest of lower levels, making it crucial for traders to monitor price action closely. Lastly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formation indicates that UNI still has more room for upward movement, as the RSI line has risen above the 50% threshold. This suggests that buying momentum is increasing, signaling a possible continuation of the bullish trend. Support Zones To Watch If UNI Faces A Pullback Several key supports may prevent UNI’s struggles to maintain its bullish momentum against further decline. The first major support level is around $6.7, which recently acted as a strong demand zone. A bounce from this level could indicate that buyers are still in control, keeping the uptrend intact. Related Reading: Uniswap Aims For Recovery – Bulls Take A Stand At $12.3 Support Should selling pressure intensify, UNI might drop toward the $5.5 range, a key area where buyers have previously stepped in to defend against more drops. Furthermore, a breakdown below this zone might shift sentiment to bearish, exposing UNI to a potential drop toward $4.8, a level where the token may stabilize or extend its losses.

It’s an opportunity to move beyond the often-adversarial narratives and towards a more collaborative approach to fostering innovation while addressing legitimate regulatory concerns. What Could Be on the Agenda? Decoding the Discussions on Crypto Regulation While the specific agenda remains under wraps, we can speculate on some key topics likely to be at the forefront of discussions at the White House Crypto Summit. Given the attendees and the current state of the crypto landscape, here are potential areas of focus concerning crypto regulation: Clarity on Regulatory Frameworks: The industry has long called for clearer regulatory guidelines. Expect discussions around defining which digital assets fall under securities laws (SEC jurisdiction) and which are commodities (CFTC jurisdiction). Clear definitions are crucial for businesses to operate compliantly. Consumer Protection: Protecting consumers from fraud and scams is a paramount concern for regulators. Discussions will likely revolve around measures to enhance consumer protection in the crypto space without stifling innovation. Innovation vs. Regulation Balance: Finding the right balance between fostering innovation in blockchain technology and implementing necessary regulations is a key challenge. The summit will likely explore ways to achieve this delicate equilibrium. KYC and AML Compliance: Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations are crucial for preventing illicit activities. Expect discussions on streamlining compliance processes and ensuring effective implementation across the crypto industry. Taxation of Digital Assets: Taxation remains a complex area in the crypto world. The summit could touch upon clarifying tax rules and ensuring fair and efficient taxation of digital asset transactions and holdings. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): DeFi presents unique regulatory challenges due to its decentralized nature. Discussions may explore approaches to regulating DeFi protocols and platforms while preserving their innovative aspects. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): With many countries exploring CBDCs, the US approach is of global interest. The summit might touch upon the potential role of a US CBDC and its implications for the broader crypto ecosystem. These are just some of the potential topics. The summit is likely to be a dynamic and multifaceted discussion, reflecting the complexity and evolving nature of the digital asset space. The presence of both industry leaders and regulators ensures a robust exchange of ideas and perspectives. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The White House Crypto Summit, while seemingly a high-level event, has implications for everyone involved in the crypto space, from investors to developers to everyday users. Here’s what you should be paying attention to and some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on news and updates coming out of the summit. Follow reputable crypto news sources and social media channels for real-time information. Understand Regulatory Developments: Pay close attention to any signals or announcements regarding future crypto regulation. This will help you anticipate potential changes in the market and adjust your strategies accordingly. Industry Advocacy: Support organizations and initiatives that advocate for sensible crypto regulation. Your voice, even as an individual, can contribute to shaping a positive regulatory environment. Prepare for Compliance: If you are involved in a crypto business, start preparing for potentially stricter regulatory compliance requirements. Strengthening your KYC/AML processes and staying updated on legal developments is crucial. Long-Term Perspective: Regulatory clarity, while it might bring short-term market fluctuations, is generally seen as positive for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto industry. Maintain a long-term perspective and focus on the fundamental value of blockchain technology and digital assets.

In a new video, Svenson tells his 82,800 YouTube subscribers that an expansion in the global money supply could trigger a rally in altcoins. According to Svenson, previous altcoin rallies have erupted after an increase in the global money supply. “Every major bull run for these altcoins… …they really did not start running until global liquidity exploded, you know, went up tremendously… And what we’ve seen is that until recently global liquidity we were testing the 2022 highs as support just recently… There has been no growth for the M2 (money supply) at all really. But it’s starting to come up… …you can see the M2 is slowly coming up now to a breakout. And that breakout in global liquidity may be exactly what the altcoins need to start doing something for real.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube The crypto analyst says that he sees altcoins replicating the price action they displayed during the rally that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to Svenson, the market cap of altcoins could go up by around 190% from the current level. “If you just extrapolate… It would take us up to $730 billion roughly which would be a new all-time high… That might be a target zone for altcoins and then they could come back to retest the trend line. And maybe go up later it might just be a very steady uptrend where there’s just a lot of profit taking at every new high.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The last few months saw a bearish momentum in the altcoin space, but within the past week, there’s been a resurgence. Price is gradually bouncing back as both altcoins enjoy a slight price recovery. Analysis from Solana news states that one of the reasons behind SOL and XRP recovery is the performance of meme coins like SHIBI and TRUMP. As these meme coins continue to perform well, there is renewed interest in the crypto space, which has significantly boosted the price of other altcoins. Will meme coins be key to the altcoin market in the future? What is the best project to invest in this year? Let’s dive into the details. Solana (SOL) Gains Momentum with Panshibi (SHIBI) and Trump’s Support Solana has become the blockchain for meme coins and fast transactions. Despite its ups and downs, it still manages to stay on top, serving as a direct rival to Ethereum. Panshib, a relatively new meme coin, takes advantage of Solana's low transaction fees and fast transfers to offer real-life utility. Panshibi is still in its presale stage, yet it has already recorded success as its price hits $0.005. The project's roadmap and real-life utility have positioned it for astronomical growth like tokens such as Bonk (BONK) and SHIB. Similarly, TRUMP continues to record success as price reaches $12.9 with thousands of investors recording huge profit since the project launched. Consequently, the SOL price seems to be enjoying a bearish movement, thanks to the momentum from these meme coins. SOL has a strong support level, and analysts expect it to break the $200 mark soon. XRP Prepares for a Strong Performance Amid Legal and Institutional Growth Despite Ripple's legal battles, it continues to gain global partnerships and reinforces its position as a player in cross-border payment systems. As Solana news reports that SOL rides high on memecoin mania, there’s also belief that XRP will not be neglected. There seem to be signs that the performance of meme coins like SHIBI and TRUMP means altcoins like XRP will also experience a resurgence. Market experts anticipate a potential rally for XRP, pushing its price beyond the $3 resistance level in the coming weeks. If you are looking for a 1.2x to 1.5x profit within the next couple of weeks, XRP is a great option. But if you are looking for up to 50x profit, the best option is buying SHIBI now that it’s still in the presale stage. Panshibi (SHIBI) Could Be the Next Big Memecoin on Solana SHIBI is designed to thrive in the growing meme coin market. It is built on the Solana network, which means investors will enjoy fast transaction speeds. The project has a good road map, liquidity, and an active community. Considering these factors, experts believe that SHIBI may be the bigger project for 2025, with the potential to give 50x gains to early investors. Whether you’re looking for the next big memecoin or a long-term utility-driven crypto, SHIBI is the token to watch in the coming weeks. The latest Solana news points to an exciting period ahead for investors. As SOL attempts to bounce back and XRP continues to prove its resilience with growing institutional adoption, investors may yield profit in the coming weeks. Despite this, you may not gain more than 2x profit from these two altcoins, which is relatively poor when compared to what you could achieve if you invest in meme coins like Panshibi that offer up to 50x profit margin.

41239289,https://coinpedia.org/?p=428754,1741275049,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Cardano Forecast: 80% Further Gains For ADA & Why Is Panshibi (SHIBI) So Attractive To Cardano Holders?,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/why-is-panshibi-shibi-so-attractive-to-cardano-holders/,"The post Cardano Forecast: 80% Further Gains For ADA & Why Is Panshibi (SHIBI) So Attractive To Cardano Holders? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a massive 80% jump, Cardano’s price is now trading near $0.964 , with many questioning whether the coin can sustain its momentum. While some foresee further upside thanks to a U.S. “crypto reserve” led by President Donald Trump, others warn that Cardano may be vulnerable to setbacks if Congress or whale activity undermines the rally. Amid this intrigue, a new meme contender Panshibi (SHIBI) emerges at $0.005, raising more than $1.22 million and capturing attention from meme enthusiasts seeking alternative gains. Below, we examine these developments and how traders can weigh their options. Cardano Price Prediction: Can an 80% Rally Hold? The Cardano price soared above $1, only to settle back to the mid-$ 0.90s. Some blame overbought conditions and profit-taking by major players. Although Cardano’s run made headlines, skeptics highlight multiple reasons not to buy ADA just yet. First is that Trump’s plan for a strategic crypto reserve still hinges on Congressional approval. If lawmakers block it, any price pump tied to government backing could unravel quickly, leaving Cardano holders vulnerable to a selloff. Secondly, Data shows whales sold 110 million ADA during the surge, implying big-money traders lack long-term confidence at these elevated prices. Their selling may restrict Cardano’s ability to hold above $1 if broader sentiment weakens. Lastly, an overbought RSI near 67 and waning MACD histogram bars suggest buyer enthusiasm could be fading. If the coin loses support at $0.97, chart watchers warn of potential dips to $0.81 or even $0.65. Cardano’s success rests on bridging these concerns and navigating the political, institutional, and whale-driven hurdles that might derail its recent rally. Those who believe the coin’s fundamentals and the upcoming White House Crypto Summit could trigger more upside must also accept the volatility that shapes short-term price action. Panshibi (SHIBI): A Comedic Alternative While Cardano price updates dominate serious altcoin discussions, Panshibi (SHIBI) appeals to a different crowd with comedic branding and structured tokenomics. Priced at $0.005, Panshibi secures liquidity for 10 years and locks team tokens for two moves meant to mitigate the sudden dumps that plague many meme coins. An audit further solidifies trust, catering to investors who crave comedic returns but want some degree of security. Early backers say an AI-based “social-fi” model sets $SHIBI apart by incentivising holders to stake, complete quests, and remain engaged beyond a quick hype cycle. If mainstream interest in meme coins reignites, Panshibi’s fresh branding and locked liquidity may draw risk-seeking traders. The project’s more robust approach could help it survive the initial hype phase better than typical short-lived memes. Conclusion An 80% rally above $1 forced the Cardano price into the spotlight, but questions remain over the U.S. crypto reserve’s viability and whales’ selling actions. Despite these red flags, some see potential for Cardano if it can hold above key supports and harness more bullish news. Meanwhile, Panshibi (SHIBI) capitalizes on comedic flair, locked security, and an active community to stake its claim in a volatile market. Both stories underscore that crypto remains driven by headlines, big bets, and sentiment offering opportunities for those willing to accept the associated risks.

This proposal will commence voting on March 6, 2025, and if implemented, it could reduce Solana’s supply significantly and drive price growth. As the Solana community votes on the proposal, will it ignite a parabolic rally for SOL to a new ATH? VanEck Says New Inflation Proposal Will Boost Solana Price Value Solana price has been under bearish pressure due to FTX unlocks . However, VanEck believes that a new proposal could shift the market sentiment, In its recent monthly report, VanEck hailed the SIMD 0228 proposal whose vote is scheduled today. It noted that the proposal was the “most impactful” to Solana price as it would reduce the annual inflation rate from 4.7% to 1.5%. Per the asset manager, “We believe lowering inflation is a worthy goal that strengthens Solana’s long-term sustainability. Maintaining a predictable and low inflation rate can support SOL’s value by reducing dilution and sell pressure.” The head of digital assets research at VanEck, Matthew Sigel, had also supported the proposal, saying it could stabilize and strengthen Solana’s position in the crypto industry. VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Despite the optimism, the upcoming upgrade has also received opposition. According to one member of the Solana community, this proposal would reduce the amount of Solana being staked and compromise network security . Solana Technical Analysis – Is a New ATH in Sight? If the Solana SIMD 0228 proposal passes the community vote, it could stir a parabolic rally for Solana price. At press time, SOL trades at $146 after a 3.3% rise in 24 hours. According to analyst Crypto Rand, Solana price was forming a bull reversal on its daily chart. The altcoin was attempting to break from a descending trendline to confirm this reversal. Looking at past trends, a decisive breakout from this trendline has often preceded a parabolic price rally. This could set the stage for a surge to an all-time high. SOL/USDT: 3-day Chart Another analyst CryptoCurb has an even more bullish Solana price prediction. In his analysis, he noted that Solana had entered had entered a demand zone where buying pressure has previously been strong. If Solana were to bounce from this zone, it could make a massive rally towards $1,000. SOL/USD: 2-Week Chart Solana price is struggling to bounce past $150. However, the proposal to reduce inflation could bode well for SOL in the long term. If the proposal passes, it could also spike short-term volatility as traders anticipate the effects that it will have on the price.

Méliuz invested $4.1 million to acquire 45.72 bitcoins at an average price of $90,926 per coin. The purchase represents roughly 10% of the company’s total cash holdings based on a new policy approved by its board of directors. In a statement, Méliuz said the bitcoin allocation seeks “long-term returns” on the investment as part of its treasury management. The company also created a Bitcoin Strategic Committee to study expanding its strategy and making bitcoin a primary treasury asset. Méliuz Chairman Israel Salmen told local media the move into bitcoin provides an “intelligent alternative” to holding cash reserves. “We see bitcoin as a long-term store of value,” he remarked. JUST IN: Brazilian listed company Méliuz buys 45.7 #Bitcoin for $4.1 million Bitcoin is good for corporations pic.twitter.com/rCGiGYXdlR — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 6, 2025 The $4.1 million bitcoin acquisition makes Méliuz the first publicly listed Brazilian company to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet. The strategy mirrors those adopted by U.S. firms like MicroStrategy, which holds over 500,000 bitcoins worth over $46 billion. Méliuz offers cashback and financial services to over 30 million users in Brazil. But its stock price has plunged from highs near $6 billion in 2021 down to just $270 million currently. Salmen said the negligible trading volume makes Méliuz shares appear “irrelevant” in public markets. He hopes the pioneering bitcoin move renews investor interest.

41239741,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=29932,1741275261,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,COTI Announces the Africa Tokenization Council with Strategic Partners,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/coti-announces-the-africa-tokenization-council-with-strategic-partners/,"COTI has unveiled the Africa Tokenization Council, an ambitious initiative launched in collaboration with strategic partners to drive blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across Africa and the Middle East. This pioneering effort seeks to unite African officials with global leaders in blockchain and tokenization, fostering investment and innovation within the region. With a rapidly growing technology-focused population and increasing interest in digital assets, African countries are poised to make a significant impact on the global blockchain ecosystem. The Africa Tokenization Council aims to convene leaders, investors, and industry practitioners through symposiums dedicated to regulatory frameworks, partnerships, investment strategies, and the necessary pathways for a thriving tokenization ecosystem. The initiative will also focus on setting standards and regulatory advancements that support seamless ownership structures, thus creating an environment conducive to international investment in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Unlocking Africa’s Market Potential The combination of Africa’s burgeoning fintech landscape, regulatory advancements, and a thriving entrepreneurial spirit presents a unique opportunity for blockchain-driven economic transformation. Africa and the Middle East collectively hold a GDP exceeding $5 trillion, with a history of adopting mobile technologies, fintech solutions, and cryptocurrency at an accelerated pace compared to traditional economic environments. The Africa Tokenization Council, backed by prominent government officials, investors, and practitioners, is well-positioned to facilitate this shift. With strong involvement from Saudi Arabian leadership and COTI’s advanced privacy-focused blockchain technology, the council envisions a future where tokenization becomes an integral part of economic growth and financial inclusion. Key Figures Leading the Initiative Several influential figures have joined the Africa Tokenization Council, bringing their expertise in energy, finance, and blockchain: Dr. Mansour Almalik holds a Ph.D. in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University and has over two decades of experience in government and academia. He has previously served as a Senior Advisor to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and has represented Saudi Arabia in the United Nations’ Science and Technology Committee. As the Chairman of Attwar Group, his interests span energy, fintech, and artificial intelligence. Alaa Bishara is a seasoned entrepreneur and crypto investor with a background in traditional real estate. His extensive experience in managing high-net-worth portfolios has positioned him as a key player in the intersection of real estate, fintech, and digital innovation. His commitment to Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization underscores his vision for a financially inclusive future driven by blockchain technology. Shahaf Bar-Geffen (CEO of COTI) and Joshua Maddox (Chief Ecosystems and Partnerships Officer of COTI) have also joined the council, reinforcing the company’s commitment to fostering blockchain adoption in Africa. Global Events and Strategic Collaborations The Africa Tokenization Council is set to host a series of strategic symposiums and roundtables aimed at connecting African governments with blockchain initiatives, global investors, and industry experts. These events will bring together diverse stakeholders, including: Blockchain practitioners dedicated to driving tokenization efforts for economic expansion. Government officials and regulatory bodies exploring blockchain’s potential in governance and finance. Investors (both local and international) seeking opportunities in Africa’s tokenized asset space. Technical developers and blockchain experts who will contribute to the infrastructure supporting tokenization projects. Market distribution partners to facilitate the adoption of tokenized assets across various industries. The insights gained from these events will be critically analyzed and assessed for risks, ensuring that the council’s findings contribute to the development of strategic investment pathways and practical implementations of blockchain-based tokenization initiatives. COTI’s Role as a Core Infrastructure Provider COTI, a leading blockchain infrastructure provider, will play a crucial role in the Africa Tokenization Council’s mission by leveraging its expertise in AI and blockchain. As the only provider offering “Privacy on Demand,” COTI ensures that privacy-compliant blockchain solutions are accessible, welcoming participation from other major blockchain providers and partners. COTI’s technology delivers a fast, scalable, and secure privacy layer for AI-driven and blockchain initiatives. Its permissioned privacy model enables secure on-chain data sharing while ensuring regulatory compliance—a major barrier that has traditionally slowed the adoption of RWAs on the blockchain. Addressing Privacy Concerns in Tokenization Tokenization involves moving real-world assets—including infrastructure, natural resources, and financial instruments—onto blockchain networks. Despite its potential, institutions have been hesitant to adopt blockchain without comprehensive privacy protections. Public blockchains’ transparency presents compliance challenges for corporations that must safeguard sensitive user data. COTI addresses this challenge by providing permissioned privacy , ensuring that relevant authorities can access compliance and reporting data without exposing confidential information. This feature makes blockchain adoption feasible for enterprises and governments seeking to tokenize large-scale assets. Scaling Tokenization for National Economies The Africa Tokenization Council aims to facilitate tokenization at the national infrastructure level. By leveraging blockchain’s transparency and efficiency, the council envisions large-scale projects that will drive economic growth across Africa and the Middle East. COTI’s robust infrastructure will serve as a foundational pillar for these initiatives, positioning itself as a key enabler of blockchain-driven economic transformation.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-06 15:34:21

So far, the cryptocurrency market has gone from shedding tens, even hundreds of billions of dollars in value to adding similar amounts on almost a daily basis as the Trump administration brings instability with its trade war or hope with its promises of a strategic BTC reserve. Howard Lutnick, the billionaire Secretary of Commerce, may have revealed the next major catalyst for Bitcoin – due as soon as March 7. Why Bitcoin is set for a strong rally This Friday, the White House is set to host a digital assets conference – an event likely to be a market catalyst in its own right – and Lutnick hinted that it will feature a major announcement regarding the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Despite appearing exceptionally bullish at face value, the situation may constitute a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ event. The hope that the reserve order would finally come has triggered a BTC rally, leading to its press time price of $91,268. The strength of this upsurge, however, hasn’t been entirely decisive, and investors have shown their lack of certainty with the initial rise petering out just above $92,000, a correction toward $88,000, and, finally, another soaring to the aforementioned value. BTC one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Another indication that the chances for a breakthrough are low came in late February when Senator Cynthia Lummis – a well-known proponent of Bitcoin – opined that the federal government is unlikely to begin stockpiling cryptocurrency for a long time and that the first developments would probably come from individual states. Will Bitcoin soar or crash this weekend? Still, BTC’s recent fluctuations indicate that the coin is likely to see its value explode should there be any announcements on Friday before entering a period of extraordinary volatility. The subsequent direction will likely depend on the specifics of the announcements and any additional moves made by the government regarding the economy. Indeed, whatever the actualities prove, it is almost guaranteed that the coming days – and the weekend with its lower volume – will provide both buying and selling opportunities for those willing to be described as ‘losers’ by Robert Kiyosaki . Is going long on BTC still the best bet? Holding long-term, on the other hand, might be the winning strategy no matter the prevailing turbulence. History shows that Bitcoin is not likely to have plateaued in the current cycle. Considering the latest halving took place in April 2024, the top is expected later in 2025, meaning that a new high should come within a few months. This is reinforced by BTC’s resilience to stay relatively decisively above $80,000 and, more recently, above $82,000 despite the tumult. On the other hand, the coin’s failure to sustainably breach $92,000, even when supported by significant upward momentum, does leave room for caution.

Table of Contents Musk fires again Legal dispute highlights broader questions OpenAI bets big on premium AI agents Musk fires again Elon Musk ’s legal battle against OpenAI has entered a new phase after a U.S. judge denied his request for an immediate injunction to halt the company’s transition into a for-profit entity. While the ruling allows OpenAI to continue operating under its current structure, the case is far from over, with the court granting a fast-tracked trial set for the fall of 2025. Musk’s lawsuit, filed earlier this year, accuses OpenAI of abandoning its original mission to develop artificial intelligence for public benefit in favor of private investors. OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, have rejected Musk’s allegations, arguing instead that transitioning to a for-profit model is necessary to raise the substantial capital required to compete effectively in the costly AI industry. The company also insists Musk’s lawsuit is driven primarily by competitive motivations rather than genuine ethical concerns. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Musk’s evidence — primarily internal emails — failed to meet the legal threshold for an injunction. However, she acknowledged that the case raises important legal questions regarding OpenAI’s transition. “Given the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred, the court is prepared to expedite trial to the fall of 2025 solely on that claim and potentially the interrelated contract-based claims,” she wrote. The ruling comes amid high-stakes financial maneuvering. Recently, Altman outright rejected a $97.4 billion takeover bid from Musk and his associates, responding with a blunt “no thank you.” no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want — Sam Altman (@sama) February 10, 2025 Meanwhile, reports indicate that SoftBank is in talks to lead a $40 billion investment round that could push OpenAI’s post-money valuation to $300 billion — dwarfing the $75 billion valuation that Musk’s rival AI startup, xAI, is reportedly seeking. Despite the setback, Musk’s legal team remains optimistic. “We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk’s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public’s benefit rather than his own enrichment,” said Marc Toberoff, Musk’s attorney. Legal dispute highlights broader questions Musk’s lawsuit raises deeper questions about who controls artificial intelligence and whether companies that start as nonprofits can legally shift to for-profit models. Musk claims that OpenAI’s transition from a nonprofit to a “capped-profit” model — and now to a structure with no profit limitations — constitutes a violation of its original mission. When OpenAI launched in 2015, Musk was one of its largest donors, contributing millions of dollars to support its nonprofit vision. The goal was to develop AI for the public good, avoiding the kind of profit-driven motives that could lead to reckless commercialization. However, in 2018, Musk left OpenAI after the board rejected his proposal to fold the company’s for-profit division into Tesla. Since then, OpenAI has increasingly relied on external investors, including a reported $13 billion from Microsoft, cementing its shift into the private sector. OpenAI has framed the lawsuit as an attempt to stifle competition, noting that Musk only began criticizing its structure after launching his own AI startup, xAI. The company has also pointed to Musk’s past emails, which show he once explored merging OpenAI’s for-profit arm into Tesla. “That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests,” OpenAI told Business Insider. Beyond the lawsuit, the case reflects the increasing costs of AI development. Training advanced models like GPT-4 costs hundreds of billions of dollars, making nonprofit funding models difficult to sustain. OpenAI bets big on premium AI agents Amid its legal battle with Musk, OpenAI continues its for-profit expansion, developing AI agents for software development, research, and professional services, with pricing ranging from $2,000 to $20,000 per month. According to The Information, OpenAI’s upcoming AI agents will be tailored to different market segments based on complexity and capability. The first tier targets “high-income knowledge workers,” offering advanced analytical tools at $2,000 per month. A more advanced version, designed for software developers, provides automated coding support and debugging assistance at a monthly cost of $10,000. At the highest tier, OpenAI is reportedly working on an AI agent capable of conducting “PhD-level research,” with an industry-leading price tag of $20,000 per month. While the exact launch timeline remains uncertain, OpenAI’s investor SoftBank has reportedly committed $3 billion to the AI agent initiative this year alone, underscoring confidence in its profitability. Beyond AI agents, OpenAI has also introduced Deep Research, an AI tool designed to synthesize vast amounts of information into research-level reports. Meanwhile, the company has rolled out GPT-4.5 to ChatGPT Pro subscribers, describing it as its most advanced language model yet. Today we’re releasing a research preview of GPT-4.5—our largest and best model for chat yet.

However, its increased size has made it more expensive to operate, with OpenAI adjusting API pricing to $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens. Despite these advancements, GPT-4.5 has not outperformed all rivals.

XRP Shows Potential Upside as Bulls Regain Momentum XRP is currently trading between $2.26 and $3.32. In the past week, its price has increased by 5.86%, signaling a possible resurgence of bullish momentum. Over the last six months, XRP has seen substantial growth of 350.33%, although it experienced a slight decline of 4.78% over the past month. The recent price movement suggests that bulls may be gaining strength after a period of consolidation. Technical indicators show potential for further growth. The Relative Strength Index is at 51.80, indicating neutral momentum. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.007322, suggesting an upward trend. If XRP breaks through the nearest resistance level at $3.70, it could rise by approximately 50% from the current price of around $2.46. Further upward movement could see it reach the second resistance at $4.76, representing a potential gain of around 93%. However, the nearest support level is at $1.58, which could act as a base if prices pull back. Cardano (ADA) Gains Over 38% in a Week, Eyes Higher Resistance Levels Cardano (ADA) has seen significant price movement recently. In the past week, its price increased by over 38%, moving within a range of $0.76 to $1.33. The 10-day simple moving average is at $0.94, higher than the 100-day average of $0.84. This suggests a positive short-term trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57.19, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. If the upward trend continues, ADA may test the nearest resistance level at $1.53, which could represent an increase of up to 30% from current prices. Breaking through this resistance might open the path to the second resistance level at $2.10, implying a potential gain of about 57%. However, if the price declines, the nearest support level is at $0.38, where buyers might step in. Conclusion While XRP and ADA perform well, XYZVerse’s unique sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, blending meme culture with sports to become a cultural icon.

American taxpayers have missed out on $17 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC ) profits since 2013 due to a walled garden investment strategy adopted by previous administrations, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks opined via X. Sacks shared a Federal Government Bitcoin Sales Analysis, generated by Elon Musk-backed Grok AI, in what appears to be another hint of a potential U.S. crypto reserve under President Donald Trump. The U.S. government began seizing Bitcoin in 2013, with the FBI’s confiscation of 11 BTC marking the first recorded instance of an American agency taking control of the asset. Public records indicate that the Bitcoin was seized from a bad actor attempting to buy illegal drugs. Since then, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have confiscated approximately 195,000 BTC. Data shows that the U.S. government sold Bitcoin 11 times over the past 12 years, with 173,000 BTC liquidated by November 2015 in four major sales over three years. You might also like: Is Trump’s crypto strategic reserve just a front to pump WLFI and his own bags? That cache alone would be worth over $15 billion as BTC cost $89,800 per token on March 6. “If the government had held the Bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today,” Sack said, implying the government paper-handed crypto wealth. A paper-hand investor is one who sold an asset early and missed its biggest price run. Authorities have 207,000 BTC left in public coffers, which could transition into a national stockpile or form the foundation for a U.S. crypto reserve. President Trump’s January Executive Order directed his crypto cabinet and regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop BTC reserve legislation, bolstering industry hopes. Further remarks from Trump about mixing BTC with altcoins in a reserve split a divide among his crypto and tech-heavy Silicon Valley supporters. Still, Trump will presumably announce a BTC reserve strategy at the first White Crypto Summit on March 7. The asset revisited $90,000 price levels ahead of the event as market volatility swayed spot prices. Over the past decade, the federal government sold approximately 195,000 bitcoin for proceeds of $366 million. If the government had held the bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today. That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy. — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 6, 2025 Read more: News Trump to announce Bitcoin reserve strategy at White House Crypto Summit: report",News|Bitcoin|Crypto assets|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-06 15:37:53

This came as a shock to many investors who watched the Shiba Inu price drop from 0.00003206 to $0.00001305. While this happens, Panshibi (SHIBI) , a panda-themed meme coin, is stealing the spotlight with its presale ranking in global attention. After over $1.2 million raised, $SHIBI’s token price sits at $0.005 in stage 4 out of 15 stages. With a promised 1,200% surge during presale and whispers of bigger gains after launch, investors are flocking in. While the Shiba Inu price struggles, Panshibi’s staking rewards and Asian hype make it a hot pick. Is this the next big crypto wave? Let’s find out. Shib Suffers Another Bearish Pressure as it Dips 57% Shiba Inu (SHIB) is under bearish pressure as a result of the Shiba Inu price crash. The price simply went from a December 2024 high of $0.00003206 to a low of $0.00001305 by March 2025. This decline has left investors rattled. Also market factors like a 91% drop in token burn rate with only 2.6 million removed from circulation continue to weigh heavily on this sentiment. Moreover, President Trump announced a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. In this reserve he named Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano as key assets. This sparked a brief rally, with Bitcoin jumping 11% to $94,164 and Cardano soaring over 50% . Yet, the Shiba Inu price barely budged, missing out on the pump that lifted other coins. While named coins saw sharp gains, meme tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, not included in the reserve, only rode a fleeting wave of hype. SHIB rose just 3.5% in 24 hours before slipping back. Posts on X note the excitement has faded fast, with Bitcoin sliding back to $86,292 by March 3 and the Shiba Inu price stuck near critical support at $0.000013. Also, analysts point to a death cross on SHIB’s charts and the reduction of the burn rate as signs of deeper trouble. Though Trump’s reserve plan fueled hope of U.S. crypto leadership, its effects are waning amid broader market volatility and tariff threats. For SHIB holders, the lack of a direct boost from the reserve has left the Shiba Inu price vulnerable as competitors steal the spotlight. 1200% Potential Returns Attract Global Investors to Panshibi Presale Panshibi, a fresh crypto project uniting Asia, pandas, and meme coin fans, is grabbing global attention with its presale. This presale promises a huge 1,200% return which is set to happen during its presale alone. With its native token $SHIBI, inspired by the adorable panda, Panshibi also offers staking rewards up to 1,200% APY and exclusive access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club for presale buyers. As of March 5, 2025, the presale which is capped at $10 million has less than 20 days left with a token price of $0.005. Still in its 4th stage, investors are waiting to see what happens in the 15th stage after the 1,200% increase. In addition, $SHIBI will list at a price of $0.026 which offers early adopters huge profits. Moreover, experts forecast a mind-blowing 145,000% surge post-launch, drawing investors away from coins like Shiba Inu as the Shiba Inu price continues to falter. Also, the meme coin market, valued at $115 billion in January 2025 per CoinGecko, now makes up 10% of all crypto. Panshibi simply taps into this appeal with its solid setup and roadmap to the top. As 60% of its 2 billion token fuels the presale, early adopters have enough opportunity to be part of history. Also, at the end of the presale, unsold tokens will be burned to boost scarcity. Plus, liquidity pools will be locked for 10 years after listing on Uniswap and top decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Conclusion With a solid roadmap to the top, most investors can tell that Panshibi is destined for greatness. While the Shiba Inu price struggles with bearish trends, Panshibi’s 15-stage presale is creating a bullish sentiment among investors who love stability and growth. No wonder investors globally are jumping in, as they trust $SHIBI to outshine fading stars like Shiba Inu.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. CoinCodex predicts PEPE could rally to $0.000033, but Rollblock may see a 1000x surge in a bull run. Table of Contents Rollblock has beaten PEPE hands down PEPE price negates all its yearly gains PEPE price prediction 2025 Investors are piling into RBLK According to CoinCodex PEPE price prediction, the meme coin might pull an explosive rally to above $0.000033. However, that’s minuscule when tossed against the new casino kingpin Rollblock (RBLK) , which might pull a 1000x multiplier once launched in a bull run. Let’s discover why crypto pundits have handpicked RBLK as the best crypto to buy right now in the market ahead of PEPE. Rollblock has beaten PEPE hands down While the PEPE price has collapsed over 70% from its recent ATH, RBLK is up 500% in presale! As investors lose their appetites for meme coins in favor of utility tokens, analysts expect this iGaming token to continue crashing PEPE with another 380% presale increase, followed by a stratospheric post-launch explosion. Rollbock’s journey to a 1000x blast seems clear cut thanks to its executive revenue sharing model, deflationary tokenomics, and huge market potential in the half-trillion gambling industry. The Ethereum-based GambleFi protocol supports a massive token buyback program from a share of its weekly gross gaming revenues. 40% of the tokens are allocated for staking rewards, with RBLK holders earning up to 30% APY for providing liquidity in the platform. The remaining 60% are sent to a dead wallet address, deleting them out of supply. This helps diminish the 1 billion RBLK supply over time, pumping up its market value to generate extra profits for investors. These lucrative passive income benefits make RBLK the best crypto to buy for investors seeking stable yields and have drawn serious attention from PEPE whales who have been suffering losses for months. The deal turns sizzling hot if you consider RBLK’s growth trajectory in the $540 billion gambling empire. Disrupting this market with an AI-driven casino ecosystem and blockchain-powered fair gaming technology positions Rollblock to cut a hefty share of this massive pie. Taking even 2% of the market suffices to roll the platform’s market cap past $10 billion, sparking a gigantic price surge for RBLK. PEPE price negates all its yearly gains The Pepe price pulled an impressive run in Q4 last year, hitting a new ATH above $0.000028 in December. The bullish wave triggered a wild profit-taking spree, forcing the PEPE coin into a bearish run. PEPE has been descending sharply for nearly 13 weeks in a row. In the past month, the frog-themed meme coin lost over 22%, pushing its year-to-date losses past 8%. This disheartening price performance comes amid collapsing demand for PEPE. Quoting Santiment data, FXstreet reveals that PEPE’s Daily Active Addresses have fallen sharply from over 7,000 in early Feb to about 3,600, with the meme coin’s trading volume crumbling from more than 3 billion to below 1 billion within the same timeframe. PEPE price prediction 2025 Though the PEPE price is currently stuck in a bearish pattern below its 50-day EMA, the meme coin is approaching a critical monthly zone where it shot up from toward the end of last year. The PEPE community sentiment stands at 87% bullish, with CoinCodex Pepe price prediction painting a bullish outlook. According to the data, PEPE could rotate back up from here and register a more than 380% upsurge to a new ATH above $0.000033. If this support zone breaks, PEPE might extend its bearish run toward 2023 lows, prompting an increasing number of meme coin whales to shift focus to utility tokens with clearer outlooks. Investors are piling into RBLK Looking at Rollbock’s prospects, it’s easy to see why the brightest crypto minds are praising RBLK as the best crypto to buy in the market. To date, crypto whales have pumped over $10.8 million into the Rollblock presale, and tokens are selling fast at $0.06 in stage 10. For more information on Rollblock, visit the website or socials .

After initially rising to $2.98 on February 28, the token has crashed to $1.8, mirroring the price action of other altcoins. Pi coin’s future is still uncertain, but the odds are that it will perform as other altcoins do, where it follows Bitcoin’s price action. This article explores how high the value of Pi will get if Bitcoin price hits $200k. Pi Network Price Pi Network Price Would Rise if Bitcoin Jumps to $200k Bitcoin price has done well since its inception in 2009. In this period, it has jumped from less than $1 to $90,000 today. With its fundamentals improving, there are chances that it will surge to $200,000 over time. It needs to rise by 122% to get to that level, an achievable scenario since it has risen by 220% since September 2023. These fundamentals are the rising demand and falling supply. Bitcoin demand has jumped in the past few years, as evidenced by the growing assets in spot ETFs These funds have added over $40 billion in about 15 months, and the trend will continue. BTC demand will rise if the US successfully launches Strategic Bitcoin Reserves . Such a move will likely push more countries and companies to acquire Bitcoins for their reserves. This demand is rising at a time when Bitcoin mining difficulty has jumped, making them rare. A Bitcoin price surge to $200K would lead to more gains among altcoins, including Pi Network, which has become a highly popular coin. Historically, altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Litecoin thrive when Bitcoin price rises. Pi Coin Price Outlook if BTC Hits $200K Pi Network would likely outperform Bitcoin if it surged to $200,000 because of the potential catalysts. First, there is a likelihood that Pi coin will receive numerous exchange listings like Binance, Coinbase, and Upbit. Such a move would make it available to millions of customers. In most cases, cryptocurrencies do well when they are listed by tier-1 exchanges. Second, there is a likelihood that one or more companies will file for a spot Pi ETF, a move that would boost its price. Also, as a Made in USA cryptocurrency with substantial utility, there is a likelihood that it will be added in strategic crypto reserves. Bitcoin trades at $90,000, meaning that it needs to rise by 122% to get to $200,000. If Pi Network price does the same, it means that it will get to almost $4. And since Pi coin will likely have more gains than Bitcoin, meaning that a jump to $5 is a possibility. In the long-term, there is a likelihood that Pi coin price will hit $100 .

But as the tides shift, some big names are beginning to lose steam, and Pepecoin price is proving to be a prime example. PEPE, once a dominant force in the meme coin world, is now facing massive sell-offs, dwindling trading volume, and waning investor interest. Meanwhile, new and promising projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) are emerging with stronger fundamentals, bigger growth potential, and community-driven innovation. The question is no longer about whether PEPE can recover, but rather, which new meme coin will take its place? Pepecoin Price Struggles Show No Signs of Slowing Down Pepecoin price continues its freefall, currently trading at $0.0000070. Technical indicators and on-chain data paint a bleak picture for the frog-based meme coin, signaling further declines ahead. One major red flag is PEPE’s break below its ascending trendline, a crucial support level that had held since mid-April. After retesting the trendline and failing to regain momentum, PEPE plunged another 18.12% on Monday, confirming a downward trajectory. With its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 33, dangerously close to oversold territory, it appears that sellers still have the upper hand. Adding to the bearish sentiment is a sharp decline in network activity. Daily active addresses for PEPE have collapsed from 7,319 in early February to just 3,611, reflecting a loss of user engagement. Trading volume tells a similar story, plummeting from 3.18 billion to 1.01 billion over the same period. When liquidity dries up and fewer people interact with a token, prices typically struggle to recover. If this trend continues, analysts predict Pepecoin price could see another 16% drop, revisiting August lows of $0.0000058 . The question on investors’ minds: is it time to cut losses and look elsewhere? Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Meme Coin Primed for 2025’s Biggest Gains While PEPE grapples with losses, Panshibi ($SHIBI) is stealing the spotlight as the next big thing in meme coins. But what makes this project stand out? Simply put: it’s a game-changer. Panshibi is more than just another meme token , it’s a full-fledged ecosystem merging three powerful communities: Asia, panda lovers, and meme coin enthusiasts. Built on a strong foundation of AI and SocialFi, Panshibi doesn’t just promise gains, it offers real utility. Holders of $SHIBI can stake their tokens for an eye-watering 1,200% APY and gain VIP access to the exclusive Bamboo Private Club. The viral meme coin presale is where things get interesting. With a hard cap of $10 million, Panshibi is already attracting massive attention from early investors. The structured presale model ensures the price of $SHIBI increases with each stage, meaning early adopters stand to benefit the most. In fact, projections estimate a 1,200% price increase before launch, followed by an astronomical 145,000% surge once the token hits major exchanges. Security is also a top priority. Panshibi’s smart contract has undergone a full audit by blockchain security firm Coinsult, with no issues found. Additionally, the liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years, and the development team’s tokens will remain untouchable for two years, a clear sign of commitment to long-term sustainability. With its listing confirmed on Uniswap and multiple centralized exchanges and only 1.2 billion tokens available during viral meme coin presale, demand is expected to soar. Unlike Pepecoin price, which struggles to maintain momentum, Panshibi is riding a wave of bullish enthusiasm. Is It Time to Ditch PEPE for SHIBI? Meme coins are notorious for their volatility, but the key to success in this market is recognizing when a project’s hype is dying and when another is just getting started. Pepecoin price continues to decline, with trading volume and active users plummeting, an indication that investors are losing interest. Meanwhile, Panshibi is generating serious buzz with its innovative approach, strong staking rewards, and a structured viral meme coin presale that practically guarantees gains for early buyers. The choice for meme coin investors is becoming increasingly clear. While PEPE fades, Panshibi is preparing for liftoff. For those looking to catch the next big wave, $SHIBI might just be the best bet of 2025. The real question is: Will you get in early or watch from the sidelines as it skyrockets?

The decline sees the flagship cryptocurrency retreat back below $90,000, down over 1% during the current session. Despite the decline, BTC remains marginally up over the past 24 hours. However, a decline below $90,000 could see the price drop towards $85,000 or lower. Donald Trump Delays Canada, Mexico Auto Tariffs Bitcoin (BTC) went past $90,000 earlier today after President Donald Trump announced he was delaying tariffs on Canadian and Mexican auto imports. The decision grants a one-month exemption for automakers, easing concerns a trade war could damage domestic manufacturing. The decision came after Trump met with Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis executives. Investors were also happy with the delay, indicating that tariffs may not cause as much economic upheaval as previously expected. BTC is trading just below the $90,000 level after declining during the current session. However, crypto-related stocks have registered substantial gains, with Coinbase (COIN) up 4% while Strategy (MSTR) jumped 12%. However, interest in Bitcoin futures is at its lowest since October 2024, indicating that traders remain cautious. Blockchain analytics firm Sentiment has noted that the Bitcoin network continues to grow, with smaller wallets registering a substantial increase. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Likely To Contain Mostly Bitcoin: Bitwise Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes President Trump’s planned crypto reserve will be made up almost entirely of Bitcoin, despite the inclusion of other cryptocurrencies. Hougan stated in a March 5 market note, “Market participants have soured on the announcement because the proposed reserve holds more than Bitcoin. The inclusion of small-cap assets in the announcement unnecessarily complicated matters.” Trump had initially stated the reserve would include SOL, ADA, and XRP, causing confusion in the crypto community. He later clarified BTC and ETH would be at the heart of the reserve. Hougan added, “After the dust settles, I suspect the final reserve will be nearly entirely Bitcoin, and it will be larger than people think.” BTC rallied after its inclusion in the reserve but lost momentum the following day, recovering after Trump announced he was delaying auto tariffs on Canada and Mexico. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has fallen into the red during the ongoing session, down over 1%. “The inclusion of speculative assets like Cardano feels more calculating than strategic. Despite the flawed rollout, he thinks the market is misreading things.” Mt.Gox Transfers 12,000 BTC To New Wallet Defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt.Gox has transferred over 12,000 BTC worth over $1.2 billion to a new wallet. The transfer is one of the largest transactions by the exchange since its bankruptcy in 2014. Such transfers are generally a consolidation of holdings to new addresses before they are sent to a crypto exchange and sold on the open market. Mt.Gox was one of the biggest exchanges in the market before its unraveling, handling over 70% of all BTC transactions. A major hack decimated the exchange as it lost over 740,000 BTC , valued at over $15 billion at current prices. Mt.Gox trustees have put together a repayment plan with a deadline of October 31, 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) faces volatility during the ongoing session as it struggles to hold on to the $90,000 price level. BTC had risen to $92,910 as markets anticipated the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, scheduled for March 7. However, profit-taking saw the price decline and settle closer to $90,000. BTC registered a substantial rally on Sunday but lost momentum as traders were rattled by a fresh round of tariffs and the prospect of a trade war with China. Singapore-based QCP Capital stated, “Investors view this as an asymmetric event with high stakes. Will it serve as the unexpected catalyst that sends prices soaring, or will it explore crypto’s fragility and trigger a deeper selloff? Lens out. Corporate bond spreads are widening, with high-yield spreads now sitting at 290 bps above Treasuries, while the investment-grade vs. high-yield spread stands at 200 bps. While this isn’t signaling panic, it's a trend worth monitoring closely.” BTC traded in the red for most of last week, declining nearly 5% on Monday and slipping below $90,000 on Tuesday to an intraday low of $85,984. It recovered from this level but could not reclaim $90,000, ultimately settling at $88,657. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell over 5% to $84,129. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Thursday, rising to an intraday high of $87,045 before settling at $84,656, ultimately registering a marginal increase. However, the price was back in the red on Friday as it plunged below $80,000, falling to an intraday low of $78,173. It recovered from this level to reclaim $80,000, ultimately settling at $84,362. Source: TradingView Sentiment changed on Saturday as BTC registered an increase of over 2% and settled at $86,182. Bullish sentiment intensified on Friday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC surged over 9% to reclaim $90,000 and go past the 20-day SMA to settle at $94,322. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping nearly 9% to give up Sunday’s gains and settle at $86,225. BTC fell to an intraday low of $81,500 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. It recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.27% and settle at $87,316. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose nearly 4% to reclaim $90,000 and settle at $90,369. The current session sees BTC marginally up as it faces volatility and struggles to remain above $90,000. The RSI sits under the neutral zone while the MACD has turned bearish, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Yet a recent post on X by a crypto analyst hints that XRP may be on the verge of a historic breakout. According to Dom the analyst, XRP is testing a resistance level against ETH that, when broken in the past, has triggered rallies of at least 160%. If history repeats itself, some speculate XRP could surge above ETH in total market value. This scenario is adding fuel to the growing excitement around XRPTurbo , the first AI Agent Launchpad to debut on the Ripple blockchain. Could XRP Overtake ETH? Dom’s analysis suggests that XRP is at a pivotal resistance level versus Ethereum—one it has never broken without a major spike afterwards. The last time XRP turned this resistance into support was in March 2020, and the market rewarded that flip with a substantial rally. Dom posits that if XRP clears this barrier convincingly, it might outperform ETH to such an extent that it closes the gap in market capitalization—a potential game-changer for holders. Given the optimistic forecast, traders and whales alike are eyeing not just XRP, but also new projects within the Ripple ecosystem, hoping to catch the next big wave. Enter XRPTurbo. Introducing XRPTurbo—The First AI Agent Launchpad on Ripple XRPTurbo is the newest gem on the XRP Ledger, designed to harness XRP’s speed, scalability, and ultra-low transaction costs for AI-driven automation and Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization.

Automated Trading – Manage trades with algorithmic precision. Real-Time Data Retrieval – Fetch critical market info in seconds. Social Media Automation – Grow projects and communities seamlessly. These features aim to supercharge DeFi on XRP by making it more efficient, cost-effective, and inclusive. XRPTurbo ’s AI Agent Launchpad sets it apart in an industry often flooded with hype, but short on tangible utility. [Join Xrpturbo Presale] The Utility of $XRT At the heart of XRPTurbo lies $XRT , a token with a fixed supply of 100 million.

FOMO Setting In With XRP perched on the edge of a possible historic rally, market sentiment suggests a pivotal moment is near.

Meanwhile, Panshibi is soaring in its ongoing presale, positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now. With shifting trends in the market, traders are evaluating whether ADA and SOL will maintain their momentum or if newer alternatives like Panshibi offer better long-term potential. Panshibi’s Panda Theme Captivates Asia, Driving Global Interest Panshibi is turning heads in the crypto world, with experts calling it a must-buy. While many meme coins struggle to stay relevant, $SHIBI is building real value by blending community engagement with smart incentives. Its presale is already seeing heavy demand as investors rush to secure tokens before prices climb. Unlike other projects with unclear roadmaps, Panshibi has set timelines and a structured launch plan. The presale lasts only 60 days, and the token will hit major exchanges soon after. This eliminates the uncertainty that comes with endless fundraising rounds. Security and trust are major concerns in crypto, but Panshibi has taken steps to protect investors. A top-tier audit has confirmed the safety of its smart contract, while the liquidity pool is locked for 10 years. This ensures a stable market without sudden price crashes caused by early exits. More than just another meme coin, Panshibi stands out with its panda theme. Its growing popularity in Asia attracts global interest, making it one of the most talked-about projects right now. With presale spots filling fast, $SHIBI could be one of the biggest opportunities of the year. Cardano’s Volatility Exposed: From $1.19 High to 29.6% Drop in 48 Hours The recent announcement of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve caused a quick market boom. Initially, ADA's price surged by 78%, reaching $1.19, accompanied by a 1,700% increase in trading volume. However, less than 48 hours after, ADA went into freefall, losing as much as 29.6%. Whales and short traders offloaded approximately $147 million worth of ADA. While President Trump may endorse ADA, the US government has yet to lend legitimacy to Cardano. Critics argue that the inclusion of altcoins like Cardano in the reserve may be premature, considering its inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Investors should remain vigilant as active ADA addresses dropped from 70,000 to 33,000 before the event. Solana Price Dips to $140 Following Mass Selloff After reaching a high of $180 on March 3, SOL's price sharply declined by 27% to $132, before stabilizing around $140. Additionally, the recent crash of memecoins led to an exodus of approximately $1 billion from Solana's network within a week, accompanied by a nearly 60% drop in daily active users. Moreover, the global crypto market remains volatile despite developments hinting at Solana's long-term potential. While the Solana price surge may have been influenced by President Trump’s announcement , its immediate fall proves premature. The Libra coin issuance scandal has triggered a ""bleeding"" crisis for Solana, resulting in liquidity loss and market fear. Conclusion With less than 20 days to go, investors are trooping into Panshibi’s presale. So far, over $1.2 million has been raised in the presale and with Stage 4 of the 15-stage presale currently live, significant growth potential remains for SHIBI.

Bitcoin surged from $85,000 to $95,000 before retracing those gains as skepticism crept in. Market participants seemed unsettled not by the concept of a reserve itself but by the inclusion of non-Bitcoin assets, particularly those perceived as more speculative. This reaction, according to Bitwise Investment Chief Matt Hougan, is shortsighted. “Market Is Overthinking Things” In the latest memo , Hougan claimed that the market is “overthinking” the recent announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve and has missed the broader bullish implications. Despite imperfections in the rollout, he argued that the fundamental takeaway is clear – the US government has officially recognized crypto as a strategic asset. In the long run, Hougan believes that this could trigger a significant shift in global monetary policy and institutional investment trends. Hougan highlighted three key factors the market is missing. First, he pointed out that Trump’s proposals often evolve before reaching their final form. The White House’s upcoming Crypto Summit is also likely to serve as a forum for industry leaders to push for adjustments, an event that is expected to refine the reserve to focus more on Bitcoin potentially. If anything, Hougan believes that the “boldness” of the original proposal expands the Overton window making a Bitcoin-only reserve seem like a reasonable compromise rather than an extreme position. Rather than dismissing the initiative due to its flaws, the Bitwise exec asserted that investors should recognize its potential to reshape the regulatory landscape in favor of digital assets. Second, Hougan went on to highlight the geopolitical impacts of the US taking the lead in declaring crypto a strategic reserve asset. Whether or not the final proposal includes a mix of cryptocurrencies, the simple act of legitimizing state-held Bitcoin will likely prompt other nations to follow suit. Countries that have dabbled in Bitcoin acquisition – such as El Salvador and Bhutan – will no longer seem like outliers but early movers in a global trend. If the US makes a significant crypto purchase, other governments, particularly those in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia, may feel pressure to do the same. A global arms race for Bitcoin accumulation could ensue, reinforcing its position as digital gold. Finally, Hougan dismissed concerns that future political shifts could lead to the liquidation of the reserve. He explained that the “asymmetric passion” for crypto in the US suggests that once the government acquires Bitcoin, it will be reluctant to sell. Unlike volatile short-term policies, strategic reserves tend to continue across administrations. Just as the US still holds significant gold reserves, a national crypto reserve could become a long-term fixture. Eyes on Friday All eyes are on the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on Friday, which may serve as the starting point for a US strategic crypto reserve. The event will bring together industry leaders and members of President Trump’s crypto task force. Scheduled for March 7th, the summit will be led by David Sacks, Trump’s top advisor on AI and crypto. In a statement to The Pavlovic Today, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that Bitcoin would receive special treatment compared to the other cryptocurrencies mentioned in Trump’s announcement. He noted that Trump had consistently expressed interest in a Bitcoin reserve and hinted that Friday’s event could mark its official rollout. Regarding other cryptocurrencies, Lutnick suggested they would be handled differently from Bitcoin but still positively. Further details will be unveiled at the summit.

However, despite its growing market presence, PEPE has faced price volatility, raising questions about its long-term potential. Analysts are now debating whether PEPE can reach a $50 billion market cap in 2025. Meanwhile, another cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS) , is emerging as a competitor, offering a unique approach through real-world asset tokenization. Pepe Coin’s Market Performance and 2025 Outlook Pepe Coin will be sold at $0.000009917 and its market value will be 4.35 billion dollars. The performance of this coin has been poor in the last one day and has dropped by 3.90% and the trading volume is $43 million. In the last couple of months mainly due to the memecoins’ nature, PEPE has demonstrated explosive movements followed by significant pullbacks. The volume of support for PEPE is at $0.00989 and that of the resistance at $0.010312. In case the price moves higher and above the resistance level, then the analysts are expecting the price to rise towards $0.0144, which is an implication of 39.96% higher price increase from the existing price level. Nonetheless, a bearish break below support might bring the Felix Gray project lower down, and suspicion arises in terms of sustainability. Some of the technical indicators are relatively bearish while others have mixed signals. The RSI is at 43.58 thus indicating that the stock has neutral momentum. However, the MACD line is below the signal line at the same period, which suggest that the price is in a short- term decline. If these indicators change to a bullish crossover, the values of PEPE may experience a new round of increase. For PEPE to become a $50bn company, it indicates that the company needs to grow by more than 1000 percentage from the current valuation. Although there is always a possibility of doing this in a bull market, it will be predicated on the popular adoption, fast-growing user base and the ability to use it for purposes other than mere speculation. Rexas Finance (RXS) Gains Traction as an Alternative Investment Rexas Finance (RXS) is a rather promising blockchain project that is also associated with the tokenization of real-world assets and thus, offers the investors more than just the hope for a memeworthy cryptocurrency. In particular, RXS intends to turn real estate, commodities and other types of physical property into tokens in order to bring more stability and usefulness to the industry and those interested in its success rather than the next get-rich-quick scheme. RXS generates notable interest from investors because its presale stage now exceeds 46 million worth of investments. The specific demand indicates how RXS tokens can be used in the local market thereby differentiating from other crypto assets which rely mainly on price appreciation expectations. Certik’s successful audit phase improves overall credibility since it demonstrates to investors that both security mechanisms and smart contracts maintain high standards of protection. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1890173865122496515 An RXS presale was made at the cost of $0.20 and its full business launch was set to take place at $0.25 in June of 2025. In case of further unchanged asset tokenization growth, market analysts expect RXS tokens to rise from $0.20 to $1.00, or $1.50 during the first year of the latter’s release. This price predictability implies that tokenization of blockchain in traditional firms is logical as it enhances the fluidity of the assets in addition to making them more easily available. In contrast, Rexas Finance thematic is based on integrating traditional financial structures into the world of decentralized blockchain applications. While trading with institutional and retail investors shift to digital assets, the company could leverage the approach to be an important part of the decentralised finance industry – providing a reliable digital asset management platform to investors around the globe.

While both assets have maintained strong communities, new contenders are gaining attention. Panshibi (SHIBI) has seen increasing interest, particularly from Asian investors, sparking discussions about its growth potential. As global investors look for opportunities, the focus is turning to whether SHIBI can sustain its momentum or if TRX and DOGE will maintain their dominance. Panshibi Dominates The Meme Space With Real-World Utilities Panshibi is gaining massive traction as big buys from Asia continue to flood in. With an increasingly active community and a growing presence, $SHIBI is making waves in the meme coin space. The viral momentum behind this token is driven by both fun and real-world utility, making it a compelling choice for investors looking beyond just price speculation. The panda-themed token is supported by strong local demand, with major buys from whales driving prices higher. As the presale moves forward, early investors are already securing large amounts of $SHIBI, positioning themselves for significant future gains. Additionally, Panshibi’s ecosystem blends social-fi and meme-fi elements is attracting both entertainment enthusiasts and crypto investors. Users can engage in interactive challenges, earn rewards, and participate in a community-driven environment that fosters long-term involvement. Clearly, Panshibi’s appeal is resonating globally. Its Asian roots are providing the perfect launchpad for international growth. As the presale nears its final stages, $SHIBI is catching the eye of global investors, setting the stage for a breakout that could see it become a top contender in the meme coin market. Market Situation Causes Decline Concern for TRON Investors In March, TRX is forming a descending wedge pattern, accompanied by a looming death cross—a bearish signal suggesting further price declines. Analysts express concern that if TRX fails to maintain support at $0.22, it could drop to $0.18. Despite these warnings, some forecasts remain optimistic. Projections suggest that TRX could trade between $0.241 and $0.366 in the coming year, representing a potential increase of nearly 50%. Investors are advised to monitor the TRON crypto coin closely. Services like Cryptocurrency Alerting and Coinwink offer real-time TRX price alerts via various channels, enabling users to set custom thresholds and receive notifications when these are met. Dogecoin Falls To New Lows in Q1 Over the quarter, the active address count on the Dogecoin network dropped approximately 95%, to greater than 30,000 from greater than 1.2 million. The sharp drop in users signifies reduced usage and interest. Dogecoin's price has experienced unprecedented volatility. Following the robust surge towards the end of last year 2024, the Dogecoin price has fallen by 22% in the last 30 days, to trade currently at $0.20. The fall comes hand-in-hand with the fall in the network activity that presages future issues. Market analysts offer differing forecasts for DOGE. Some are calling for a gradual rise to about $0.263 by March 19, whereas other forecasts expect the token to rise to $1.72 within the next twelve months. But these positive projections might overlook the current decrease in the network usage and users' interest. Conclusion With TRON and Dogecoin grappling with market volatility, investors are flocking to Panshibi’s presale , where the SHIBI token is currently priced at just $0.005 in the fourth stage. As the price increases at each stage, now is the best time to secure early positions before the next price jump. Don’t miss out on the memecoin revolution!

Analysts predict Shiba Inu (SHIB) will increase 500% because analysts spot both technical indicators and rising enthusiasm for meme-based cryptocurrencies. The second stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale launches with a price of $0.015. The entire presale has accumulated $2.2 million from 4,200 investors. Planners expect the Token to reach $3.50 per unit after its exchange listing at a price of $0.06 while investors anticipate gaining 300% profits during this transition. The structured lending model and buy pressure mechanisms of MUTM establish it as a threat to shake up the market while SHIB encounters challenges. Price predictions about Shiba Inu. The current market activities show Shiba Inu maintains a volatile price structure. Studies of cup-and-handle patterns indicate SHIB will rise 12-fold to achieve a price of $0.000183. Such optimism clashes with on-chain data. The SHIB burn mechanism decreased its supply reduction rate by 11% during the past day. A significant problem exists in Shibarium layer-2 network as TVL has reached an all-time low making users abandon the network. Lack of network activity growth presents potential supply-demand problems that would prevent SHIB price from advancing. Technical indicators mirror uncertainty. The Relative Strength Index for SHIB maintains a value of 50 which indicates the price shows neither bullish nor bearish trends. The double-bottom formation indicates potential market recovery although $0.000014 stands as an unbroken barrier to price gains. If $0.00001316 resistance is broken then the price may face further decreases. The speculative hype behind SHIB makes the coin susceptible to risks despite irrational meme coin price hikes. Investors who are interested in stable returns now choose alternative opportunities. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) counters volatility with utility. Users in the decentralized platform can generate passive income through mtTokens by borrowing assets using their overcollateralized value. The autonomous ecosystem survives through the accumulation of interest which builds up on tokens throughout their lifespan. Phase 2 of the project presale shows strong uptake because it offers MUTM tokens for $0.015 which represents a 33% reduction from the upcoming phase rate of $0.02. The first investors who participate in the program will receive 300% returns from the market launch and professionals believe the value potential is even greater. The method of buying and distributing enables the platform to redirect profits into purchasing MUTM tokens that return value to its staking pool members. The perpetual demand formation through this mechanism protects the token from market sell-offs. The combination of the $100,000 value giveaway program for early investors together with the strategy drives quick adoption of the platform. More than 4,200 users have taken hold of MUTM because the protocol delivers Decentralized Finance services while offering strong potential growth. MUTM’s Path To Exponential Returns The tokenomics system of Mutuum Finance serves as its main attraction. Potential market appreciation starts with the presale price at $0.015 before lifting to $0.06 during the exchange listing period. The projections following the launch surpass standard conservative forecasts. The DeFi industry revealed its early-stage giants in recent times and experts forecast that MUTM could reach $3.50 value which represents a 23,233% increase from its starting point. Such massive growth would break records for meme coin rallies thus establishing MUTM as a chief market player. Phase 2’s limited inventory intensifies urgency. The fast sellout performance of phase one created such high demand that tokens from subsequent phases need to navigate intensified interest. Investors understand the time constraint because the Phase 3 entry price will increase 33% which will reduce profit opportunities. When MUTM launches its lending platform together with prominent exchange listings it will activate a surge of token demand through practical applications. Act Before Phase 2 Closes The time availability for affordable entry into Mutuum Finance is rapidly expiring. The ongoing presale delivers a minimum price that guarantees profit increases after the product launch. Additionally the late purchase of tokens will result in both increased costs combined with diminished return on investment. Homeowners can access Mutuum Finance’s official website to purchase tokens before Phase 2 reaches its termination. History favors the decisive.

Myth #1: “Investing in crypto is complicated and confusing.” The prospect of dealing with digital wallets, private keys and unregulated crypto exchanges has led many traditional investors to believe that investing in crypto is beyond them. However, the advent of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) in 2024 presents investors with a new avenue to access digital assets in a familiar investment vehicle. With crypto ETPs, investing in digital assets such as bitcoin has become as simple as buying shares of a stock. Investors can purchase bitcoin and ether ETPs through their regular brokerage accounts, just like any other security. This eliminates the need to set up and manage cryptocurrency wallets on an exchange, making crypto accessible to a wider audience. Moreover, these ETPs are regulated financial products, providing an additional layer of security for investors. While there is certainly a lot of truth behind the old crypto adage, “Not your keys, not your crypto,” the popularity of crypto ETPs proves that self-custody doesn’t have to be the only way to gain crypto exposure. Myth #2: “It’s too late to invest in bitcoin – I missed the run-up.” While bitcoin has seen substantial price appreciation, the idea that it’s “too late” to invest is misguided. In reality, bitcoin remains in the early stages of institutional and mainstream adoption, with significant potential for future growth. At approximately $1.7 trillion, bitcoin’s market capitalization is less than 9% of gold’s (~$19.4 trillion) and an even smaller fraction of the stock, bond and real estate markets. If bitcoin continues gaining traction as a store of value, medium of exchange or reserve asset, its market cap could expand significantly. Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply of 21 million makes it inherently scarce — 94% of all BTC has already been mined, and as much as 20% may be permanently lost. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s issuance rate, otherwise known as its “block rewards,” halves roughly every four years, meaning new supply is continually shrinking while demand grows, particularly from institutional investors. The launch of BTC exchange-traded products just over a year ago has shattered records, with cumulative inflows exceeding $35 billion — the fastest-growing ETP launch in history. These products provide institutions and retail investors alike with regulated, seamless access to bitcoin, accelerating mainstream adoption. The recent presidential change in the U.S. has ushered in a markedly more favorable stance on digital assets. Policies that once hindered adoption are being reevaluated, opening the door for broader institutional participation. On March 2, the administration announced it was moving forward on the creation of a crypto strategic reserve that would include five major coins — bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Additionally, 18 U.S. states are actively reviewing Bitcoin reserve adoption, while a total of 33 states are considering legislation to establish their own Bitcoin reserves. This underscores Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a legitimate financial asset. Another major shift is the recent repeal of SAB 121, which removes a key regulatory hurdle to crypto adoption by paving the way for banks to more easily custody bitcoin and digital assets. This could unlock significant institutional demand and further integrate bitcoin into the financial system. Bitcoin is still in the early innings of adoption. Its small market size relative to traditional assets, supply constraints, institutional momentum and evolving regulatory landscape all suggest that the opportunity to invest is far from over. While past price appreciation does not guarantee future returns, the narrative that bitcoin’s best days are behind it ignores the broader macroeconomic and institutional trends at play.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency investments are subject to various risks, including inability to develop digital asset applications or to capitalize on those applications, theft, loss, or destruction of cryptographic keys, the possibility that digital asset technologies may never be fully implemented, cybersecurity risk, conflicting intellectual property claims, and inconsistent and changing regulations. Speculative trading in bitcoins and other forms of cryptocurrencies, many of which have exhibited extreme price volatility, carries significant risk; an investor can lose the entire amount of their investment. Blockchain technology is a new and relatively untested technology and may never be implemented to a scale that provides identifiable benefits. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security, it may be deemed to violate federal securities laws. There may be a limited or no secondary market for cryptocurrencies. - Christopher Jensen, head of research, Franklin Templeton Digital Assets Ask an Expert Q. Why are staking rewards often seen as a type of investment? A: Many perceive staking as passive income since returns are often expressed using Annual Percentage Yield (APY). However, its source of income isn’t from interest; instead, it's generated by revenue earned for performing critical network security tasks. Q: Why is staking a security function, not an investment? A: The U.K. Treasury recently clarified that staking is not an investment scheme but instead a core security and cryptographic service essential for validating transactions on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Staking is a security function in that the participants secure decentralized networks and are rewarded for doing it effectively. Protocols like Ethereum define validator rewards through publicly available mechanisms, such as EIP-2917 . While staking rewards can be predictable, they fluctuate based on validator performance and network conditions. Recognizing staking as the backbone of blockchain security ensures a policy framework that aligns with its true role. - Pablo Larguia, founder and CEO, SenseiNode Keep Reading President Trump will host the first U.S. digital asset summit tomorrow, March 7.

Understanding Mystery Boxes Mystery boxes have captivated audiences with their element of surprise and potential for exciting rewards. They combine thrill and curiosity, making them a popular choice for gamers and collectors alike. History and Popularity The concept of mystery boxes dates back to the early 20th century. Initially, they were used in traditional markets as a way to sell off surplus goods. Retailers would package items without revealing the contents, enticing customers with the chance of discovering valuable treasures. In recent years, mystery boxes gained popularity among online shoppers and gamers. Subscription services and e-commerce platforms began offering curated mystery boxes filled with gaming merchandise, collectibles, or even electronics. This growth in popularity is driven by the excitement of the unknown and the potential for high-value items at a fraction of their retail price. How They Work Mystery boxes typically come in two forms: physical and digital. Physical boxes are shipped to the buyer’s address, while digital mystery boxes may unlock in-game items or rewards. When purchasing a mystery box, the buyer pays a set price without knowing the specific items inside. Each box often contains a variety of products, ranging from common items to rare collectibles. Some mystery boxes include a guarantee of value, while others rely on luck. Users enjoy the thrill of the unboxing experience, where the excitement builds as they reveal what’s inside. It’s important to research the seller’s reputation to ensure the quality and value of the items received. Types of Prizes You Can Win Mystery boxes offer a thrilling variety of prizes that can cater to different interests. From unique collectibles to practical gift cards, the elements of surprise keep players engaged and excited. Rare Collectibles Rare collectibles can include limited edition items, action figures, or signed memorabilia. These treasures are often tied to beloved franchises or significant events. Many gamers and collectors relish the chance to snag something exclusive. For example: Limited Edition Figures : Often released for a short time, these figures become highly sought after. Autographed Items : Signed memorabilia from favorite game developers or celebrities can hold significant value. Owning these collectibles can boost any collection and make it truly distinctive. Finding a rare piece in a mystery box enhances the excitement of the gaming experience. Gift Cards and Coupons Gift cards and coupons are practical prizes that almost everyone appreciates. They not only provide immediate value but also allow winners the freedom to choose their rewards. Types of gift cards may include: Gaming Platforms : Cards for Steam, PlayStation Store, or Xbox Live. Retail Stores : Cards for popular gaming shops or online retailers. Coupons might offer discounts on gaming gear or subscriptions, adding further value.

While Donald Trump is expected to make an announcement regarding the US strategic crypto reserve at this summit, a claim has emerged regarding the reserve announcement Trump made on Sunday. Trump announced on Sunday that XRP, Solana, and Cardano will be included in the crypto reserve. Ripple (XRP)-Solana Claim! While Trump’s preference for XRP, SOL and ADA garnered backlash in the crypto market, according to Unchained, Ripple Labs allegedly pressured Trump to include Solana in the crypto reserve in order to legitimize the inclusion of XRP. Ripple Labs executives, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, approached President Trump to include SOL in the crypto reserve announced on Sunday to legitimize the existence of XRP, two sources familiar with the matter told Unchained. Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous, said that Ripple aimed to make XRP's presence in the reserve seem more legitimate with this move. According to sources, Solana’s inclusion in the reserve also helped Ripple convey that it was advocating for a crypto reserve that included several American tokens. According to Polymarket data, the probability of any of these assets being in the US reserve is as follows: Bitcoin is in first place with 64% above 50%; Ethereum is in second place with 42%; XRP and Solana are in third and fourth place with 29% and 28% respectively. There are no contracts on Polymarket regarding the probability of ADA being included in the reserve. Shocking Statements from the Founder of Solana (SOL)! As the allegations between Ripple and Solana continue to be discussed, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko said that a strategic crypto reserve in the US would undermine decentralization and that there should be no reserve at all. Yakovenko said he was skeptical of the idea of a crypto strategic reserve in the US, saying his first preference would be for there to be no crypto reserve at all. According to Yakovenko, government oversight of cryptocurrencies could undermine the decentralization of digital assets. The Solana founder said his second preference is for states to manage their own crypto reserves, which Yakovenko said could act as a hedge against the Fed making mistakes. Solana founder said that if his third preference is that there must be a reserve, the cryptocurrency to be included in the reserve must have objectively measurable requirements. “If there has to be a reserve, it's based on objectively measurable requirements. I don't care what they are, they can even be structured in a way that only Bitcoin can currently meet them, they just have to be objectively measurable and rationally justified. If there's a goal to be achieved, the Solana ecosystem will achieve it.” My reserve order of preference 1. No reserve, because if you want decentralization to fail you’d put the government in charge of it. 2. Or states run their own reserve as a hedge against the fed making a mistake 3. Or if there has to be a reserve, it’s based on objectively… https://t.co/LfYXCIeRnG — toly (@aeyakovenko) March 6, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

If passed, the bill would allow tax officials to access individuals’ emails, social media, and trading accounts starting from April 1, 2026. The government claims this measure is necessary to curb tax evasion, but many are worried about potential misuse and privacy violations. Digital Locks No Longer Safe Currently, tax officials do not have direct authority to check digital records, which has led to legal confusion. The new bill seeks to remove these uncertainties by officially granting them the power to access: Email servers Online banking and investment platforms Social media accounts Digital storage and applications Beginning April 1, 2026, tax officers will have the legal right to investigate a person’s digital presence if they suspect tax evasion. This means they could check emails, social media activities, bank accounts, trading records, and even personal messages to look for undisclosed income, gold, jewelry, or other valuable assets on which taxes have not been paid. What does the Law say? Under the current Income Tax Act, of 1961, officials can enter properties and seize documents if they believe someone is hiding financial details. The new bill takes this a step further by giving them access to digital records. This means tax officers could check personal messages, emails, and online accounts if they think someone is evading taxes. While the government insists these powers will only be used in serious cases, many people worry about the lack of clear rules. A Threat to Digital Freedom? While the bill aims to improve tax compliance, legal experts and privacy advocates worry it could lead to excessive government surveillance. They argue that without proper safeguards, authorities might gain too much control, increasing the risk of harassment and misuse of personal financial data. Possible harassment of taxpayers Unnecessary scrutiny of personal information Threats to digital rights and privacy Critics fear that businesses and individuals could face unfair investigations, and there are questions about how sensitive data will be handled and protected. Bill is Currently In a Review The bill is currently being reviewed by a parliamentary committee, and changes might be made before it becomes law. While the government sees this as a step toward better tax enforcement, concerns over privacy and misuse remain.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 16:11:32

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has solidified its place as a dominant meme token with an engaged community, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is breaking new ground with an even better AI-powered technology, a growing community focus, and a strong drive for future success. With its growth-focused ecosystem, many exclusive rewards, and unbeatable entry price, crypto enthusiasts are wondering if FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a better bet for 2025. FloppyPepe (FPPE)- The Future of AI-Powered Meme Coins FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out from typical meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) by integrating advanced AI technology instead of being just another hype token. This new AI coin’s advanced utility and potential make it a better buy for crypto users than SHIB. FloppyPepe (FPPE) boasts an AI video agent, FloppyX, and the AI-powered Meme-o-Matic allows users to create high-quality viral content effortlessly. Another compelling factor is FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) commitment to a deflationary model. Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB), which has an outrageous market cap and token distribution, this project features an integrated burn mechanism that activates with each transaction. With 1% of all transactions permanently reducing the total supply, scarcity is actively increasing, supporting its lasting growth. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is also deeply rooted in Matt Furie’s legendary meme legacy. The influence of Furie’s iconic characters, especially Pepe the Frog, provides this crypto with a cultural relevance that many meme coins cannot boast of. This affiliation, plus this project's thorough SolidProof audit , lends credibility to the asset, positioning it for massive adoption from both new investors and Pepe supporters. FloppyPepe's (FPPE) community-driven approach is another game-changer. The rapid growth of its Telegram and X communities shows the project's organic excitement. To add to the excitement, crypto Influencers like Nass Crypto, a well-known YouTuber with over 1 million subscribers, recently highlighted FloppyPepe (FPPE) as an AI gem with massive potential. When established figures in the space recognize a project's unique value proposition, they solidify confidence in its trajectory. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Strong Contender But Facing Challenges Shiba Inu (SHIB) took the crypto world by storm, often called the ""Dogecoin Killer."" With a dedicated and thriving community, it has seen remarkable highs. However, the past month has shown signs of unpredictability, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trading at $0.00001501, up by 4.16% in the past 24 hours, 5.66% in the past seven days, but down by 24.62% over the past 30 days. This fluctuating price sparks worries about Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) ability to maintain momentum over the long haul. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen impressive adoption, its primary utility revolves around staking, swaps, and expansions like Shibarium. Yet, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out due to its AI-powered tools.

Some warn it could drop to $1 if it loses key support at $2, while others believe it could rally to $30 by May 2025, especially with its recent inclusion in strategic reserves. In parallel, StratoVM ($SVM) had a 347% increase, and as Bitcoin’s DeFi sector grows, StratoVM could help bring smart contracts, AI, and faster transactions to the network. Here’s a closer look at what’s going on with both projects. Will XRP Rebound to $30 After a Drop to $1? XRP’s price could be in for a dramatic swing. Market expert Ali Martinez warns that if XRP falls below the critical $2 support level, it could tumble by 40%, which would drag its value down to $1. Others share this concern and emphasize that holding above $2 is crucial to prevent a deeper sell-off. Despite the bearish outlook in the short term, some experts are optimistic. EGRAG CRYPTO believes the token could surge to $30 by May 2025 and cites historical trends and technical patterns. He compares the current market setup to 2017, when XRP consolidated before skyrocketing in price. One of the key reasons behind this bullish prediction is XRP’s recent inclusion in strategic reserves. Investors now face a crucial period of uncertainty. If XRP loses its key support, it could drop significantly. But if history repeats itself, a major rebound could happen. As of today, XRP is trading at around $2.48, up 4.5% in the last 24 hours. Trading volume has been strong, reaching approximately $9.84 billion over the same period. StratoVM ($SVM): The Breakthrough Layer-2 That Could Transform Bitcoin Beyond Just Digital Gold Bitcoin is the go-to asset for storing value, often compared to digital gold. But when it comes to smart contracts, DeFi, and AI applications, it lags behind faster blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. That’s where StratoVM ($SVM) could come in—a Layer-2 solution designed to potentially tap into Bitcoin’s potential beyond just being a store of value. Unlike Ethereum, which powers countless decentralized apps and financial tools, Bitcoin’s functionality has been limited. StratoVM might be able to change that by making Bitcoin transactions faster, integrating DeFi, and enabling AI-powered applications. SVM’s price has grown over 347% in the last week, hitting $0.2217, according to CoinGecko . Yet, despite this massive jump, its market cap is still at $3.7 million—small compared to projects like CoreDAO ($990 million). This means there’s still a lot of room for growth if more people start using it. SVM 7-day chart, Source: CoinGecko Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s DeFi sector (BTCFi) is exploding. In just a year, the total value locked (TVL) in Bitcoin-based DeFi projects has skyrocketed from $307 million to $5.85 billion, according to DefiLlama . With that kind of momentum, demand for Layer-2 solutions like StratoVM could soar. StratoVM is already gaining traction—it’s listed on Uniswap , and rumors are circling about a centralized exchange (CEX) listing. The project’s testnet is active, with 113,000 wallets and 56,000 daily transactions. If StratoVM achieves its goal, Bitcoin could break past its traditional role and step into DeFi, smart contracts, and AI. Final Thoughts XRP’s next move is uncertain—some expect a drop to $1, while others see a rally to $30. Either way, it’s a crucial time for investors. Meanwhile, StratoVM ($SVM) seems to be gaining momentum and showing that Bitcoin can do more than just store value. If it keeps growing, it could help Bitcoin compete in DeFi, smart contracts, and AI.

This follows an initial round in February, which covered smaller claims of $50,000 or less. Kraken Expands FTX Repayments to Larger Creditors in Next Phase In a post on X, FTX creditor representative Sunil stated that Kraken has started notifying affected users via email. The upcoming payouts will include both smaller claimants who have not yet received their full repayment and larger creditors, including institutional investors, who have been waiting for their share of recovered funds.

Payments have been facilitated through both Kraken and BitGo, with Kraken also offering trading fee credits to ensure it does not profit from the process. FTX Repayments: 18 Feb 2025 Funds available from 10am ET FTX Claims FTX Creditors in the Bahamas process have email confirmation that repayments will start on 18 Feb 2025 9% interest per annum from 11 Nov 2022 pic.twitter.com/FrmDN4qiK7 — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) February 4, 2025 The bankrupt exchange’s estate has allocated approximately $16 billion for creditor distributions. The first round of repayments fully covered approved Convenience Class claims, with small creditors receiving an additional 9% post-petition interest. The second phase will now extend similar payouts to larger creditors, including accrued interest. The repayment process has faced legal and logistical hurdles since FTX’s collapse in November 2022. The exchange, once valued at $32 billion, filed for bankruptcy following revelations that its sister company, Alameda Research, had misused customer funds. Under the leadership of CEO John J. Ray III, FTX’s restructuring has focused on asset recovery through legal actions and liquidation efforts. The upcoming May 30 distribution marks another step in the process, with Kraken and BitGo continuing to facilitate creditors’ payments. FTX Creditors Plan to Reinvest Payouts, Signaling Confidence in Crypto The collapse of FTX remains one of the largest financial fraud cases in U.S. history. After misusing customer funds to cover losses at its sister firm, Alameda Research, the exchange faced a liquidity crisis and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. Since then, creditors have been locked in legal battles, hoping to recover their lost funds. Now, after more than two years of negotiations and asset recovery efforts, FTX’s bankruptcy estate is preparing to reimburse creditors. This milestone relieves thousands of affected investors, though uncertainties remain for those with claims exceeding $50,000. Further updates are expected as the estate continues working to maximize recoveries. While this marks a turning point, its impact extends beyond just compensation. According to a survey conducted by NFTevening and Storible on February 19, most creditors (79%) plan to reinvest their repayments into crypto. A recent survey found that 79% of FTX creditors plan to reinvest their repayments in crypto, with 62% specifically eyeing Solana despite past market turbulence. #FTX #Solana $SOL https://t.co/aD882BkwSq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 21, 2025 The study, conducted through Prolific, surveyed 1,016 FTX creditors who met specific criteria, such as holding at least 10% of their portfolio in Solana (SOL) or owning $100 worth of SOL for over a year. Despite recent market turbulence on Solana, including events like the controversial Libra meme coin launch and the Meteora scandal , Solana remains a top choice. According to the survey, 62% of respondents intend to buy SOL with their payouts, while 44% want to invest in Solana-based projects. Additionally, 71% of creditors said they would hold or buy more SOL if its price drops below $145, reflecting long-term confidence in its growth potential. This trend suggests that many creditors view the downturn as a buying opportunity rather than an exit from the market. With billions set to re-enter the crypto ecosystem, the upcoming reimbursements could provide a fresh wave of liquidity, potentially fueling further market growth.

While Trump’s March 7 crypto summit could spark optimism, some warn of a “sell the news” scenario that could lead to a market correction. A 65% Increase on the Way? Over the past several hours, Bitcoin (BTC) has stabilized in the $90,000-$92,000 range. Recall that in the last week, the primary cryptocurrency experienced enhanced volatility, with its price hovering between $78,000 and $95,000. According to some analysts, pumping to a new all-time high is not out of the question. The popular X user Ali Martinez envisioned a target of $150,000 if BTC reclaims $97,000. He based his assumption on the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, an on-chain metric that identifies potential market tops of the leading digital asset. Shortly after, Martinez claimed the candlestick wicks on BTC’s weekly chart signal strong buying pressure, meaning bulls might step in “to defend key support levels.” Another analyst who outlined a bullish prediction was the X user CRYPTOWZRD. They maintained that “moving above $91,500 will bring the next long location.” “A successful bullish breakout of that will result in a quick rally towards $100,000 or higher,” the market observer added. Those curious to explore additional factors that may positively impact BTC’s valuation in the short term can take a look at our dedicated article here . Beware of the Crypto Summit US President Donald Trump will host a designated crypto summit in the White House on March 7 . The highly-anticipated gathering is supposed to touch upon crucial topics, including regulatory frameworks, the future of the digital asset industry in America, and , of course, details on the crypto reserve. The event will supposedly be attended by some well-known names in the sector, such as Strategy’s founder Michael Saylor, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Coinbase’s boss Brian Armstrong, and others. Many industry participants believe that the discussions would positively influence BTC’s price. Others , though, have warned about a potential “sell the news” effect. Such a market phenomenon occurs when investors go on a buying spree in anticipation of good news, driving prices up before the event. When the news is finally released, many traders take profits, causing a substantial sell-off. Earlier this week, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly stated that Trump will unveil a BTC reserve strategy at the White House on March 7. Ali Martinez reacted to the disclosure, saying, “ Buy the rumor, sell the news.” The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: $150K Is Still Possible But What’s the Catch appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-06 17:29:17

If you were around for TRUMP Coin’s wild surge to $75.35, you either rode the wave or sat back and watched as others cashed out big. That coin exploded from humble beginnings, fueled by hype, community energy, and a powerful movement. But here’s the thing—meme coin seasons don’t end, they just reload. The next potentially massive play? That would be BTFD Coin, which is already crushing it in presale with over $6.26 million raised and 71 billion tokens sold. The numbers speak for themselves. Analysts are already calling BTFD one of the top meme coin presales to buy today , with its listing price set for $0.0006 and a post-launch moon target of $0.006. If that happens, we’re talking about a 3,650% ROI, the kind of gain that can turn a $10,000 investment into $375,000. BTFD Coin’s Referral Program: The Bulls Are Cashing In Before It’s Too Late Crypto whales and smart traders always look for ways to maximize their profits, and BTFD Coin just handed them a golden ticket. The BTFD referral program is turning investors into crypto influencers overnight, rewarding them just for bringing new buyers to the presale. Here’s how it works. If you share your BTFD referral code and someone buys $50 or more, they get a 10% bonus in BTFD tokens on their purchase. But the real magic? If you’re among the top 20 referrers, you pocket 10% of their total buy amount in BTFD tokens at the end of the month. That’s free money on top of what you already invested. With BTFD’s presale numbers climbing daily, that could mean thousands of extra dollars rolling into your portfolio just for spreading the word. This referral competition runs until the last day of each month at 6 PM UTC and resets on the first of the month. If you were looking for an opportunity to stack even more BTFD before it lists, this is it. Combined with staking rewards at 90% APY, BTFD Coin is one of the top meme coin presales to buy today, and the smart money knows it. Let’s talk gains! Imagine throwing $10,000 into BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.00016. Once the token lists at $0.0006, your $10K instantly turns into $37,500. But that’s just the start. If BTFD Coin reaches its projected $0.006 moon target , that same investment skyrockets to $375,000. That’s a serious stack of cash—enough to buy a luxury car, take a year-long vacation, or even put down on a dream home. And if you’re staking while waiting for the price to pump? That 90% APY is just stacking your bag even more. The opportunity is crystal clear—this is still the presale stage, where the biggest profits are made. That’s why BTFD is being talked about as one of the top meme coin presales to buy today. TRUMP Coin Proved That Timing Is Everything—BTFD Could Be Next The TRUMP Coin surge was one for the books. Launched as a meme, it became a cultural sensation, with holders watching their bags explode to an all-time high of $75.35. It wasn’t just another meme coin; it was a movement, a rallying cry, and a community-driven financial powerhouse. But by the time most people caught wind of it, the best entry points were already gone. Right now, BTFD Coin is in that same early-stage sweet spot. The presale is raging, the community is growing, and the hype is building. Once BTFD hits exchanges, there’s no telling how quickly it will blast off, but one thing’s for sure—latecomers won’t be getting it at these prices. TRUMP Coin delivered massive gains to its early buyers. Now, BTFD Coin’s $6.26M presale and 3,650% ROI potential are shaping up to be the next big opportunity.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. FloppyPepe is emerging as a strong contender, with analysts predicting a 100x surge before Shiba Inu reaches $0.001. Table of Contents Shiba Inu growth: Gradual and ongoing FloppyPepe: The next memecoin set to surge New investors and traders move to FloppyPepe The crypto market has had many massive growth stories, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) might be the next big winner ahead of Shiba Inu (SHIB). According to analysts, FloppyPepe is ready for a 100x surge before Shiba Inu reaches the $0.001 mark. With a growing community and unique tokenomics, this new AI memecoin is capturing the attention of early adopters and seasoned investors. As memecoins continue to dominate speculative trading, FloppyPepe’s momentum suggests it could be the dark horse of the next bull run, gaining the attention of traders. Shiba Inu growth: Gradual and ongoing Shiba Inu has grown gradually since its launch, driven by community enthusiasm and widespread speculation. Initially dismissed as another memecoin, Shiba Inu gained motion through strategic marketing, exchange listings, and a strong online following. The milestones achieved, including listing on top exchanges and periodic token burns, have been instrumental to SHIB’s gradual rise in value. However, despite these gains, Shiba Inu has struggled to break into higher price ranges, with its sizable token supply keeping its price relatively low. While Shiba Inu has built a loyal base of supporters and continues to develop projects like Shibarium, its long-term growth remains uncertain. The coin has faced challenges in maintaining momentum, especially in bear markets where speculative assets tend to suffer. Though Shiba Inu has seen periods of strong rallies, its journey to $0.001 is still a long way off, requiring massive market movements or significant token burns. As a result, investors and traders are looking at newer memecoins with higher growth potential.

It has remained a strong and consistent player amongst other memecoins that have been volatile since its introduction to the crypto market. With a passionate community and rising investor interest, FloppyPepe’s growing traction has caught the attention of traders looking for the next big opportunity. One of FloppyPepe’s key missions is to capitalize on the expanding AI market and the demand for AI-powered solutions in the crypto space. At the heart of its ecosystem is the Meme-o-Matic machine, an AI agent bringing a new dimension of meme creation through decentralized development and community-driven distribution. Users can input images, text, and videos, allowing the AI to generate unique, engaging memes. FloppyPepe also features FloppyX, an advanced bot that transforms text-based interactions into dynamic, character-consistent videos through automated pipelines and the use of self-aware characters. These users experience real-time interaction through direct polls and prompts. The Meme-o-Matic machine is now live on Telegram. FloppyPepe intends to maximize this launch and the momentum it will bring to increase its presence in the market and raise its value. New investors and traders move to FloppyPepe By combining community-driven momentum with a stage-based pricing system that rewards early investors, FloppyPepe has captured the attention of traders eager to capitalize on its rising momentum. FloppyPepe prioritizes security and trust, as evident by its SolidProof audit, reassuring the community of its commitment to transparency and safety. To maintain scarcity and drive long-term value, 1% of every token transaction is burnt, while redistribution payments incentivize long-term holders. This mechanism guarantees stability and profitability as demand increases and supply gradually declines. The excitement surrounding FloppyPepe was undeniable during its private sale, which sold out in less than 24 hours, raising nearly $1 million from eager early adopters. With the presale gaining momentum at $0.0000002, the memecoin is expected to meet and exceed the predictions of crypto experts, attracting the attention of new investors and traders. FloppyPepe is offering a 60% bonus on all presale token purchases from March 3rd to 7th, 2025. Investors simply need to use the promo code FLOPPYAI60 at checkout on the official website to secure the extra tokens. For more information on FloppyPepe, visit the website , Telegram , or X .

Binance’s CZ answers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-project-on-l1-and-l2-binances-cz-answers/,"On Thursday, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) started a debate on social media platform X, discussing whether developers should build their AI-focused blockchain projects on their own Layer 1 (L1) networks or rely on existing Layer 2 (L2) solutions. Through his official X account, Zhao said the query crossed his mind after having a conversation with a project founder. He surmised that the main goal of AI-driven blockchain projects is not to create a new blockchain but to “use blockchain technology for AI-related economic models.” “ Having your own L1 feels like you have more sovereignty, more decentralization, etc. But it’s also a lot more work. Nodes, validators, etc. You are also kinda on your own island ,” the ex-Binance CEO wrote . “ L2 saves you all that work. And doesn’t seem to have much value leakage to the L1 you are on (like ETH). You get to use the DEX, perps, existing tools, and the community .” Concluding his thoughts, Zhao asked the crypto community which of the two is considered “superior. ” He acknowledged that it was an aged debate but wondered if there is a clearer winner now. Decentralization vs. practicality: Community discusses L1 networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are independent blockchains that handle all transactions and security on their own, processing transactions directly and requiring validators or miners for consensus. L2 solutions such as Ethereum’s ZK-Rollups operate on top of existing L1 chains and process transactions off-chain or in batches before settling on the main blockchain to reduce congestion and fees. L2s allow projects to use pre-established ecosystems without the need to maintain a network. Building L1 is more like building an apartment building. You need to maintain the building, employ security and find real estate agents who then find you tenants to make the building viable. Similarly, L2 is like buying one of those apartments to rent it out further. Smaller… — Annkurr (@ghaiankur) March 6, 2025 In response to CZ’s question, an account using the pseudonym Silent Capital insisted that the decision should depend on what the project’s goals are. According to the user, L2 networks are innately decentralized because they leverage an existing blockchain network. According to Silent Capital a users own L1 won’t give the same level of decentralization. They also talked about how, in order to build a new L1, a developer would have to make almost everything from scratch. They have to cover consensus mechanisms, validator networks, and security models. Marketing researcher Clytheronix also gave a similar perspective, insisting that L1 networks tend to be more decentralized but come with greater complexity. L1 networks haven’t lost their relevance Still, not everyone agrees with the idea that L2 is the best option for AI projects. MatrixAI community head Sercan Muslu listed some benefits of L1’s sovereignty, asserting that AI applications require a level of optimization that existing L2 solutions fail to provide. “L1 sovereignty isn’t just about control [it] helps optimize consensus mechanisms for AI workloads. [In addition, it] integrates AI models natively into the chain and improves scalability without external dependencies,” Muslu remarked. The community head concluded that L2 solutions feel more plausible, but they depend on the L1 parent chain’s architecture and are not designed to handle AI’s high computational demands. Some crypto enthusiasts like Music artist Marco Tonetti went beyond technical considerations and saw the choice between L1 and L2 through the scope of making a business strategy. “ L2 is way better if you want to build a product. L1 is better if you want to gamble your luck and become richer faster ,” he claimed . Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The coin’s value dropped to $595.5 in the last 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency value fell by 0.52%. Technical indicators and price charts continue to depict a negative momentum for today. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,612.24 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price decreased over the last 24 hours, towards the support at $566.4. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems stable because bulls successfully secured this level in the past week, whereas the coin is still trading on the balanced end of its daily price range. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,612.24 by 2031. Recent news/opinion on BNB Binance founder and ex-CEO CZ reshared his post stressing mental health. He said if the crypto dip is stressful for you, then you should reduce your positions for peace of mind. He was replying to a question by a user who goes by the BillionAirSon, asking him his views on present markets. If you got shaken out during the dip, reduce your size to a level you can handle.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB is trading near the psychological mark of $600.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-06 17:35:41

The winds of change might be blowing in our favor, and if Real Vision crypto market analyst Jamie Coutts is on the mark, we could be witnessing a spectacular rally soon. Coutts boldly stated on X that both Bitcoin (BTC) and the vast universe of top 200 altcoins are gearing up to potentially smash through their existing ceilings and reach dazzling new all-time highs (ATHs) by May. Is this wishful thinking, or is there solid ground beneath this optimistic forecast? Let’s dive deep into the analysis and unpack what this could mean for the crypto market . Decoding the Price Prediction: Bitcoin and Altcoins to ATH? Coutts’ price prediction hinges on a confluence of factors, some seemingly contradictory at first glance. While the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), a key indicator of the dollar’s strength and often inversely correlated with crypto prices, has taken a significant dip (which is generally seen as rocket fuel for liquidity and risk assets like crypto), Bitcoin itself just weathered its roughest February in a decade. Confusing, right? Let’s break it down: The DXY Dip – A Tailwind for Crypto? : A weaker dollar usually means global liquidity loosens up. This often translates to more capital flowing into riskier assets, and cryptocurrencies are certainly in that category. Think of it like this: when the dollar is less attractive, investors look elsewhere for potentially higher returns, and crypto becomes a brighter prospect. Bitcoin’s February Blues – A Temporary Setback? : Despite the favorable DXY conditions, Bitcoin had a tough February. This could be due to profit-taking after a strong run, broader market corrections, or simply the inherent volatility of the crypto space. However, Coutts suggests this might be a temporary lull before a bigger surge. Altcoin Carnage – Capitulation or Opportunity? : The altcoin market, often seen as a high-beta play compared to Bitcoin, experienced even more significant selling pressure. A staggering 47% of the top 200 altcoins plummeted to new yearly lows. Interestingly, Coutts interprets this as a potential sign of capitulation – a point where sellers are exhausted, and the market is primed for a reversal. Why Could This Crypto Market Rally Happen Now? To understand the potential for this crypto market rally, we need to consider the cyclical nature of crypto and the broader macroeconomic environment. Here are a few key drivers that could fuel this predicted surge: Halving Hype: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event (expected in April 2024) historically reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. This supply shock, coupled with sustained or increasing demand, often creates a bullish environment for Bitcoin and, consequently, the broader crypto market. Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly embracing crypto. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the US is a game-changer, opening up Bitcoin investment to a wider range of investors and legitimizing the asset class further. This institutional influx can provide significant buying pressure. Broader Economic Recovery (or at least stability): While economic uncertainty persists globally, there are signs of resilience and potential recovery in some major economies. If inflation starts to cool down and central banks pivot towards less hawkish monetary policies, risk assets like crypto could benefit significantly. Altcoin Season Potential: After periods of Bitcoin dominance, the altcoin market often experiences a surge. If Bitcoin leads the charge to new ATHs, history suggests that altcoins, with their higher risk and reward profile, could follow suit with even more explosive gains. Navigating the Altcoins Landscape: Opportunity or Peril? The altcoins space is a double-edged sword. While the potential for explosive gains is undeniable, so is the risk of significant losses. The fact that nearly half of the top 200 altcoins hit yearly lows might seem alarming, but as Coutts points out, it could be a sign of market cleansing – a necessary shakeout before a new bull run begins. Potential Benefits of Investing in Altcoins during a Predicted Rally: Benefit Description Higher Growth Potential Altcoins, especially smaller-cap ones, often exhibit higher percentage gains than Bitcoin during bull markets. Diversification Investing in a basket of altcoins can diversify your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, potentially reducing overall risk (though individual altcoin risk can be high). Exposure to Innovation Altcoins represent diverse projects and technologies within the crypto ecosystem, offering exposure to various sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. Challenges and Risks of Altcoin Investing: Challenge/Risk Description Higher Volatility Altcoins are significantly more volatile than Bitcoin, meaning price swings can be dramatic and losses can be substantial. Liquidity Issues Some altcoins, especially smaller ones, can have lower liquidity, making it harder to buy and sell large amounts without impacting the price. Project Risk Many altcoin projects are still in early stages and carry a higher risk of failure or abandonment compared to established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Scams and Rug Pulls The altcoin space is rife with scams and “rug pulls,” where projects are designed to defraud investors. Due diligence is paramount. Actionable Insights: Preparing for a Potential ATH Surge So, how can you navigate this potentially explosive ATH scenario? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This is crypto rule number one. Don’t blindly follow predictions. Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency you consider investing in, understanding its technology, team, use case, and tokenomics. Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Crypto is inherently volatile, and even optimistic predictions can be wrong. Diversify your portfolio and consider using stop-loss orders to manage downside risk. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market developments, macroeconomic indicators, and news related to Bitcoin and altcoins. Market sentiment can shift rapidly in the crypto world. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, consider DCA – investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This can help smooth out volatility and potentially improve your average entry price. Be Patient and Long-Term Focused: Crypto investing is often a long-term game. Don’t get caught up in short-term hype or panic selling during dips. Focus on the long-term potential of the technology and the assets you believe in. Conclusion: Are We on the Cusp of a New Crypto Dawn? Jamie Coutts’ prediction of Bitcoin and top 200 altcoins reaching new ATHs by May is certainly exciting and warrants attention. While recent market dips and Bitcoin’s February struggles might seem concerning, the underlying factors like a weaker dollar, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, and increasing institutional adoption paint a potentially bullish picture for the crypto market . The altcoin market, despite its recent woes, could be poised for a significant rebound if Bitcoin leads the way. However, remember that predictions are not guarantees. The crypto market is notoriously unpredictable, and thorough research and prudent risk management are crucial. But, if Coutts’ analysis proves accurate, we might just be on the verge of witnessing another exhilarating chapter in the crypto saga. Buckle up, it could be a wild ride to May!

The stock market initially bounced off a sharply lower opening and bitcoin (BTC) rose through $91,000 as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — in an appearance on CNBC — said the president would exempt Mexico from his new 25% tariff for any goods or services covered under a previous trade agreement. The nicer stance toward the country's neighbor to the south was confirmed later by a social media post from Trump. The positive moves in markets were short-lived though, with the Nasdaq at its session low just past the noon hour on the east cost, down 2.3%. Bitcoin has pulled back to $88,500, down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours. This just in: Stagflation Possibly lost in the unending ebb and flow of news emanating out of D.C. is a sharp rise in interest rates across the developed world. With U.S. military support for Europe possibly on the decline, governments across the continent are pledging budget-busting increases in defense spending. Germany, for instance, this week saw one of its worst bond crashes ever, with the 10-year Bund yield jumping more than 40 basis points to the current 2.83%. In Japan, where long-term Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields were little more than a handful basis points for what seemed like decades, the 10-year JGB yield rose another 6 basis points to 1.51% overnight. That's more than double the level of six months ago. The moves haven't been ignored by U.S. markets. The 10-year Treasury yield — which had previously had declined about 70 basis points since the Trump inauguration — has risen more than 20 basis points in the last 48 hours to 4.30%. ""The recent move in global bond yields has put me on high alert,"" wrote Lekker Capital's Quinn Thompson . Particularly concerning to Thompson is that yields are rising as growth slows. ""We are witnessing the exact definition of stagflation which historically has not treated risk assets well,"" he continued. Friday brings the latest U.S. jobs figures The large gains in interest rates brings a renewed importance to the February U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls Report to be released Friday morning. Economists are expecting payrolls to have risen 160,000 versus 143,000 in January. The unemployment rate is seen remaining steady at 4%. A strong print — and employment reports have tended to run ahead of expectations for many months running — could send rates pumping even higher, and risk markets, crypto among them, into a new leg down.",Markets|Interest Rates|Bitcoin|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 17:38:01

That practice had been cited by Republicans as a problem area in recent congressional hearings, which examined how digital assets businesses had been systematically cut out of U.S. banking relationships because of perceptions that the regulators — including the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — didn't want them there. As the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, South Carolina's Tim Scott has rounded up fellow Republicans on that panel to back the bill — the Financial Integrity and Regulation Management Act , or FIRM Act — that cuts that phrase from any regulators' assessment of a bank's safety and soundness. ""It’s clear that federal regulators have abused reputational risk by carrying out a political agenda against federally legal businesses,"" Scott said in a statement on the bill, which said that ending debanking is among his top priorities. ""This legislation, which eliminates all references to reputational risk in regulatory supervision, is the first step in ending debanking once and for all."" Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who is the leader of the digital assets subcommittee, had recently raised this specific point as a concern with the Federal Reserve's oversight. ""Americans deserve a transparent regulatory framework that fosters innovation in digital assets instead of smothering it with government overreach,"" she said in a statement. Consumer advocates and several Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have argued that the regulators' focus on digital assets had been warranted after the collapse of several major firms, fraud charges against industry leaders, major routine hacks of digital assets platforms and generally volatile markets have posed threats to the safety of investors.

While Ripple's legal battles and market volatility continue to weigh on XRP, a new player is stealing the spotlight. BinoFi is the first ever hybrid crypto exchange. With its ambitious vision and innovative features, BinoFi is attracting attention from investors who are looking for the next project with big returns. But what makes this token stand out, and why are people betting on its explosive potential in 2025? The Presale: A Gradual Climb to Success BinoFi's presale is structured to reward early adopters while maintaining fairness and stability. This gradual rise ensures that early participants get the best deal, while latecomers may regret missing the opportunity as the project gains momentum. What's interesting is the absence of private sales, a move that prevents large investors from dominating the market early on. Instead, the presale is entirely public, giving retail investors a fair shot at getting in from the start. Early participants also enjoy extras like staking bonuses, governance rights, and trading fee discounts, which could make holding BINO more appealing in the long run. BinoFi's Vision: Bridging the Gap Between CEXs and DEXs BinoFi's core idea is simple yet powerful: combine the best of centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) into one platform. CEXs are known for their speed and liquidity but come with the risk of losing control over your funds. DEXs, on the other hand, offer security and transparency but often suffer from slow transactions and fragmented liquidity. BinoFi aims to solve this dilemma by offering a hybrid liquidity model. This model aggregates liquidity from both CEXs and DEXs, ensuring users get the best prices and fastest execution. Whether you're a casual trader or an experienced one, BinoFi promises a smoother experience without compromising on security. Speaking of security, the platform's non-custodial MPC wallets ensure that users retain full control of their assets, eliminating the risk of exchange hacks or insolvency. Proof-of-Reserves & On-Chain Transparency: A New Standard One of the biggest concerns in crypto is trust. How do you know an exchange isn't playing fast and loose with your funds? BinoFi addresses this with real-time proof-of-reserves, a feature that allows users to verify the platform's solvency at any time. Unlike traditional exchanges that operate in the shadows, BinoFi's on-chain transparency ensures that every transaction is traceable and every reserve is accounted for. This level of transparency is rare in the crypto space, and it could set a new standard for how exchanges operate. When BinoFi delivers on this, it will just force other platforms to step up their game or risk losing users to a more transparent competitor. Why BinoFi Could Explode So, what does the future hold for BinoFi? Upon delivering its promises, the token would see significant growth by 2025. Here's why: Hybrid Model Appeal: The combination of CEX speed and DEX security is a compelling proposition. If BinoFi can attract both retail and institutional users, its liquidity and trading volume could skyrocket. Transparency as a Selling Point: In an industry plagued by scandals, BinoFi's proof-of-reserves and on-chain transparency could make it a trusted name in crypto. Token Utility: BINO isn't just a speculative asset—it's integral to the platform's ecosystem. From trading fee discounts to governance rights, the token has multiple use cases that could drive demand. Conclusion: A Token Worth Watching While XRP struggles to regain its footing, BinoFi is a promising alternative for investors seeking innovation and transparency. Its hybrid exchange model, commitment to security, and accessible price make it a standout project in a crowded market. Will BinoFi explode in 2025? Experts say the probability is close to 100%. One thing is clear: in a world where trust is often in short supply, BinoFi is choosing transparency as top priority and that makes it a project worth watching.

41243816,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137527,1741283120,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Garantex Exchange Shuts Down After Shocking $27M Tether Freeze,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/garantex-exchange-tether-freeze/,"In a dramatic turn of events shaking the cryptocurrency landscape, Russian crypto exchange Garantex has abruptly suspended all trading and withdrawals. This drastic measure comes in the wake of a significant $27 million USDT freeze by Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin. The freeze, as reported by Cointelegraph, is directly linked to the latest round of EU sanctions targeting Garantex for its alleged ties to sanctioned Russian banks. What does this mean for crypto users, especially those in Russia, and what are the broader implications for the stability of the crypto market? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. Why Did Garantex Face a Tether Freeze? The core issue stems from the expanding web of international sanctions against Russia. Following Russia’s actions in Ukraine, both the U.S. and the EU have been tightening financial restrictions on entities perceived to be supporting or connected to the Russian regime. Garantex, already sanctioned by the U.S. in 2022, has now become a target of the EU as well. These sanctions are designed to limit Russia’s access to the global financial system, and cryptocurrency exchanges are increasingly being scrutinized to ensure compliance. The EU’s recent action specifically targets Garantex due to its alleged links with sanctioned Russian banks. While the exact nature of these ties remains somewhat opaque, the EU’s decision to impose sanctions suggests they have identified connections that warrant restrictive measures. This is where Tether freeze comes into play. Tether, as a centralized entity controlling USDT, has the authority to freeze addresses holding USDT, especially when instructed by law enforcement or regulatory bodies. In this case, it appears Tether acted in response to the EU sanctions, freezing $27 million USDT linked to Garantex. Impact of the Tether Freeze on Garantex and its Users The immediate impact of the Tether freeze is the paralysis of Garantex’s operations. The exchange has suspended all trading and withdrawals, effectively locking users out of their funds, at least temporarily. Garantex itself has issued a warning to its users, particularly those holding USDT in Russian wallets, indicating that their assets are now at risk. This situation presents several challenges: Loss of Access to Funds: Users of Garantex, especially in Russia, are facing the immediate prospect of being unable to access their USDT holdings. This can have significant financial consequences, particularly for those who rely on these funds for daily transactions or savings. Uncertainty and Panic: The sudden halt in operations and the warning from Garantex have understandably created uncertainty and panic among users. The lack of clarity from Tether and the ongoing maintenance of the exchange further fuel anxiety. Reputational Damage to Garantex: This incident severely damages Garantex’s reputation. Trust is paramount in the crypto exchange world, and a freeze of this magnitude, coupled with sanctions, erodes user confidence. Wider Market Concerns: While Garantex is not one of the largest global exchanges, this event highlights the risks associated with centralized exchanges and the potential impact of regulatory actions on the crypto market. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market and Sanctions? The Garantex situation is not an isolated incident. It underscores the increasing regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, particularly concerning sanctions compliance. Here’s what we can infer for the broader crypto market: Increased Regulatory Pressure: Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are paying closer attention to crypto exchanges. They are actively working to ensure compliance with sanctions regimes and prevent the use of crypto for illicit activities. Centralized Exchanges at Risk: Centralized exchanges, like Garantex, are more vulnerable to regulatory actions and sanctions due to their centralized nature. They are subject to the jurisdiction of governments and can be compelled to freeze assets or halt operations. Decentralization as a Countermeasure: This event may further strengthen the argument for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). DEXs, by their nature, are more resistant to censorship and sanctions, although they too are not entirely immune to regulatory pressures. USDT Scrutiny: This freeze also puts Tether and USDT under renewed scrutiny. As the dominant stablecoin, USDT’s actions have significant ripple effects across the crypto market. Its compliance with sanctions and its transparency are constantly debated topics. Russian Crypto Exchange Under Pressure: A Sign of Things to Come? Garantex, being a Russian crypto exchange , finds itself at the epicenter of geopolitical tensions and financial sanctions. The pressure on Russian crypto exchanges is likely to intensify as international sanctions remain in place. This incident raises questions about the future of crypto in Russia and the ability of Russian users to access and utilize cryptocurrencies in a regulated and secure manner. The situation with Garantex could be a harbinger of things to come for other exchanges operating in or catering to regions targeted by sanctions. It highlights the delicate balance crypto exchanges must strike between providing services and complying with increasingly complex and stringent global regulations. Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Users Learn? This unfolding situation provides several key takeaways for crypto users: Diversification of Holdings: Relying heavily on a single exchange, especially one operating in a geopolitically sensitive region, carries risks. Diversifying holdings across multiple exchanges and considering self-custody solutions can mitigate risks. Understanding Exchange Risks: Users should carefully research the exchanges they use, considering their regulatory compliance, jurisdiction, and risk profile. Exchanges operating in sanctioned regions or with unclear regulatory status may pose higher risks. Exploring Decentralized Options: For those concerned about censorship and sanctions, exploring decentralized exchanges and DeFi protocols might be a viable alternative, although these also come with their own set of risks and complexities. Staying Informed: Keeping abreast of regulatory developments and news related to crypto exchanges is crucial. Events like the Garantex freeze can have significant implications for the market and individual users. Conclusion: Navigating the Complex World of Crypto Regulations The Garantex saga serves as a stark reminder of the growing intersection of cryptocurrency and international regulations. The crypto sanctions landscape is evolving rapidly, and exchanges and users alike must adapt to this new reality. While the crypto space often touts decentralization and freedom from traditional finance, centralized entities like exchanges are increasingly becoming subject to the rules and regulations of the global financial system. The USDT freeze on Garantex is not just about one exchange; it’s a signal of the increasing pressure and scrutiny the entire crypto industry is facing in the context of global sanctions and regulatory compliance. As the situation unfolds, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how Garantex responds, how Tether addresses the situation, and what further regulatory actions may follow. This event is a critical juncture, highlighting the need for vigilance, informed decision-making, and a proactive approach to navigating the complex and evolving world of cryptocurrency regulations.

The attack, reportedly carried out by North Korea's Lazarus Group, resulted in the theft of over 401,000 ETH, reinforcing the reality that no exchange is safe from sophisticated cyber threats, and any platform can be at risk. Bybit’s response is critical. The positive takeaway is that Bybit has re-established a 1:1 asset backing for its clients and closed the “ether gap.” However, this temporary situation — where users shoulder the burden of centralized exchange (CEX) security failures could drive staking participants toward self-custody, keeping only the bare minimum on exchanges for transactions. While the full fallout of this breach is still unfolding, it may serve as a catalyst for both retail and institutional staking participants to rethink their strategies. Here’s how the hack could reshape staking. Potential Staking Losses The hack resulted in the theft of approximately 400,000 ETH, which is nearly $1 billion in losses at an average price of $2,600 per ETH. Beyond the immediate financial hit, the Ethereum staking yield — hovering around 4% annually — means a loss of roughly 16,000 ETH in yearly staking rewards. For perspective, if these stolen ETH were spread out across 100 stakers, each would have lost 160 ETH in rewards. This is a significant blow, particularly for retail investors who may lack the financial resilience to absorb such losses. Declining Staking Share on Centralized Exchanges The Bybit hack may be a turning point for the crypto industry, highlighting the risks of staking on centralized platforms. The trend is already visible in recent data: in the last six months, the amount of staked ETH on centralized exchanges has dropped from 8,597,984 ETH in September 2024 to 8,024,288 ETH in February 2025, representing a 6.67% decline. This change comes amid growing concerns about security and transparency on centralized platforms. Additionally, following the hack from Feb. 20 to Feb. 23, staked ETH on CEXs fell by 0.56%, while on-chain staking (excluding CEXs) increased by 0.31%. This suggests a shift in the staking landscape, with users increasingly moving their assets away from centralized exchanges to more secure, non-custodial staking solutions or hardware wallets. This change could have long-term implications for the crypto market. Centralized exchanges, which have long dominated the staking ecosystem, may see their influence wane. As stakers migrate to decentralized alternatives, CEXs’ roles in governance, reward distribution, and network upgrades could diminish. In the long-term, this may result in the reshaping of the staking market, with decentralized alternatives taking center stage. Institutional Adoption at Risk High-profile hacks like Bybit's inevitably make institutional investors more cautious about entering the crypto market. When auditors evaluate staking products, including ETH ETFs, billion-dollar security breaches can prompt legal and compliance teams to hit the brakes on crypto allocations. This stagnation could push back the timeline for achieving new price highs and delaying broader adoption. Given the rising threat of hacks, it is crucial for both retail and institutional investors to embrace audited and certified self-custody solutions. Securing assets through non-custodial wallets and decentralized platforms can significantly mitigate the risks posed by centralized exchanges. At the same time, exchanges need to work to rebuild trust by enhancing their security measures, conducting regular audits, and offering insurance schemes for users affected by breaches. Moreover, the entire crypto community — including developers, exchanges, regulators, and users — needs to come together to balance innovation with security.

Increasingly, though, blockchains host far more than tokens. In fact, blockchains are our future tech stack, and they can host sophisticated Web apps too, which live fully-onchain, just like tokens. These apps are implemented entirely from network-resident code (i.e. smart contract software and its evolutions). This has huge potential: by the end of 2025, more than 5 billion people will own internet-connected smartphones with Web browsers. So what might drive them to create and use fully-onchain web apps, which can sport seamless Web3 functionality? I believe a new blockchain revolution is imminent, thanks to advancing AI and “self-writing app” technology. This relates to an important emerging trend called “vibe coding.” Vibe coding involves software engineers using tools with integrated AI that can write and fix software code on their behalf, making them much more productive. The self-writing apps paradigm takes this much further, by enabling non-technical users to create, own and update apps simply by instructing AI over chat. For reasons I will explain, blockchain is in a unique position to help bring this revolutionary functionality to the world. In the future, an individual will be able to create a personal branding website, or something like a custom wedding planning app for a family member getting married, just by talking to AI. An entrepreneur without technical staff or money will be able to create a new kind of e-commerce website, or build a sharing economy app with Web3 rails. And, an enterprise will be able to create sophisticated CRM functionality, for an infinitesimally small fraction of the investment in time and money that is currently required. All just by talking, without the need for software engineering or systems administration skills. In this new development paradigm, everyday users will issue instructions to AI over chat, and simply refresh their web browser moments later to interact with their new or updated app. Apps living on blockchains have a number of valuable features. They are sovereign and censorship-resistant, because they live on a public network, they are tamperproof, which means they are secure without depending on cybersecurity, incredibly resilient, and can seamlessly integrate powerful web3 functionalities because they live on-chain. In addition, blockchain technology solves major problems involved with having AI build solo on traditional IT. For example, the code that runs on traditional IT must be written carefully to avoid introducing security holes, and the whole platform is sensitive to security configurations, from cloud accounts, to operating systems running on cloud instances like Linux, to hosted platform software such as databases and web servers. This means traditional IT infrastructure must often be further protected by cybersecurity systems such as firewalls and anti-malware. Failover , and backup and restore, are another concern, and service providers must be trusted. Trusting AI to build solo on traditional IT is a stretch, because even a single mistake can lead to a cyberattack that results in data exfiltration, or ransomware encrypting data. Blockchains make it far easier for AI to build solo in many different ways. For example, the network-resident code blockchains host is “serverless,” greatly simplifying the coding tasks AI must perform, allowing code to be produced faster. On the Internet Computer network, code can also serve secure interactive web experiences directly to end users, and can store and process massive amounts of data efficiently, and even be used to build things such as a fully-onchain social network (e.g oc.app) or an important enterprise application. At DFINITY, we are great believers in self-writing apps running on public blockchains, which we term the “self-writing internet,” and have been developing supporting technologies for some years. For self-writing apps to reach their maximum potential, it must be possible not only for users to create them by talking, but also to continue updating and improving them in production, so they can talk until they have what they need, or a design that is optimal. Unless users can continue updating apps running in production, the total market addressed by the self-writing app paradigm will reach only a tiny fraction of its tremendous potential. DFINITY has been developing a programming language framework called Motoko for usage by AI, as well as humans. When a user updates an app by adding or changing functionality, the AI must also describe how to update the structure of data inside the app, so that none is lost. When the AI tries to install an update, the framework is able to detect if a mistake has been made that would cause even a small amount of data to be lost unintentionally, so that it can ask the AI to try again. We believe the self-writing internet will democratize and decentralize tech on blockchain, and are excited that a new platform called Caffeine.ai will soon be released. Just by interacting with Caffeine over chat, users will create, own and update sovereign apps on the Internet Computer, and the World Computer more broadly, which for us is the amalgamation of all blockchains that can host tokens and smart contract software. In the future, it will be possible to say “build me a personal Google Photos, which I can share with my family and friends, where we can add comments and emoji reactions to photos,” or “build me a remittance system so I can pay my international contractors using stablecoins.” On blockchains, human imagination, rather than technical skills, will increasingly be the limit when creating web apps. The utility unlocked will drive massive adoption of blockchain – although, oftentimes, users may not be aware that blockchain lies behind their game-changing experiences. I have long talked about a “blockchain singularity” occurring where decentralized networks become a major new tech stack. I think this is how we get there, and the future is almost here.",Opinion,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 17:52:27

The firm’s decision to wade into DeFi will grant it access to on-chain credit markets with regulatory compliance at the heart of the partnership. Bitwise Makes First DeFi Allocation Through Maple Finance Maple Finance has announced a partnership with Bitwise that will see the asset management firm access on-chain credit. According to a press release , Bitwise entered the DeFi space via an institutional allocation with Maple Finance in a pioneering move for the crypto index fund manager. The partnership will see Bitwise lean on Maple’s regulatory-compliant infrastructure to access “yield-generation opportunities” in the DeFi ecosystem. Bitwise’s allocation with Maple provides a measure of structure and transparency in the “Wild West” of DeFi as it enters into unknown terrain. The move is expected to signal Bitwise’s transition away from traditional fixed income toward on-chain lending markets. “Across all our active solutions at Bitwsise, we’ve always sought to take advantage of crypto-native investments that generate dynamic uncorrelated returns,” said Bitwise Head of Alpha Strategies Jeff Park. Bitwise’s decision to partner with Maple is not a flash in the pan. Park cites Maple’s experience in the space with institutional capital, particularly its risk management frameworks or institutions. Maple has a streak of issuing overcollaterized loans backed by cryptocurrencies. “Maple’s deep expertise and battle-tested infrastructure position Bitwise and our clients well to access the opportunities with confidence and scale,” said Park. Bitwise’s Deepens Its Position In The Cryptoverse Bitwise, the largest crypto index fund manager in the US is sizzling with activity in recent weeks. The company has filed an S-1 for an Aptos ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The insitution’s plan is to provide regulated APT exposure to investors, tracking the value of the layer 1 blockchain. The fund manager says it will donate 10% of its ETF earnings toward the open-source development of Bitcoin . The firm has rolled out a raft of crypto-based ETFs, inching forward with a potential launch for a Dogecoin ETF. The registration of the legal entity for the memecoin-based ETF is fuelling speculation for Dogecoin price to reach $6 .

What is a cryptocurrency? According to Wikipedia’s definition, it is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is “not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.” And while at the very beginning in 2009 there was one and only cryptocurrency out there, called Bitcoin ( BTC ), things have changed significantly since then. Now, there over 12 million different tokens, per data from crypto price aggregator platforms. But how to differ them? There are memecoins, utility tokens, security tokens, and many more. No wonder crypto has become so complex. “So, whether you’re building a blockchain-based project, investing in tokens, or simply using them as a consumer, it’s essential to know what to look for. It’s important not to confuse, for instance, memecoins with network tokens.” a16z crypto To help sort the crypto things out, Miles Jennings, Scott Duke Kominers, and Eddy Lazzarin from a16z crypto created a framework for understanding the seven categories of tokens they see entrepreneurs building with most often. Below is a breakdown of these categories. Network tokens Network tokens are used to keep a blockchain or smart contract protocol running. Basically, their value comes from how the network works. They usually have a clear purpose, like helping with network operations, forming consensus, upgrading the protocol, or rewarding certain actions within the network. As a16z crypto explains, these networks, where the tokens live, usually have features like “programmatic buybacks, dividends, and other changes to the total token supply via token creation or burning to introduce inflationary and deflationary pressures in service of the network.” Network tokens depend on trust. And in this aspect a16z crypto says these tokens “are similar to both commodities and securities.” “Recognizing this, both the SEC’s 2019 Framework and FIT21 provided for network tokens to be excluded from U.S. securities laws when those trust dependencies are mitigated through decentralization of the underlying network.” a16z crypto These tokens are used to launch new networks, distribute ownership or control, and keep the network secure. The brightest examples are Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Uniswap ( UNI ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Security tokens While network tokens might seem like securities, security tokens are actually digital versions of traditional securities, like company shares or corporate bonds. They can also have special features, like giving profits interest in an LLC or rights to future settlement payments from lawsuits. While securities give holders specific rights, titles, or interests, and the issuer often controls the asset’s risk, these tokens will still be under U.S. securities laws, as a16z crypto points out. Even though these tokens aren’t as common as network tokens or memecoins, they’ve still been used to raise money for business ventures. For example, Etherfuse Stablebonds and Aspen Coin gave people fractional ownership in the St. Regis Aspen Resort. How to define a token | Source: a16z crypto Company-backed tokens Company-backed tokens are tied to an off-chain application, product, or service run by a company or centralized organization. Like network tokens, company-backed tokens may use blockchain and smart contracts (e.g., to facilitate payments). However, they primarily serve off-chain operations rather than network ownership. As a result, a company has more control over the issuance, utility, and value of the token. Although these tokens don’t provide a defined right or title like traditional securities, they still have trust dependencies akin to securities. “Their value is inherently dependent upon a system that is controlled by a person, company or management team.” a16z crypto For this exact reason, company-backed tokens could be subject to U.S. securities laws when they attract investment, the analysts warn. Historically, company-backed tokens have been used to circumvent securities laws in the U.S., acting as proxies for equity or profits interests in companies. For instance, examples include ( FTT ), which was a profit interest in the notorious FTX exchange. Binance Coin ( BNB ) is another example of a company-backed token that transitioned into a network token after the launch of BNB Chain.

These tokens often serve as currencies within virtual economies, like digital gold in a game , loyalty points for a membership program, or credits for digital products. What makes arcade tokens unique is that they are designed to discourage speculation. They may have an uncapped supply — meaning an unlimited number can be minted — and/or limited transferability. As a16z crypto points out, these tokens may even “expire or lose value if unused, or they may only have monetary value and utility within the system in which they are issued.” As a rule, arcade tokens don’t promise financial returns, which makes them relatively safe from U.S. securities laws. Examples include FLY, the loyalty token for the Blackbird restaurant network, and Pocketful of Quarters, an in-game asset that received relief from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019. Collectible tokens One of the most well-known types of tokens are collectible ones. They can represent things like a work of art, a music piece, or even a concert ticket stub. But for the public, they’re more commonly known by a different name — NFTs , or non-fungible tokens. And while NFTs might seem like another speculative bubble, these tokens may actually have utility within specific contexts. “A collectible token may function as a license or ticket to an event; could be used in a video game (like that sword); or could provide ownership rights with respect to intellectual property.” a16z crypto Because collectable tokens generally relate to finished goods and don’t rely on third-party efforts, they are usually excluded from U.S. securities laws, a16z crypto notes. The well-known NFTs are probably Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks . Asset-backed tokens Asset-backed tokens get their value from a claim on underlying assets. For example, commodities, fiat currency, or even digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. These tokens may be fully or partially collateralized, and they serve various purposes, such as acting as stores of value or hedging instruments. However, unlike collectable tokens, which derive value from the ownership of unique goods, asset-backed tokens function more like financial instruments. Per a16z crypto, the “regulatory treatment of asset-backed tokens, however, depends on their structure and use.” Examples include fiat-backed stablecoins like Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ), liquidity provider tokens like Compound’s C-tokens, or derivative tokens like OPYN’s Squeeth. Memecoins And then, we’ve got memecoins – probably the most well-known ones. These are like the peak of internet chaos. They don’t really do anything useful and are mostly all about memes or whatever community hype is going on. Their fundamentals? Forget it. It’s all about speculation and whatever the market feels like, which means they’re super easy to manipulate or get rug-pulled. Because of how wild they are, memecoins are “generally excluded from U.S. securities laws,” as a16z crypto says, noting though that they’re still “subject to anti-fraud and market manipulation laws.” What makes them stand out? They’ve got zero purpose or real use, and their prices can swing like crazy, which makes them pretty much a no-go for investment. Some famous ones include Pepe ( PEPE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and the new Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin linked to U.S. President Donald Trump.

41244202,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137529,1741283716,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Astonishing AI Coding Revolution: 25% of YC Startups Built on AI-Generated Code,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-coding-yc-startups-revolution/,"The world of startup development is undergoing a seismic shift, fueled by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. Imagine a scenario where budding entrepreneurs can bring their visions to life with codebases almost entirely crafted by AI. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the reality for a stunning quarter of the startups in Y Combinator’s (YC) current cohort. This revelation underscores a monumental change in how new ventures are being built, potentially reshaping the future of tech innovation and even influencing the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain development. The Rise of AI-Generated Code in YC Startups Y Combinator, a name synonymous with successful startups like Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe, is witnessing a groundbreaking trend. Jared Friedman, a managing partner at YC, recently disclosed that an impressive 25% of the startups in their Winter 2025 (W25) batch boast codebases that are a staggering 95% AI-generated code . This isn’t just about using AI for minor code snippets; it’s about fundamentally changing the development process. Friedman clarified that this 95% figure meticulously distinguishes between AI-written code and human-typed code, excluding elements like library imports. Consider this: Highly Technical Founders: These aren’t non-technical individuals outsourcing development. Friedman emphasized that these founders are “highly technical, completely capable of building their own products from scratch.” Dramatic Shift: Just a year ago, these same founders would have painstakingly coded their products manually. Now, AI is the primary architect of their code. Efficiency Unleashed: This shift signifies an unprecedented level of efficiency in the early stages of startup development. This development is particularly relevant to the crypto space, where rapid iteration and technological agility are paramount. Imagine the implications for blockchain projects, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces if development timelines could be drastically reduced using AI coding tools. “Vibe Coding”: Is This the Future of Development? The concept of “vibe coding” is gaining traction, and it’s intrinsically linked to the rise of AI-generated code . As discussed in a YouTube video featuring YC leaders like Garry Tan, Harj Taggar, and Diana Hu, “vibe coding” essentially means using natural language and intuitive instincts to guide AI in generating code. Andrej Karpathy, a prominent AI figure, described it as coding with Large Language Models (LLMs) without getting bogged down in the nitty-gritty of traditional coding syntax. Think of it like this: Intuitive Interface: Instead of writing lines of code, developers can describe what they want to build in plain English. Leveraging LLMs: Powerful AI models translate these natural language instructions into functional code. Focus on Logic, Not Syntax: Developers can concentrate on the core logic and functionality of their applications, leaving the complexities of coding syntax to AI. For the cryptocurrency sector, this could mean faster prototyping of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and other blockchain-based solutions. The barrier to entry for building in the crypto space could be lowered, potentially fostering greater innovation and wider participation. Challenges and Caveats of AI Coding: Are We Ready? While the prospect of AI-generated code is exhilarating, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges. Reports and studies have highlighted potential pitfalls, including: Security Vulnerabilities: AI-generated code isn’t always secure. It can inadvertently introduce security flaws, making applications vulnerable to attacks. Outages and Errors: Bugs and errors are still a reality. AI can make mistakes that lead to application outages or malfunctions. Debugging Demands: Developers often need to spend considerable time debugging and refining AI-generated code. Diana Hu from YC rightly pointed out that even with heavy reliance on AI, the ability to read code and identify bugs remains paramount. She emphasized the need for “taste and knowledge” to discern between good and bad AI-generated code. Garry Tan echoed this sentiment, stressing that classical coding training is still essential for the long-term sustainability of products built with AI. What happens when a startup with 95% AI-generated code scales to millions of users? The debugging capabilities of current AI models are not yet robust enough to handle complex issues independently. Human expertise remains indispensable. Developer Tools and the Future Landscape The excitement surrounding AI-powered coding is palpable in the venture capital world. Startups focused on developer tools that leverage AI are attracting significant investment. Companies like Bolt.new, Codeium, Cursor, Lovable, and Magic have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars in recent funding rounds. This influx of capital underscores the belief that AI is not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in software development. Garry Tan’s assertion, “This isn’t a fad. This isn’t going away. This is the dominant way to code. And if you are not doing it, you might just be left behind,” is a powerful statement. It signals a potential paradigm shift where developers who embrace AI tools gain a significant competitive advantage. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries, adopting these developer tools could mean faster development cycles, more efficient resource allocation, and ultimately, a quicker path to bringing innovative crypto solutions to market. Actionable Insights: Navigating the AI-Driven Development Era So, what are the key takeaways for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors in the age of AI coding ? Embrace AI Tools: Don’t resist the change. Explore and experiment with AI-powered coding tools to enhance your development workflow. Sharpen Code Review Skills: Focus on developing strong code review and debugging skills to effectively manage AI-generated code. Balance AI with Human Expertise: Recognize that AI is a powerful tool, but human oversight and classical coding knowledge remain crucial for building robust and scalable applications. Invest in AI Literacy: For startups and established companies alike, investing in AI literacy for development teams is becoming increasingly important. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest advancements in AI coding tools and best practices for leveraging them effectively. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Leap Forward The fact that a quarter of YC startups are building on codebases predominantly generated by AI is a clear indicator of a revolutionary shift in the tech landscape. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of increased efficiency, faster development cycles, and lower barriers to entry are undeniable. As AI continues to evolve, its role in software development, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, will only become more profound. The era of AI-assisted coding is not just dawning; it’s rapidly accelerating, promising to reshape how we build and interact with technology.

El Salvador first adopted BTC as legal tender in 2021, but recent pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) related to a recently approved $1.4 billion loan agreement has forced the Central American country to pull back on some of its Bitcoin evangelism. Recent amendments to El Salvador’s BTC legislation make the acceptance of Bitcoin voluntary and shed the asset of its “currency” status, though it still is considered “legal tender” in the country. As part of the conditions tied to El Salvador accessing the $1.4 billion loan facility, the IMF also wants the country to halt public sector acquisitions of BTC, dissolve the Fidebitcoin trust fund by July 2025 and cease operations of its Chivo wallet system. Bukele pushed back against those conditions this week. “’This all stops in April.’ ‘This all stops in June.’ ‘This all stops in December.’ No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘Bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now and it won’t stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining.” The country’s National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) has also continued purchasing one BTC a day, with holdings totaling 6,102.18 BTC at time of writing.

Despite an initial surge earlier this week, driven by President Donald Trump’s much-discussed social media update on Bitcoin holdings as a “strategic crypto reserve,” gains quickly reversed amid broader concerns about tariffs in the market. Skepticism has emerged following further analysis of the strategic crypto reserve, JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note. “There is skepticism not only about congressional approval for such a strategic crypto reserve, but also about the feasibility of including smaller tokens other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, given their higher risk and volatility,” he said. Panigirtzoglou also noted that Bitcoin reserves have failed to gain traction at the state level. Proposals for adoption have been rejected in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming due to concerns about risk and volatility. Additionally, central banks in Switzerland and Poland have rejected the idea of including Bitcoin reserves, further dampening institutional sentiment. Related News: There is a New Development for Donald Trump's Tariffs Another factor influencing Bitcoin’s price is the lack of a significant crypto-specific catalyst. “Institutional investors also appear to have reduced their positions due to the lack of positive catalysts and the deterioration of momentum,” Panigirtzoglou said. He added that JPMorgan’s futures indicators for Bitcoin and Ethereum, based on changes in open interest in CME futures contracts, show that there is room for further easing, especially as momentum traders start to create short positions. Signs of weakening demand are reflected in recent capital raises by major players in the sector. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, issued $2 billion in convertible debt, while bitcoin miners such as Mara Holdings have also raised significant capital through equity and debt offerings. However, Panigirtzoglou noted that the terms of these deals have become increasingly investor-friendly over the past month, indicating increased caution and selectivity among investors. *This is not investment advice.

The Dogecoin price experienced instability because 21 essential team members from US Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) suddenly left their positions. The departure of all 21 key team US members from Dogecoin's Department of Government Efficiency triggered both a periodic price drop of 35% as well as investor confusion over the meme coin's sustainable operations. The hybrid trading platform of DTX Exchange achieved over $15.5 million in promising presales which demonstrates industry trust. It stands out to investors because of its stability combined with decentralized and traditional finance capabilities which positions it as a leading market competitor. With the hot presale that DTX Exchange is having with over 720,000 investors, they are looking forward to the $0.36 listing which will bring them 2x on their investment. Additionally to that, those who used a code “LIST2X” got a 100% bonus on their deposits and can even 4x their investment. 21 Employees Exit DOGE Sparking a Selloff The cryptocurrency markets were destabilized when 21 U.S. Dogecoin service employees left their positions which disrupted Dogecoin's ecosystem. The workforce reduction occurred at the same time as increased DOGE selling activity which caused token value to significantly decrease. Members of the investment community examine the project's structure because doubts about sustainability and strategic planning clarity increase across retail and institutional stakeholders. DOGE revealed its speculative instability through the 35% price decline it faced within a month. Record-setting cryptocurrency prices from the past now stand completely reversed due to market fluxes that affect hot trend cryptocurrencies. Market reversals led initial investor valuations to undergo rigorous stress tests after they propelled impressive monetary values to begin with. The DOGE market forecast shows a continuous bearish trend according to analysts who report several technical signals pointing to future depreciation before possible market stabilization. Boilerplate updates from development teams support increased bearish market sentiment which causes current stakeholders to face challenging investment decisions. The developing market environment activates fundamental concerns about Dogecoin's future development direction while challenging its value fundamentals. Market players now thoroughly inspect core protocol performance indicators alongside governance structures because they need specific reference points to stabilize price valuations. DTX Exchange's $15M Presale The presale of DTX Exchange demonstrates market confidence differently than other sectors despite overall market instability. The platform has successfully attracted more than 720,000 investors through its $15.5M capital injection because it offers strategic next-generation trading infrastructure while demonstrating sustainable market demand. People find the centralized liquidity pools combined with decentralized governance features of the exchange platform to be highly attractive. The platform operates with integration between various financial assets including regular equities and digital assets and currency markets and exchange-traded funds which creates one unified trading environment. New participants entering at its early stage can purchase tokens worth $0.18 before the launch and expect them to reach $0.36 during the exchange debut. Investors obtain a 100% bonus on their deposits using a specific code that allows them to maximize their investment potential by 4x. Dogecoin Price Drops 35% For the Month Dogecoin lost 35% of its value during the past month showing how volatile cryptocurrencies can be and its price movements provide clear evidence. The Dogecoin price outlook remains negative following technical analysis indications of potential rebound points because the project faces leadership challenges. The same historical Dogecoin price movements exist yet the current instability within the organization produces skepticism about when a market recovery will happen. The data available from blockchain analytics shows a severe decline in daily active DOGE network participants who have decreased by 62% since June. A significant decrease in Dogecoin network participation strongly indicates that speculative interest has been diminishing across the market. Despite unclear Dogecoin price predictions, the $15.5 million presale success of DTX demonstrates that investors want combinations of regulatory compliance with DeFi innovation in their assets. Market observations indicate the future value of DOGE will rely more on infrastructure development than on speculative trading which represents an essential change in cryptocurrency investment attitudes. Conclusion The crypto market shows a big difference between the current Dogecoin price difficulties and DTX Exchange's successful pre-sale capital acquisition. DTX stands ready for major expansion due to its advanced functionality together with investor market support. The potential of DTX Exchange should be explored by those who want additional information about its platform features.

The XRP coin and Cardano coin were included in this list and among the top gainers. Despite the slight decline, Ripple (XRP) targets a breakout above $3 while Cardano (ADA) leads in gains and eyes a retest of $1. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) , an up-and-coming cryptocurrency at the intersection of DeFi and TradFi, has outperformed the crypto market. It exploded over 800% in the past few months in presale—one of the best ICOs. Set to soar higher after listing, it is among the best cryptos to invest in. DTX Exchange (DTX): 2X Gain on the Launch Date and More Post-Launch DTX Exchange (DTX) , an emerging cryptocurrency, has been one of the best performers these past few months. Despite not being as popular as the Cardano coin or XRP coin, it outperformed with an 800% upswing, rising from an initial price of $0.02. In addition to its impressive performance, it is also in the spotlight for blending DeFi with TradFi. In the bonus and final ICO round, a token is massively underpriced at $0.18. A 2x gain is programmed at the listing price of $0.36, while new buyers can make a 4x profit on the launch date by applying “LIST2X” at the checkout for a 100% increase on purchase. Meanwhile, insiders consider a 50x jump in value before the year’s end as modest, placing it among the best presales to invest in. Also driving interest is its solid fundamentals. Standing at the crossroads between decentralized and traditional finance, it will be the first crypto-native platform to offer traditional financial instruments. Moreover, it will combine key elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges—a hybrid trading platform. Ripple (XRP): Bulls Target a Breakout Above $3 Next The XRP coin shot up from $1.9, a week low, to breaking out above $2. Its last upswing pushed it toward $2.9, although there has been a slight pullback to $2.4. On the bright side, it is in an attractive buy zone—one of the best coins to invest in given the growing institutional appetite. Next on its list is a breakout above $3, supported by key indicators like the MACD Level (12, 26) and 100-EMA. At the same time, bold XRP coin price predictions have been flying, boosting confidence. Startupily, a crypto analyst, predicts $10 before the end of Q1—a bold XRP coin price prediction. Pathfinder, another crypto analyst on Twitter, has $10 to $20 as their XRP coin price prediction this cycle, placing it among the altcoins to watch out for. Despite this, the new DeFi coin DTX Exchange (DTX) has higher upside potential. As a new and low-cap coin, it has plenty of room to run, contributing to the rising interest among savvy investors. Cardano (ADA) Maintains 25% Weekly Gain Despite the pullback, the Cardano coin leads in gain with a 25% rally on the weekly chart. It crossed $1.1 but has retreated below $1, linked to profit-taking among investors. With a complete bullish reversal on the cards, it is a good crypto to buy at the current market price. Meanwhile, top analysts have been throwing out bold Cardano coin price predictions. Bull Breeza, bullish on the Layer-1 coin, targets $12 this bull run. A modest Cardano coin price prediction was given by IKC Trading—$6 this cycle. Despite the Cardano coin being announced as part of a US crypto reserve, its upside potential is limited due to its large market size. In contrast, DTX, a low-cap coin, could soar as high as 50x this bull run—a more compelling alternative. DTX Exchange (DTX): Higher Upside Potential Than Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) Unsurprisingly, DTX Exchange has higher growth prospects than the Cardano coin and XRP coin as a low-cap. Moreover, it is backed by a bullish narrative—transforming the $10 billion global trading landscape by blending DeFi and TradFi. Poised for massive adoption and growth, it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in, soaring past $15.5 million in early funding.

41244729,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137514,1741284604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Japan Crypto Regulation: Tax Cuts and ETF Approval on the Horizon,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-crypto-regulation-tax-etf/,"Exciting news is breaking from the Land of the Rising Sun! Japan, a nation known for its technological prowess and forward-thinking approach, is poised to potentially revolutionize its cryptocurrency landscape. Imagine a world where crypto taxes are significantly slashed, and the doors are flung open for crypto ETFs. Well, that future might be closer than you think, thanks to a groundbreaking proposal from Japan’s ruling party. Let’s dive into the details of this potentially game-changing development and explore what it could mean for the crypto world, particularly focusing on Japan crypto regulation and its ripple effects. What’s the Buzz About Japan Crypto Regulation? The current crypto climate in many parts of the world is often characterized by regulatory uncertainty and, let’s be honest, sometimes even outright hostility. But Japan seems to be taking a different, more welcoming path. According to Astar (ASTR) founder Sota Watanabe, a prominent voice in the crypto space, Japan’s ruling party is proposing a significant overhaul of its Japan crypto regulation framework. This isn’t just minor tweaking; we’re talking about a potential paradigm shift. The proposal aims to bring crypto under the umbrella of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, a move that could legitimize and streamline the industry within the existing financial system. Think of it like this: currently, crypto regulations can be scattered and sometimes unclear. This new framework promises to consolidate and clarify the rules of the game, creating a more predictable and business-friendly environment. This is a stark contrast to regions where regulatory crackdowns and ambiguity stifle innovation. Japan’s approach could be a beacon of hope, signaling a more mature and accepting stance towards digital assets. Here’s a breakdown of the key proposed changes: New Regulatory Framework: Crypto assets will be regulated under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, providing a clear legal structure. Asset Classification: Cryptocurrencies are proposed to be classified as a new asset type, distinctly separate from securities. This is crucial because securities regulations are often more stringent and less suited to the nature of cryptocurrencies. Potential Tax Cuts: Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect is the proposed reduction in crypto taxes. We’ll delve deeper into crypto tax cuts Japan in the next section. Crypto ETF Approval: The framework opens the door for the approval of crypto Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in Japan. This could be a massive catalyst for institutional investment and broader market adoption. Sota Watanabe himself has hailed this proposal as a “major win” for the industry, emphasizing the strong collaboration between government and industry leaders in shaping these regulations. This collaborative spirit is key, as it suggests that the regulations are being crafted with a deep understanding of the crypto industry’s needs and potential, rather than being imposed from above without industry input. Crypto Tax Cuts Japan: A Game Changer for Investors? Let’s talk about the money – specifically, taxes. Currently, Japan’s crypto tax regime is notoriously steep, with rates reaching as high as 55%. This has been a significant pain point for crypto investors and businesses in Japan, often cited as a major barrier to wider adoption and innovation. Imagine handing over more than half of your crypto gains to taxes – it’s enough to make any investor think twice! The proposed crypto tax cuts Japan are a breath of fresh air. The plan is to slash the tax rate down to a much more palatable 20%. This is a dramatic reduction and could have profound implications. Why is this such a big deal? Increased Investor Appeal: Lower taxes make crypto investments significantly more attractive. A 20% tax rate is far more competitive and aligns more closely with capital gains taxes in other developed economies. This could draw in both domestic and international investors. Boost to Trading Activity: High taxes can discourage trading and investment. With lower taxes, we could see a surge in crypto trading volume and market activity in Japan. Investors will be more incentivized to participate in the market knowing they can keep a larger portion of their profits. Attracting Talent and Businesses: A favorable tax environment can attract crypto talent and businesses to Japan. Entrepreneurs and developers might be more inclined to set up shop in a jurisdiction where their crypto ventures are not heavily taxed. Leveling the Playing Field: The current high tax rate puts Japan at a disadvantage compared to countries with more crypto-friendly tax policies. These crypto tax cuts Japan aim to level the playing field and make Japan a more competitive hub for the digital asset industry. To put it into perspective, a tax cut from 55% to 20% is not just a minor adjustment; it’s a seismic shift. It sends a clear message that Japan is serious about fostering a thriving crypto ecosystem and is willing to create a tax environment that is conducive to growth and innovation. This could be a major catalyst for unlocking the full potential of the crypto market in Japan. Will Japan Crypto ETF Approval Become a Reality? ETFs, or Exchange Traded Funds, have revolutionized traditional finance by providing easy and accessible ways for investors to gain exposure to various asset classes. The prospect of a Japan crypto ETF is generating significant excitement within the crypto community. Why are crypto ETFs so important, and why is their potential approval in Japan such a big deal? Firstly, let’s understand what a crypto ETF is. In simple terms, a crypto ETF is an investment fund that tracks the price of one or more cryptocurrencies. It’s traded on traditional stock exchanges, making it easy for investors to buy and sell shares, just like regular stocks. This accessibility is a game-changer for crypto adoption. Here’s why Japan crypto ETF approval could be transformative: Increased Institutional Investment: Many institutional investors, such as pension funds, hedge funds, and mutual funds, are restricted from directly investing in cryptocurrencies due to regulatory hurdles and internal mandates. Crypto ETFs provide a regulated and familiar investment vehicle that can overcome these barriers. Approval in Japan could unlock a massive influx of institutional capital into the crypto market. Simplified Retail Investment: For retail investors who find the process of buying and storing cryptocurrencies directly daunting or complex, crypto ETFs offer a simpler alternative. They can invest in crypto through their existing brokerage accounts, without needing to worry about wallets, private keys, or exchanges. Enhanced Market Liquidity and Stability: The introduction of crypto ETFs can significantly increase market liquidity and potentially reduce volatility. Increased trading volume and institutional participation tend to stabilize markets over time. Mainstream Adoption: Crypto ETFs represent a major step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. They bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world, making digital assets more accessible and palatable to a wider audience. While the proposal doesn’t guarantee immediate Japan crypto ETF approval, it lays the groundwork by establishing a regulatory framework that can accommodate such financial products. If Japan does indeed approve crypto ETFs, it could become one of the first major economies in Asia to do so, potentially positioning itself as a leading crypto hub in the region and globally. This move could also put pressure on other countries to follow suit, accelerating the global adoption of crypto ETFs. How Does Crypto Asset Classification Impact the Market? The devil is often in the details, and in the world of regulation, asset classification is a crucial detail. The proposal to classify cryptocurrencies as a “new asset type,” distinct from securities, is a significant and positive development. Why does this matter, and how does this crypto asset classification impact the market? The distinction between securities and other asset types is fundamental in financial regulation. Securities are typically subject to stricter regulations, disclosure requirements, and investor protection measures. Classifying cryptocurrencies as securities could impose burdensome compliance costs and potentially stifle innovation. However, recognizing them as a new asset type allows for the development of regulations that are tailored to the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies. Here’s why this crypto asset classification is beneficial: Tailored Regulations: Treating crypto as a new asset class allows regulators to create rules that are specifically designed for digital assets, rather than trying to force them into the mold of existing securities regulations. This can lead to more effective and less restrictive regulations. Reduced Regulatory Burden: Avoiding securities classification can reduce the regulatory burden on crypto businesses and projects. This can foster innovation and encourage the growth of the crypto industry in Japan. Clarity and Legal Certainty: Clear asset classification provides legal certainty for businesses and investors. It removes ambiguity and helps stakeholders understand the regulatory landscape, fostering confidence and investment. Encouraging Innovation: A more flexible regulatory approach, enabled by the new asset class designation, can encourage innovation in the crypto space. It allows for the development of new crypto products and services without being stifled by overly rigid securities regulations. By opting for a new asset class designation, Japan is signaling a nuanced and forward-thinking approach to crypto asset classification . It acknowledges that cryptocurrencies are not simply digital versions of traditional securities and require a distinct regulatory framework. This approach could serve as a model for other jurisdictions grappling with how to regulate this nascent asset class. Astar Crypto Japan: Leading the Charge? The announcement of these proposed regulations came directly from Sota Watanabe, the founder of Astar (ASTR), a prominent blockchain platform with strong ties to Japan. Watanabe’s active role in communicating these developments highlights the close relationship between the Astar crypto Japan community and the regulatory process. What role does Astar and figures like Watanabe play in shaping Japan’s crypto future? Astar Network is a multi-chain smart contract platform that aims to be a hub for Web3 innovation. It has a strong focus on interoperability and scalability, and it has been actively building partnerships and projects within the Japanese ecosystem. Watanabe’s involvement in the regulatory discussions underscores the growing influence of Astar crypto Japan and the broader Japanese crypto industry in shaping government policy. Here’s how Astar crypto Japan and industry leaders are contributing: Industry Advocacy: Figures like Sota Watanabe are acting as strong advocates for the crypto industry, engaging in dialogue with policymakers and educating them about the potential benefits of crypto and the need for sensible regulations. Collaboration with Government: The “strong cooperation between the government and industry leaders” mentioned by Watanabe is a key factor in the positive direction of Japan’s crypto regulation. This collaborative approach ensures that regulations are informed by real-world industry experience and needs. Promoting Innovation: Projects like Astar Network are at the forefront of crypto innovation in Japan. Their success and growth demonstrate the potential of the Japanese crypto ecosystem and provide a compelling case for supportive regulations. Global Influence: The actions of Astar crypto Japan and other Japanese crypto leaders are being watched globally. Japan’s regulatory approach could influence other countries and contribute to the development of best practices for crypto regulation worldwide. The prominent role of Astar crypto Japan and its founder in these regulatory developments is a testament to the growing maturity and influence of the Japanese crypto industry. It signals a shift towards a more collaborative and industry-driven approach to regulation, which is likely to be more effective and beneficial in the long run. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Crypto in Japan? Japan’s proposed new crypto regulations, with the potential for significant tax cuts and the approval of crypto ETFs, represent a potentially transformative moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This isn’t just about regulatory adjustments; it’s about Japan signaling its intention to become a leading hub for crypto innovation and investment. The combination of a clearer regulatory framework, lower taxes, and the prospect of ETFs could unlock significant growth and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in Japan and beyond. While these are still proposals and need to be passed into law, the positive tone and industry collaboration suggest a strong likelihood of implementation. If these changes come to fruition, Japan could very well emerge as a shining example of how governments can embrace and regulate cryptocurrencies in a way that fosters innovation, protects investors, and drives economic growth. Keep a close watch on Japan – the Land of the Rising Sun may be ushering in a new dawn for the crypto world.

Imagine a world where land ownership is indisputable, transparent, and readily accessible – this is the vision Dantewada is bringing to life by leveraging the power of the Avalanche blockchain to secure over 700,000 land records. This initiative is not just about digitizing documents; it’s about building a tamper-proof foundation for land governance, directly impacting the lives of citizens and setting a precedent for other regions globally. Let’s dive into how this innovative project is unfolding and what it means for the future of land management. Why Choose Avalanche Blockchain for Land Records? The decision to utilize Avalanche blockchain land records wasn’t arbitrary. Avalanche stands out in the crowded blockchain space due to its impressive speed, scalability, and eco-friendliness. For a project of this magnitude, dealing with hundreds of thousands of records, these characteristics are not just beneficial, they are essential. Here’s a breakdown of why Avalanche was the ideal choice: Speed and Scalability: Avalanche boasts incredibly fast transaction finality, meaning records can be added and verified swiftly. This is crucial for efficient land administration where timely updates and access are paramount. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to some older blockchains, Avalanche offers significantly lower transaction fees, making it a cost-effective solution for large-scale data storage and management. This is particularly important for government initiatives aiming for broad accessibility without burdening the public with high costs. Security and Tamper-Proof Nature: Blockchain technology, by its very design, offers robust security. Once data is recorded on the Avalanche blockchain , it becomes virtually immutable, ensuring the integrity of digital land records and preventing fraudulent alterations. Environmental Friendliness: Avalanche is known for its energy efficiency, operating on a proof-of-stake mechanism that consumes far less energy than older proof-of-work blockchains. This aligns with global sustainability goals and makes it a responsible choice for long-term infrastructure projects. Digitizing India Land Registry: A Transformative Step for Dantewada India’s land registry system has historically been plagued by inefficiencies, corruption, and disputes arising from outdated and often manually maintained records. The move to digitizing India land registry is a monumental undertaking, and Dantewada’s initiative serves as a beacon of progress. What are the immediate and long-term benefits of this digitization? Benefits of Digital Land Records on Blockchain: Benefit Description Enhanced Transparency All land records stored on the blockchain land management system are transparent and accessible to authorized parties. This reduces opacity and fosters trust in the system. Reduced Land Disputes The tamper-proof nature of blockchain significantly minimizes the scope for manipulation and fraud, leading to fewer land disputes and clearer ownership. Increased Efficiency Digital records are easier to access, update, and manage compared to paper-based systems. This streamlines administrative processes and reduces bureaucratic delays. Improved Governance A transparent and efficient land registry system is crucial for good governance. It enables better planning, resource allocation, and revenue generation for the local administration. Empowerment of Citizens Easy access to land records empowers citizens, allowing them to verify their ownership and conduct transactions with greater confidence and security. Dantewada Land Records: A Case Study in Blockchain Implementation Dantewada, a district in Chhattisgarh, might seem like an unlikely pioneer in blockchain adoption. However, this region’s embrace of Dantewada land records on Avalanche highlights the technology’s potential to reach even the most remote areas and address fundamental governance challenges. How did Dantewada achieve this? The district administration, in collaboration with technology partners, undertook a meticulous process of digitizing over 700,000 existing land records. This involved: Data Collection and Verification: Gathering physical land records from various sources and verifying their accuracy. Digitization: Converting paper records into digital formats, ensuring data integrity and readability. Blockchain Integration: Developing a system to securely store these digital land records on the Avalanche blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency. User Interface Development: Creating user-friendly interfaces for officials and potentially citizens to access and manage these records (within defined access parameters). Training and Capacity Building: Educating local officials and staff on how to use and manage the new blockchain-based system. This multi-stage process demonstrates a commitment to thoroughness and long-term sustainability. It’s not just about uploading data; it’s about building a robust and reliable system that can serve the community for years to come. Challenges and the Path Forward for Blockchain Land Management While the Dantewada project is a resounding success, implementing blockchain land management systems is not without its challenges. What hurdles need to be overcome for wider adoption? Digital Literacy and Infrastructure: Ensuring widespread digital literacy and access to necessary infrastructure (internet, devices) is crucial for the system to be truly inclusive and accessible to all citizens, especially in rural areas. Data Migration and Legacy Systems: Integrating blockchain systems with existing legacy land record systems can be complex and require careful data migration strategies. Regulatory Framework: Clear legal and regulatory frameworks are needed to recognize and legitimize blockchain-based land records, ensuring their legal validity and acceptance in courts and other institutions. Scalability for National Implementation: While Avalanche is scalable, deploying such a system nationwide across a vast and diverse country like India will require significant planning, resources, and coordination. Privacy and Data Security: While blockchain enhances security, robust measures are still needed to protect sensitive personal data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations. Addressing these challenges will pave the way for broader adoption of blockchain in land administration, not just in India but globally. The Dantewada example provides valuable lessons and a working model for other regions to emulate. The Future is Secure: Blockchain Transforming Land Governance The Dantewada district’s pioneering use of Avalanche blockchain for land records is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a fundamental shift towards transparent, secure, and efficient governance. By embracing innovation and tackling real-world challenges head-on, Dantewada is setting a powerful example. This initiative showcases the transformative potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize not just finance, but also essential public services. As more regions and nations witness the success of projects like this, we can anticipate a future where blockchain plays an increasingly vital role in securing property rights, fostering trust, and empowering citizens worldwide.

Coutts tells his 35,600 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks a weakening US dollar and a massive sell-off in the crypto markets sets Bitcoin up for a bullish reversal by May, when it may print new all-time highs. According to the Real Vision analyst, the strength or weakness of the US dollar as measured by the US Dollar Index (DXY), a benchmark of the value of the US dollar compared to a basket of six major currencies, determines Bitcoin’s price direction. When the DXY is strong, it is often seen as a sign that the US economy is strong and that the US dollar is a safe haven asset. This can lead to selling pressure in cryptocurrencies, as investors move their money into the US dollar. “This week had it all. The DXY saw its fourth largest negative three-day move – massively liquidity-positive. Just as Bitcoin nuked and had its worst February in a decade. Meanwhile, in altcoin land, the Top 200 crypto index puked one more time. The chart shows that 365 days of new lows hit 47%, a hallmark of capitulation in a bull cycle. The stage is set for a new all-time high in Bitcoin and Top 200 aggregate market cap by May.” Source: Jamie Coutts/X He suggests that a bottom may now be forming in the altcoin market after the major selloff that could lead to some alts having explosive rallies to new all-time highs (ATHs). “I expect some alts to make new ATHs this cycle.” He also shares a chart showing that the three previous times the DXY fell by a similar percentage change Bitcoin went on explosive rallies. “Don’t think people understand the significance of the DXY move in the past three days and what it means for Bitcoin.” Source: Jamie Coutts/X The DXY is currently at 104 while Bitcoin is trading for $88,787 at time of writing, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

Bitwise, a well-known name in cryptocurrency asset management and the issuer of a spot Bitcoin ETF, has just launched a groundbreaking product: the Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP (BTCG). This innovative Exchange Traded Product (ETP) is now trading on major European exchanges, Euronext Paris and Amsterdam, marking a significant step in the evolution of crypto investment strategies. Let’s dive into what makes this Bitcoin and Gold ETP so noteworthy and how it could potentially reshape your investment portfolio. What is the Bitwise Bitcoin & Gold ETP (BTCG)? The Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP (BTCG) is not just another crypto product; it’s a carefully constructed financial instrument designed to offer investors a balanced exposure to both Bitcoin and gold. This ETP tracks a unique index that dynamically allocates between Bitcoin and gold. But how does it decide when to lean more towards Bitcoin or gold? It’s all based on Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted performance . This sophisticated approach aims to optimize returns while managing risk effectively, especially in volatile markets. Here’s a breakdown of the key features: Dual Asset Exposure: BTCG offers exposure to two distinct asset classes – Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, and gold, a traditional safe-haven asset. Risk-Adjusted Strategy: The index intelligently shifts between Bitcoin and gold based on Bitcoin’s volatility and return profile. When Bitcoin shows strong risk-adjusted performance, the ETP may increase its Bitcoin allocation. Conversely, in times of higher Bitcoin volatility or underperformance, it may shift towards gold. Euronext Listing: Being listed on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam provides accessibility to a wide range of European investors, making it easier to invest in this diversified strategy. Issuer Reputation: Bitwise is a reputable cryptocurrency asset manager known for its expertise in digital assets and for launching one of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Why Combine Bitcoin and Gold in an ETP? The rationale behind combining Bitcoin and gold in a single investment product stems from their unique, yet potentially complementary, characteristics. While Bitcoin is often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ its price action often correlates more with risk assets like tech stocks than with traditional gold. Gold, on the other hand, is traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, often performing well during times of economic uncertainty or market downturns. Here’s a table highlighting the contrasting and complementary aspects of Bitcoin and Gold: Feature Bitcoin Gold Asset Class Cryptocurrency (Digital Asset) Precious Metal (Traditional Asset) Correlation Higher correlation with tech stocks and risk assets Lower correlation with equities, often negative correlation during crises Volatility High Volatility Lower Volatility Growth Potential Potentially High Growth (but also high risk) Moderate Growth, Store of Value Use Case Digital Store of Value, Transactional Currency (potential) Store of Value, Inflation Hedge, Industrial Use By combining these two assets, the Bitwise Bitcoin & Gold ETP aims to create a more robust and diversification strategy . The dynamic allocation model further enhances this by adjusting the portfolio based on market conditions, potentially capturing Bitcoin’s upside while mitigating downside risk with gold. Benefits of Investing in a Bitcoin and Gold ETP Investing in an ETP like BTCG offers several potential advantages, especially for investors looking to gain exposure to both Bitcoin and gold without the complexities of direct ownership. Let’s explore some key benefits of Bitcoin ETP and gold ETP combinations: Simplified Diversification: BTCG provides instant diversification across two distinct asset classes with a single investment. This is far simpler than buying and managing Bitcoin and gold separately. Risk Management: The dynamic allocation strategy based on Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted performance is designed to manage portfolio risk. By shifting towards gold during periods of higher Bitcoin risk, the ETP aims to cushion potential downturns. Accessibility and Convenience: ETPs trade on regulated exchanges like Euronext, making them easily accessible to a wide range of investors through traditional brokerage accounts. This removes the need for crypto wallets or physical gold storage. Professional Management: Bitwise, as an experienced asset manager, handles the complexities of index tracking, rebalancing, and custody, allowing investors to benefit from professional management. Potential for Enhanced Returns: By dynamically allocating to the asset with better risk-adjusted performance, the ETP aims to optimize returns compared to a static allocation or investing in just one of the assets. Are there any Challenges to Consider? While the Bitwise Bitcoin & Gold ETP presents a compelling investment proposition, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges: Management Fees: ETPs typically involve management fees, which can impact overall returns. Investors should carefully consider the fee structure of BTCG and compare it to alternatives. Tracking Error: Like all index-tracking products, BTCG may experience tracking error, meaning its performance might slightly deviate from the underlying index due to various factors like transaction costs and fund management. Market Volatility: While the ETP aims to manage risk, both Bitcoin and gold markets can be volatile. The dynamic allocation strategy is not foolproof and cannot eliminate all risks. Index Methodology: The effectiveness of the ETP is heavily reliant on the index methodology. Investors should understand how the risk-adjusted performance is calculated and whether it aligns with their investment objectives. New Product Risk: As a newly launched product, BTCG’s track record is limited. It’s crucial to monitor its performance and how it behaves in different market conditions over time. Examples of Market Conditions and ETP Behavior To understand how the Bitwise Bitcoin & Gold ETP might behave, let’s consider a few hypothetical market scenarios: Scenario 1: Bitcoin Bull Market: If Bitcoin experiences a strong bull run with relatively low volatility, the index is likely to increase its allocation to Bitcoin, aiming to capture the upside potential. Scenario 2: Bitcoin Bear Market with High Volatility: During a Bitcoin bear market characterized by high volatility, the index is expected to reduce its Bitcoin allocation and increase exposure to gold, seeking to preserve capital and reduce portfolio volatility. Scenario 3: Stable Bitcoin Market, Rising Inflation: In a scenario where Bitcoin price is relatively stable but inflation is rising, gold might outperform Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. The index could potentially shift slightly towards gold to reflect this. Scenario 4: Broad Market Uncertainty and Risk-Off Sentiment: During periods of global economic uncertainty or risk-off sentiment in broader markets, both Bitcoin and gold might see increased demand as safe-haven assets. The ETP’s allocation would depend on the relative risk-adjusted performance of Bitcoin at that time. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the launch of the Bitwise Bitcoin & Gold ETP, here are some actionable insights for investors: Evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current portfolio allocation and determine if adding a diversified product like BTCG aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Understand the Strategy: Thoroughly understand the ETP’s index methodology and how it dynamically allocates between Bitcoin and gold based on risk-adjusted performance. Consider Long-Term Perspective: ETPs like BTCG are generally more suitable for long-term investment strategies. Consider your investment horizon and whether this product fits within it. Monitor Performance and Fees: Keep an eye on the ETP’s performance, tracking error, and expense ratio to ensure it continues to meet your expectations. Consult a Financial Advisor: Before making any investment decisions, especially in new and complex products, consult with a qualified financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your financial situation. Conclusion: A Novel Approach to Crypto Investment The launch of the Bitwise Bitcoin & Gold ETP (BTCG) on Euronext marks an exciting development in the world of crypto investment . By combining Bitcoin and gold in a dynamically managed ETP, Bitwise offers investors a novel approach to diversification and risk management within the digital asset space. Whether this innovative product will become a staple in investment portfolios remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly represents a creative step forward in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the evolving world of cryptocurrencies. As the market matures, products like BTCG could pave the way for more sophisticated and balanced investment solutions, making crypto more accessible and appealing to a wider range of investors.

Qubetics’ crypto presale continues to dominate headlines as it smashes past $14.6 million, attracting thousands of investors eager for high returns. Injective is battling market volatility, but its current downturn could present an opportunity for long-term investors looking for a strategic entry point. Meanwhile, AAVE’s $1 million weekly buyback proposal and new governance initiative fuel optimism, reinforcing its position as a dominant force in the DeFi sector. With these projects gaining momentum, they stand out as the top coins to join today for massive return potential in 2025 . For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes Qubetics’ crypto presale attractive to investors? Qubetics’ $TICS presale has already raised over $14.6 million, drawing in more than 22,200 investors. With its current price at $0.0976 and final-stage projections suggesting a climb to $0.25, investors could see a 155.93% return before its mainnet launch, which could drive even greater gains. Is Injective (INJ) a good investment despite its recent price drop? Injective has been experiencing a volatile market cycle, dropping over 16% in a single day. However, crypto investors often see such dips as opportunities to buy at a discount. If INJ finds strong support and reverses its trend, it could present high upside potential in the coming months. How will AAVE’s buyback proposal affect its price? AAVE’s weekly $1 million buyback will reduce the circulating supply of its tokens, which could drive price appreciation over time. Additionally, the introduction of the Aave Finance Committee (AFC) aims to improve the project’s financial sustainability, potentially making AAVE a more attractive long-term investment.

The scale of this transaction has attracted attention from market participants and analysts, prompting discussions about potential implications for liquidity, price action, and market sentiment. The nature of large cryptocurrency transfers often leads to speculation, particularly when assets are moved from exchanges to unknown wallets. Such movements may indicate an entity securing holdings in private storage, over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, or strategic positioning by institutional players. 95,254,697 #XRP (235,584,856 USD) transferred from #OKX to unknown wallet https://t.co/p6JRQA7upU — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) March 5, 2025 Market Reaction and Community Interpretation Following the alert, cryptocurrency enthusiasts on social media responded with various theories regarding the intent behind the transfer. A user known as Agent Guru commented , “Big transfer alert, huh? 95M XRP on the move. Always a sign of something brewing. Keep an eye on those wallets—could be a whale positioning for a big play or just a game of hot potato. In the DeFi world, liquidity shifts like this can shake things up.” This perspective suggests that the transaction may be linked to market positioning by a high-net-worth entity, often referred to as a “whale.” Given the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem’s sensitivity to liquidity shifts, large transfers can contribute to volatility or signal upcoming strategic moves. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Layo, speculated on a broader market impact, stating , “The wolves are circling, my friends! A massive #XRP transfer just went down from OKX . What’s going on in the shadows? Is this a hint of something bigger to come? Stay vigilant, and stay informed!” Possible Explanations for the Transfer While the exact reason behind this transfer remains unclear, several possibilities exist. One explanation is that the entity behind the transaction sought to secure assets in a private wallet, a practice often seen among investors prioritizing custody over exchange storage. Another possibility is that this transfer was part of an OTC deal, where large transactions occur outside public order books to prevent direct market impact. Additionally, it is worth considering whether the movement is related to liquidity redistribution within the ecosystem, potentially tied to institutional players engaging in strategic positioning. The lack of details on the recipient’s wallet further fuels speculation. Given XRP’s role in cross-border payments and institutional transactions, it remains possible that this transfer is tied to a broader financial strategy rather than an immediate market-moving event. However, traders and analysts will likely monitor the wallet’s activity closely to determine whether further transactions follow or if there are signs of accumulation or liquidation.

The move comes in response to concerns from the crypto industry, which has accused government agencies of cutting them off from the financial system. Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said the legislation would “curtail the weaponization of federal banking agencies by eliminating the ability for regulators to use reputational risk as a component of supervision.” He added: As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I have made addressing debanking a top priority. This discriminatory and un-American practice should concern everyone, which is why I’ve led my colleagues in working to find tangible solutions. The Financial Integrity and Regulation Management Act (FIRM Act) has the backing of several Republican senators, including Mike Crapo, Cynthia Lummis, Katie Britt, Bernie Moreno, Thom Tillis, John Kennedy, and Bill Hagerty. Under the Federal Reserve’s definition, reputational risk refers to the “potential that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.” Scott argued that regulators have abused this concept to target businesses based on political bias. The bill seeks to eliminate all references to reputational risk in regulatory supervision and prevent its use in future rules or guidance. According to a Senate Banking Committee spokesperson, the proposal has support from the American Bankers Association, the Blockchain Association, and the Bank Policy Institute. Crypto debanking concerns The legislation follows mounting complaints from the digital asset industry, which claims that crypto firms face significant hurdles in securing and maintaining bank accounts in the US. The issue has gained traction among lawmakers as crypto companies allege that banks are under regulatory pressure to distance themselves from the sector. Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures, has described the situation as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” drawing parallels to a 2013 US Department of Justice initiative that sought to restrict banking access for high-risk industries, including payday lenders and firearm dealers. Bank executives have expressed concerns about the risks associated with serving crypto firms, with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warning that banks could face millions in fines if compliance missteps occur. Several Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have stated that regulatory scrutiny of digital assets was justified following the collapse of major firms, fraud charges against industry leaders, frequent hacks of digital asset platforms, and overall market volatility. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently acknowledged the need to re-evaluate current policies. “I will commit to working with you on that, we do try to avoid excessive burden,” Powell said during a February Senate Banking Committee hearing. “Look, I think it’s fair to take a fresh look, frankly, on debanking.” The post Senate Banking Chair moves to end debanking of crypto, ‘risky’ industries appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Crypto regulation|USA,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-03-06 19:19:24

Investors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly awaiting signs of momentum. The crypto market buzzes with speculation, creating a sense of anticipation. Which digital currencies are poised for significant growth next? The unfolding developments promise to be revealing. Bitcoin Market Pulse: Recent Trends and Key Levels Bitcoin's monthly change shows a decline of 9.45% paired with an impressive six-month gain of 69.74% and a recent week jump of 9.38%. The numbers reveal a mix of short-term slips and strong long-term recovery, indicating price swings that capture market volatility alongside robust gains. These figures reflect shifting momentum and investor reactions over the past month and half-year Bitcoin trades between roughly 74047 and 98803. The immediate support near 63733 and resistance around 113244 set clear trading bounds. Negative oscillator readings are countered by a near-neutral RSI, suggesting neither bulls nor bears are firmly in control. A trading approach may involve buying if the price respects support or considering exits when trending toward resistance, always monitoring for potential breakouts within these levels. Ethereum Market Trends and Key Levels Ethereum experienced a sharp decline over the past month with a 20.30% drop, while its six-month performance managed a modest 3.30% gain. The price has shown volatility, oscillating within a range of $1766.31 to $3020.97, reflecting both recent bearish pressure and some underlying resilience over time. Recent weekly changes seem less dramatic, hinting at short-term consolidation following the downturn. Current price action centers around key levels with support at $1294.44 and resistance near $3803.76, while a second resistance at $5058.42 offers an upper boundary. Bears currently dominate with negative momentum readings and an oscillator at -340.37, making this range a cautious area for trading opportunities. Conclusion BTC has been showing strong upward momentum, and its journey to 100K seems more realistic than ever. Attention is now turning to ETH as it aims to recover to the 3,500 mark. Both coins are benefiting from increased interest and adoption. Market conditions and investor sentiment will play significant roles in determining the timelines. While BTC sets the pace, the performance of ETH will be closely watched. Investors are keen to see how quickly these milestones can be reached.

41247231,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137554,1741288962,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unlock Potential Gains: Ethereum’s MVRV Z-Score Hits Rock Bottom, Igniting Hope",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-mvrv-zscore-market-bottom/,"Is the crypto winter finally thawing? For Ethereum enthusiasts, there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon. A key on-chain metric, the Ethereum Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, has just plunged to a 17-month low, a level historically associated with significant undervaluation and potential market bottoms. Could this be the signal smart investors have been waiting for to strategically position themselves for the next Ethereum surge? Decoding the Ethereum MVRV Z-Score: Is it a Buy Signal? The Ethereum MVRV Z-Score might sound like complex jargon, but it’s a powerful tool for gauging market sentiment and identifying potential buying opportunities. Think of it as a temperature gauge for the Ethereum market. It essentially tells us whether Ethereum is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market capitalization (market value) to its realized capitalization (realized value). Realized cap attempts to value ETH based on the price each coin last moved on the blockchain, offering a potentially more accurate reflection of investor investment than market cap alone. The Z-Score part adds another layer of insight. It uses standard deviation to normalize the difference between market cap and realized cap. In simpler terms, a low MVRV Z-Score suggests that the market cap is significantly lower than the realized cap, indicating potential Ethereum undervaluation . Conversely, a high score might signal overvaluation and a potential price correction. Currently, as reported by Glassnode, the Ethereum MVRV Z-Score has descended into territory that historically precedes bullish reversals. Let’s break down what this means: 17-Month Low: This isn’t just a minor dip. Hitting a 17-month low signifies a substantial correction and prolonged period of market pressure. Approaching the Green Zone: The “green zone” is a term often used by analysts to describe the lower end of the MVRV Z-Score range, historically indicating undervaluation. When the score enters this zone, it suggests that Ethereum is trading at a discount compared to its on-chain value. Historical Precedent: The crucial point! Similar dips in the Ethereum MVRV Z-Score in October 2023, December 2022, and the infamous March 2020 crash were followed by significant ETH price rallies. This historical pattern lends credence to the current low score being a potential bottom signal. Why is the MVRV Z-Score Important for Crypto Investors? Understanding and monitoring metrics like the Ethereum MVRV Z-Score offers several key benefits for cryptocurrency investors: Identifying Potential Entry Points: As highlighted, a low MVRV Z-Score can act as a powerful signal for identifying potential market bottoms and strategic entry points for buying Ethereum. It helps investors move beyond just price charts and consider on-chain fundamentals. Assessing Market Sentiment: The MVRV Z-Score reflects the overall sentiment of the Ethereum market. A low score indicates widespread fear and potential capitulation, which can ironically be the best time to buy as the market is likely oversold. Risk Management: Conversely, a high MVRV Z-Score can warn of potential market tops and overvaluation, prompting investors to consider taking profits or reducing their exposure to ETH. Data-Driven Decision Making: In the volatile world of crypto, relying on data-driven metrics like the MVRV Z-Score can lead to more informed and less emotionally driven investment decisions. Whale Accumulation: Are Smart Money Investors Piling into ETH? Adding further fuel to the bullish narrative is the significant ETH accumulation activity observed on-chain. Data reveals that addresses holding substantial amounts of Ethereum – particularly whales – are aggressively buying the dip. Record Daily Inflows: ETH accumulation addresses have witnessed their highest daily inflows in years. This indicates a strong influx of ETH into wallets known for long-term holding, suggesting a belief in Ethereum’s future potential. Whale Behavior (1,000–10,000 ETH Holders): The data specifically points to whales holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH as being particularly active buyers. These are sophisticated investors with significant capital and resources, and their accumulation patterns are often seen as a strong indicator of market direction. “Buying the Dip” Mentality: The current market conditions, with the MVRV Z-Score signaling undervaluation, appear to be triggering a classic “buy the dip” strategy among these large holders. They are capitalizing on lower prices to increase their ETH holdings, anticipating future price appreciation. Navigating the Crypto Market Bottom: Challenges and Considerations While the signals from the crypto market bottom indicators like the MVRV Z-Score and whale accumulation are encouraging, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective and acknowledge the inherent challenges: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Even with positive on-chain metrics, unforeseen macroeconomic events, regulatory changes, or black swan events can trigger further price drops. No Guarantees: Historical patterns are not guarantees of future performance. While past MVRV Z-Score dips preceded rallies, there’s no certainty that this pattern will repeat exactly. Identifying the True Bottom: Pinpointing the absolute bottom of a market is incredibly difficult, if not impossible. The MVRV Z-Score provides a signal of potential undervaluation, but the price could still decline further before a sustained recovery. Risk Management is Key: Investing in cryptocurrencies, especially during market downturns, carries significant risk. Proper risk management strategies, including diversification and only investing what you can afford to lose, are paramount. Further Research Required: The MVRV Z-Score and whale accumulation are just two pieces of the puzzle. Investors should conduct thorough research, consider other indicators, and stay informed about broader market trends before making any investment decisions. Actionable Insights: Seizing Potential Opportunities in Ethereum So, what are the actionable takeaways from this analysis? While this is not financial advice, the current confluence of a low Ethereum MVRV Z-Score and significant whale accumulation suggests a potentially opportune moment for strategic investors. Here are some insights to consider: Further Research: Dive deeper into on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode to track the MVRV Z-Score and whale accumulation trends in real-time. Explore other relevant metrics to get a comprehensive market picture. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy to gradually build your ETH position over time. This approach mitigates the risk of trying to time the market perfectly and allows you to average out your entry price. Long-Term Perspective: If you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem, a market dip signaled by metrics like the MVRV Z-Score can be viewed as a chance to acquire ETH at a discounted price for long-term holding. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in the crypto space, including regulatory updates, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors that could impact the market. Conclusion: A Hopeful Glimpse Amid Market Uncertainty Ethereum’s MVRV Z-Score reaching a 17-month low, coupled with aggressive whale accumulation, paints a potentially hopeful picture for ETH and the broader crypto market. While challenges and uncertainties remain, these on-chain signals suggest that we might be approaching a significant market bottom. For astute investors, this could represent a strategic window to unlock potential gains as Ethereum positions itself for its next bullish cycle.

The registration of the digital transfer agent aligns with Superstate’s goal of using blockchain technology to advance the integration of tokenized securities. Ensuring compliance with existing regulatory frameworks while bringing real-world assets on-chain is Superstate Services LLC’s top priority, the company said in a blog post . The tokenized securities market benefits from transfer agents, whether issuers or markets, in tracking the ownership, issuance, and redemption of shares. With transfer agents in place, issuers can focus on business growth and operations while ensuring effective governance and boosting shareholder confidence. Superstate’s agent services aim to bring these advantages to the market, enabling issuers to leverage the asset manager’s on-chain record-keeping system for real-time ownership monitoring. “Initially, Superstate Services will only support our Superstate Funds as we seek to broaden their distribution. But, we aim for Superstate Services to be a crucial enabling service provider to all issuers as more securities become tokenized,” the company said.

USTB allows qualified purchasers and accredited investors to explore investment opportunities via short-duration Treasury bills, while USCC offers institutional investors a crypto basis strategy. Per rwa.xyz , USTB has over $319 million in assets under management. The registration with the SEC comes amid broader pro-crypto sentiment on the regulatory scene in the U.S. Earlier this week, Commodity and Futures Trading Commission acting chair Caroline Pham said the CFTC and SEC were engaging amid efforts for further regulatory collaboration. Also notable are comments by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who currently leads the securities watchdog’s crypto task force. In recent remarks, she stated that transfer agents could play a crucial role in the tokenized securities market as the industry seeks regulatory clarity.

The inability of Bitcoin to overcome crucial CME gaps below $85,000 has resulted in massive $213 million worth of liquidations which propelled major altcoins into plummeting prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains its resistance to market dip while other cryptocurrencies suffer massive losses during the carnage. The presale run has exceeded $2.2 million and gathered more than 4,200 holders within a brief period. The second stage of MUTM presale is now picking up speed because investors seek projects that deliver stability along with measurable returns while the token trades at $0.015. Evolution in the exchange listing is set for $0.06 as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) moves towards a potential 300% market value growth at launch and constructs itself as the secure investment option throughout this market turmoil. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) strong presale demand despite general market losses. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) welcomes exceptional demand despite Bitcoin’s CME gap battle and Ethereum’s reflection of Bitcoin’s weakness. The current presale volume phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets its final token value at $0.015 before a subsequent increase raises it to $0.02 while providing a 33.3% gain. After joining the early presale phase those participants will gain immediate price appreciation yet they stand to benefit most from upcoming growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utilizes engineering solutions to drive its fast growth based on upcoming launch at $0.06 before reaching $3 value by 2025. Future demand projections for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens will exceed standard bitcoin price changes along with overshadowing unplanned movements seen in cryptocurrency assets like Dogecoin and XRP which mainly adhere to Bitcoin market changes. The token shows long-term viability since its core essence includes practical asset value. The decentralized lending and borrowing system known as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) serves as both a DeFi unique offering and separate entity from traditional cryptocurrency types. Users can create mtTokens with interest value by exchanging stablecoins or ETH which grow before users spend them for various DeFi functions. MUTM demand remains steady because the platform uses part of its fees to repurchase tokens which get distributed among its stakers. The built-in cycles between scarcity and rewards at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operate in a closed loop that protects the platform from market uncertainty. Organic growth stands as MUTM’s primary method to avoid the problems identified. The presale structure implements stepwise price value increases based on development targets rather than artificial market hype. The project has distributed tokens for three essential components: liquidity mining activities, platform development and strategic partnership deployment to establish sustainability. Bitcoin struggles to reach $85,000 value due to its inability to provide built-in revenue and deflationary features. Calculated Growth Outshines Speculative Volatility The recent market downturn has been by no means a challenge for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which continues to grow. The presale succeeded in raising $2.2 million which demonstrates the confidence of institutional investors in their model. Buying tokens for $0.015 early on enables investors to achieve 300% growth at launch although their real gains will materialize further in the future. A positive price trajectory to $3 is projected because the lending services launch will introduce mtToken adoption growth. The projected 19,900% increase of MUTM from presale prices exceeds what top-20 cryptocurrencies can achieve in their maximum returns. As part of its promotional strategy the project offers a $100,000 giveaway split into ten equal $10,000 prizes for presale contributors. Several critical initiatives increase the pressure since the second stage is about to reach its closing deadline. As the time to acquire MUTM at $0.015 decreases investors feel increasing fear of missing out (FOMO) while searching for protection from declining financial assets. The recent collapse of Bitcoin and Ethereum provides an ideal time for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to demonstrate its sustainable expansion concepts. MUTM leads the upcoming Decentralized Finance wave because of its successful pre-sale event combined with utility-based ecosystem components. Buyers now face the critical juncture of the $0.015 MUTM price while awaiting substantial price appreciation which brings joint benefits of low price and high potential gains.

Méliuz (MELIUZ), a publicly traded Brazilian company, has just given the green light to a significant shift in its financial strategy. They’re not just dipping their toes into the cryptocurrency world; they’re making a bold move by allocating Bitcoin (BTC) to their corporate treasury. This decision, confirmed by Walter Bloomberg on X, is sending ripples through both the Brazilian and global crypto markets. What does this mean for the future of corporate Bitcoin adoption, and why is Méliuz making this strategic leap? Let’s dive in and explore this fascinating development. Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is Gaining Momentum The idea of companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, often referred to as corporate bitcoin adoption , has moved from a fringe concept to a serious consideration for businesses worldwide. Why are we seeing this increasing interest? Several compelling factors are at play: Hedge Against Inflation: In an era of rising inflation and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold – a store of value that can potentially protect against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Companies are looking for ways to preserve their capital, and Bitcoin offers an alternative to traditional assets that might be eroded by inflation. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Smart financial management often involves diversification. Holding Bitcoin allows companies to diversify their treasury beyond traditional assets like cash and bonds. This diversification can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Potential for Higher Returns: While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, it also presents the potential for significant capital appreciation. Companies looking to enhance their treasury returns are attracted to Bitcoin’s growth potential, especially in the long term. Future-Proofing Finances: Embracing Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking move, positioning companies at the forefront of technological and financial innovation. It signals to investors and customers that the company is adaptable and prepared for the future of finance. Méliuz and the Brazil Bitcoin Landscape Brazil has been steadily emerging as a significant player in the Latin American cryptocurrency scene. With a tech-savvy population and a growing interest in digital assets, the country is ripe for Brazil Bitcoin adoption. Méliuz, a well-established publicly listed company in Brazil, making this move is particularly noteworthy. What is Méliuz, and why is their decision so impactful? Méliuz is a Brazilian technology company known for its cashback and rewards platform. Being publicly listed on the Brazilian stock exchange (B3), their decision to allocate Bitcoin to their treasury adds a layer of legitimacy and visibility to the crypto space within the Brazilian financial market. This isn’t just a small startup; it’s a recognized entity making a significant statement. Impact of Méliuz’s Decision Méliuz’s move can have several positive impacts: Increased Confidence in Crypto in Brazil: A publicly listed Brazilian company adopting Bitcoin can boost confidence in cryptocurrencies among other Brazilian businesses and investors. It sets a precedent and encourages further exploration of digital assets. Potential for Follower Effect: Méliuz’s decision could inspire other companies in Brazil and Latin America to consider Bitcoin treasury allocations. When a company of Méliuz’s stature takes the plunge, it can pave the way for others to follow suit. Positive Signal for the Global Crypto Market: This news from Brazil adds to the growing narrative of institutional investment in Bitcoin globally. It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class and attracting interest from established businesses beyond just tech companies. Navigating the Bitcoin Treasury Landscape: Benefits and Challenges While the potential benefits of a Bitcoin treasury allocation are clear, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges and considerations companies face when making this decision. Let’s weigh the pros and cons: Benefits Challenges Inflation Hedge Diversification Potential for High Returns Enhanced Brand Image (Innovation) Decentralized Asset – Reduced Counterparty Risk Price Volatility Regulatory Uncertainty (Varies by Jurisdiction) Accounting and Tax Complexities Custodial Risks (Secure Storage) Educational Curve (Understanding Bitcoin) Mitigating the Challenges Companies considering Bitcoin treasury allocations can mitigate the challenges by: Implementing Robust Risk Management Strategies: This includes setting clear allocation limits, understanding volatility, and potentially using hedging strategies. Staying Informed on Regulatory Developments: Keeping abreast of evolving regulations in their jurisdiction and globally is crucial for compliance. Seeking Expert Guidance: Consulting with crypto-savvy financial advisors, accountants, and legal professionals can help navigate the complexities. Prioritizing Secure Custody: Utilizing reputable and secure custody solutions for Bitcoin holdings is paramount to prevent loss or theft. Investing in Education: Educating internal teams about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fundamentals is essential for informed decision-making and management. What’s Next for Méliuz and Corporate Bitcoin? Méliuz’s approval is just the first step. The actual implementation of their Bitcoin treasury allocation will be closely watched. Key questions remain: What percentage of their treasury will be allocated to Bitcoin? The size of the allocation will signal the level of their conviction and risk appetite. What custody solutions will they employ to secure their Bitcoin? Security is paramount for corporate holdings. How will this decision impact their financial performance and stock price? The market’s reaction will be a crucial indicator of the broader sentiment towards corporate Bitcoin adoption. Méliuz’s move is undoubtedly a significant development in the ongoing story of corporate bitcoin adoption . It underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset and signals a potentially exciting new chapter for both the cryptocurrency market and the future of corporate finance. Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin Treasury Right for Your Company? Inspired by Méliuz’s bold step and considering the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption, businesses should evaluate if a Bitcoin treasury allocation aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance. Here are some actionable steps to consider: Conduct Thorough Research: Deeply understand Bitcoin, its underlying technology, market dynamics, and potential risks and rewards. Assess Your Company’s Financial Situation: Determine if allocating a portion of your treasury to a potentially volatile asset like Bitcoin is financially prudent and aligns with your overall investment strategy. Define Clear Objectives: Establish specific goals for Bitcoin treasury allocation – is it for inflation hedging, diversification, or long-term growth? Develop a Risk Management Framework: Create a robust risk management plan that addresses volatility, custody, regulatory compliance, and accounting considerations. Start Small and Learn: Consider starting with a small allocation to gain experience and understanding before making larger commitments. Seek Expert Consultation: Engage with financial advisors, crypto experts, and legal professionals to navigate the complexities and ensure compliance. In conclusion, Méliuz’s decision to embrace Bitcoin for their treasury marks a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency’s journey toward mainstream acceptance. It’s a powerful signal that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset but a strategic tool for forward-thinking companies looking to diversify their holdings and potentially enhance their financial future. As more companies like Méliuz explore this path, the landscape of corporate finance may be on the cusp of a profound and exciting transformation.

The bill aims to position Texas as a leader in Bitcoin adoption by establishing a reserve of BTC, which proponents argue will serve as a hedge against economic instability and inflation. Support for the bill was evident during a February 18 hearing held by Texas’ Senate Committee on Business and Commerce. The hearing drew numerous Bitcoin advocates, including Pierre Rochard of Riot Platforms, North America’s largest Bitcoin mining company. Speaking in favor of the bill, Rochard stated, “Bitcoin will continue to accrue long-term value, so now is the perfect time to make a strategic investment.” JUST IN – Riot Platform's Pierre Rochard to the Texas State Senate: ""Bitcoin will continue to accrue long term value, so now is the perfect time to make a strategic investment."" pic.twitter.com/45wBBS5TlV — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 18, 2025 Senate Committee on Business and Commerce Chairman Charles Schwertner also emphasized Bitcoin’s growing role in financial markets, saying, “Bitcoin, referenced as digital gold by the US Treasury, has become a recognized asset in the financial markets.” JUST IN: Texas Senate holds public hearing on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation ""Bitcoin, referenced as digital gold by the US Treasury, has become a recognized asset in the financial markets."" pic.twitter.com/g13UXMtNjM — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 18, 2025 The bill’s passage in the Senate comes amid growing national interest in Bitcoin reserves. Just days ago, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would be creating a federal Bitcoin reserve. President Trump is expected to provide further details on the federal Bitcoin reserve during the upcoming Digital Assets Summit at the White House tomorrow, based on Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s comments yesterday. Lutnick said that an official announcement is expected soon, stating, “A Bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President’s interested in. He spoke about it all during the campaign trail, and I think you’re going to see it executed on Friday.” As SB 21 moves to the Texas House, all eyes are on whether Texas will successfully establish itself as a leader in Bitcoin adoption at the state level. If passed, Texas could become the first U.S. state to officially hold Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy, setting a precedent for other states to follow.

As a result, the price of Ethereum (ETH) dropped below the critical $2,000 mark, leading to a surge in long liquidations. Amid this, various on-chain metrics for Ethereum turned bearish, suggesting a drop in accumulation. However, analysts anticipate a strong rebound in the price of ETH ahead of the upcoming crypto summit. Whale Pressure Drops Amid ETH’s Dip Recent data from Coinglass shows equal trading activity as Ethereum remains under the $2,500 mark. In the past 24 hours, Ethereum faced a total liquidation of approximately $47.87 million, with buyers liquidating $28.1 million and sellers closing $19.7 million in short positions. In the meantime, key investors are utilizing the opportunity to purchase Ethereum at lower prices, especially ahead of the upcoming White House Crypto Summit. Traders are particularly focused on the activity of wallet addresses associated with Trump-endorsed World Liberty Financial (WLF). Also read: Trump’s WLFI Buys $10M in Ethereum Despite Losses – Here’s Why According to Arkham Intel, an on-chain intelligence firm, WLF’s wallet has tripled its Ether holdings within just one day. WLF has been actively buying up Ethereum during recent price dips. Reports from Arkham Intel reveal that as of Thursday, WLF holds approximately 7,100 Ethereum tokens, valued at over $80 million. This substantial increase from 2,500 tokens in just 24 hours highlights a strong accumulation strategy. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a significant decline in whale activity for Ethereum, coinciding with considerable losses due to Ethereum’s price drop. The count of whale transactions has notably decreased, falling from a high of 13.4K transactions to just 6.46K. Furthermore, there has been a drastic drop in the volume of large transactions, which plummeted from $11 billion to $5.5 billion. This decline in whale pressure came following a negative trend in large holders’ unrealized profit. CryptoQuant data indicates that ETH whales, specifically those with holdings ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 ETH and from 10,000 to 100,000 ETH, have experienced a shift to negative unrealized profits. What’s Next for ETH Price? The ETH price recovered toward $2,300 as it faced buying pressure. However, it failed to surge further as bears strongly defended the resistance level. As of writing, Ethereum price trades at $2,200, dropping over 0.9% in the last 24 hours. The ETH/USDT trading pair is struggling to approach the immediate resistance line at $2,530. This level could be a major obstacle as STHs might continue to liquidate here. However, buyers might soon break above that level as demand surges. If the price holds below the EMA20 trend line on the 1-hour chart, the sellers will likely try to push it back down to $2K. However, with the RSI level continuing to trade around the midline at level 45, it might trigger a retest of the resistance channel. If the price manages to hold above $2,530, it would favor the buyers. The trading pair could then increase to $2,935.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|ARKM|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 19:37:53

This follows the first round in February, which focused on smaller claims. As reported, the next phase will include a wider group of creditors, covering those with both small and large claims. Bigger Claims to Be Paid Next The first batch of payments went to creditors with $50,000 or less claims . At the time, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported that about $1.2 billion had been withdrawn from FTX-controlled wallets. With the new phase, bigger claims will also be processed. Regarding the above, FTX creditors’ representative Sunil Kavuri allegedly shared an email from Kraken confirming that both small and large claims would be included this time. However, as of the time of writing, Kraken has not released any official statement. Meanwhile, the timing matches what FTX had previously announced, indicating that things are still on track. Even so, many creditors are unsure when they will receive their full payments. Some Creditors Still Left Out It is important to state that despite the progress, not all affected users will get their money back in this round. For example, creditors in countries like China, Russia, Egypt, Nigeria, and Ukraine have not received any payments yet. These regions had many FTX users, yet they were left out of the first batch of repayments. Again, the representative said that FTX is looking for ways to resolve this issue, but there is no clear timeline for when these customers will be paid. Unfortunately, the delay has frustrated many people as they are still waiting for answers. FTX Moves More Solana as Repayments Continue As FTX works through its repayment plans, it has been unstaking large amounts of Solana (SOL). Earlier this month, blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain reported that FTX and Alameda Research unlocked 3.03 million SOL worth about $432.5 million and moved the tokens to different wallets. This was the biggest unstaking event for FTX and Alameda since November 2023. They plan to release 11.2 million SOL valued at roughly $1.5 billion. Since late 2023, they have sold 7.83 million SOL worth around $986 million through exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. FTX may be using its crypto holdings to help fund repayments, but it is still unclear how much money will go directly to creditors.

In a new Telegram announcement on Thursday, the Russian exchange says that Tether has blocked Garantex’s wallets, which contained over 2.5 billion rubles, about $28 million. “Dear users! We have bad news. Tether has entered the war against the Russian crypto market and blocked our wallets worth more than 2.5 billion rubles. We are temporarily suspending all services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals, while our entire team solves this problem. We are fighting and will not give up! Please note that all USDT in Russian wallets is currently under threat. As always, we are the first but not the last.

This is not the first time Tether has actively worked with regulators to disrupt USDT in sanctioned wallets. In September of last year, Tether announced that, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), it had seized over $6 million in wrongfully obtained crypto in Southeast Asia. When Reuters asked for a comment, a Tether spokesperson requested that all questions be directed to the U.S. Secret Service.

This article delves into three promising cryptocurrencies poised for mid-term growth—find out which coins are catching analysts' attention ahead of this pivotal event. BNB Price Surge and Key Level Battle in a Mixed Market BNB dropped about 2% over the last month while showing a strong six-month gain of roughly 24%. The coin maintained a trading range from around $487 to $711, reflecting some short-term weakness followed by solid long-term recovery. Price action over these periods revealed steady, if uneven, momentum that set the stage for potential moves as traders adapted to minor setbacks and overall robust performance. Current levels present clear markers with support near $385 and resistance at about $834. The market lacks a defined trend as bearish signals from oscillators mix with long-term strength. In this setting, traders may look for breakouts above resistance or tests of support to decide on entry and exit points. Ethereum Market Trends and Key Levels Ethereum experienced a sharp decline over the past month with a 20.30% drop, while its six-month performance managed a modest 3.30% gain. The price has shown volatility, oscillating within a range of $1766.31 to $3020.97, reflecting both recent bearish pressure and some underlying resilience over time. Recent weekly changes seem less dramatic, hinting at short-term consolidation following the downturn. Current price action centers around key levels with support at $1294.44 and resistance near $3803.76, while a second resistance at $5058.42 offers an upper boundary. Bears currently dominate with negative momentum readings and an oscillator at -340.37, making this range a cautious area for trading opportunities. SUI Price Analysis: Recent Declines Amid Long-Term Gains Over the past month, SUI underwent a sharp 25.70% loss even as it recorded an impressive 224.35% gain over the last six months. Price fluctuations marked recent activity, yet the long-term surge shows underlying strength and potential, reflecting a resilient performance despite near-term pullbacks. SUI currently trades between $2.11 and $3.83 with immediate resistance at $4.83 and support near $1.40. Oscillators at -0.45 and an RSI of 41.50 indicate weak momentum amid cautious sentiment, with bears holding short-term sway. Traders might consider buying near support and looking to sell as the price nears resistance, while watching for any shift in trend. Conclusion BNB , ETH , and SUI show strong potential for mid-term investment. BNB offers robust performance with its connection to Binance. ETH remains a solid choice due to its widespread use and ongoing upgrades. SUI stands out with innovative features and growing interest. These three cryptos present promising options ahead of the US Crypto Summit. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

How the Attack Unfolded SafeWallet and cybersecurity company Mandiant outline how the attackers compromised Bybit’s systems by taking over a Safe developer’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) session tokens, which allowed them to compromise the company’s multifactor authentication (MFA) security controls. SafeWallet’s AWS policies were set to reauthenticate every 12 hours. The attackers attempted to register an MFA device multiple times but failed. They then breached a developer’s MacOS system—likely through malware—enabling them to use AWS session tokens as long as the developer’s sessions remained active. Once inside AWS, the hackers methodically mounted their attack, leveraging cloud-based security weaknesses to gain unauthorized access. North Korean Hackers Behind the Attack Mandiant’s forensic analysis confirmed that the attackers were state-sponsored North Korean hackers. They spent 19 days planning the attack before executing the breach. Despite the scale of the exploit, SafeWallet assured that its smart contracts remained intact. The company has since incorporated additional security protocols to prevent such an occurrence. FBI Issues Warning as Hackers Launder Stolen Funds The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a public advisory, requesting node operators to halt transactions from wallet addresses linked to the North Korean hackers. The government agency cautioned that the stolen coins would be laundered and exchanged for fiat. Bybit hackers successfully laundered 100% of the stolen crypto within 10 days—nearly 500,000 Ether-based tokens. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou noted that 77% of the funds worth about $1.07 billion are yet to be tracked on-chain, and some $280 million have disappeared into untouchable transactions. Security experts like Cyvers CEO Deddy Lavid are of the view that a possibility still remains to track and freeze some of the stolen funds despite the fast pace of the laundering process. As the crypto sector faces growing cyber attacks, SafeWallet’s report brings into focus the need to tighten security measures, especially within cloud-based systems.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-06 19:47:42

Overview Cryptocurrency NEAR Protocol Ticker NEAR Price $3.08 Market Cap $3,922,347,671.81 Trading Volume 24-h $169,920,270.64 Circulating Supply 1,179,250,018 NEAR All-time High $20.42 Jan 17, 2022 All-time Low $0.526, Nov 04, 2020 24-h High $3.46 24-h Low $3.26 NEAR Protocol price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $4.35 200-Day SMA $4.87 Price Prediction $7.29 (119.99%) F & G Index 25.48 (fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 14-Day RSI 55.51 NEAR Protocol price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: NEAR Protocol price analysis shows a fall to the $3.00 mark NEAR price fell by over 3.2% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $3.10 and $3.30, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for March 7 shows that the price rose to the $3.20 mark as bulls find support at $3.650 NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR rises to the $3.18 mark The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the NEAR price is trading in a bearish market since failing to climb past the $8.00 mark. The price fell to the $5.00 level but the bulls managed to recover to the $6.00 level. The recovery was short-lived as after a couple of ups and downs, the bears came out on top and the price dropped to the $3.20 level where it trades at press time. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart The Indicators reflect the increasing bearish price sentiment as all three major technical indicators signal rising bearish price sentiments. The MACD is bullish at 0.027 units and suggests low bullish momentum. Moreover, the EMAs are below the mean position, and the indicator shows a declining bearish momentum. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 44.16 from above the 50.00 index level. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest increasing volatility, indicating that the $3.20 support may not hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows that NEAR has been trading inside a downward channel since late January as the bears dominated the market. While the bulls did attempt to break out of the channel on January 31st, the lack of momentum caused the asset’s price to break down further, leading to a drop to the $3.00 price level. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The RSI is at 42.07, suggesting that the asset is in the lower half of the neutral zone, which indicates that it has room for more downward movement. However, the horizontal slope suggests decreasing selling pressure on the asset, suggesting further consolidation. The MACD is bullish, with the MACD line at 0.038 showing bullish dominance across the 4-hour charts. This dominance has been increasing in recent candles as NEAR rose to $3.20. These indicators collectively issue a steady bullish trend that suggests a return towards $3.25. NEAR Protocol technical indicators: Levels and actions Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 3.73 SELL SMA 5 $ 3.59 SELL SMA 10 $ 3.60 SELL SMA 21 $ 3.44 SELL SMA 50 $ 4.22 SELL SMA 100 $ 5.18 SELL SMA 200 $ 4.99 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 3.60 SELL EMA 5 $ 3.92 SELL EMA 10 $ 4.40 SELL EMA 21 $ 4.89 SELL EMA 50 $ 5.35 SELL EMA 100 $ 5.40 SELL EMA 200 $ 5.28 SELL What to expect from NEAR Protocol price analysis? NEAR Protocol price analysis NEAR ended its bearish rally at the $3.00 mark, a key support to the asset that has been tested many times. The strong trade volume suggests decreasing trade activity suggesting that the sell-off may be over. Currently, the bulls are trying to defend the $3.15 support level as traders seek stability. Traders should expect NEAR to breakthrough from around the $3.20 level for the next few days as the bulls generate momentum. However, the bulls must defend key levels to prevent a breakdown below $3.00.

Now, the price hovers around $3.20 as either side struggles for a breakout. Will NEAR reach $10? NEAR is experiencing a volatile market movement that may see it reach the $10 mark before the end of 2027. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth.

In 2020 I was center-left and I gave to Biden's campaign,"" he said. ""I was optimistic he'd be a sort of solid center-left President. I spent the next few years in [Washington] DC a lot. I made dozens of trips there, and was really, really shocked by what I saw, not in a good direction, from the administration."" “By late 2022 I was giving to Republicans privately as much as Democrats. And that started becoming known right around FTX’s collapse, so that probably played a role,” Bankman-Fried added. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of multiple charges of fraud and conspiracy in March 2024 and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He made over $40 million in political donations to 196 members of Congress , including former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and former Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). In other words, 1 in 3 lawmakers took money from him.

An undated Google Doc listed ideas such as ""come out against the woke agenda"" and ""Go on Tucker Carlsen, come out as a republican."" With the GOP now firmly in power in D.C., the latter idea has now seemingly come to fruition. Bankman-Fried told Carlson that he’d never expected a whole lot from the Democrats but that he believed some lawmakers would prove thoughtful in both political parties. He criticized former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, calling the agency “something out of a nightmare” during his tenure due to difficulties for crypto companies to come in and register. Asked by Carlson whether he’d called in any favors from political figures during his trial, Bankman-Fried denied it. However, the 33-year-old's parents, former Stanford Law School professors Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman, have reportedly been meeting with lawyers and other people in U.S. President Donald Trump's orbit in an attempt to secure their son a presidential pardon. “There’s a long story there. It involves a law firm that took a pretty unusual and active role in the case, before I even gave up control of FTX, before it was ever filed for bankruptcy, the DOJ had already made up its mind.” The Google Doc unveiled during Bankman-Fried's trial also suggested he was planning to ""talk about how the cartel of lawyers is destroying value and throwing entrepreneurs under the bus in order to cover up the incompetence of lawyers.” Bankman-Fried recently posted a series of messages on social media about the difficulties of firing employees, in reference to the firings enacted by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Bankman-Fried was criticized by the crypto community for the posts, which were perceived as an attempt to ingratiate himself with the Trump administration.",Policy|SBF|Sam Bankman-Fried|Democratic Party|Republican Party,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|DOGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 19:55:03

The conversation covered a broad range of topics but primarily focused on regulatory challenges, the evolution of crypto’s foundational promises, and the potential trajectory of digital currencies in the global financial landscape. You might also like: Core Scientific’s stock down 11% as Microsoft trims AI contract Regulatory landscape for crypto and US position When asked about the future of crypto in the US, Bankman-Fried emphasized the importance of stable regulatory frameworks for the adoption and growth of cryptocurrencies, particularly in the country. He noted that while the U.S. accounts for about 30% of the world’s traditional finance, it represents only approximately 5% of global crypto activity. Bankman-Fried acknowledged that the new administration appears more favorable toward cryptocurrency, stating that “changing the guard helps.” However, he attributed the current challenges to the country’s strict regulatory environment, saying, “The reason is entirely regulatory; the U.S. is unique in its difficulty to work with.” Reflecting on the transition between presidential administrations, Bankman-Fried observed differences in their approaches to crypto regulation. “You look at what the Trump administration said going into office, there are a lot of good things. There are a lot of things that were very different from the stance [of] the Biden administration,” he remarked. However, he emphasized that the effectiveness of any administration’s stance depends on execution, noting that financial regulators are “big, giant bureaucracies in the federal government. They’re not used to changing overnight, and they have been playing a really obstructive role for a decade in crypto.” You might also like: New GOP bill targets crypto ‘debanking’ by limiting regulator oversight The promise of privacy and utility in crypto The discussion also touched upon the original ideals of cryptocurrency, particularly the promise of privacy and individual autonomy in financial transactions. Carlson reminisced about the early days of crypto, saying, “The whole idea was that this was a currency that could store to the individual his freedom of commerce… And that obviously hasn’t happened.” Bankman-Fried acknowledged this shift, attributing it to the longer timelines required for technological adoption compared to the rapid cycles of investment bubbles. He explained, “Technology is built out on a decade basis… Right now, crypto is not quite at a point where it could become an everyday tool of a quarter of the world or something.” Despite current limitations, Bankman-Fried expressed optimism about the future utility of cryptocurrencies. He envisioned that with continued industry progress, “five, ten years from now, you could imagine a world where all of a sudden it is the case that anyone can have a crypto wallet… a billion people could use it each day, with privacy, with security, fast, cheap, international.” You might also like: Sam Altman’s World Network debuts crypto-enabled chat feature",News|FTX|Sam Bankman-Fried,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-06 19:55:13

The Prime Minister highlighted that hundreds of individuals have profited significantly from Bitcoin, questioning why governments are not adopting similar strategies.

In an interview with Tucker Carlson on Thursday, the convicted criminal tried, once again, to paint himself as a misunderstood genius who just made some bad decisions. SBF called the prison environment “dystopian” but insisted he wasn’t in any physical danger. Instead, he complained about the lack of productivity, logistical issues, and being stuck in a room with 40 other inmates who have “nothing left to care about except trivial matters.” Throughout the interview, SBF avoided responsibility, as per usual. He talked about how his legal work was nearly impossible to manage due to the prison’s chaotic schedule, waking up at 4 a.m. just to spend hours in holding cells and transport vans before getting back at 9 p.m. with no access to legal documents. When asked what he does all day, SBF told Tucker that: “I’ve read books. I’ve, you know, started reading novels again. I play some chess and I work on my legal case to the extent I can. You know, there is an appeal going on for me. There are other things I do what work I can from in here on that. But the lack of other meaningful things to spend my time on is one of the most kind of soul crushing things about prison.” SBF addresses drug rumors and life with inmates Tucker pressed SBF on his hyperactive behavior before his 2023 arrest, asking if he was high on Adderall during media appearances, as rumors had it back then. SBF denied it, saying: “No, I wasn’t, but I was pretty out of it. My mind was racing because there were, you know, a billion things to keep track of.” The convicted felon admitted that because he is autistic, he’s not very good at communicating, especially when FTX collapsed, and he got “swept up in details” instead of seeing the bigger picture. When asked how life without digital access has affected him, SBF said he missed having access to the internet, but not for leisure—only for productivity. He complained about how hard it is to do anything meaningful in prison. Tucker then pointed out that SBF looked healthier and less jittery, possibly because he was forced to step away from screens and stress. Tucker then asked, “So, like, have you made friends there? How are you hanging with Diddy? I think he’s in there with you.” SBF confirmed that Sean “Diddy” Combs is in the same prison and has been “kind to people in the unit.” When asked how other inmates react to being locked up with two of the most famous prisoners in the world, SBF said some see it as an opportunity to meet people they normally wouldn’t, though he quickly added that he doesn’t think about prison that way. SBF then shared an unexpected observation with Tucker. Apparently, a surprising number of ex-gangsters and armed robbers are good at chess, despite not speaking English or finishing school. With a laugh, SBF said he constantly loses games to them. SBF talks about politics, money, and broken alliances Despite donating millions to mostly Democratic political campaigns in 2021 and 2022, SBF was left to rot when he needed help the most. He admitted that, at first, he supported Biden and the Democratic Party, believing they would be the better choice for financial regulation. But after spending years in Washington, SBF was shocked by what he saw. By late 2022, SBF claims he secretly started giving just as much money to Republicans, which he thinks may have backfired. He called former SEC Chair Gary Gensler a “nightmare”, saying the agency blocked crypto companies from registering, making it impossible for companies to comply. When asked why he didn’t call in favors from political allies when facing charges, SBF said he didn’t want to do anything inappropriate and that many distanced themselves from him immediately, turning on him. When Tucker asked if he had any money left, SBF said “basically, no.” He explained that FTX had $15 billion in liabilities and $3 billion in assets at the time of its collapse. SBF has once again insisted that if FTX hadn’t gone bankrupt, everyone could have been repaid in full with extra billions left for investors. Instead, he blamed the bankruptcy process for making the situation worse, saying assets were “dissipated incredibly quickly” by those in charge, specifically John Ray III. SBF says he was betrayed by his own people According to SBF, nearly all of his former friends, colleagues, and allies abandoned him. He told Tucker that he received “nice messages” from people in D.C. right after the collapse, but by the time his trial started, no one wanted to be in contact with him. SBF claimed that his co-founder, Ryan Salame, was pressured into pleading guilty after prosecutors threatened to charge his pregnant wife. He called the seven-year sentence given to Salame “disgusting” and accused the US government of operating in bad faith. SBF also shared that none of his former employees have visited him in prison. Tucker asked if this experience had changed his views on effective altruism, the philosophy he once followed, where making money was supposed to help the most people possible. SBF responded that he still believes in it, but he acknowledged that bad execution can make things worse. When asked about the future of crypto, SBF was cautiously optimistic. He said the industry still has potential, but the U.S. government’s regulatory approach is still uniquely obstructive. SBF pointed out that only 5% of global crypto activity happens in America, despite the country having 30% of the world’s financial markets. As the interview ended, Tucker joked about SBF’s new reality, saying he went from running a global crypto empire to trading muffins in prison. SBF admitted that muffins, ramen, and packaged fish serve as currency behind bars, but unlike crypto, they don’t scale. With a weak laugh, the FTX founder told Tucker, “You can’t do a $200 transaction in muffins. Like what? You know, like I mean, it doesn’t work physically, right? And it’s unwieldy. Yeah?” When asked how he plans to spend his 33rd birthday, SBF said he doesn’t celebrate birthdays, especially not in prison. If he serves his full 25-year sentence, he will be 57 years old when released—but with potential reductions, he could be out in his late 40s, said SBF, so he’s not really interested in birthdays right now. With a sad smile, SBF then admitted to Tucker that he wasn’t sure if he could survive that long, saying the hardest part is having nothing meaningful to do. Studies suggest that prison reduces life expectancy by three times, meaning SBF’s real-life expectancy could be closer to 40 years. Meanwhile, SBF’s family has been calling on the pro-crypto president Donald Trump to pardon him like he did the crypto hero Ross Ulbricht. But so far, Trump hasn’t even shown any signs that he knows who SBF is. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

As Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate the headlines, savvy investors are looking for the next set of altcoins that could deliver exponential returns. While many coins come and go, only a handful possess strong fundamentals, growing adoption, and real-world use cases that position them for massive breakouts. Web3Bay leads the list of trending crypto projects poised for incredible returns, while other established assets like Solana, XRP, Hedera, and Sui are also gaining momentum. Web3Bay (3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce As traditional e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay continue to control the market with high fees and centralized policies, Web3Bay is emerging as a game-changer in the decentralized economy. The project is built to provide a secure, transparent, and cost-efficient marketplace, where users have full control over their transactions and data. Unlike speculative meme coins that thrive on hype, Web3Bay is solving real-world issues by eliminating intermediaries in online commerce. Investor enthusiasm surrounding Web3Bay is undeniable. The presale has already raised $1.6 million, with over 390 million tokens sold, making it one of the most successful early-stage crypto projects of the year. Its structured price model ensures steady growth, with the current presale price sitting at $0.00524, up 15% from the last batch price of $0.00456. As demand continues to rise, many analysts believe Web3Bay could be one of the biggest gainers in 2025, delivering 500x returns for early adopters. Solana (SOL) – The Ethereum Killer Eyes New Highs Solana has remained a dominant force in the blockchain space, offering lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low fees. It has consistently ranked among the top-performing Layer-1 networks, attracting NFT projects, DeFi platforms, and institutional investors looking for scalable blockchain solutions. Recent market activity suggests that Solana is gearing up for another massive breakout, with analysts closely watching price levels around $200 and beyond. As developers continue to build on the Solana ecosystem, investors are positioning themselves for what could be another record-breaking year for SOL. XRP (XRP) – Institutional Adoption Gains Momentum XRP’s potential remains significant as institutional investors increase their exposure to the asset. The approval of XRP’s first spot ETF in Brazil has fueled speculation about whether the U.S. will follow suit, driving renewed interest in the token. With XRP’s current price still far from its previous all-time highs, traders see it as an opportunity for high returns in the next bull cycle. Analysts predict that if Bitcoin’s price surge continues, XRP could ride the wave toward new record highs, making it a strong contender for long-term gains. Hedera (HBAR) – The Institutional-Grade Blockchain Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera operates on a hashgraph consensus model, providing higher speed, greater security, and increased efficiency. This has attracted major corporations such as Google, IBM, and Boeing, which are actively utilizing Hedera’s technology for enterprise-grade applications. Hedera’s growth in the DeFi and tokenization sectors has also been remarkable, positioning HBAR as one of the most undervalued assets in the crypto market. With increasing adoption and strategic partnerships, analysts see HBAR as a must-have in any serious crypto portfolio for 2025. Sui (SUI) – A Layer-1 Powerhouse on the Rise Sui is a rising star in the smart contract space, offering developers an efficient and highly scalable blockchain. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which face network congestion issues, Sui utilizes parallel transaction processing, allowing it to scale more efficiently. Despite recent price fluctuations, Sui’s ecosystem is expanding, with new projects and DeFi applications launching on the network. If adoption continues to grow, SUI could become one of the top-performing Layer-1 networks of 2025, making it a strong addition to any well-diversified crypto portfolio. Final Thoughts – Web3Bay Leads the Way While Solana, XRP, Hedera, and Sui offer strong investment potential, Web3Bay remains the most promising crypto to watch in 2025. With its decentralized e-commerce model, rapidly growing presale, and increasing adoption, Web3Bay is positioned for exponential growth in the coming months. Investors looking to maximize their returns should consider Web3Bay before the next price increase. The opportunity to buy into a high-growth crypto at an early stage is rare, and those who act fast could be the biggest winners in the next bull cycle.

41248331,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137499,1741291227,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crucial Insights: Why China’s FX Policy Shift Remains Uncertain, Says BofA",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/china-fx-policy-uncertainty-bofa/,"Is the dragon breathing fire, or just exhaling a puff of smoke? The question of whether China’s foreign exchange (FX) policy is undergoing a fundamental shift is generating considerable buzz in financial circles. Bank of America (BofA) recently weighed in, suggesting that while changes are afoot, it’s premature to declare a complete overhaul. For crypto enthusiasts and investors keenly watching global financial trends, understanding China’s currency maneuvers is absolutely crucial . After all, shifts in major economies ripple across all markets, including the digital asset space. Let’s dive deep into why BofA is urging caution in interpreting China’s recent FX actions. Decoding China’s FX Policy: What’s the Current Playbook? To understand if there’s a ‘fundamental change,’ we first need to grasp the existing framework. For years, China’s FX policy has been characterized by a few key elements, primarily aimed at maintaining stability and control. Think of it as a carefully orchestrated balancing act. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Managed Floating Exchange Rate: The Chinese Yuan (CNY), also known as Renminbi (RMB), operates under a managed float regime. This means its value is not entirely fixed but is allowed to fluctuate within a band around a central parity rate set daily by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). Capital Controls: China maintains capital controls to manage the flow of money in and out of the country. These measures are designed to prevent excessive capital flight or inflows, which could destabilize the economy and the exchange rate . Intervention in FX Markets: The PBOC actively intervenes in the foreign exchange market to influence the Yuan’s value. This intervention can take various forms, including direct buying or selling of Yuan, adjusting reserve requirements, or using state-owned banks to conduct operations. Focus on Stability: A core objective of China’s FX policy is to maintain relative stability in the Yuan’s value. This stability is seen as vital for trade, investment, and overall economic predictability. Essentially, China’s approach has been about guided evolution, not radical revolution. The goal is to allow the market to play a role, but always within a framework of control and stability. But is this changing? Why BofA Says ‘Too Early’: Examining the Nuances of China’s Actions BofA’s recent analysis suggests that while there are shifts in China’s approach, it’s not yet a ‘fundamental change.’ What are they seeing that leads them to this conclusion? Several factors are at play: Tactical Adjustments vs. Strategic Overhaul: BofA believes that recent actions by China might be tactical adjustments to manage specific economic pressures rather than a complete strategic overhaul of its FX policy. Think of it as fine-tuning the engine rather than rebuilding it from scratch. Global Economic Context: The current global economic landscape is complex, with inflation, interest rate hikes in major economies, and geopolitical uncertainties. China, like other nations, is navigating these turbulent waters. Some FX actions might be responses to these external pressures rather than a desire for a new long-term policy direction. Data Dependency: BofA emphasizes the need for more data and sustained observation over a longer period. Short-term fluctuations and policy responses can be misleading. A true ‘fundamental change’ would require consistent policy shifts over time, not just isolated incidents. No Clear Signal of Policy Doctrine Shift: Crucially, BofA points out that there hasn’t been a clear communication or signal from Chinese authorities indicating a fundamental shift in their long-held FX policy doctrine. Policy changes of this magnitude are usually accompanied by some level of official communication or guidance. In essence, BofA’s stance is one of prudent observation. They acknowledge changes but argue against jumping to conclusions about a complete policy transformation without more concrete evidence and sustained trends. The Role of Yuan Stability in China’s Economic Strategy Yuan stability is not just a matter of currency valuation for China; it’s deeply intertwined with its broader economic and geopolitical strategy. A stable Yuan is seen as beneficial for several reasons: Trade Competitiveness: A stable and predictable Yuan facilitates international trade. Excessive volatility can create uncertainty for businesses involved in import and export activities. Attracting Foreign Investment: A stable currency can make China a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI). Investors prefer stable environments where currency fluctuations don’t erode their returns. Managing Inflation: Exchange rate stability can help manage imported inflation. A weaker Yuan can make imports more expensive, potentially fueling domestic inflation. Financial System Stability: Sudden and sharp currency depreciations can trigger capital outflows and create instability in the financial system. Maintaining stability is crucial for overall financial health. Global Currency Ambitions: China has ambitions for the Yuan to play a greater role in the global financial system. Yuan stability is seen as a prerequisite for building trust and confidence in the currency internationally. Therefore, any perceived shift in China’s FX policy must be viewed in the context of these broader strategic objectives. Is China willing to sacrifice some stability for other goals? That’s the million-dollar question. Currency Intervention: Still a Key Tool in China’s Arsenal? Currency intervention has been a hallmark of China’s FX policy toolkit. The PBOC has historically been willing to step into the market to influence the Yuan’s direction. Is this changing? Here’s what to consider: Effectiveness of Intervention: The effectiveness of currency intervention can vary depending on market conditions and the scale of intervention. In some cases, intervention can be highly effective in stemming depreciation pressures or guiding the currency in a desired direction. In other situations, it might have a more limited impact, especially against strong market forces. Cost of Intervention: Intervention is not without cost. It can involve the use of foreign exchange reserves, which are finite resources. Sustained and large-scale intervention can deplete reserves and may not always be sustainable in the long run. Signaling Effect: Even if the direct impact of intervention is limited, it can send a powerful signal to the market about the authorities’ intentions. This signaling effect can sometimes be as important as the actual intervention itself. Shifting Tactics?: It’s possible that China is evolving its intervention tactics rather than abandoning intervention altogether. They might be becoming more nuanced and targeted in their approach, intervening less frequently but more strategically. So, while the fundamental willingness to intervene likely remains, the frequency, scale, and methods of currency intervention might be adapting to changing circumstances. Capital Controls: Loosening or Tightening the Reins? Capital controls are another crucial aspect of China’s FX management. Are we seeing a relaxation or tightening of these controls? The picture is complex: Balancing Act: China faces a constant balancing act between attracting foreign investment and managing capital flows. Looser capital controls can attract more investment but also increase the risk of capital flight. Tighter controls can limit capital flight but might deter some foreign investors. Selective Liberalization: China has been pursuing a path of selective liberalization of capital controls , opening up certain channels while maintaining restrictions in other areas. For example, there has been some easing of restrictions for portfolio investment through schemes like Stock Connect and Bond Connect. Crackdowns on Illicit Flows: Simultaneously, China has been cracking down on illicit capital flows and tightening enforcement of existing regulations. This reflects a concern about illegal activities and the potential for capital flight through unofficial channels. Geopolitical Considerations: Geopolitical tensions and uncertainties can also influence China’s approach to capital controls . In times of heightened global uncertainty, there might be a tendency to tighten controls to safeguard financial stability. Therefore, the trajectory of capital controls in China is not necessarily linear. It’s likely to be a dynamic process influenced by both economic and geopolitical factors, with periods of selective easing and targeted tightening. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto and Forex Traders? For those involved in crypto and forex trading, understanding the nuances of China’s FX policy and potential shifts is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Yuan Volatility: Keep a close eye on the Yuan’s volatility, especially against major currencies like the US dollar. Increased volatility can create trading opportunities but also heightened risks. Track PBOC Actions: Pay attention to announcements and actions by the PBOC related to FX policy. Any signals of policy shifts, even subtle ones, can have market implications. Analyze Capital Flow Data: Monitor data on capital flows in and out of China. Changes in these flows can provide clues about underlying trends and potential policy responses. Consider Geopolitical Factors: Be aware of geopolitical developments that could influence China’s FX policy. Trade tensions, international relations, and global economic events can all play a role. Diversification Strategy: In an environment of uncertainty about China’s FX policy, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes and markets to mitigate risks. China’s FX policy is a complex and evolving landscape. While BofA suggests it’s too early to declare a fundamental change, the situation is dynamic and warrants careful observation. For crypto and forex traders, staying informed and adaptable is the name of the game. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainties of China’s Currency Path The question of whether China’s FX policy has fundamentally changed remains shrouded in uncertainty . BofA’s cautious stance serves as a valuable reminder to avoid premature conclusions. While tactical adjustments are likely underway, a complete overhaul of long-standing policy doctrines is not yet confirmed. Yuan stability , currency intervention , and capital controls remain key pillars of China’s approach, though the nuances of their application may be evolving. For investors and traders, especially in the volatile crypto market, this means navigating a landscape of watchful waiting. Continuous monitoring of data, policy signals, and global economic trends is essential to anticipate and adapt to any shifts in China’s currency path. The dragon’s next move in the FX arena remains a story yet to be fully written.

Gox Stirs The Market With $1 Billion Bitcoin Transfer—What’s Going On?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/mt-gox-stirs-the-market-with-1-billion-bitcoin-transfer-whats-going-on/,"Bitcoin took center stage again as Mt. Gox moved 12,000 BTC, valued at over $1 billion, to an unknown wallet. This occurs at a time when Bitcoin is trading at approximately $92,000, a level that has caused market volatility. The actions of the defunct exchange have sparked debate regarding whether this movement indicates imminent creditor repayments or something else entirely. Related Reading: Billionaire Warns Of Financial Turmoil—Will Bitcoin Save Investors? Large Bitcoin Transfer Raises Eyebrows Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 following a major attack, and for years it has been in the process of reimbursing debtors. Regarding the trade, the movement of 12,000 BTC represents among the most important events in recent history. While some people think it may be a big step toward the much-needed repayments, others worry about the possible market pressure a big sell-off could generate. On March 6, Arkham Intelligence reported that a Mt. Gox-linked wallet, “1PuQB,” moved 12,000 BTC, with 11,834 BTC (over $1 billion) sent to an unidentified wallet, “1Mo1n,” and 166.5 BTC ($15 million) transferred to Mt. Gox’s cold wallet, “1Jbez.” ARKHAM ALERT: MT GOX MOVING $1B $BTC pic.twitter.com/VpIkHdJQkl — Arkham (@arkham) March 6, 2025 This marks the first major transaction since January, when smaller amounts were shuffled between its cold wallets. Mt. Gox-linked wallets still hold approximately 36,080 BTC, valued at $3.26 billion, according to Arkham. Such a large volume of Bitcoin movement historically has caused market volatility to rise. Investors are closely monitoring the possible sale in great numbers or redistribution of these monies to creditors. Although the recent surge in Bitcoin shows strong buying demand, this latest movement – if its a sell – could trigger a price dip, Bitcoin Price Remains Stable At Or Above $90,000 Bitcoin is strong and is currently trading at about $91,680 despite the uncertainty. The market’s lackluster reaction to the transfer thus far may suggest that investors are “cool” about the most recent activity from the now-defunct exchange. Similar huge transactions have previously resulted in brief declines, but the price of Bitcoin has continued to rise. Creditors Await Further Updates Mt. Gox’s creditors have been waiting years for their money to come back. Payback has been slow and marked by delays. Although this most recent transaction shows that development is happening, it is still unknown when or how the creditors will get their Bitcoin. Many hope that restitution will be handled smoothly so that it minimizes disturbance of the market. However, until official announcements are made, speculation will continue. The crypto community remains watchful for any updates that might clarify the exchange’s next steps.

During the same period, large holders have exhibited signs of strategic movements. Wallet Growth Accelerates Bitcoin has finally rebounded above $90,000 amid heightened volatility in March. The network has seen significant growth, with 50,000 more wallets than a month ago. In fact, Santiment’s analysis shows that 37,390 additional wallets now hold less than 0.1 BTC, while 12,754 more wallets contain between 0.1 and 100 BTC. On the other hand, the number of wallets holding at least 100 BTC has dropped by six, which could potentially mean that some large holders may be taking profits. The data suggests a bullish trend, with smaller investors accumulating Bitcoin despite market fluctuations. However, Santiment noted that for a broader crypto breakout, an increase in 100+ BTC wallets would be an encouraging sign. While whales have slightly reduced their holdings, the rising number of smaller wallets indicates ongoing adoption and confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Despite the increasing buying by the smaller wallets, broader market conditions have seen intense selling pressure this year, as highlighted by Glassnode’s latest data . Significant sales have been made across all Bitcoin wallet sizes, which has created immense market pressure. Since mid-January, selling activity has accelerated, with realized losses peaking at $818 million daily, second only to August 2024’s $1.34 billion event. This suggests that many investors are exiting at a loss as they struggle under current market conditions. Key Levels to Monitor The “coiling of volatility” over recent months, as per Glassnode’s findings, has led to a widespread price contraction across all digital assets. This is the second-largest capitulation event in the current Bitcoin cycle. A key level to monitor is $92,000, representing the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis, which could determine local momentum shifts. If Bitcoin sees further declines, the $71,000 region stands out as a major support level, which is validated by multiple technical and on-chain indicators. Defending this zone will be crucial for bullish investors to prevent a deeper downturn and maintain confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to recover from current market pressures.

This development arrives at a crucial juncture for the crypto industry, as global regulatory scrutiny intensifies. For those closely monitoring the cryptocurrency landscape, this news from the South Korean crypto market is a significant indicator of how exchanges are adapting to the evolving regulatory environment. Why are Ex-South Korean Regulator Officials Joining Bithumb? The integration of former officials from the South Korean regulator , the FSS, into Bithumb’s leadership structure is a noteworthy event. These individuals, previously holding key positions in the Bank Examination Department and Insurance Examination Department of the FSS, bring a wealth of experience in financial oversight and regulatory frameworks. Their decision to join Bithumb underscores the exchange’s proactive approach to navigating the complex web of cryptocurrency regulations. Let’s break down why this is a significant development: Deep Regulatory Insight: Having worked within the FSS, these new hires possess an intimate understanding of the regulatory expectations and compliance standards set by South Korean authorities. This insider knowledge is invaluable for Bithumb as it seeks to maintain and enhance its operational compliance. Proactive Compliance Posture: By bringing in ex-regulators, Bithumb is sending a clear message about its dedication to operating within legal boundaries and fostering a compliant environment. This move can be interpreted as a preemptive measure against potential regulatory challenges and a commitment to building trust with both users and authorities. Strengthened Internal Controls: With their expertise in financial examination and auditing, the former FSS team leaders are poised to significantly bolster Bithumb’s internal control mechanisms. Their roles as Compliance Officer and Head of Audit are critical in ensuring the exchange adheres to best practices and mitigates risks effectively. Navigating Evolving Regulations: The cryptocurrency regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. Individuals with a background in financial regulation are better equipped to interpret and adapt to new rules and guidelines, ensuring Bithumb remains agile and compliant in a dynamic environment. Boosting Crypto Compliance: What Does This Mean for Bithumb? The appointment of these former FSS officials is primarily aimed at enhancing crypto compliance within Bithumb. In the increasingly regulated world of digital assets, maintaining robust compliance frameworks is not just about adhering to legal mandates; it’s about building trust, ensuring operational stability, and fostering long-term sustainability. Here’s how these hires are expected to impact Bithumb’s compliance posture: Area of Impact Expected Outcome Enhanced AML/KYC Procedures Strengthened Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, aligning with global standards and minimizing risks of illicit activities. Improved Risk Management More effective identification, assessment, and mitigation of financial and operational risks, safeguarding user assets and platform integrity. Regulatory Liaison Facilitated communication and smoother interactions with regulatory bodies, ensuring proactive responses to regulatory inquiries and changes. Internal Audit Efficiency More rigorous and comprehensive internal audits, ensuring all departments and operations adhere to compliance policies and regulatory requirements. User Trust and Confidence Increased user trust and confidence in Bithumb as a secure and compliant platform, attracting a broader user base and fostering long-term loyalty. Bithumb’s Position in the South Korean Crypto Exchange Market Bithumb is a significant player in the crypto exchange market in South Korea, a country known for its high cryptocurrency adoption rates and active trading community. South Korea has also been at the forefront of crypto regulation, striving to balance innovation with investor protection. In this context, Bithumb’s move to strengthen its compliance team can be seen as a strategic effort to solidify its market position and potentially gain a competitive edge. Consider these points regarding Bithumb’s market standing and the impact of these hires: Competitive Advantage: In a market where regulatory adherence is increasingly becoming a differentiator, Bithumb’s proactive compliance approach can attract users who prioritize security and regulatory certainty. Market Leadership: By setting a high standard for compliance, Bithumb can reinforce its position as a leader in the South Korean crypto exchange landscape and potentially influence industry best practices. Investor Appeal: Institutional investors and larger trading firms are often more inclined to engage with exchanges that demonstrate strong regulatory compliance. Bithumb’s enhanced compliance framework could make it more appealing to these segments of the market. Long-term Growth: By focusing on sustainable and compliant growth, Bithumb is positioning itself for long-term success in a rapidly evolving and often volatile market. The Broader Impact on Financial Regulation in Crypto This development at Bithumb has implications that extend beyond a single crypto exchange . It reflects a broader trend within the cryptocurrency industry where regulatory compliance is transitioning from a peripheral concern to a core operational imperative. The move highlights the increasing convergence between traditional financial regulation and the digital asset space. Here’s a look at the wider implications: Industry-wide Compliance Push: Bithumb’s initiative could set a precedent for other crypto exchanges, both in South Korea and globally, to prioritize and invest in robust compliance frameworks and expertise. Increased Regulatory Legitimacy: As more exchanges demonstrate a commitment to compliance by hiring individuals with regulatory backgrounds, the cryptocurrency industry gains greater legitimacy in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and regulatory bodies. Investor Protection Focus: The enhanced compliance measures ultimately aim to protect investors and users within the crypto ecosystem, fostering a safer and more reliable trading environment. Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto: The movement of personnel from traditional financial regulatory bodies to crypto exchanges signifies a growing bridge between these two worlds, potentially leading to more harmonized regulatory approaches and industry standards. Benefits of Hiring Ex-Regulators: A Strategic Advantage for Bithumb Bringing former regulators on board offers Bithumb a strategic advantage in several key areas. These strategic hires are not merely about filling compliance roles; they represent a significant investment in the future stability and growth of the exchange. Let’s explore the multifaceted benefits: Reduced Regulatory Risk: Expertise in regulatory frameworks minimizes the risk of non-compliance penalties, legal challenges, and operational disruptions. Enhanced Credibility: Hiring ex-regulators boosts Bithumb’s credibility with regulators, users, and partners, signaling a commitment to responsible operations. Operational Efficiency: Streamlined compliance processes and proactive risk management can lead to greater operational efficiency and cost savings in the long run. Attracting Top Talent: A strong compliance culture and leadership can attract top talent within the crypto and traditional finance sectors, further strengthening Bithumb’s team. Sustainable Growth: By prioritizing compliance, Bithumb is laying the foundation for sustainable growth and long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Regulatory Maturity Bithumb’s decision to bring on board former team leaders from the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service is a bold and strategic move that underscores the growing importance of regulatory compliance in the cryptocurrency industry. This development not only strengthens Bithumb’s internal capabilities but also sends a powerful message to the market about its commitment to operating with the highest standards of regulatory adherence. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, such proactive steps towards compliance will be crucial for fostering trust, ensuring stability, and paving the way for the sustainable growth of the digital asset ecosystem. This move by Bithumb could very well be a harbinger of things to come, as other exchanges globally look to bolster their regulatory expertise and navigate the increasingly complex world of crypto finance.
