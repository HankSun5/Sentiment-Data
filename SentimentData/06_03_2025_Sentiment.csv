Binance Has Just Received A Massive Litecoin Inflow According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large move has been spotted on the Litecoin network during the last 24 hours. The transfer in question involved the shifting of 500,000 LTC across the network. At the time that the chain executed the transaction, this stack was worth around $51.3 million. Given the large scale associated with the move, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for it. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop: $75,500? Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level Whales are the largest of investors on the network, who can carry some degree of influence in the market due to their ability to make large transactions like this latest one. As such, the behavior of these humongous holders can often be worth keeping an eye on, as even if it may not always end up impacting the LTC price, it can still tell us about what the sentiment is like among this important cohort. Generally, though, it can be hard to say for certain what the whales are doing from their transaction activity alone, considering the anonymous nature of the blockchain. Nonetheless, sometimes, one of the wallets involved in the transaction can be connected to a central entity, which can provide room for speculation. The latest Litecoin move is fortunately of this type. Here are the details of the addresses involved in the transfer: As is visible above, the whale made the Litecoin transaction from a few unknown wallets. Such addresses are those that aren’t known to be affiliated with any centralized platform, so they can be assumed to be personal, self-custodial wallets of the investor. The destination of the transaction was a wallet attached to Binance, an exchange. Moves of this type, where coins go from personal addresses to the custody of an exchange, are known as exchange inflows.

As such, exchange inflows can sometimes have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. It’s unknown, though, whether the whale truly intended to sell with the latest exchange inflow or not. In the scenario that the investor did plan for it, then it could spell trouble for Litecoin, considering the scale of the move and the fact that its price has already registered a considerable drawdown during the past week. LTC Price Litecoin has recently plummeted alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency sector, which has brought its price down to $104.

Amid this, Dogecoin (DOGE), the world’s largest and most popular meme coin, is catching the attention of crypto analysts and experts. Experts’ Bullish Views on DOGE Meme Coin Recently, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) with a bold prediction. The expert expressed a bullish outlook, noting that DOGE has maintained its position within an ascending parallel channel. Based on historical price momentum, if the meme coin holds above the $0.16 level, there is still hope that it could reach $2.74 or even $6.24 in the coming days. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1897396450528809329 Current Price Momentum Today, March 6, 2025, the overall crypto market sentiment appears bullish, with major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experiencing impressive gains of 3.25%, 2.80%, and 2.15%, respectively. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action and Upcoming Levels Amid this bullish momentum, DOGE has gained 3.29% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.204. However, despite the ongoing price recovery, the meme coin’s trading volume has dropped by 45%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Source: Trading View Besides all this, Coinpedia’s technical analysis suggests that DOGE appears bullish but is currently facing modest resistance near the $0.205 level. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the meme coin breaches this resistance and closes a daily candle above $0.21, it could soar by 18% to reach $0.245 in the coming days. Besides this bullish outlook, another factor supporting it is the current retest of a crucial support level. During the recent price drop, the meme coin found crucial support at $0.18 and is now moving upward. The daily chart shows that this support level has a history of triggering bullish price reversals.",Price Analysis|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 23:01:49

According to Robinhood, the ETH layer-2 Arbitrum ( ARB ) is now available to be bought, sold, and traded over the trading platform. google336x280] News of the addition sent ARB rallying from a price of $0.374 on March 4th to $0.421 a day later. It has since stabilized and is trading for $0.419 at time of writing, a 14.5% gain during the last 24 hours. ARB joins Robinhood’s suite of crypto products, which includes Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum, Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), popular memecoins such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Pepe ( PEPE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and dozens of others. Last month, it was Robinhood reported that it saw a staggering 8x increase in crypto trading revenue in Q4 of 2024, putting pressure on Coinbase, its competitor and the largest crypto exchange platform in the US. According to the Robinhood’s investment report, the company saw a 200% year-over-year increase in transaction-based revenues, most of which can be attributed to crypto. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its investigation into Robinhood without levying any enforcement actions against the firm. As stated by Dan Gallagher, the Robinhood’s chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, at the time, “We applaud the staff’s decision to close this investigation with no action. Let me be crystal clear – this investigation never should have been opened. Robinhood Crypto always has and will always respect federal securities laws and never allowed transactions in securities. As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed.

""Look at this mining. More and more people are turning to me. If it is profitable for us, let's do it. We have excess electricity. Let them make this cryptocurrency and so on,"" Lukashenko told Alexei Kushnarenko, the nation's new minister of energy, according to Belarusian media outlet Belta . The news comes as the U.S. government is studying the possibility of creating a national strategic crypto reserve that could include cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), ripple (XRP) and cardano (ADA). Lukashenko mentioned the White House's interest in crypto. ""You see the path the world is going. And especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep [a crypto] reserve,"" he said. ""Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves,"" Lukashenko said . Belarus wouldn't be the first nation to mine cryptocurrencies.

Remittix Dominates 2025 Best Crypto Presales,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/can-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-make-the-us-crypto-reserve-remittix-dominates-2025-best-crypto-presales,"The Dogecoin price took an instant 15% jump on Sunday following Trump's announcement a few hours earlier. This quick reaction has fueled reactions to a potential inclusion of Dogecoin in the federal crypto reserve. However, while this reaction was impressive, the Dogecoin price is not the only asset that responded positively to this announcement. So, is the Dogecoin surge simply FOMO from investors? Can Dogecoin and other meme assets like Shiba Inu join the US crypto reserve? There are hundreds of questions about the Trump announcements, but let's keep it to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu with this article. However, if you're looking for a top investment choice this year, the Remittix presale offers an option you can take advantage of. But first, let's talk about DOGE and SHIB in the crypto reserve. What Does The Dogecoin Price Brief Response Mean In The Long-Term Projection? Dogecoin remains one of the top choices when talking about the crypto meme coin market. The market cap continues to keep it at the top as the largest meme coin in the world with a cap of about $29B, standing more than a distant second, Shiba Inu. However, many factors have been acting against the Dogecoin price since the beginning of the year, with the sudden influx of new meme coins being a significant concern. This has caused a sudden shift of attention to newer meme coins with options to make a new favorite out of the hundreds of new meme coins that joined in January. The Dogecoin price downtrend in the last few weeks has caused panic, which has made many investors liquidate their positions. However, the recent surge, although brief, has fueled what looks like a return to optimism. While speculations abound about the possibility of Dogecoin joining the crypto reserve as a meme coin option, this is not immediate. The recent surge could only lead to further selling. Where Is Shiba Inu's Place In The Future Of Meme Coins? To briefly touch on Shiba Inu, its addition to the crypto reserve looks highly unlikely. This is because, unlike Dogecoin, which got most of its influence from the contribution of key figures like Elon Musk, Shiba Inu does not have such a strong backing. However, although the Shiba Inu coin is the number two meme coin in the world, recent additions like the Trump coin have posed a big risk to its influence. Hence, adding a second meme coin to the crypto reserve might not help the Shiba Inu coin. With the recent news of a 99% drop in shibarium trading activity, the sun might already be setting on Shiba Inu's dominance. Here Is Why Remittix Could Be The Primary Talk In Crypto This Year Undeniably, the crypto market is already making its way into mainstream finance. Countries such as El Salvador, Japan, and the US are already taking a strong position with cryptocurrency, and it is only a matter of time before it becomes a global currency. However, solutions around its payment integration and remittance are still in their early phases. The Remittix approach to crypto payment allows users to freely send money to different corners of the world, which is delivered directly into the receiver's account. This solution takes the best parts of the traditional banking system, creating ease with FIAT, and mixes them with the decentralization and security of the blockchain. The word in town is that Remittix is the future of crypto payment, as it delivers payment faster and at a lower fee. The ongoing Remittix token presale has become the center of all discussions this year, with over 5x in returns over the last few weeks. But there is more to come with this new token , as experts believe the launch could even bring more growth of over 50x this year, breaking all presale records. Now is a good time to take advantage of this new token, which is still in an ongoing presale round. Check the links below for information on how to buy.

Spotlight on Chainlink (LINK) and Litecoin (LTC) as potential risers. This article dives into insights from experts. Are these coins set for a bullish trend? Readers will discover whether these digital assets are primed for significant growth and what factors could drive their success. Chainlink's Price Journey: Short-Term Dips and Long-Term Growth Chainlink saw a sharp decline of 26.89% over the last month, marking recent market volatility. Over the past six months, however, it surged 49.04%, showing strong long-term growth. The performance changes signal fluctuating investor sentiment and shifting market dynamics. Price trends have adjusted significantly over different durations. Currently, Chainlink trades between 10.20 and 22.70 dollars. Resistance appears near 30.59 dollars and higher at 43.10 dollars, while support holds around 5.58 dollars. Market signals hint at a slight bearish tilt with momentum indicators below neutral. Traders can explore buying opportunities near support levels or await a breakout above resistance for short-term plays. Litecoin Market Pulse: Short-term Dip Amid Strong Long-Term Rally Last month saw Litecoin fall by nearly 6%, alongside a weekly drop exceeding 10%. Despite this short-term weakness, the coin's performance over the past six months reveals a remarkable 55% gain, highlighting a strong long-term recovery. This contrast between immediate declines and extended resilience suggests that the overall upward trend remains intact, even as recent fluctuations create challenges for short-term traders. Currently, Litecoin trades between $92.68 and $151.78, with key resistance at $175.54 and a higher barrier at $234.65. The nearest support stands at $57.33. Bears currently dominate the market with negative momentum and oscillator readings. However, the RSI at 38.20 indicates a possibility for a bounce. Traders may want to monitor these levels for potential signs of a reversal or further breakdown. Conclusion Experts believe that LINK and LTC show potential for growth this month. Both coins have unique features that make them attractive to investors. LINK benefits from its role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data. LTC offers faster transaction times and lower fees. Market conditions and investor interest will play crucial roles in their performance. Watching key indicators can provide insights into their future movements. High trading volumes and positive market sentiments could drive prices up. Overall, LINK and LTC may experience significant activity and potential price increases this month. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg , this omission indicates that crypto is not a personal priority for Trump. “If it was a personal priority, then it would have been in the speech,” Seiberg wrote in a note on Wednesday. Trump sidelines crypto in speech, signaling political strategy or low priority The exclusion particularly stood out since Trump had referenced crypto in prior speeches and on social media just days before the Congress address, according to Seiberg. He views the exclusion as “more substantive” than Trump’s silence on other topics like housing and banking, given that the president does have a crypto strategy. Seiberg highlighted a political rationale for Trump’s omission of crypto in the speech, noting that congressional Republicans seek Democratic support for stablecoin legislation in the coming months. Trump’s involvement could complicate that effort. However, he also proposed a more nuanced reason — Trump does not view crypto as a central issue in his broader political agenda. “Trump talks up crypto when he is before crypto investors. Yet we continue to believe this is not a personal priority,” Seiberg said. Generally, Trump’s speech was “long on showmanship and short on substance for even a Donald Trump address,” according to Seiberg. “As many commentators noted last night, the address more resembled a campaign rally speech than a State of the Union speech.” The White House is set to hold its first Crypto Summit on Friday, led by Trump’s crypto czar, David Sacks. Industry leaders such as Michael Saylor and Brian Armstrong are expected to attend, with reports suggesting the event may reveal details about a U.S. crypto reserve. Crypto prices rally after Trump backs five coins for ‘Crypto reserve The president’s address, spanning a record 99 minutes, served as a defiant sales pitch for the policies Trump championed during his campaign and doubled down on in his first weeks back in office. He vowed to continue enacting sweeping changes to rescue the nation from what he described as his predecessor’s destruction and missteps. Throughout the speech, he rarely addressed the American people directly, who are grappling with recent upheavals, while repeatedly taking jabs at the Democratic lawmakers seated before him. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the Democratic response after Trump’s speech, said, “America wants change, but there’s a responsible way to make change and a reckless way, and we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy.” Though Trump did not mention cryptocurrency in his Congressional speech on Tuesday night, he recently revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he says he’d like to be included in a new strategic reserve to make the US “the Crypto Capital of the World. “ The market prices of the five coins he named – Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano – swiftly jumped after the announcement. During Trump’s presidential campaign, he aggressively courted the crypto community. The previous US president, Joe Biden, had overseen a crypto crackdown due to fraud and money laundering concerns.

Speaking in parliament on the 4th of March, she noted that the regulation of cryptocurrency is complicated due to its anonymous features and is advantageous to criminals. “Our advice to the public is to stay away from cryptocurrencies. The risk of getting burned is high, and if you become a victim of a scam, the chances of getting any of your money back are slim,” said Sun Xueling. Singaporeans suffered 1.1 billion yuan losses from scams last year, 70% more than in the same period last year. Such frauds included those involving cryptocurrency and contributed to a quarter of the losses incurred. With the increased use of cryptocurrencies, criminals are now using it to compel victims to withdraw their money into digital money so that it can hardly be traced. Cybercriminals and phishing attacks have also led to the loss of money from users’ digital wallets. Though the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates local crypto operations under the Payment Services Act, most exchanges and wallets are outside its jurisdiction. Sun remarked that even professional investors have fallen to the tricks of these fraudsters. Calls for tougher fraud penalties The question as to whether penalties for fraud should be more severe was also discussed. Jurong GRC MP Dr Tan Yew Meng opined that Singapore has overly lenient laws at present. While moneylenders who handle $10,000 worth of illicit money face caning, fraudsters who steal much larger sums can go scot-free. He even advocated for compulsory caning in cases where the fraud offence is considered severe. His statements demonstrate a rising concern that regulators have voiced in recent years about the rising number of crypto scams. Sun reported that at present, the government is examining the legislative measures against fraud and increasing some of the offences that can attract caning. She mentioned that more than 80% of the victims of the scam willingly transferred the money to the fraudster through impersonation, pretence of authority or fake promises of financial gains. To reduce this threat, the Singapore government has recently passed the Anti-Fraud Protection Bill. The law, however, allows authorities to block the assets of such victims in case they do not heed the threats. It is anticipated that this should be implemented this year. However, to date, there has not been a policy amendment with regard to some of these concerns. But it should be noted that according to local media reports, new regulations might be introduced soon. However, despite the fraud cases, cryptocurrency use is rising in Singapore. Singapore’s central bank doubled the number of licenses in the market in 2024 to improve stability.

Qubetics ($TICS) aims to do just that, offering solutions to real-world problems that previous platforms have struggled to address. Its innovative features and practical applications position it as a strong contender for those seeking the best crypto for quick profit.​ Meanwhile, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) has introduced the ASI-1 Mini, a Web3-native large language model designed to support complex agentic workflows. This development opens new avenues for the Web3 community to invest in, train, and own advanced AI models. In this article, we will delve into how Qubetics ($TICS) addresses real-life challenges unmet by its predecessors, positioning itself to meet the future demands of blockchain and digital finance.​ Qubetics: Pioneering Practical Blockchain Solutions Qubetics is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to tackle real-world issues through its comprehensive ecosystem. One of its standout features is the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which simplifies blockchain development for businesses, professionals, and individuals. This user-friendly platform enables seamless creation of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and other blockchain-based solutions.​ The QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for those looking to develop blockchain solutions without extensive coding knowledge. It offers a drag-and-drop interface, pre-built templates, and real-time testing environments, making blockchain development accessible to a broader audience. For instance, a small business can create a supply chain management system using QubeQode, ensuring transparency and efficiency without the need for a dedicated development team. Similarly, artists can tokenize their work, creating unique digital assets and opening new revenue streams. These practical applications demonstrate how Qubetics is poised to become the best crypto for quick profit.​ Qubetics is in its 24th crypto presale stage, having raised over $14.6 million from more than 22,200 token holders, with over 495 Million $TICS tokens sold. The current price per $TICS token is $0.0976, with projections suggesting a potential increase to $0.25 by the end of the presale. This growth trajectory indicates a significant return on investment for early participants, further solidifying Qubetics’ position as a top choice for those seeking quick profits in the crypto market. ​ If you invest $1,000 in $TICS at its current price of $0.0976 per token, you would receive approximately 10,245 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, your investment will grow to $2,561, yielding a 156% ROI. Should the price hit $1 after the presale, your holdings would be worth $10,240, reflecting a 924% ROI. If $TICS surges to $5, your investment would skyrocket to $51,200, achieving a 5,019% ROI. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance: Merging AI and Blockchain The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) represents a collaboration between leading blockchain-AI projects: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. This alliance aims to advance decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and, ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The recent introduction of the ASI-1 Mini, a Web3-native large language model, marks a significant milestone in this endeavor.​ The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token has faced a challenging market environment, with reports labeling it among the worst-performing altcoins of the year. Previously known as Fetch.ai (FET), ASI had shown an 8% gain as of mid-February, trading at $0.755, but recent trends indicate a decline. On the technology front, the introduction of ASI-1 Mini has provided Web3 users with new opportunities to invest in and train advanced AI models. Meanwhile, industry leaders such as Sam Altman continue to explore the potential of artificial superintelligence to surpass human capabilities across multiple domains, further shaping discussions around its future. SUI: Navigating Market Volatility SUI has recently experienced significant market fluctuations. Over the past 24 hours, its price plummeted by approximately 21%, reaching around $2.34. This sharp decline aligns with a broader market downturn, with the CoinDesk 20 Index down by 3.9%. Additionally, SUI has seen outflows exceeding $600 million from its ecosystem, contributing to a 17% price drop. Technical analyses suggest potential further declines, possibly towards the $1 mark, if key support levels fail.​ SUI unlocked approximately 40.63 million tokens, accounting for 1.28% of its current circulation and valued at around $117 million. Such token unlocks can increase supply and exert downward pressure on prices. Despite recent challenges, some analysts remain optimistic. Predictions suggest that SUI could reach a $10 billion market cap, driven by institutional adoption and ecosystem expansion. However, these forecasts are speculative and subject to market conditions. Participants are advised to exercise caution, monitor market trends, and consider both technical analyses and fundamental developments when evaluating SUI’s potential.​ Conclusion: Seizing Opportunities in Emerging Cryptos Qubetics stands out as a promising platform addressing real-world challenges with practical blockchain solutions. Its innovative features, such as the QubeQode IDE, make it accessible to a wide range of users, from businesses to individual creators. The ongoing presale and projected growth present a compelling opportunity for those seeking the best crypto for quick profit .

Speaking at an American Bar Association event in Miami today, SEC acting enforcement director Antonia Apps and CFTC enforcement director Brian Young noted that enforcement will remain a priority even amid broader policy changes. “You can expect to see some changes depending on priorities and different policies that we may pursue,” Apps said, “but we will move forward with the core enforcement agenda that we have always moved forward with.” The statements come at a time when both regulatory agencies are undergoing significant transformations under Republican leadership. Since late January, the SEC has been reviewing its cryptocurrency enforcement policies, while the CFTC has been restructuring its enforcement division. Related News: Analytics Company Shares 7 ""Most Negative"" Altcoins According to Funding Rates The comments were made at a government enforcement conference focused on white-collar crime, where Justice Department officials reportedly withdrew from speaking because of ongoing changes and turmoil within the Justice Department. Both Apps and Young voiced strong support for enforcement personnel, who are facing mass layoffs and budget cuts as the administration, along with special adviser Elon Musk, seeks to reshape the federal workforce. “In addition to doing a great job, the CFTC enforcement staff are genuinely good people,” Young said. “I think the taxpayers should be indebted to them for what they do for us every day.” Young also noted that the agency prioritizes cases that have a strong likelihood of returning funds to victims of fraud or market manipulation. One of the most notable policy changes came at the SEC, which has paused or dropped active litigation and investigations related to cryptocurrencies. When asked about the future of crypto enforcement, Apps reiterated that the agency will continue to pursue cases involving fraud and clear regulatory jurisdiction. “We're not walking away,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The ministry said the National Welfare Fund (NWF)’s level of liquid funds should be topped up to reach a level equivalent to 7-10% of Russia’s GDP before Moscow considers buying “riskier” assets like crypto. Russian Crypto Reserve: Could Moscow Start Buying BTC? Per the Russian media outlets Interfax and RBC , the claims came from the Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev, who claimed that the ministry “is not currently considering” buying or holding crypto in the NWF “due to its high volatility.” Vladimir Kolychev, the Russian Deputy Finance Minister. (Source: Katerina Vorontsova/YouTube/Screenshot) When questioned on the matter, Kolychev said that the ministry would “not” make changes in the structure of the NWF’s investments. He said that the fund would continue to focus exclusively on gold and Chinese yuan holdings. Media outlets say that 60% of the fund is made up of yuan, with the remaining 40% in gold reserves. Gold bars embossed with a stamp that reads “Russia.” (Source: Kapital Strany/YouTube/Screenshot) However, Kolychev said it would be “possible to consider riskier assets” when the NWF reaches Moscow’s 7%-10% target. “When we get there, we will be able to think about different assets, including crypto. However, for now, the volatility signs are not favorable.” Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev Kolychev added that Russia is still “far” from reaching its desired levels of reserves. And that is why Moscow will only countenance buying gold and yuan reserves for the time being. We Need Liquidity, Says Deputy Finance Chief The Deputy Finance Minister said the fund’s assets “must be liquid and not subject to sharp revaluations.” He added: “When we sell our reserves, the sales should not result in us receiving 50 kopeks for each ruble we invested, instead of a ruble for each ruble’s worth of our assets.” The comments come just months after Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told university students who asked him about creating a Russian crypto reserve that the Treasury needed to “earn less, but keep its powder dry.” Trump pivots to the war in Ukraine and his talks with Russia. Trump says he has gotten “strong signals” from Russia that Moscow is ready for peace. “Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” Trump asks. Latest updates: https://t.co/vDJlBJzZHe pic.twitter.com/kVlCxo25W9 — Bloomberg (@business) March 5, 2025 Central Bank’s Final Say Kolychev concluded by saying that he was not party to any “discussions about creating a cryptocurrency reserve in Russia” similar to Washington’s own strategic crypto reserve fund. He claimed that final decisions on such matters would be taken by the Russian Central Bank. As previously reported, the Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina is a known crypto-skeptic . Nabiullina has tried on multiple occasions to orchestrate a total, China-style ban on crypto in Russia.

A recent post by cryptocurrency researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) emphasized how this system was implemented to eliminate uncertainty about XRP’s future supply and prevent concerns over centralized control. The discussion, accompanied by a highlighted excerpt from Ripple’s 2017 announcement, has reignited conversations about how XRP’s escrow functions and its broader implications. “Ripple’s Escrow Safeguards XRP’s Price” Ripple’s escrow system was designed to eliminate uncertainty about XRP’s future supply. By locking up a significant portion of XRP, Ripple ensured the market wouldn’t be concerned about centralized control over its distribution. … pic.twitter.com/5fk9ZjQjkG — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) March 3, 2025 The Purpose of Ripple’s Escrow According to Ripple’s 2017 statement, the company locked 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow system, releasing a maximum of 1 billion XRP per month over 55 months. As Ripple stated, the purpose, was “to remove uncertainty around XRP’s future supply” and ensure that a large quantity would not enter the market at once, preventing drastic price fluctuations. This strategy was designed to establish predictability in XRP’s distribution and counter fears of market oversupply. XRP Allocation from Escrow SMQKE’s post reiterated that the primary use of released XRP is “to incentivize market makers for XRP-based currency exchanges and for sales to institutional investors—not retail.” This aligns with Ripple’s original announcement, which stated that XRP would facilitate liquidity by offering “tighter spreads between currency pairs” and would also be sold to institutional investors. Unused XRP at the end of each month is returned to escrow, extending the timeline for its eventual release. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The post directly counters claims that Ripple’s escrow is a means to dump XRP on retail investors. SMQKE argued that if Ripple were indiscriminately “dumping” XRP from escrow, its price would be significantly lower. The structured and controlled release mechanism prevents sudden supply shocks that could negatively impact XRP’s market performance. Speculation on XRP’s Role in Broader Economic Strategy An X user, Wolfemother, commented on the post, speculating on a potential future use case for Ripple’s escrowed XRP . They proposed that it could be utilized as part of a “government’s strategic crypto reserve,” suggesting that the total escrowed XRP—amounting to 37 billion—could reach a value of $1,000 per XRP, equating to $37 trillion, roughly aligning with the U.S. national debt. While speculative, such theories reflect ongoing discussions about the long-term implications of Ripple’s escrow model and whether XRP could help global financial structures. As discussions continue, the system remains a key component of XRP’s market structure, negating the claims of indiscriminate token sales while also fueling broader speculation about its role in the financial ecosystem.

As 2025 unfolds, selecting the right assets could make a significant difference in building a profitable portfolio. While established tokens maintain their dominance, newer projects are introducing compelling solutions that could shape the future of blockchain technology. This guide highlights some of the most promising cryptos for 2025. Each has been analyzed based on recent developments, current performance, and long-term growth potential. From decentralized e-commerce platforms to blockchain protocols advancing decentralization, these are the projects to keep an eye on. 1. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is revolutionizing online shopping by creating a direct marketplace between buyers and sellers using blockchain technology. By removing intermediaries, the platform reduces transaction costs and enhances user privacy. Its presale has gained significant attention, with the 3BAY token currently priced at $0.00524 in its 5th stage, raising over $1.54 million. Analysts anticipate a launch price of $0.1959, potentially offering early investors a 4,200% return. The roadmap for 2025 outlines several key milestones, including full decentralization by Q4 and the introduction of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to involve the community in decision-making. Plans to integrate PayPal and other payment systems are also in motion. With its blend of practical application and strong demand, Web3Bay presents an opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential in the crypto market. 2. Near Protocol: Advancing Blockchain Accessibility Near Protocol (NEAR) continues to innovate, becoming the first non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain to integrate with MetaMask. This connection, facilitated through the NEAR Snap feature, enables seamless account creation and transactions within MetaMask, making blockchain interactions more user-friendly. Currently trading at $3.29 after a slight 2.37% decline, Near Protocol remains focused on scalability and ease of use. With growing adoption in decentralized applications (dApps) and enhanced interoperability, NEAR has the potential to solidify its place among the most promising projects for 2025. 3. Pi Coin: A Community-Powered Ecosystem Pi Coin (PI) has gained attention for its mobile-first mining approach, allowing users to participate in blockchain activities through their smartphones. With a community of over 35 million, Pi Network has generated widespread discussion, particularly following recent speculation about a possible Binance listing. In a community vote on Binance Square, 86.2% of participants supported the listing of PI, although Binance has stated that this is not yet confirmed. Despite its strong user base, potential investors should be mindful of ongoing concerns regarding the project’s legitimacy. Chinese authorities have issued warnings about possible risks related to data privacy. Those considering Pi Coin should thoroughly research before making investment decisions. 4. Hyperliquid: Innovating Decentralized Trading Hyperliquid (HYPE) is gaining traction in decentralized finance (DeFi) with its perpetual trading platform. Recent upgrades include AI-driven trading tools and zero-slippage order execution, improving efficiency and user experience. Over the past month, HYPE has risen by 23%, fueled by increasing trading volumes and platform enhancements. To further strengthen its position, the Hyperliquid Foundation is addressing transparency concerns regarding validator operations. With advanced trading features and a focus on improving accessibility, Hyperliquid is well-positioned for continued growth in 2025. 5. Chainlink: Leading Cross-Chain Data Integration Chainlink (LINK) remains a key player in the blockchain ecosystem, offering critical services for connecting smart contracts with real-world data. Its oracles facilitate seamless data transfers, supporting numerous decentralized applications. Recent updates have focused on expanding staking options and increasing institutional adoption. Although LINK’s price has seen an 18% drop, now sitting at $16.43, its fundamental technology remains strong. With continued developments and integrations, Chainlink presents a viable option for those seeking stability and innovation in their crypto portfolio. Final Thoughts Choosing the right cryptocurrencies involves weighing potential growth against associated risks. Web3Bay offers a fresh approach to e-commerce, while Near Protocol’s technological improvements make blockchain interactions more accessible. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s trading advancements and Chainlink’s role in data connectivity highlight the broad range of opportunities available. Investors should stay informed and track emerging trends to make strategic decisions. Whether looking for high-growth opportunities or established stability, these projects represent some of the most promising options for 2025.

Plus, Insights on DOGE Price Rally & ADA Price Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/achievement-unlocked-inter-milan-boosts-blockdags-presale-to-200m-plus-insights-on-doge-price-rally-ada-price-surge/,"The crypto market is delivering a new kind of excitement, and traders are all in. The Dogecoin price rally is causing a stir on the charts, while the latest Cardano (ADA) price surge is fueling discussions about whether it will break through key resistance. Also, the buzz about ETF approvals and mainstream interest keeps expectations high for both currencies. BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves on social media, partly due to its collaboration with Inter Milan, which has proven to be a catalyst for its presale success. The initiative has amassed over $200 million, selling 18.7 billion coins. BlockDAG’s social media presence has swelled to about 226,000 followers, positioning it as today’s top bullish crypto. Dogecoin Price Rally Gains Momentum Amid ETF Speculation DOGE has reached $0.2793 as the Dogecoin price rally draws more eyes, with its trading volume up by 38.41% at $2.34 billion. Analysts predict that surpassing the 0.618 Fibonacci level might send Dogecoin to a possible high of $2.30. A significant driver of the Dogecoin price rally is the short squeeze that wiped out over 28 million DOGE from short positions, causing a sharp price increase. The SEC’s nod to Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF proposal also boosts the sentiment. Analysts suggest this might open doors for broader market participation, potentially stabilizing DOGE in the long run. Cardano (ADA) Price Surge Encounters Resistance at $0.98 The Cardano (ADA) price surge has injected optimism among ADA supporters, with analysts suggesting it could hit $1.35 if it overcomes existing barriers. Currently, ADA is priced around $0.7719, with a slight 3% dip over the past day but showing promise for a recovery. A strong upward Cardano (ADA) price surge could emerge if ADA can rise above $0.9837, seen by analysts as a crucial milestone. If this is achieved, ADA could potentially climb to $1.16 and further to $1.35. The growing interest from the market has seen ADA attract $4.4 million in the past month while Bitcoin and Ethereum faced significant withdrawals. The anticipation of a Cardano ETF continues to bolster ADA’s longer-term prospects. BlockDAG’s Partnership with Inter Milan Catalyzes Presale Success BlockDAG is swiftly gaining attention in the cryptocurrency sphere, greatly aided by its partnership with Inter Milan . This collaboration is not merely about brand visibility; it’s about introducing BlockDAG to millions of soccer enthusiasts, effectively narrowing the divide between cryptocurrency and popular culture. This increased visibility is enhancing BlockDAG’s credibility and accelerating its presale activities. BlockDAG’s success is evident in the numbers, with the presale amassing a staggering $200 million and distributing over 18.7 billion coins. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, early participants have reaped a 2,380% ROI—a commendable achievement for a project still in the presale stage. This partnership has also significantly expanded BlockDAG’s social media presence, with notable increases across platforms like Telegram (71.7K), X (108.1K), Discord (20.7K), and Instagram (25.4K). Analysts are optimistic that this increased exposure will hasten the growth of BlockDAG’s ecosystem and cement its future prospects. The combination of widespread visibility and robust community engagement distinguishes BlockDAG as it continues to grow its network. Some analysts even suggest that the presale might eventually exceed $600 million due to the soaring demand for BlockDAG. Both retail and more organized interest are on the rise, indicating that BlockDAG is more than just another coin; it’s becoming a significant movement. Final Say The cryptocurrency market is ripe with new possibilities, with Dogecoin’s price rally and the anticipation of an ETF driving sustained trader interest, while Cardano’s price surge and increased attention are fueling discussions on ADA’s potential to overcome significant resistance levels. Amidst this, BlockDAG is carving out a notable niche for itself with the help of its Inter Milan partnership, which is greatly advancing its crypto presale and bolstering its social media footprint. Having already secured over $200 million, BlockDAG is reinforcing its status as a top bullish crypto. The community is keenly watching their BDAG holdings appreciate as the project captures the attention of a growing audience.

41209217,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=687702,1741219246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41209217.jpeg,Trump advisers start mapping out a plan for a national crypto reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-advisers-start-mapping-out-a-plan-for-a-national-crypto-reserve/,"President Donald Trump’s administration has officially started executing plans for its federal crypto strategic reserve, and step one is figuring out exactly how much crypto the US government already owns, according to a report from the Journal. A month into a six-month planning phase, Trump’s interagency working group is reportedly doing a full audit of existing crypto holdings, which include assets seized from criminals. Trump first floated the idea of a government-backed crypto stockpile last summer during his campaign, and in January, he signed an executive order to begin laying the foundation. Bo Hines, executive director of the working group, confirmed the process was underway, saying , “The first thing we have to do is get an accounting of what the government has. We’ll provide more insight as that continues.” Trump is expected to give a speech about the initiative on Friday at a White House industry summit, where more details will probably come. White House team counts up government-owned crypto The Justice Department and US Marshals Service oversee billions of dollars in confiscated Bitcoin and other crypto assets, mostly taken from criminals. According to the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, $18 billion worth of Bitcoin is sitting in government-controlled wallets, though accounting issues have made it unclear how much is actually secured. As part of the new plan, officials are now tallying up these holdings to determine whether they will become part of the official crypto reserve. What’s still unclear is whether the administration will also buy new crypto for the reserve. If they do, Congress might need to approve large acquisitions. There’s also the question of who exactly will oversee the stockpile—whether the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, or a newly created agency. Right now, no federal entity is set up to manage a crypto reserve of this scale. Trump’s push for a government crypto reserve has divided analysts and investors alike. Supporters say it could legitimize digital assets and integrate them into the country’s financial system. Crypto advocates have poured millions into Trump’s campaign and inauguration in efforts to make the reserve a reality. But critics argue that crypto isn’t comparable to gold or oil, which are two assets commonly stockpiled by governments. Gene Hoffman, CEO of blockchain firm Chia Network, doesn’t think the US should be making these calls yet. “The United States government shouldn’t be making this call yet,” he said . Others warn that the extreme volatility of crypto could turn a government reserve into a financial disaster if prices crash. Timothy Massad, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, believes Trump’s plan could be more about paying back campaign supporters than actual financial strategy. “It concerns me that it is a payback for their support of Trump and the Republican Party,” Massad said. Meanwhile, Bitcoin momentarily surged 10% after Trump’s announcement, proving just how much influence he has over the market. Financial advisers in the UK and US are reporting a spike in clients asking about crypto investments. Why people are concerned about Trump’s crypto plans One of the biggest issues with a government-controlled crypto reserve is security. Crypto is a prime target for hackers, and federal agencies haven’t always been great at keeping track of what they already have. The US Marshals Service has struggled to manage seized crypto, and with $18 billion in Bitcoin alone, the potential for mismanagement is quite high. Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital warned that security needs to be a top priority. He recommended keeping assets stored in cold wallets with private keys only accessible under strict controls. “There will need to be some careful consideration about how the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are held and how they are held securely,” McCauley said. Cryptos are difficult to safeguard because they are targeted by sophisticated hackers, putting a premium on cybersecurity measures for crypto exchanges and custodians that hold assets. Bybit, one of the world’s biggest exchanges, recently saw the hacker group Lazarus stole over $1.4 billion in Ethereum from its cold wallets. “Criminals have stolen tokens worth $1.5 billion from the crypto exchange Bybit, prompting a rush of customers demanding their funds back,” Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said. He compared it to the final chaotic hours of FTX, where mass withdrawals led to a complete collapse. “Although Bybit claims to be stable, the developments evoke memories of the chaotic final hours of the now-defunct FTX exchange.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

More and more people are approaching me. If it’s profitable for us, let’s do it. We have excess electricity. Let them produce this cryptocurrency and so on,” Lukashenko told Alexei Kushnarenko, Belarus’s newly appointed energy minister, as reported by local media outlet Belta. Belarus considers crypto mining amid rising global interest in digital reserves This President of Belarus suggestion emerges as the U.S. government is studying the possibility of creating a national strategic crypto reserve that could include assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Lukashenko acknowledged the White House’s growing interest in digital assets, stating, “You see the direction the world is taking, especially the largest economy. They announced yesterday that they will maintain a crypto reserve.” “Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves,” Lukashenko said . Belarus wouldn’t be the first nation to mine digital assets. The Kingdom of Bhutan, with its abundance of hydropower, already has more than 100 megawatts (MW) of operational bitcoin mining infrastructure and is set to get another 500MW worth of power online. The country currently holds $950 million in Bitcoin, according to Arkham Intelligence. El Salvador on the other hand uses geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin, though in smaller quantities. Trump pushes crypto strategy forward with first-ever summit Even with the Trump administration’s promises and enthusiasm, the industry has been left disappointed by meme coin scandals and a lack of concrete government action—aside from the dismissal of a few SEC cases and the release of a somewhat ambiguous Executive Order on January 23. That disappointment, however, just got a temporary lift. Two days ago, the White House announced it would hold its first-ever crypto summit this Friday, chaired by White House A.I. & Crypto Czar David Sacks and overseen by Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reports that the roundtable, scheduled from 6:30 pm to 10:30 pm UTC, is expected to include more than 25 participants, including members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets. As of Wednesday morning, Terrett reported that 11 crypto executives and two White House representatives had confirmed their attendance. However, it seems Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson is not invited to the Summit on Friday, according to a White House source familiar with the guest list. In fact, neither Hoskinson nor any representatives for Cardano have been invited to meet with the president since the inauguration. Many in the community had also taken X posts from Hoskinson in February to mean he would attend a fundraising dinner for pro-crypto PAC MAGA Inc. this past Saturday. As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, excitement is building within the crypto community. This marks progress toward the Executive Order’s goals of bolstering U.S. leadership in digital assets and financial technology while safeguarding economic freedom. However, for a president who closely ties stock market performance to his success, the summit’s announcement alone likely fell short. That may explain why Trump took it a step further, unveiling the first five tokens set to be included in a future crypto reserve: Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, Ripple, and Solana. Trump’s social media posts offer little additional detail on the planned “reserve,” as he referred to it in his Sunday posts. However, the choice of the word “reserve” appears to signal a shift from the administration’s stance in January’s Executive Order. The term “reserve” suggests that the government will proactively purchase more assets. In contrast, the intention stated in January’s executive order to “evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile” would be more about holding onto the $19.1 billion in crypto, 97.9% of which is in Bitcoin, that it already has from seizures across dozens of tokens.

Describing this disparity as “value asymmetry,” the report points out that Solana’s DeFi sector is growing faster and generating more revenue than Ethereum’s, but its tokens remain relatively undervalued. “Solana DeFi valuation multiples are trading lower than their Ethereum counterparts on average despite their significantly higher growth profiles, highlighting a distinct valuation asymmetry,” the report said. Franklin Templeton conducted an analysis comparing five leading Ethereum-based DeFi projects (LDO, AAVE, ENA, MKR, and UNI) to five of Solana’s top-performing protocols (JTO, JUP, KMNO, MNDE, and RAY). The findings showed that Solana projects experienced a staggering 2,400% median growth in fees year-over-year and a median valuation multiple of 9x. In contrast, Ethereum projects saw a more modest growth of 150% and a multiple of 18x. Related News: Analytics Company Shares 7 ""Most Negative"" Altcoins According to Funding Rates This valuation disparity follows a period of rapid expansion for Solana. The network’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have witnessed a surge in trading activity, led primarily by memecoin investors. In January 2025, Solana’s DEXs recorded higher trading volumes than the entire Ethereum ecosystem combined. “DeFi may be entering an era of Solana Virtual Machine dominance, moving away from the historical reign of EVM-based DeFi,” the report said. However, Franklin Templeton clarified that this does not indicate Ethereum’s decline. Instead, the firm noted that the increased activity on Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solutions indicates the strategic evolution of the network. “The shift of activity to layer-2 blockchains is evidence that the Ethereum scaling approach is advancing incrementally,” the report said. Despite the current undervaluation of Solana-based DeFi assets, Franklin Templeton predicted that this disparity may not last forever. “As Solana continues to demonstrate its resilience as a decentralized computing platform, the market may soon price blue-chip, cornerstone Solana DeFi protocols in line with comparable Ethereum protocols,” the report concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Needless to say, the Pepe coin’s speculative mania might not be over despite a downturn of over 35% in the last 30 days. However, Rollblock’s presale is changing the GambleFi sector, raising over $10.8 million in a move that makes RBLK a compelling alternative to speculative meme coins. Analysts already forecast a 100x uptick on launch for RBLK. Pepe’s market performance and risks PEPE’s meme coin hype has persisted since its launch, as the coin surged from a market cap of about $517 million to above $11 billion. Those who bought into Pepe even as early as January 2024 have managed to accumulate a 10x gain. However, past performance is never a guarantee of future results in the world of meme coins. Pepe coin’s recent dips have sparked a wave of uncertainty among holders. Traders who once saw Pepe coin as an easy path to quick profits are starting to exit their positions.

Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, boldly claims a looming debt crisis and calls it a “potential heart attack.” In a statement, Dalio argued that once we reach a point in the cycle where one borrows more money to service debt and bond holders say that it’s risky, it becomes a “debt debt spiral.” Dalio compares the current debt crisis to a heart attack waiting to happen if authorities fail to provide interventions. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Won’t Stop At $150K’ This Year, Research Firm Chief Says Understanding The Current US Debt Issue Dalio’s insights on the current economic landscape and the country’s looming debt crisis come as the crypto market cap drops to $2.76 trillion in one day. During the market shakeoff this week, the overall crypto market cap dropped by 8%, with Ethereum and Bitcoin leading the losers with 11% and 8%, respectively. The US is currently facing a growing debt and excessive budget deficits. According to recent data, the country’s national debt is now $33.6 trillion, with a massive deficit of $1.7 trillion in 2023, equal to 5.8% of the total GDP. Researchers are also warning about the increasing cost of servicing the debt, hitting $879 billion in 2023, comparable to the size of the country’s budget for national defense. Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences. pic.twitter.com/MbBpHO76mN — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) February 6, 2018 Dalio Says Alternative Stores Of Value Can Help In an interview on the Odds Lots podcast, Dalio offered insights on how the general public responds to an economic crisis. He mentioned that in times of economic uncertainties, many investors are looking at alternative stores of value. Dalio asks: What’s an alternative to money with a stable supply? He mentioned the growing role of Bitcoin and digital assets as leverage against inflation. “Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences.” he added. Dalio’s insights followed US President Trump’s announcement on the proposed US strategic reserve, which includes top coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, and Cardano. Trump’s statement was followed by a spike in crypto prices, with Bitcoin surging to over $90k after revisiting $80k. While Bitcoin’s price surged for the day, its dominance dipped from 55.4% to 50%, reflecting the shift in capital to altcoins. Historically, a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance catalyzes an altcoin run, which now excites many on social media. Is Bitcoin The Answer? Although Ray Dalio didn’t categorically mention Bitcoin as the “potential savior”, his recent statements suggest a favorable view on the premier digital asset. Due to its decentralization, Dalio highlighted the asset’s potential as a hedge against economic uncertainties.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,000 followers on the social media platform X that the XRP against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC) pair is flashing a bearish divergence on the weekly chart. Traders keep a close eye on coins flashing a bearish divergence as the signal suggests the token is losing bullish momentum and may be ready to enter a downtrend. Bluntz also notes that XRP appears to be in the midst of an ABC correction against the US dollar. “Looks increasingly like that was a complacency shoulder B wave on XRP in my opinion. If BTC and SOL taught me anything the last month, do not fade the weekly bear divs.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that an asset tends to go through an ABC pullback after completing a five-wave rally. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will fall to the $1 area to complete the ABC correction. At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.46. In January, when BTC was trading above $100,000, Bluntz said that Bitcoin appears to have completed a five-wave rally and that a market top may be in. He later updated his outlook and said that Bitcoin was flashing a bearish divergence on the monthly timeframe. Last month, he told his followers that SOL looked weak after losing the $220 level while showing a bearish divergence on the two-week chart. At time of writing, BTC is trading for $87,421 and SOL is worth $144.78.

The Federal Reserve just dropped its latest Beige Book , and it’s painting a picture of the U.S. economy that’s… well, let’s just say it’s not a blockbuster, but it’s far from a horror show. Think of it as a modest sequel – not as thrilling as the original, but still holding its own. Let’s dive into what this economic snapshot means, especially for those of us keeping a close eye on the crypto markets. Decoding the Fed Beige Book: A Glimpse into Economic Growth The Fed’s Beige Book , a report published eight times a year, offers a qualitative assessment of current economic conditions across the twelve Federal Reserve districts. Think of it as economic tea leaves, gathered from anecdotal evidence from businesses, community leaders, and other contacts. This latest edition, covering the period since mid-January, reveals a recurring theme: modest economic growth . But what does ‘modest’ really mean in the grand scheme of things, and more importantly, how does it impact our crypto world? Here’s a quick rundown of the key takeaways: Slight Expansion: Most districts reported slight or modest growth, suggesting the economy is still inching forward, albeit not at a breakneck pace. Consumer Spending Dip: Perhaps the most concerning note is the decline in consumer spending in several districts. This is a crucial indicator as consumer spending fuels a significant portion of the US economy. Manufacturing Gains: On a brighter note, manufacturing showed modest gains in some areas, hinting at pockets of resilience within the industrial sector. Job Growth Slowdown: Job growth was described as slow across the board, and wage increases are easing. This could be interpreted as a cooling labor market, which has implications for inflation. Price Pressures Persist: Prices continued to rise across districts. Interestingly, some firms are finding it difficult to pass on increased costs to consumers, while others are preemptively raising prices anticipating tariffs. In essence, the Beige Book paints a picture of an economy in a state of cautious equilibrium – growing, but with headwinds and uncertainties. Wu Blockchain, a prominent voice on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted the nuanced outlook, noting that despite policy and tariff concerns, regional outlooks remain cautiously optimistic. This cautious optimism is a key thread running through the report. The Consumer Spending Conundrum: What Does it Mean for Crypto? The dip in consumer spending is arguably the most significant detail for crypto enthusiasts. Why? Because consumer sentiment and spending power are intertwined with investment appetite, including investments in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. If consumers are tightening their belts, it could signal a shift away from discretionary spending and investments. Here’s the breakdown of why declining consumer spending matters: Reduced Liquidity: Less spending can translate to less disposable income available for investments, including crypto. Risk Aversion: Economic uncertainty often leads to risk aversion. Consumers might prefer to hold onto cash or invest in safer assets rather than volatile cryptocurrencies. Broader Economic Slowdown: Declining consumer spending can be a leading indicator of a broader economic slowdown, which can negatively impact all markets, including crypto. However, it’s crucial to remember that the Beige Book is a snapshot in time and reflects anecdotal evidence. It’s not a definitive forecast. Furthermore, the crypto market operates on global dynamics, and while US consumer spending is important, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Navigating Inflation and the Economic Outlook Inflation remains a persistent concern, as prices continue to rise across regions, according to the Beige Book. The report highlights a mixed bag when it comes to businesses passing on costs. Some are struggling, indicating potential pressure on profit margins, while others are preemptively hiking prices due to anticipated tariffs. This inflationary environment has significant implications for the economic outlook and, by extension, the crypto market. Here’s how inflation and the broader economic outlook are connected to crypto: Inflation Hedge Narrative: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often touted as an inflation hedge. In inflationary times, investors might turn to crypto as a store of value, potentially driving up demand and prices. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Central banks’ responses to inflation, particularly interest rate hikes, can impact crypto markets. Higher interest rates can make traditional investments more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Economic Uncertainty: Inflation adds to economic uncertainty. While some investors might see crypto as a safe haven during uncertainty, others might reduce risk exposure across the board. The Beige Book’s mention of cautious optimism despite these inflationary pressures suggests a belief that the economy can navigate these challenges. However, the path forward remains uncertain, and vigilance is key. Job Growth and Manufacturing Gains: Glimmers of Hope? While the Beige Book notes slow job growth and easing wage increases, the modest manufacturing gains offer a sliver of positivity. Manufacturing is a foundational sector, and any growth, however modest, can be seen as a positive sign for overall economic health. Furthermore, a cooling labor market, while concerning for job seekers, could be seen as a positive development in the fight against inflation, as it may reduce wage-price pressures. How do these factors play into the crypto narrative? Manufacturing as an Indicator: Manufacturing health can be a barometer for broader economic activity. Continued modest gains could signal underlying economic resilience, which is generally positive for all markets, including crypto. Labor Market Dynamics: A cooling labor market and easing wage pressures could influence the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. If inflation shows signs of easing, the Fed might become less hawkish, which could be beneficial for risk assets like crypto. Overall Economic Sentiment: These mixed signals – slow job growth but manufacturing gains – contribute to the overall cautious optimism reflected in the Beige Book. This sentiment, while not overtly bullish, suggests a degree of stability that can be reassuring for investors. Actionable Insights and Crypto Market Strategy So, what can we glean from the Fed’s Beige Book for our crypto strategies? Monitor Consumer Spending Data: Keep a close eye on upcoming consumer spending data releases. A continued decline could signal a more significant economic slowdown and potentially impact crypto markets. Track Inflation Metrics: Inflation remains a key driver of market sentiment. Monitor inflation reports and central bank responses closely. Stay Informed on Fed Policy: The Fed’s monetary policy decisions will heavily influence the economic outlook and market conditions. Pay attention to Fed speeches and announcements. Diversification is Key: In times of economic uncertainty, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto or any other asset class. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is volatile and operates in cycles. Focus on long-term fundamentals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term economic reports. Conclusion: Navigating the Modest Growth Landscape The Fed’s Beige Book offers a nuanced, if somewhat underwhelming, snapshot of the US economy. Economic growth is happening, but it’s modest. Consumer spending is a concern, while manufacturing gains offer a glimmer of hope. Inflation persists, and the overall economic outlook is cautiously optimistic. For the crypto market, this report underscores the ongoing economic uncertainties and the need for a balanced and informed investment approach.

41211692,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137360,1741223997,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Bitwise Files Aptos ETF Application with SEC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-aptos-etf-sec-filing/,"Get ready for a potential game-changer in the crypto investment world! U.S. asset management giant Bitwise has just thrown its hat into the ring, submitting a crucial S-1 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Aptos (APT) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This exciting development signals a growing appetite for diverse crypto investment products and could pave the way for wider adoption of Aptos within traditional financial markets. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast or potential investor? Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking news. What is an Aptos ETF and Why is it Significant? Before we get too deep, let’s break down the basics. An Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF, is essentially a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. Think of it as a basket holding various assets – in this case, the assets would be related to Aptos. A spot Aptos ETF , if approved, would directly hold APT tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Aptos without directly purchasing and managing the cryptocurrency themselves. This is a huge deal for several reasons: Accessibility for Retail Investors: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This means everyday investors who might find navigating crypto exchanges daunting can invest in Aptos through a familiar and regulated financial product. Increased Institutional Adoption: Institutional investors, such as pension funds and large investment firms, are often restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies. An Aptos ETF provides a compliant and regulated pathway for these institutions to allocate capital to the Aptos ecosystem, potentially driving significant inflows. Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: The approval of an Aptos ETF by the SEC would be a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It signals that regulatory bodies are becoming more comfortable with digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. Diversification Opportunities: For investors already involved in crypto, an Aptos ETF offers a convenient way to diversify their portfolios beyond established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In essence, an Aptos ETF acts as a bridge, connecting the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency with the established infrastructure of traditional finance. It simplifies access, broadens participation, and potentially injects substantial capital into the Aptos network. Bitwise ETF Application: A Closer Look at the Filing So, who is Bitwise, and why is their Bitwise ETF application noteworthy? Bitwise Asset Management is a well-established player in the crypto investment space, known for its expertise in digital asset funds. They manage a range of crypto-focused investment products and have been actively involved in advocating for and launching crypto ETFs. Here’s what we know about their recent filing: S-1 Filing: Bitwise submitted an S-1 form to the SEC. This is the initial registration statement required for new securities, including ETFs, to be offered to the public. It’s a crucial first step in the ETF approval process. Delaware Entity Registration: Prior to the SEC filing, Bitwise registered the ETF entity in Delaware. This is a common practice for financial entities due to Delaware’s favorable corporate laws. Spot ETF: Based on the information available, it is expected to be a spot Bitwise ETF , meaning it will hold actual APT tokens. This is different from futures-based ETFs, which derive their value from futures contracts and not the underlying asset itself. Track Record: Bitwise has a history of launching innovative crypto investment products. Their experience and credibility within the crypto space lend weight to their Bitwise ETF application. While the filing is a positive sign, it’s important to remember that it’s just the beginning of a potentially lengthy review process by the SEC. The SEC will meticulously examine various aspects of the application, including market surveillance, custody arrangements, and investor protection measures. Navigating the SEC Filing Process for Crypto ETFs: What are the Hurdles? The path to SEC approval for a crypto ETF , especially one holding a cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, is not without its challenges. The SEC has been cautious in approving spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto market. Here are some key hurdles that Bitwise and their Aptos ETF application will likely face: Challenge Description Potential Bitwise Approach Market Surveillance Concerns The SEC wants assurance that the underlying Aptos market is robust and resistant to manipulation. Bitwise will need to demonstrate strong surveillance mechanisms in the APT trading markets and potentially partner with exchanges that have robust compliance programs. Custody of Assets Secure and regulated custody of APT tokens is paramount. The SEC needs to be convinced that investor assets are safe. Bitwise will likely utilize qualified custodians that meet SEC standards for digital asset custody. Valuation and Liquidity Accurate and transparent valuation of APT and sufficient liquidity in the market are essential for ETF operations. Bitwise will need to demonstrate reliable pricing sources and sufficient market depth for APT trading. Investor Protection The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection. They will scrutinize the ETF structure and disclosures to ensure investors are adequately informed about the risks involved. Bitwise will need to provide clear and comprehensive disclosures about the risks associated with investing in an APT ETF and Aptos itself. Despite these hurdles, the fact that Bitwise, a reputable asset manager, is pursuing an Aptos ETF suggests growing confidence in the maturation of the crypto market and increasing regulatory acceptance. The recent approvals of Bitcoin spot ETFs may also set a precedent and potentially ease the path for subsequent crypto ETF applications. The Broader Crypto ETF Landscape: Expanding Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum The potential approval of an Aptos ETF would mark a significant expansion of the crypto ETF landscape beyond the established giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Currently, the majority of approved crypto ETFs focus on these two cryptocurrencies. An APT ETF would represent a move towards greater diversification within the crypto ETF space, offering investors exposure to a wider range of digital assets. This expansion is crucial for the continued growth and evolution of the crypto market. It indicates a broadening interest in and understanding of different blockchain ecosystems and their potential. Furthermore, it could pave the way for ETFs based on other promising layer-1 blockchains and emerging crypto sectors. The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has demonstrated significant investor demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. If the Bitwise ETF application is successful, it could signal the beginning of a new wave of crypto ETF offerings, bringing even more diverse crypto assets into the traditional financial system. Investing in APT ETF: Opportunities and Considerations for Investors For investors considering an APT ETF , it’s essential to weigh both the potential opportunities and the inherent risks. Here’s a breakdown to help you make informed decisions: Opportunities: Exposure to Aptos Ecosystem: Investing in an APT ETF provides direct exposure to the Aptos blockchain, a relatively new layer-1 blockchain known for its scalability and innovative technology. Aptos aims to address some of the limitations of earlier blockchains and has the potential for significant growth. Simplified Investment: As mentioned earlier, ETFs simplify the investment process. You can gain exposure to Aptos without needing to understand crypto wallets, private keys, or crypto exchanges. Potential for Growth: If Aptos continues to develop and gain adoption, the value of the APT ETF could appreciate significantly. The crypto market is known for its volatility and high-growth potential. Portfolio Diversification: Adding an APT ETF to your portfolio can enhance diversification, especially if you are already invested in traditional assets or other cryptocurrencies. Considerations: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Aptos, are inherently volatile. The price of APT can fluctuate significantly, and the APT ETF will reflect these price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the value of Aptos and the ETF. Aptos Specific Risks: Aptos is a relatively new blockchain. It faces competition from other blockchains, and its long-term success is not guaranteed. Technical issues or slower-than-expected adoption could impact its value. ETF Fees and Expenses: ETFs typically have expense ratios, which are fees charged to manage the fund. These fees will reduce your overall returns. Actionable Insight: If you are interested in gaining exposure to Aptos and are comfortable with the risks associated with crypto investments, an APT ETF , once approved, could be a convenient and accessible option. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research on Aptos, understand the risks involved, and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance before investing. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Aptos and Crypto ETFs Bitwise’s filing for an Aptos ETF is undoubtedly a significant development for both the Aptos ecosystem and the broader crypto ETF market. It signals growing institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies and a potential expansion of regulated crypto investment products. While SEC approval is not guaranteed and the process may take time, this move represents a hopeful step towards greater mainstream acceptance and accessibility of Aptos and other innovative blockchain technologies.

41211720,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137361,1741224076,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pivotal Showdown: How Tether & Circle Battle Will Shape the Cryptocurrency Future of Stablecoins,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-circle-stablecoins-crypto-future/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with discussions about stablecoins, and for good reason. These digital assets, designed to maintain a stable value, are seen by many as a crucial bridge between the volatile crypto market and traditional finance. But who will control the future of this burgeoning sector? According to a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report, the answer might hinge on the intense competition between the two giants of the stablecoin realm: Tether and Circle. This isn’t just a corporate rivalry; it’s a battle that could redefine the very fabric of the crypto landscape. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating power struggle and understand what it means for the future of digital finance. The Titans Clash: Tether vs. Circle and the Fate of Stablecoins The WSJ report shines a spotlight on the contrasting approaches of Tether and Circle, emphasizing that their ongoing competition is the key determinant of the cryptocurrency future of stablecoins. These two companies, while both issuing stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, operate under fundamentally different philosophies and strategies. Understanding these differences is crucial to grasping the stakes of this competition. Tether (USDT): Often seen as the elder statesman of stablecoins, Tether has prioritized decentralization and operating outside the traditional financial system. It has historically faced scrutiny over its reserves and transparency but remains the most widely used stablecoin in the market. Circle (USDC): In contrast, Circle has embraced regulatory compliance and aims to integrate stablecoins within the existing financial framework. USDC is known for its greater transparency and is often favored by institutions seeking a compliant digital dollar. This divergence in approach sets the stage for a high-stakes showdown. The WSJ suggests that the victor in this competition will not only dominate the stablecoin market but also dictate the direction in which the entire sector evolves. Will it be a future where stablecoins operate largely outside of traditional regulatory control, or will they become integrated into the established financial system? The answer, it seems, lies in the fortunes of Tether and Circle. Decoding the Different Paths: Tether’s Decentralized Vision vs. Circle’s Regulatory Embrace To truly understand the significance of this battle, we need to dissect the contrasting strategies employed by Tether and Circle. These aren’t just different business models; they represent fundamentally different visions for the role of stablecoins in the global financial ecosystem. Tether: Championing Decentralization and Autonomy Tether’s approach can be characterized by a commitment to the original ethos of cryptocurrency: decentralization and operating outside the purview of traditional financial institutions. Here’s a closer look at their strategy: Decentralized Operations: Tether has historically operated with less regulatory oversight compared to Circle. This has allowed them to cater to a global market, including regions with less stringent financial regulations. Market Dominance: Being the first mover in the stablecoin space, Tether has built a massive network effect. USDT enjoys widespread adoption across exchanges and DeFi platforms, making it the most liquid and widely traded stablecoin. Focus on Crypto-Native Users: Tether’s appeal is strong among users who prioritize decentralization and are wary of centralized financial systems. Its presence is deeply entrenched in the core crypto trading and investment landscape. However, this decentralized approach has come with its own set of challenges, primarily concerning transparency and regulatory scrutiny. Concerns about the backing of USDT and its reserves have been persistent, leading to ongoing debates and legal challenges. Circle: Paving the Way for Regulatory Compliance and Institutional Adoption Circle, on the other hand, has chosen a path of regulatory compliance and integration with the traditional financial system. This strategy is geared towards building trust with regulators and attracting institutional investors. Let’s examine Circle’s key tenets: Regulatory Compliance: Circle has actively sought regulatory approvals and operates under a more transparent framework. USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, enhancing its credibility in the eyes of traditional finance players. Institutional Focus: USDC is positioned as a stablecoin suitable for institutional adoption. Its transparency and regulatory compliance make it attractive to institutions seeking to enter the crypto space while adhering to established financial norms. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Circle aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By being compliant and transparent, USDC can facilitate smoother integration of stablecoins into existing financial infrastructure. Circle’s strategy, while appealing to regulators and institutions, might be perceived as less aligned with the original decentralized ideals of cryptocurrency by some in the crypto community. However, it positions USDC for mainstream adoption and potentially wider acceptance within the global financial system. The Regulatory Tightrope: How Crypto Regulation Could Tip the Scales The WSJ report rightly points out that crypto regulation will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of this stablecoin showdown. Regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on the crypto space, and stablecoins, due to their potential systemic importance, are squarely in their sights. Here’s how regulatory actions could impact Tether and Circle: Regulatory Crackdown on Tether: If regulators successfully clamp down on Tether, demanding greater transparency and stricter compliance, it could significantly impact USDT’s market position. Increased regulatory pressure could erode trust in USDT, potentially leading to a shift towards more compliant alternatives like USDC. Regulatory Tailwinds for Circle: Conversely, stricter regulations could inadvertently benefit Circle. USDC’s proactive approach to compliance positions it favorably in a more regulated environment. Increased regulatory scrutiny on competitors could make USDC a safer and more appealing option for users and institutions alike. Global Regulatory Landscape: The consistency and coordination of global crypto regulation will be crucial. Differing regulations across jurisdictions could create arbitrage opportunities and complexities for stablecoin issuers. A globally harmonized regulatory framework could provide clarity and stability to the stablecoin market. The regulatory landscape is still evolving, making it difficult to predict the exact direction. However, it’s clear that regulatory actions will be a major determinant in shaping the future of stablecoins and the competitive dynamics between Tether and Circle. What’s at Stake? The Broader Implications of the Tether-Circle Battle The competition between Tether and Circle transcends mere market share rivalry. It’s a battle for the soul of stablecoins and, to some extent, the future direction of the cryptocurrency ecosystem itself. The outcome will have significant implications for various stakeholders: For Cryptocurrency Users: The availability and characteristics of stablecoins directly impact crypto users. The dominance of either Tether or Circle could influence transaction costs, accessibility, and the overall user experience within the crypto space. For DeFi Ecosystem: Stablecoins are the lifeblood of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The stability and reliability of these assets are paramount for the continued growth and functionality of DeFi protocols. The regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) surrounding stablecoins can significantly impact DeFi innovation. For Traditional Finance: The integration of stablecoins into traditional finance could revolutionize payments, remittances, and cross-border transactions. However, regulatory acceptance and interoperability with existing financial infrastructure are crucial for this integration to materialize. For the Future of Money: Stablecoins are being viewed by some as a potential form of digital currency that could challenge traditional fiat currencies. The regulatory approach and the success of either decentralized or compliant stablecoin models could influence the future evolution of money itself. The WSJ’s assertion that the outcome of the Tether-Circle competition will shape the future of stablecoins is not an exaggeration. This is a pivotal moment for the crypto industry, and the choices made by regulators, companies, and users will collectively determine the trajectory of this vital sector. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape So, what does all of this mean for you? Whether you’re a crypto investor, a DeFi enthusiast, or simply curious about the future of finance, understanding the dynamics of the stablecoins market is increasingly important. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed about Regulatory Developments: Keep a close watch on regulatory announcements and policy changes related to stablecoins in your jurisdiction and globally. Regulatory shifts can have a significant impact on the value and utility of different stablecoins. Diversify Your Stablecoin Holdings: Consider diversifying your stablecoin holdings across different issuers, including both centralized and potentially decentralized options (while being mindful of risks). This can mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions or issuer-specific issues. Understand the Risk Profiles: Educate yourself about the reserve composition, transparency, and regulatory compliance of different stablecoins. Understand the risk profiles associated with each stablecoin before using or investing in them. Engage with the Crypto Community: Participate in discussions and forums within the crypto community to stay abreast of the latest developments and perspectives on stablecoins and their future. Conclusion: A Stablecoin Showdown with Far-Reaching Consequences The WSJ report paints a clear picture: the future of stablecoins is inextricably linked to the ongoing competition between Tether and Circle. This isn’t just a business rivalry; it’s a battle between two fundamentally different visions for the role of digital currencies in the world. Whether regulators succeed in curbing Tether’s influence, paving the way for Circle’s compliant model, or whether Tether manages to navigate the regulatory storm and maintain its dominance, the outcome will have profound implications. It will shape not only the stablecoin market but also the broader cryptocurrency future , influencing the balance between decentralization and regulation in the digital finance era.

Imagine a tool that not only predicts your revenue but also leverages the power of AI to enhance sales strategies. That’s precisely what revenue prediction startup Gong offers, and their latest milestone is turning heads. Revenue Prediction Startup Gong’s Monumental $300M ARR Milestone Gong, a pioneering revenue prediction startup , has just announced a staggering achievement: surpassing $300 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR). This news, unveiled on Wednesday, signals robust growth and positions Gong as a significant player in the SaaS landscape. Founded in 2016, Gong has carved a niche by using AI to analyze customer interactions, providing invaluable insights for businesses aiming to optimize their sales processes. This remarkable ARR figure isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to Gong’s innovative approach and the increasing demand for sophisticated revenue prediction tools in today’s competitive market. CEO Amit Bendov, in a statement to Bitcoin World, expressed enthusiasm about the company’s momentum, stating, “We’re seeing great momentum. That’s why we’re excited to share the numbers.” This surge in ARR is partially attributed to the integration of generative AI capabilities in recent years, further enhancing Gong’s ability to provide accurate and actionable revenue predictions . AI-Powered Growth Engine Fuels Gong’s Ascent Since its inception, Gong has been at the forefront of leveraging AI to transform how businesses understand and predict their revenue streams. Here’s how AI has become Gong’s secret weapon: Analyzing Customer Interactions: Gong’s core technology revolves around using AI to analyze vast amounts of customer interaction data. This includes everything from sales calls and emails to video conferences, providing a 360-degree view of the sales process. Generative AI Boost: The recent incorporation of generative AI has amplified Gong’s capabilities. This advanced AI allows for even deeper insights and more nuanced revenue predictions , helping companies anticipate market changes and adjust strategies proactively. Predictive Analytics: By identifying patterns and trends within customer interactions, Gong’s AI algorithms offer highly accurate revenue predictions . This enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales funnels, and improve overall revenue generation. The fusion of AI with sales intelligence is not just a trend; it’s a fundamental shift in how businesses approach revenue management. Gong is leading this charge, empowering companies to move from reactive sales strategies to proactive, data-informed approaches. Gong’s Valuation and Market Standing: Is it IPO Ready? Gong’s financial trajectory is as impressive as its technological innovation. Valued at a hefty $7.25 billion during its $250 million Series E funding round in 2021, led by Franklin Templeton, Gong is now being closely watched for its next move. Let’s break down the valuation context: Valuation Metrics: With a $7.25 billion valuation and $300M ARR, Gong’s valuation currently stands at approximately 24 times ARR. This places it alongside major AI companies, indicating strong investor confidence and market perception. Market Comparison: While 24x ARR is significant, it’s essential to compare it with other high-growth AI startups . For instance, Anysphere, known for its AI -powered coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at 25 times ARR, showcasing the premium the market places on cutting-edge AI ventures. Growth Trajectory: Although CEO Bendov remained tight-lipped about specific revenue growth figures, he indicated that Gong’s growth is within the “top-quartile public SaaS companies” range, suggesting an annual growth rate between 25% and 56%. This positions Gong as a high-growth company justifying its valuation and attracting further investment interest. Considering these factors, the question naturally arises: Is Gong gearing up for an IPO ? The $300M ARR milestone certainly fuels such speculation, placing Gong firmly on the IPO radar. IPO Speculation and Future Pathways for Gong The impressive ARR and growth trajectory naturally lead to discussions about a potential IPO for Gong. While CEO Amit Bendov acknowledges that going public is an important milestone, he tempered immediate expectations, stating that an IPO is not planned for 2025. Here’s a look at Gong’s potential future paths: IPO on the Horizon? : While not imminent, an IPO remains a likely long-term goal for Gong. Surpassing $300M ARR is a key indicator of IPO readiness, and as Gong continues to scale, the public markets could offer significant capital and visibility. Financial Strength: Bendov highlighted Gong’s strong financial position, noting that the company is nearly profitable and has barely touched the capital raised in its 2021 Series E round. This financial stability gives Gong flexibility in its strategic decisions, whether to pursue an IPO or consider further private funding rounds. Customer Base: With 4,500 corporate customers, including industry giants like Google, LinkedIn, and Square, Gong has established a robust and diverse client base. This broad adoption underscores the value proposition of Gong’s revenue prediction platform and its potential for continued market penetration. For now, Gong seems focused on sustained growth and further innovation in the AI -driven revenue prediction space. Whether through an IPO or continued private growth, Gong’s future looks exceptionally bright. Conclusion: Gong – A Rising Star in the AI and SaaS Universe Gong’s ascent to $300M ARR is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful validation of the transformative potential of AI in reshaping business operations. As a revenue prediction startup , Gong is not only redefining sales strategies but also setting new benchmarks for growth and innovation in the SaaS industry. The company’s journey from a nascent startup in 2016 to a potential IPO contender is a compelling narrative of vision, execution, and the strategic application of AI .

It’s not just about market caps and price predictions; it’s also about who’s dominating the crypto conversation. Santiment, the renowned on-chain analytics platform, just dropped some fascinating insights. They’ve dived deep into the digital chatter across Reddit, X, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and BitcoinTalk to unveil the definitive list of the top crypto founders everyone’s talking about. Let’s explore who made the cut and why these figures are constantly in the spotlight. Santiment Unveils Top Crypto Figures by Mentions Santiment’s recent analysis isn’t just a popularity contest; it’s a gauge of influence and impact within the crypto space. By meticulously tracking mentions across diverse social platforms, Santiment provides a unique perspective on which cryptocurrency leaders are shaping narratives and capturing public attention. This data is invaluable for understanding market sentiment and identifying key figures driving the industry’s evolution. Here’s the countdown of the top 10 most mentioned crypto founders , according to Santiment’s comprehensive analysis: Satoshi Nakamoto: The Enigmatic Pioneer Topping the list is the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Even after years of mystery surrounding their true identity, Satoshi remains the most talked-about figure. Why? Because Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency they birthed, is the foundation upon which the entire industry is built. The anonymity itself adds to the intrigue, constantly fueling speculation and discussion. Satoshi’s creation sparked a revolution, and their legacy continues to dominate conversations. Do Kwon: The Fallen Titan From groundbreaking innovator to facing legal battles, Do Kwon’s journey is a cautionary tale. As the co-founder of Terra (LUNA) and UST, Kwon was once celebrated. However, the dramatic collapse of his algorithmic stablecoin project in 2022 sent shockwaves through the market, causing billions in losses. Currently on trial in the U.S., Kwon’s story is a stark reminder of the risks inherent in crypto and the intense scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency leaders . His high mention count is unfortunately tied to the Terra debacle, making him a figure of intense discussion and debate. Vitalik Buterin: The Visionary Architect of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of EthereumIn stark contrast to Kwon’s recent notoriety, Vitalik Buterin earns his place for positive contributions and ongoing influence. As the co-founder of Ethereum, Buterin is revered for introducing smart contracts, the technology that powers decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi. His visionary approach and continuous involvement in Ethereum’s development keep him at the forefront of crypto discussions. Buterin is not just a founder; he’s a thought leader constantly pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Justin Sun: The Marketing Maestro of Tron Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, is known for his aggressive marketing strategies and headline-grabbing moves. His infamous multi-million dollar lunch with Warren Buffett showcased his flair for publicity. Whether you love him or critique his tactics, Sun’s ability to generate buzz and keep Tron in the conversation is undeniable. His high mentions reflect his active presence and often controversial but effective marketing approach. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): The Disgraced Exchange King Similar to Do Kwon, Sam Bankman-Fried’s mentions are linked to a significant market event – the collapse of FTX. Once hailed as a crypto prodigy, SBF’s empire crumbled amidst allegations of fraud. The FTX saga is a major talking point in crypto, raising crucial questions about regulation, transparency, and trust. SBF’s downfall is a stark example of the high stakes and intense scrutiny within the crypto mentions landscape. Roger Ver: Bitcoin Jesus and Bitcoin Cash Advocate Roger Ver, nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus,” is a polarizing figure. As an early Bitcoin investor, he was instrumental in its early adoption. However, he later became a staunch supporter of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), leading to significant debates within the Bitcoin community. Ver’s outspoken opinions and long history in crypto ensure he remains a frequently mentioned personality, particularly in discussions about Bitcoin’s scaling and philosophy. Ryoshi: The Vanished Visionary of Shiba Inu The founder of Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ryoshi, mirrors Satoshi’s anonymity but with a different twist. Ryoshi launched the meme coin sensation and then mysteriously disappeared, adding to the mythos of Shiba Inu. This enigmatic departure has only fueled speculation and discussion within the SHIB community and the broader crypto world. Ryoshi’s absence is as much a part of the Shiba Inu story as the coin itself, contributing to their persistent mentions. Charles Hoskinson: The Cardano Architect and Ethereum Co-founder Charles Hoskinson brings a blend of technical expertise and academic rigor to the crypto space. As a co-founder of Ethereum and the creator of Cardano (ADA), Hoskinson is respected for his methodical approach to blockchain development and his focus on peer-reviewed research. His active engagement in the Cardano community and his thought-provoking commentary on the industry keep him relevant in ongoing crypto conversations. Charlie Lee: The Pragmatic Creator of Litecoin Charlie Lee, the developer of Litecoin (LTC), positioned his cryptocurrency as a practical alternative to Bitcoin – “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” Litecoin’s focus on faster transaction times and lower fees has ensured its longevity and continued relevance. Lee’s pragmatic approach and consistent presence in the crypto space contribute to his regular mentions, especially in discussions about Bitcoin alternatives and payment solutions. Changpeng Zhao (CZ): The Binance Titan Turned Educator Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, is synonymous with Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange he founded and led to dominance. After stepping down as CEO due to regulatory issues in the U.S., CZ has transitioned to focusing on Web3 education. His journey from building a crypto empire to navigating regulatory challenges and now promoting education makes him a compelling figure. CZ’s past leadership at Binance and his current focus on education ensure he remains a prominent voice in the crypto mentions landscape. Why Do Crypto Mentions Matter? Understanding which cryptocurrency leaders are being discussed and why offers several key benefits: Sentiment Analysis: High mention counts, especially when analyzed with sentiment data, can indicate market trends and shifts in public perception towards specific projects or figures. Influence Tracking: It helps identify who the key influencers are in the crypto space, allowing for a better understanding of information dissemination and narrative shaping. Risk Assessment: Spikes in mentions, particularly negative ones, can signal potential risks or controversies associated with certain individuals or projects, as seen with Do Kwon and SBF. Community Engagement: Tracking mentions can provide insights into community focus and interests, helping projects and platforms understand what topics are resonating with their audience. Challenges in Analyzing Crypto Mentions While valuable, analyzing crypto mentions also presents challenges: Data Overload: The sheer volume of online conversations can be overwhelming, requiring sophisticated tools like Santiment’s to filter and analyze effectively. Noise and Misinformation: Social media is rife with noise, bots, and misinformation, which can skew the data and make it challenging to extract genuine insights. Context is Key: Mentions alone don’t tell the whole story. Understanding the context behind the mentions – whether positive, negative, or neutral – is crucial for accurate interpretation. Platform Fragmentation: Crypto conversations are spread across numerous platforms, requiring comprehensive data aggregation to get a holistic view. Actionable Insights from Santiment’s Analysis Santiment’s analysis of top crypto figures provides actionable insights for various stakeholders: For Investors: Stay informed about which figures are influencing market sentiment and project narratives. Monitor mentions alongside other on-chain metrics for a more comprehensive investment strategy. For Project Teams: Understand who the influential voices are in your space and track how your project and leaders are being discussed. Use this data to refine your communication and engagement strategies. For Media and Analysts: Identify key figures and trending topics to focus your reporting and analysis. Use mention data to support your narratives and provide data-backed insights. Conclusion: The Enduring Influence of Crypto Founders Santiment’s analysis underscores the enduring influence of crypto founders in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. From the enigmatic Satoshi to the visionary Vitalik and the controversial figures like Do Kwon and SBF, these individuals and their stories continue to drive conversations and influence market perceptions.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-is-designed-to-underpin-us-dollar-usd-heres-why/,"A recent tweet from Digital Perspective has sparked discussion regarding the potential role of XRP in maintaining the U.S. dollar’s dominance as the world’s reserve currency. The tweet suggests that “XRP was designed to underpin the USD dollar to ensure its dominance as the World Reserve Currency for the next 150 years.” XRP was designed to underpin the USDollar to ensure its dominance as the World Reserve Currency for the next 150 years. Ripple is playing chess while everyone else out here is playing checkers on a Maxi board. This isn`t about chasing green candles.This is about protecting the… pic.twitter.com/dR6soENyPf — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) March 4, 2025 This assertion presents an intriguing perspective on the evolving financial landscape and the role digital assets could play in global monetary policy. The Role of XRP in the Global Economy The claim that XRP was designed to support the U.S. dollar’s global standing is significant. While there is no official confirmation that XRP was specifically created for this purpose, its technological capabilities and liquidity advantages make it a candidate for high-level financial applications. XRP’s ability to facilitate near-instant, low-cost cross-border transactions has already positioned it as a useful tool for financial institutions. The tweet further suggests that “Ripple is playing chess while everyone else out here is playing checkers on a Maxi board.” This statement implies that Ripple’s long-term strategy involves global financial infrastructure, rather than focusing solely on short-term market movements. While some cryptocurrency communities concentrate on price speculation, Digital Perspective argues that the real significance of XRP lies in its potential role in economic stability and monetary policy. The Argument for a Basket of Assets In the video attached to the tweet, Digital Perspective discusses the concept of a diversified reserve backing for the U.S. dollar. The speaker states, “This is why I love the idea of a basket of assets, right? And I do mean like gold, oil, and digital assets alike.” This idea aligns with historical discussions about strengthening the dollar by tying it to tangible and digital reserves rather than relying solely on government policies or agreements such as the petrodollar system. The speaker recalls a 2019 conversation with Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the potential benefits of backing the dollar with multiple assets. He suggests that “if you could underpin the dollar with all of those things, instead of just an agreement to print more or just a petrodollar agreement, then you really would have the confidence of a dollar for the next 150 years.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 National Security and Economic Strategy A response to the tweet by X user JohnMWagner brings a geopolitical dimension to the discussion. He argues that “if folks would just re-premise the existence of utility-driven crypto, and not be blinded by gaslighting and tribalism, they would have a clearer perspective on all things being national security first.” Their statement suggests that digital assets, including XRP , should be viewed through national economic security rather than mere financial speculation. The comment also suggests that policymakers are methodically shaping a new financial framework incorporating digital assets into the existing system. The idea that the U.S. is undergoing a systematic restructuring aligns with ongoing regulatory discussions about digital currencies and their role in the global economy. Digital Perspective’s tweet and the subsequent discussion raise important questions about the future of the U.S. dollar and the role of digital assets like XRP. While there is no official confirmation that XRP was designed to support the dollar’s global dominance, its capabilities make it a viable component of a broader financial strategy.

If you’ve been watching the markets, you’ve seen Dogecoin (DOGE) fall below the $0.20 mark despite growing ETF optimism and Shiba Inu (SHIB) barely holding onto support. Meanwhile, the BTFD Coin (BTFD) presale is nearing its final stage with a mind-blowing 3650% ROI potential, making it the hottest meme coin opportunity of 2025 and the standout among the best cryptos to join for long term wins. With over $6.26 million raised and 71 billion coins sold, investors are scrambling to get in before the price jumps at launch. Meme coins have always been volatile, but smart investors know that presales are the safest bet to bypass market crashes and bear trends. That’s why BTFD Coin has captivated the crypto community. With a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a growing army of 11,200 holders, BTFD is not just another meme coin—it’s a wealth-generating machine in the making. But how does it compare to DOGE and SHIB? Can DOGE’s potential ETF approval or SHIB’s last support level change the game? Keep reading to find out why BTFD is the best crypto to join for long term and why it’s set to lead the next meme coin revolution. BTFD Coin: The 3650% ROI Presale That’s Changing the Meme Coin Game How often do you get a shot at 3650% gains? BTFD Coin’s presale started at just $0.000004 and is now at $0.00016 in Stage 14, with a final launch price of $0.0006. Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, meaning those who buy now are looking at life-changing returns. But this window is closing fast. With Stage 14 already 98.85% complete, this might be your last chance to secure a seat before the rocket takes off. Presale Success and Expert Forecasts Numbers don’t lie— BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of spectacular. Starting at just $0.000004 in Stage 1, the current price in Stage 14 has climbed to $0.00016, with a final listing price of $0.0006. With a projected moon price of $0.006, investors are eyeing a massive 3650% ROI, making it one of the best cryptos to join for long term. Over 71 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $6.26 million, while the BTFD Bulls community now boasts over 11,200 holders. The presale is nearing its final stretch, and this window won’t stay open for long! Let’s break this down with a real-world example. If you invest $500 right now at $0.00016, you’ll get 3.125 million BTFD tokens. At launch, that’s already worth $1,875. But if analysts’ moon price of $0.006 is hit? That same $500 turns into $18,750! And let’s not forget staking. BTFD’s 90% APY staking rewards mean you’re earning passive income just for holding, making it one of the most rewarding meme coins of the year. Why BTFD’s Utility and Community Power Make It Unstoppable Meme coins live and die by their community, and BTFD’s Bulls Squad is built differently. This isn’t just hype—it’s a movement. The team has gone all in with a fully launched P2E game, giving players a chance to earn BTFD rewards while having fun. Combined with staking, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an ecosystem designed for growth. How to Buy BTFD Coin Before It’s Too Late Visit the official BTFD presale site . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Select your currency and enter the amount you want to invest. Confirm your purchase and secure your BTFD tokens before the presale ends. Dogecoin (DOGE): ETF Optimism vs. Market Reality DOGE has fallen by 13% and is struggling below $0.20, despite growing optimism around a Dogecoin ETF. NYSE Arca has filed a 19b-4 with the SEC, aiming to launch Bitwise’s DOGE ETF, with Coinbase Custody managing holdings and Bank of New York Mellon handling cash assets. Market sentiment is heating up. Polymarket now places DOGE ETF approval odds at 67%, up from 55%. Bloomberg analysts are even more bullish, projecting a 75% chance of ETF approval by 2025. Yet, DOGE’s price has fallen by 16%, proving that ETF speculation alone isn’t enough to hold it up. For DOGE to recover, it needs to break back above $0.244 and hold $0.284—a challenge given the current market sentiment. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Critical Support Holding By a Thread SHIB is in dangerous territory, trading at $0.00001271 and teetering on losing another zero. It has breached the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, signaling heavy selling pressure. If it falls below $0.00001200, expect even more downside. One glimmer of hope? Selling volume is declining, hinting at potential “bear fatigue.” A breakout above $0.00001400 could shift momentum, but for now, SHIB remains in a precarious position. Final Verdict: BTFD Coin is the Best Crypto to Join for Long Term! Based on market trends, expert predictions, and real-world numbers, BTFD Coin is the clear winner among the best cryptos to join for long term gains. Unlike DOGE, which relies on ETF speculation, or SHIB, which is barely holding onto support, BTFD’s presale has already proven its strength. With 275% ROI at launch and 3650% moon potential, there’s simply no comparison. Time is running out. The final presale stages are almost sold out. If you want to maximize your gains and avoid market volatility, now is your shot. Don’t wait. Buy BTFD before the presale ends and join the Bulls Squad today! Get your BTFD tokens now .

Imagine a world where election outcomes are not just tallied but also immutably etched into a decentralized, transparent ledger. This isn’t a scene from a futuristic movie; it’s the reality unfolding in Tennessee, showcasing a novel approach to election security . Let’s delve into how this innovative step could redefine trust and transparency in electoral processes. Why Bitcoin for Election Security? Exploring the Blockchain Advantage When we talk about Bitcoin , we often think of digital currency and financial transactions. However, the underlying technology, blockchain, offers far more than just a platform for cryptocurrency. The Williamson County GOP’s decision to utilize the Bitcoin network highlights a fascinating and perhaps underappreciated aspect of blockchain technology: its robust security and immutability. But why Bitcoin specifically? Let’s break it down: Immutability: Once data is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This is a cornerstone of blockchain technology. Each block of data is cryptographically linked to the previous one, creating a tamper-proof chain of information. This immutability is crucial for ensuring the integrity of election results . Decentralization: The Bitcoin network is decentralized, meaning it’s not controlled by any single entity. This distributed nature makes it incredibly resistant to censorship and single points of failure. Unlike centralized databases that can be vulnerable to hacking or manipulation, the Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by a global network of nodes, enhancing its resilience. Transparency: Every transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is publicly viewable. While the content of the Williamson County GOP’s election results might not be publicly accessible in detail (depending on how they stored it), the fact that data was recorded at a specific block number (886,370) on the Bitcoin blockchain is verifiable by anyone. This inherent transparency adds a layer of accountability and trust. Security: The Bitcoin network is secured by cryptography and a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Work. This makes it extremely difficult and computationally expensive to attack or manipulate the blockchain. The security of the cryptocurrency network, designed to protect billions of dollars in value, is now being leveraged to protect something equally valuable – democratic processes. Cointelegraph reported that the Williamson County Republican leadership and board selected the immutable Bitcoin network to store the election results from their Republican National Convention election on March 4. These results were recorded on block number 886,370 on the Bitcoin blockchain. This act is a powerful example of how blockchain’s inherent features can be applied beyond finance, extending into areas like governance and civic integrity. How Does Blockchain Technology Fortify Election Integrity? To understand the significance of this move, let’s consider how blockchain technology, in general, and Bitcoin’s blockchain, in particular, can strengthen election integrity : Feature Traditional Election Systems Blockchain-Based Election Data Storage Data Immutability Vulnerable to tampering; digital records can be altered. Data is permanently recorded and cannot be changed once confirmed on the blockchain. Transparency Often opaque processes; audits can be complex and time-consuming. Transactions are publicly auditable; anyone can verify the record on the blockchain. Security Centralized systems are potential targets for cyberattacks and manipulation. Decentralized network; highly resistant to attacks due to cryptographic security and distributed nature. Auditability Audits can be subjective and require trust in central authorities. Cryptographically verifiable audit trail; enhances trust and reduces reliance on central authorities. By storing election results on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Williamson County GOP is essentially creating a permanent, verifiable, and transparent record of their election outcome. This doesn’t mean the entire voting process was on the blockchain, but rather the final results were anchored to this secure ledger. This distinction is important. It’s about using blockchain as a secure notary or timestamping service for critical data. Benefits of Bitcoin Blockchain for Securing Election Data What are the specific advantages of this approach? Let’s highlight some key benefits: Enhanced Trust: In an era where trust in institutions is often questioned, leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain can enhance public confidence in the integrity of election results. The verifiable nature of blockchain can reassure stakeholders that the data is authentic and untampered with. Reduced Risk of Manipulation: The immutability and security of the blockchain significantly reduce the risk of data manipulation or fraud. Altering data on the Bitcoin blockchain is practically infeasible, offering a robust defense against malicious actors. Improved Auditability: Auditing becomes simpler and more transparent. Instead of relying solely on manual recounts or centralized logs, auditors can verify the timestamp and existence of the election results directly on the public blockchain. Innovation and Leadership: The Williamson County GOP chapter is demonstrating leadership and innovation by exploring cutting-edge technology to improve their processes. This move could inspire other organizations, both political and non-political, to consider blockchain solutions for data security and integrity. Challenges and Considerations While the use of Bitcoin for securing election results is an exciting development, it’s important to consider potential challenges and limitations: Complexity and Understanding: Blockchain technology can be complex and not widely understood by the general public. Effective communication and education are crucial to ensure that this approach is accepted and trusted. Scalability for Large-Scale Elections: While suitable for storing election results, using the Bitcoin blockchain directly for every single vote in a large-scale national election would currently be impractical due to scalability limitations of the Bitcoin network itself. However, solutions like layer-2 networks or other blockchains designed for higher throughput might address this in the future. For now, using Bitcoin to secure the final results is a practical and valuable application. Public Perception and Misconceptions: Cryptocurrency and blockchain are still relatively new technologies, and misconceptions exist. Overcoming negative perceptions and educating the public about the benefits of blockchain for data security is essential. Cost and Technical Expertise: Implementing blockchain solutions might require initial investment in technical expertise and infrastructure. However, the long-term benefits in terms of security and trust could outweigh these costs. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin and the Future of Secure Data Management The Williamson County GOP’s initiative is a significant step towards exploring the potential of blockchain technology beyond finance. It opens up a conversation about how decentralized, immutable ledgers can be used to secure critical data in various sectors, including governance, healthcare, supply chain management, and more. This example could serve as a catalyst for further innovation and adoption of blockchain solutions for enhancing data security and transparency across diverse applications. While this particular instance involves a GOP chapter and election security , the underlying principle of using blockchain for data integrity is universally applicable. As blockchain technology matures and becomes more accessible, we can expect to see more creative and impactful uses emerge, further solidifying its role in the digital age. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Transparent Governance The decision by the Williamson County Republican Party to use the Bitcoin network to secure their election results is more than just a technological novelty; it’s a bold statement about the importance of transparency and security in democratic processes. By leveraging the immutable and decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, they’ve set a precedent for how technology can be used to build trust and ensure the integrity of critical data. This innovative approach underscores the versatility of Bitcoin and blockchain, extending its utility far beyond the realm of digital currencies. It’s a powerful reminder that the foundational principles of blockchain – security, transparency, and immutability – can be harnessed to address real-world challenges and pave the way for a more secure and trustworthy future.

41212407,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137369,1741225301,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Eric Schmidt Rejects Risky ‘Manhattan Project’ for Superintelligence AGI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/schmidt-rejects-agi-manhattan-project/,"In a stunning policy reversal that has sent ripples through the tech and crypto communities, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has publicly argued against pursuing a ‘Manhattan Project’-style approach to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This comes as a critical juncture for the future of AI development, especially considering the technology’s growing influence on cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations. Schmidt, alongside Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and Center for AI Safety Director Dan Hendrycks, released a compelling paper urging caution and a shift in strategy. Are we on the brink of an AI arms race, and what does this mean for the rapidly evolving world of digital assets? The Perils of a Superintelligence ‘Manhattan Project’ The core of Schmidt and his co-authors’ argument lies in the potential dangers of aggressively pursuing superintelligence with a ‘Manhattan Project’ mentality. Drawing parallels to the historical project that developed the atomic bomb, they caution against a concentrated, all-out effort to achieve AGI dominance. Why? Because this approach, they argue, is fraught with risks, especially in the current geopolitical landscape. Here’s a breakdown of their key concerns: Escalating International Tensions: A U.S.-led ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ could be perceived as a hostile act by other nations, particularly China, potentially triggering a dangerous AI arms race. Cyberattack Risks: Fearing a global power imbalance in superintelligence , rival nations might resort to extreme measures, including sophisticated cyberattacks, to disrupt or preemptively disable U.S. AI advancements. This could destabilize international relations and create a volatile environment. Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): Borrowing from the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) in the nuclear age, the authors introduce MAIM. This concept suggests that aggressive pursuit of superintelligence could lead to a scenario where nations proactively disable each other’s AI projects, creating a climate of distrust and potential conflict. Schmidt and his colleagues highlight that the assumption behind a ‘Manhattan Project’ – that rivals will simply accept an AI power imbalance – is fundamentally flawed and dangerously naive. They argue that history and current geopolitical realities suggest otherwise. Challenging the Status Quo: Is AI Safety Taking a Backseat? This paper directly challenges the growing sentiment, especially within U.S. policy circles, that a government-backed, intensely focused program like the ‘Manhattan Project’ is the optimal path to secure AI leadership and outcompete China. Recent statements from officials, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who explicitly referenced a ‘new Manhattan Project’ for AI, underscore this prevailing viewpoint. However, Schmidt, Wang, and Hendrycks present a compelling counter-narrative, emphasizing AI safety and global stability over a winner-take-all race. The debate essentially boils down to two contrasting approaches: Approach Proponents Key Beliefs Risks ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ Some U.S. policymakers and industry leaders Aggressive, government-led push is necessary to win the superintelligence race against China. Increased international tensions, cyberattacks, potential for AI arms race, neglecting AI safety concerns. Measured, Defensive Strategy Eric Schmidt, Alexandr Wang, Dan Hendrycks Prioritize AI safety , focus on defensive measures, deterring hostile AI development, and international cooperation. Potential for falling behind in the AI race if other nations pursue aggressive development, requires international consensus and cooperation. Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): A New Paradigm for AI Policy? The concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM) is a crucial contribution of this paper. It suggests a paradigm shift in how we think about AI safety and international AI policy. Instead of solely focusing on outpacing rivals in AI development, MAIM proposes a strategy of deterrence and proactive defense. This involves: Developing Cyberattack Capabilities: Ironically, to prevent hostile superintelligence development, the U.S. should enhance its cyberattack arsenal to be capable of disabling threatening AI projects in other nations. This is presented as a defensive measure, not an offensive one. Limiting Access to Key Resources: Restricting adversaries’ access to advanced AI chips and open-source models is another crucial element in deterring rapid and unchecked superintelligence development. This strategy is not about halting AI progress; it’s about steering it towards a safer and more stable trajectory. It acknowledges the reality of international competition but emphasizes the paramount importance of preventing catastrophic outcomes. Beyond Doomers and Ostriches: A Third Way for AGI Development Schmidt et al. cleverly categorize the existing spectrum of opinions on AI policy into two extremes: the “doomers” and the “ostriches.” Doomers: Believe AI catastrophe is inevitable and advocate for slowing down or even halting AI progress altogether. Ostriches: Advocate for rapid, unbridled AI development, essentially hoping for the best without robust safety measures or international agreements. The paper positions its proposed strategy as a “third way” – a measured and responsible approach that acknowledges both the immense potential and the significant risks of AGI . This “third way” prioritizes defensive strategies and international cooperation, moving beyond the simplistic dichotomy of acceleration versus deceleration. Schmidt’s Evolving Stance on China AI and Superintelligence What makes this paper particularly noteworthy is Schmidt’s involvement. Previously, he has been a vocal advocate for aggressive competition with China in AI. His earlier op-ed highlighting DeepSeek as a turning point in the U.S.-China AI race underscores his previous stance. This new paper signals a significant evolution in his thinking, suggesting a growing concern about the risks of unchecked superintelligence development and a potential shift towards prioritizing AI safety over outright dominance. This shift in perspective from a prominent figure like Schmidt carries considerable weight and could influence policy discussions in Washington and beyond. It highlights the increasing urgency of addressing the potential risks of AGI, even as the race to develop it intensifies. Implications for the Crypto and Tech World While not directly about cryptocurrency, this debate around AGI and AI safety is profoundly relevant to the crypto and broader tech world. AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain technology, impacting everything from cybersecurity and decentralized finance (DeFi) to the metaverse and NFT development. A global AI arms race or a catastrophic AI malfunction would have far-reaching consequences for all sectors, including the digital asset space. Therefore, understanding the nuances of AI policy, the risks of superintelligence , and the importance of AI safety is becoming increasingly crucial for anyone involved in the future of technology and finance. Schmidt’s paper serves as a vital contribution to this critical conversation, urging a more cautious and globally responsible approach to AGI development. In conclusion, the call to avoid a ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ from influential figures like Eric Schmidt is a powerful wake-up call. It underscores the need for a nuanced, globally-minded strategy that prioritizes AI safety and international stability over a potentially perilous race for superintelligence dominance. The future of AI, and indeed the future of technology as a whole, may depend on embracing this more cautious and collaborative path.

Suntory and Sony are two Japanese giants already making moves to stave off potential fallout. While it’s unclear exactly what the US figurehead meant by accusing the Japanese and Chinese governments of “[killing] their dollar, their equivalent of the dollar, whatever,” one thing appears clear: Canada and Mexico will not be the only economies to face Trump trade war fallout. Fiat currencies worldwide are struggling, and of course, the group with the strongest military typically has the “strongest” currency. From a debt-based perspective , neither the yuan, the yen, or the USD are in a position of solvency or strength. Nonetheless, preparations are being made by Japan-based companies to fend off failure in the case of a potentially damaging new tariff. Japanese giants Suntory and Sony make provisions Reuters reports Wednesday (JST) that Japanese electronics behemoth Sony and multinational drinks company Suntory have begun building up supplies in the United States, with Sony increasing electronics and gaming division inventory. Suntory, for its part, has reportedly shipped tequila from it’s Mexico-based operations north of the border. Trump’s comments from the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Monday have only exacerbated fears, with Japan’s government denying the Asian state is “devaluing” the Japanese yen. The US president also mentioned Honda moving production of its next Civic from Mexico to Indiana in the speech, saying: “Well, Honda is coming, and I told you about Apple, that they’re going to be starting to build massively here — $500 billion.” Criticism of Japan may seem confusing at this juncture, as the nation’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has recently stated that the country will increase investment in the United States to an unprecedented $1 trillion dollars. This proclamation was made in the presence of Trump at a joint press conference following a Japan-US summit meeting in D.C in February. Ishiba also noted plans for Japanese automakers Toyota and Isuzu to build plants in America. Trump supporters shift positions Economic freedom and populist protectionism are butting heads in light of Trump’s trade rhetoric, as his mixed support base, some of whom even claim he is “libertarian,” struggle to hold their hodgepodge of mixed values in one place. On the one hand, classically liberal (libertarian) economists overwhelmingly favor free trade, as it tends to benefit everyone in an economy, due to the free flow of goods. However, nationalist interests in supporters who typically view themselves as anti-communist or fascist, have them vocally supporting the 25% trade impositions on Canada and Mexico, which interestingly may be met with even more, retaliatory tariffs, forcing companies like Honda to once again move back to Mexico or the countries they initially fled. Perhaps the most obvious explanation for the contradictory positions and confusing opposition to Japanese interests by Trump, is one that is age old: he’s just playing politics. Unfortunately, the fallout from such games is measured in real people’s lost livelihoods and even lives, when trade wars erupt into armed conflict. And even if Japan is not directly targeted with tariffs, it’s important to note that in a global economy, Mexico and Canada being slammed will still make things much harder for businesses with ties to those zones. Whatever may unfold, Japanese businesses are on guard, with Reuters quoting senior Oxford Economics economist Norihiro Yamaguchi as emphasizing: “Corporates are now more aware that Japan could also be a target.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

41212409,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137371,1741225352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Relief for Miners: US Government Unleashes Seized Bitcoin Mining Hardware,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-government-seized-bitcoin-miners/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency mining community, the U.S. government has started to release a portion of the Bitcoin miners it had previously seized. This news, first reported by Reuters, brings a sense of relief to many in the industry who have been closely following the saga of these detained machines. But what exactly happened, why were these Bitcoin miners seized in the first place, and what does this release mean for the future of crypto mining? Let’s dive into the details. Why Were Bitcoin Miners Seized by the US Government? Late last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), acting on the request of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), initiated a series of seizures targeting Chinese Bitcoin miners at various ports of entry across the United States. The crackdown reportedly led to the seizure of up to 10,000 units of crypto mining hardware . But what prompted such drastic action? Here’s a breakdown of the likely reasons behind the seizures: FCC Regulations: The FCC is responsible for regulating interstate and international communications. It’s plausible that the seized Bitcoin miners were flagged for potential violations of FCC regulations. This could range from issues with equipment certification to concerns about electromagnetic interference. National Security Concerns: While less explicitly stated, national security concerns often play a role in government actions, especially concerning technology imports. There might have been worries about the origin or functionality of these specific units, prompting a closer inspection. Trade Policy and Tariffs: The timing of the seizures coincided with ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. While not directly confirmed, trade policy considerations could have indirectly influenced the scrutiny applied to these imports. Compliance Checks: Routine customs checks can sometimes uncover discrepancies or issues with imported goods. It’s possible that these seizures were part of a broader effort to ensure compliance with import regulations. Release of Seized Bitcoin Miners: A Turning Point? The recent news of the U.S. government releasing some of these seized Bitcoin miners marks a significant development. While details remain somewhat sparse regarding the exact number of units being released or the specific reasons for this change of course, it signals a potential shift in approach. What could be behind this release? Resolution of Regulatory Issues: It’s possible that the companies importing these miners have successfully addressed the FCC’s concerns. This could involve providing necessary certifications, demonstrating compliance, or reaching agreements on specific issues. Re-evaluation of Seizure Justification: Perhaps upon further review, the government agencies involved reassessed the initial grounds for seizure and concluded that releasing some or all of the units was appropriate. Economic Considerations: Prolonged detention of goods can have economic implications for businesses and supply chains. Releasing the miners could be a pragmatic decision to mitigate potential economic disruptions. Diplomatic Factors: International relations and diplomatic considerations might also play a role in such decisions, although this is more speculative without further information. Impact on Crypto Mining Hardware and the Market The release of US government Bitcoin miners, even if it’s a partial release, could have several implications for the cryptocurrency market and the crypto mining hardware industry: Increased Hashrate Potential: These released miners, once operational, will contribute to the overall Bitcoin network hashrate. This could lead to increased network security and potentially faster transaction processing times, although the impact of a few thousand miners on the massive Bitcoin network might be incremental. Boost for Mining Companies: For the companies that own these miners, their release represents a significant win. It allows them to deploy previously stranded assets and resume or expand their mining operations. This can directly impact their profitability and operational capacity. Market Sentiment: The news could be interpreted as a positive signal for the crypto industry. It might suggest a more nuanced or even softening stance from the U.S. government towards crypto mining, although this interpretation needs to be approached cautiously. Supply Chain Dynamics: The episode highlights the complexities of international trade and regulatory compliance for the Bitcoin regulations and crypto mining sector. It underscores the importance of navigating these regulations effectively to avoid disruptions. Navigating Bitcoin Regulations: Actionable Insights This situation provides valuable lessons for businesses operating in the cryptocurrency mining space, particularly concerning international trade and regulatory compliance. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Regulatory Compliance: Thoroughly understand and adhere to all relevant regulations, especially those pertaining to import/export, communications equipment, and technology standards in your target markets. Due Diligence in Supply Chains: Conduct rigorous due diligence on your supply chains, especially when sourcing equipment from overseas. Ensure that suppliers and manufacturers comply with all applicable regulations. Maintain Open Communication with Authorities: Establish and maintain open lines of communication with relevant regulatory bodies. Proactive engagement can help address potential issues before they escalate into seizures or other disruptions. Seek Expert Legal Counsel: Engage legal experts specializing in international trade, customs law, and cryptocurrency regulations. Professional guidance is crucial for navigating the complex legal landscape. Diversify Operational Locations: Consider diversifying your mining operations geographically to mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions in specific jurisdictions. In conclusion, the release of some seized Bitcoin miners by the U.S. government is a noteworthy development in the ongoing interaction between cryptocurrency and regulatory bodies. While the full implications are still unfolding, it serves as a reminder of the dynamic and evolving nature of the crypto landscape. Staying informed, proactive, and compliant is paramount for navigating this exciting yet complex industry.

41212530,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137377,1741225495,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding Crucial SEC Crypto Task Force Discussions on Crypto Regulation with WisdomTree,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-task-force-wisdomtree/,"In a significant move signaling proactive engagement in the evolving digital asset landscape, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Crypto Task Force convened a meeting with representatives from WisdomTree Digital Management and its affiliates on March 5. This crucial discussion, as detailed in the SEC’s official meeting log, centered on navigating the complex terrain of crypto regulation . For those invested in the future of cryptocurrency and digital assets, understanding these regulatory developments is paramount. Let’s delve into what this meeting signifies and what aspects of crypto regulation were brought to the table. Why is the SEC Crypto Task Force Meeting with WisdomTree Important for Crypto Regulation? The fact that the SEC Crypto Task Force is actively engaging with key players like WisdomTree underscores the agency’s commitment to establishing a clear regulatory framework for the burgeoning crypto industry. WisdomTree, a prominent asset manager, has been increasingly involved in the digital asset space, particularly with its interest in exchange-traded products (ETPs) for cryptocurrencies. This meeting is not just a procedural formality; it’s a vital dialogue to shape the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. Here’s why this interaction matters: Proactive Regulatory Approach: The SEC’s Crypto Task Force proactively seeking discussions demonstrates a move towards informed regulation rather than reactive enforcement. This is a positive sign for the industry, suggesting a collaborative approach to understanding and addressing the nuances of crypto assets. Industry Input: WisdomTree’s participation allows the SEC to gain direct insights from industry experts actively working within the crypto space. This real-world perspective is invaluable for crafting effective and practical regulations. Focus on Key Issues: The meeting agenda itself highlights the SEC’s priorities in crypto regulation , including operational aspects of tokenized funds, in-kind transactions for digital asset ETPs, and the application of broker-dealer net capital rules to crypto assets. These are critical areas that need clarity for the crypto market to mature and attract broader institutional adoption. Unpacking the Agenda: What Aspects of Crypto Regulation Were Discussed? The meeting agenda provides a window into the specific regulatory challenges and considerations currently at the forefront of the SEC’s attention regarding crypto regulation . Let’s break down each key point: 1. Operational Aspects of Tokenized Funds Tokenized funds represent a novel approach to investment vehicles, leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalize ownership and enhance accessibility. However, their operational mechanics raise several regulatory questions: Custody and Security: How are tokenized funds securely custodied? What measures are in place to protect investors from theft or loss of digital assets? Valuation and Transparency: How are these funds valued, and how is transparency maintained for investors, especially given the volatility of underlying crypto assets? Compliance with Existing Fund Regulations: Do existing investment fund regulations adequately cover tokenized funds, or are new rules needed? Discussions on these operational aspects are crucial for ensuring investor protection and market integrity within the evolving landscape of tokenized investments. 2. In-Kind Transactions for Digital Asset ETPs In-kind transactions, where investors can create or redeem ETP shares using the underlying assets (in this case, digital assets) rather than cash, are a significant feature of many commodity and now potentially crypto ETPs. However, for digital asset ETFs , this raises unique questions: Market Manipulation Concerns: Could in-kind transactions in the volatile crypto market be more susceptible to manipulation? Valuation and Liquidity of Underlying Assets: How are the digital assets used in in-kind transactions valued, and is there sufficient liquidity in the underlying crypto markets to support these transactions without market disruption? Tax Implications: What are the tax implications of in-kind transactions involving cryptocurrencies for both ETP providers and investors? Addressing these complexities is essential for the SEC to confidently approve and oversee digital asset ETFs that utilize in-kind transaction mechanisms. 3. Application of Broker-Dealer Net Capital Rules to Crypto Assets Broker-dealer net capital rules are designed to ensure that financial firms maintain sufficient liquid assets to cover their liabilities and protect customer funds. Applying these rules to firms dealing with crypto assets presents new challenges: Valuation of Crypto Assets for Net Capital Calculation: How should volatile crypto assets be valued when calculating a broker-dealer’s net capital? Should haircuts (reductions in value) be applied, and if so, at what rate? Custody and Control of Crypto Assets: How does the custody and control of crypto assets by broker-dealers impact net capital requirements? Are existing custody solutions sufficient for regulatory purposes? Operational Risks Specific to Crypto: Do the unique operational risks associated with crypto, such as cybersecurity threats and private key management, necessitate adjustments to net capital rules? Clear guidelines on applying broker-dealer net capital rules to crypto assets are vital for fostering a secure and stable market environment, especially as institutional involvement in crypto increases. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation and Digital Asset ETFs? The meeting between the SEC Crypto Task Force and WisdomTree is a strong indicator that regulatory dialogue is actively underway. It suggests that the SEC is taking a measured and informed approach to crafting crypto regulation , engaging with industry participants to understand the nuances and challenges. This is particularly encouraging for the prospects of digital asset ETFs in the U.S. As the SEC grapples with the complexities of tokenized funds, in-kind transactions, and broker-dealer rules in the context of crypto, these discussions pave the way for: Clearer Regulatory Guidelines: Industry stakeholders can anticipate more specific and tailored regulations for crypto assets, reducing uncertainty and fostering innovation. Potential for Digital Asset ETF Approval: Addressing the regulatory hurdles around operational aspects, in-kind transactions, and net capital rules is crucial for the eventual approval of spot digital asset ETFs in the U.S., which many believe will unlock significant institutional capital for the crypto market. Increased Market Confidence: Proactive engagement from regulators and a clear regulatory framework can boost investor confidence in the crypto market, leading to greater participation and maturity. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Crypto Regulation The SEC Crypto Task Force ‘s meeting with WisdomTree is more than just a procedural step; it’s a crucial dialogue that underscores the ongoing evolution of crypto regulation . By addressing critical issues such as tokenized funds, in-kind transactions, and broker-dealer rules, the SEC is actively working towards a regulatory framework that can accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets while safeguarding investors and maintaining market integrity. For participants in the crypto space, these developments are vital to watch, as they will significantly shape the future trajectory of the industry and the accessibility of digital asset ETFs and other crypto investment products. The engagement signals a move towards a more defined and navigable regulatory environment, which is ultimately beneficial for the long-term growth and stability of the cryptocurrency market.

Notably, cryptocurrency miners are high-powered computers that compete to solve tricky math problems. This process helps maintain the blockchain, the tech behind digital currencies, and miners are rewarded with new cryptocurrency. “Thousands of mining units have been released,” said Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, a cryptocurrency equipment broker. Notably, at one point, up to 10,000 units were stuck at various U.S. ports. He also mentioned that some officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seemed to be against bitcoin mining and made life difficult for the industry. According to Blockspace, U.S. Customs and the Federal Communications Commission began seizing certain bitcoin mining equipment late last year. Notably, some of the machines might have been held back because they contained chips from Sophgo, a Chinese chip company that is restricted from trade. The release of an unspecified amount of cryptocurrency mining equipment is happening during a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, particularly due to the ongoing trade war and security concerns that have been raised by U.S. authorities. These concerns have been present since the later months of the Biden administration. Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor Technology, noted that while some of the seized shipments are now being returned, the majority of them remain held. Both Vera and Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, shared that authorities had cited concerns about radio frequency emissions from the mining machines, which they dismissed, suggesting that the machines’ emissions were not a real issue. This situation is part of a broader context of the U.S. government’s scrutiny of Chinese-made technology, especially in sectors like telecommunications and computing. The U.S. has expressed security worries about foreign-made equipment, particularly from Chinese companies, fearing that they could be used for espionage or other malicious activities. As a result, the government has been imposing restrictions on certain tech imports, and these concerns have extended to cryptocurrency mining equipment as well.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 01:45:14

One crucial tool investors use to gauge market sentiment is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Recently, this index showed a slight uptick, offering a glimmer of hope amidst persistent uncertainty. But what does this rise really mean, and why is the market still gripped by ‘Extreme Fear’? Let’s dive deep into the latest readings and understand the undercurrents shaping the crypto landscape. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of Alternative.me, is designed to measure the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’, suggesting investors are overly worried and potentially leading to undervaluation of assets. Conversely, a score of 100 signals ‘Extreme Greed’, hinting at a possible market bubble due to irrational exuberance. As of March 6th, the index stands at 25. While this is a five-point increase from the previous day, it firmly remains within the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This indicates that despite some positive shifts, a significant portion of the market remains cautious and apprehensive. Decoding the Metrics: What Drives the Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a calculated metric that takes into account a blend of six different market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final index score, providing a holistic view of market sentiment. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. High volatility often correlates with fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current market momentum and trading volume against recent averages. Strong momentum can indicate growing greed, while weak momentum might suggest fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for hashtags related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Positive sentiment contributes to greed, while negative sentiment fuels fear. Surveys (15%): Conducts polls and surveys on crypto platforms to directly gauge investor sentiment. These surveys provide a direct pulse on whether investors are feeling fearful or greedy. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful times, as investors prefer the perceived stability of Bitcoin over altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Increased search interest can sometimes correlate with greed, while declining interest might suggest fear or apathy. Why Does Market Fear Persist Despite a Slight Index Rise? The recent five-point increase in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a positive signal, but it’s crucial to understand why ‘Extreme Fear’ still dominates. Several factors could be at play: Lingering Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions, continue to cast a shadow over all markets, including crypto. This macroeconomic uncertainty fuels investor anxiety. Recent Market Corrections: The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant corrections in recent months. These downturns can leave lasting psychological impacts, making investors hesitant to jump back in aggressively, even with slight positive indicators. Regulatory Scrutiny: Ongoing regulatory discussions and actions around the world can create uncertainty and fear within the crypto market. Unclear regulatory landscapes can make investors wary of potential risks. Bearish Market Sentiment: Prolonged periods of negative price action can create a self-reinforcing cycle of fear. Investors who have experienced losses may be more risk-averse and prone to selling during rallies, further dampening sentiment. Navigating Extreme Fear: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals ‘Extreme Fear’? Here are some actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Periods of extreme fear can be opportune times to employ a DCA strategy. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of price. This can help mitigate risk and potentially capitalize on lower prices over time. Due Diligence and Research: Fear can sometimes lead to panic selling and undervaluation of fundamentally strong projects. Use this time to conduct thorough research on cryptocurrencies you believe in. Identify projects with solid fundamentals, strong teams, and real-world use cases. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Adopting a long-term investment perspective can help you weather short-term fluctuations and avoid emotional decision-making driven by fear. Risk Management: ‘Extreme Fear’ periods highlight the importance of sound risk management. Ensure your portfolio is diversified, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Keep abreast of market developments and news, but be discerning about the information you consume. Avoid being swayed by fear-mongering headlines and focus on credible sources and fundamental analysis. The Path Ahead: Will Greed Return to the Crypto Market? The slight rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a sliver of optimism, suggesting that the extreme bearishness might be easing slightly. However, the market is still firmly in ‘Extreme Fear’. Whether and when we’ll see a shift towards greed depends on a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, technological advancements in the crypto space, and broader investor adoption. For now, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable reminder of the emotional currents driving the market. Understanding these emotions, and acting rationally rather than reacting emotionally, is key to navigating the exciting yet often turbulent world of cryptocurrency investment.

41212532,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137381,1741225550,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Exclusion: Cardano’s Hoskinson Snubbed from White House Crypto Summit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hoskinson-cardano-white-house-summit/,"In a rather shocking turn of events, Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, finds himself excluded from the upcoming White House Crypto Summit. This news, first reported by Unchained, raises eyebrows and sparks questions within the cryptocurrency community. Why would a prominent figure in the crypto space, especially one associated with a major blockchain like Cardano, be left out of such a crucial policy discussion? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential implications of this intriguing development. Charles Hoskinson Excluded: What Happened at the White House Crypto Summit? According to a White House source cited by Unchained, Charles Hoskinson did not receive an invitation to the highly anticipated White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 7th. This revelation is particularly noteworthy given Hoskinson’s significant role in the cryptocurrency industry as the co-founder of Cardano and his vocal advocacy for blockchain technology. The source stated plainly, “They are not involved in anything about trying to influence policy.” This blunt statement suggests a deliberate decision to exclude Hoskinson from the summit, raising questions about the criteria for invitation and the White House’s approach to engaging with the diverse crypto ecosystem. Here’s a quick rundown of what we know: The Exclusion: Charles Hoskinson, a key figure in Cardano and the broader crypto space, was not invited to the White House Crypto Summit. Source of the News: Unchained, citing a White House source, broke the story. Reason for Exclusion (Alleged): The White House source indicated that Hoskinson and potentially Cardano are not seen as relevant to policy influence. Summit Date: The White House Crypto Summit is scheduled for March 7th. The Cardano Paradox: Trump’s Crypto Reserve Claim vs. Summit Snub Adding another layer of intrigue to this situation is a past statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Trump had previously mentioned Cardano’s native token, ADA , as a potential component of a crypto reserve. This public acknowledgement from a prominent political figure seemed to indicate a level of recognition, if not endorsement, of Cardano and ADA within certain political circles. However, Hoskinson’s exclusion from the White House Crypto Summit appears to directly contradict this notion. This discrepancy begs the question: Is there a disconnect between different parts of the U.S. political landscape regarding cryptocurrency? Or does this exclusion signal a shift in perspective, downplaying the significance of Cardano and ADA in the broader crypto policy discussion? Crypto Policy and the Missing Voice: What Does Hoskinson’s Absence Mean? The White House Crypto Summit is intended to be a forum for discussing and shaping crypto policy in the United States. The exclusion of Charles Hoskinson, a figure with years of experience in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, raises concerns about the comprehensiveness and inclusivity of these policy discussions. Hoskinson has been a vocal advocate for sensible crypto regulation and has often engaged in public discourse on the future of blockchain technology. His absence could mean a missed opportunity to incorporate diverse perspectives and expertise into the policymaking process. Potential Implications of Hoskinson’s Exclusion on Crypto Policy Discussions: Limited Perspective: Excluding key figures may lead to a narrower range of viewpoints being considered during policy formulation. Missed Expertise: Hoskinson’s deep understanding of blockchain technology and its potential applications could have been valuable for policymakers. Industry Perception: The exclusion might be perceived negatively by some within the crypto industry, potentially signaling a less inclusive approach to crypto regulation. Focus on Specific Agendas: The summit’s agenda might be skewed towards certain narratives or interests if diverse voices are not represented. White House Crypto Summit: Who’s In and What’s on the Agenda? While Charles Hoskinson’s absence is notable, it’s important to consider the broader context of the White House Crypto Summit . Although details about the specific agenda and list of attendees are still emerging, such summits typically aim to bring together government officials, industry leaders, and experts to discuss the current state of the cryptocurrency landscape and the path forward for regulation. The focus is often on topics such as consumer protection, financial stability, national security, and innovation within the digital asset space. It remains to be seen who *is* included in the summit and what specific issues will be prioritized. However, the exclusion of a prominent figure like Hoskinson does prompt questions about the White House’s priorities and its understanding of the diverse and decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency industry. Cardano’s Future Unaffected? Navigating the Regulatory Landscape Despite Charles Hoskinson’s exclusion from the White House event, Cardano continues to be a significant player in the blockchain space. The project boasts a robust community, ongoing development, and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). While policy discussions at summits like the White House Crypto Summit can influence the regulatory landscape, the fundamental technology and utility of Cardano are independent of these political dynamics. Cardano’s Strengths and Resilience: Technological Innovation: Cardano is known for its peer-reviewed research and focus on secure and scalable blockchain solutions. Strong Community: Cardano has a large and active global community of developers and users. Decentralization: As a decentralized blockchain, Cardano’s operations are not controlled by any single entity or government. Growing Ecosystem: The Cardano ecosystem is expanding with new dApps and projects being launched regularly. Ultimately, while Hoskinson’s exclusion from the summit is a noteworthy development, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency industry is dynamic and multifaceted. The success and adoption of projects like Cardano will likely be determined by a range of factors, including technological advancements, community engagement, and real-world utility, in addition to navigating the evolving regulatory environment. Conclusion: An Intriguing Snub and its Ripple Effects The exclusion of Charles Hoskinson from the White House Crypto Summit is undoubtedly an intriguing development that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community. Whether it’s a deliberate snub, a policy oversight, or a reflection of evolving political dynamics, the absence of a prominent voice like Hoskinson’s from a key policy discussion is certainly noteworthy. It raises important questions about inclusivity, perspective, and the future direction of crypto regulation in the United States. As the White House Crypto Summit unfolds, the industry will be watching closely to see what policies are discussed and whose voices are ultimately heard.

The platform at Mikybull Crypto detected historical similar patterns from when Ethereum broke out in February 2024 shortly before the 300% price jump occurred. A substantial number of investors currently embrace Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its ongoing second presale phase because of its decentralized lending platform. Despite Ethereum’s previous price swings from $1,400 to $80 levels before reaching $4,800 in 2021 only to drop 80% below its peak, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts notice through its structured tokenomics system along with strong presale performance which has surpassed $2.1 million at $0.015 per token. Ethereum’s Volatile Ascent The fundamental technology of Ethereum demonstrates the ongoing battle between recent bullish traits and its previous substantial weaknesses. The asset price maintains its position around $3,200 while experts predict that breaking through this threshold would drive it to reach $5,600. Mikybull Crypto’s analysts discovered identical market trends before an enormous price increase in February 2024. The potential conditions indicate Ethereum can raise its value to $15,000 by 2025. The periodic market volatility of Ethereum has produced multiple booms and busts which make investors anxious about future fluctuations. This latest rally highlights a potential problem because the preceding 16% monthly drop reveals how cryptocurrency markets face sudden downturns which demand investment in modern innovative stable assets. Mutuum Finance’s Calculated Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has adopted a DeFi protocol design to unite lending features with overtly managed token demand while offering its services to capital markets. From Phase 2 of MUTM’s presale investors have acquired 4000 addresses while Phase 2 tokens sell for $0.015 and Phase 3 will be priced at $0.02. The first participants who invest will receive a 300% return when MUTM lists at $0.06 but projection models extend even beyond that timeframe. Experts indicate that platform revenue passes through a buy-and-distribute mechanism which acquires MUTM tokens before distributing them among stakers for continued market demand. The model hardened by overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer features establishes the main attraction of the system. Presale Surge and Tokenomics The protocol succeeded in rapidly attracting investors during its presale phase because of growing market confidence. Phase 2 started at $0.015 entry point which enabled the project to reach $2.1 million in funding while Phase 1 experienced a rapid sellout. Starting at launch price Tokenomics ensures a 4x increase but the analysis after listing reveals potential for the token to reach $2.40 during 2025 which represents a 15900% upside versus present value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) implements mtTokens to create value through accumulating interest since these tokens provide liquidity between different platforms. Users can earn more valuable mtETH tokens by putting their ETH into deposits which users can then freely trade due to their growing worth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents particular methods to counteract crypto volatility even though Ethereum’s technological indicators forecast market appreciation. The lending system at Mutuum Finance depends on overcollateralized loans that require borrowers to pledge assets worth more than the loan amount while working with adjustable interest rates to protect lenders while giving borrowers flexibility. The presale utility attracts participants through a $100,000 giveaway scheme that distributes $10,000 each to 10 investors. The price movement of MUTM depends entirely on user adoption and revenue-based buy pressure rather than market sentiments like Ethereum faces. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes beyond speculative hype to show significant practical project achievements. The presales activity at high velocity and 3900 individual holders prove that the project possesses real market demand which is uncommon for new projects. MUTM token buyers should act swiftly given that future price increases combined with upcoming exchange listings make purchasing tokens for $0.015 more challenging than ever. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers an appealing investment option to those investors looking for controlled entry points coupled with systemic demand creation since Ethereum maintains unquestionable potential. Crypto markets function by supporting stories where Ethereum’s comeback headlines compete against Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which brings forth an investable narrative with extensive risks. The presale results combined with utility-based structure and deflationary token operations of MUTM distinguish itself from Ethereum by relying on market-wide trends. The Phase 2 launch of MUTM allows users to find stability in DeFi’s upcoming advancement that rewards investors through controlled growth instead of uncertain market swings. As Ethereum eyes $7,200, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly charts a course toward redefining value itself.

Interestingly, a crypto analyst on TradingView has highlighted this price support as a make-or-break level for PEPE, suggesting that a breakout above this zone could spark a 400% rally toward $0.0001. This outlook comes after a particularly challenging week for the entire crypto market, during which PEPE extended its losses and dropped to its lowest price point in months. This Level To Trigger 400% Move For PEPE Technical analysis shows that PEPE’s upward trajectory hinges on a bounce at support around $0.00000650. This interesting analysis was highlighted by a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform using the PEPE weekly candlestick timeframe chart. Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise This support level comes into play in light of PEPE’s extended decline since the beginning of the year. Interestingly, technical analysis shows that the decline looks like a repeating pattern of the meme coin’s price action in 2024. The ongoing correction stems from PEPE’s peak price of $0.00002803 in December 2024, which the analyst termed the third drive. Notably, earlier first and second drives in 2024 were also each accompanied by a correction phase after rallies. Interestingly, the meme coin has shown signs of life in the past 24 hours with a push above this support level and climbing into the $0.000007 range. However, the uptrend could not be defined yet, and the crypto analyst noted that any uptrend will depend on how PEPE reacts with a crucial resistance zone between $0.00001150 and $0.00001200. This level has previously acted as support but has now turned into resistance. Therefore, a weekly close above this zone would confirm a bullish breakout and a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. Price Targets If The Meme Coin Breaks Above Resistance A break above $0.00001200 would cement a breakout with more momentum for PEPE. Such a breakout would mark the first bullish catalyst in a while, confirm momentum, and lead to increased buy-side pressure with an aggressive upward move. From here, the next resistance levels are projected to be around $0.00001700 to $0.00002200. A move to $0.00002200 will most likely cascade into more momentum above its current all-time high of $0.00002803. Related Reading: PEPE Flashes Reversal Signal To Recoup The 800 EMA, What This Means For Price The analyst further predicted a price target of $0.0001, provided the bullish momentum sustains itself. However, failure to close above the key resistance level at $0.00001200 could result in a continued downtrend, with PEPE possibly retesting lower support zones around $0.00000650 to $0.00000550. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.000007239, up by 4.4% in the past 24 hours. PEPE’s ability to sustain such an upward trajectory would depend on broader market conditions for Bitcoin and other large market cap cryptocurrencies.

Excitement is building as Grayscale moves forward with its application for a dedicated Cardano ETF under the ticker “GADA” on NYSE Arca. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) is flashing bullish signals, with analysts predicting a potential 16% increase as buying activity picks up. While these established projects aim for new highs, Web3Bay is making headlines for its mission to reshape digital asset trading. With tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) becoming more common and NFTs maturing beyond collectibles, Web3Bay is stepping up to create a next-generation marketplace. This platform aims to connect digital creators, buyers, and asset owners in a seamless ecosystem that could challenge OpenSea’s dominance. Web3Bay: The Future of Digital Asset Trading in 2025 Web3Bay is setting its sights on becoming the go-to marketplace for digital assets, much like Amazon has for e-commerce. By creating a direct and transparent marketplace, it brings together creators, investors, and collectors in one space. With RWAs gaining mainstream traction and NFTs evolving into more functional assets, Web3Bay is building a framework that supports secure and efficient trading. One of Web3Bay’s key strengths is its ability to support NFT applications beyond art and collectibles. The platform is structured to handle digital tickets, memberships, and virtual assets, tapping into the growing demand for real-world applications of blockchain technology. As physical assets like real estate and luxury goods get tokenized, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a hub where buyers and sellers can interact without unnecessary intermediaries. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale is in its 5th stage, with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524. The project has already raised $1.6 million, showing strong backing from early adopters. Upcoming integrations, including PayPal support, signal a push toward mainstream adoption, making this a prime time for investors to get involved before the platform scales. Could a Cardano ETF Take ADA to the Next Level? The anticipation around a potential Cardano ETF is growing as Grayscale files for a dedicated investment product under the ticker “GADA.” If approved, this move would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to ADA without directly managing crypto assets. The fund’s structure includes Coinbase Custody Trust Company as custodian and BNY Mellon as administrator, adding credibility to the proposal. Following the ETF announcement, ADA jumped by 14.38%, hitting $0.8051. Looking ahead, CoinCodex predicts that ADA could climb to $1.900281 in 2025. The community is closely watching the SEC’s decision, as an approval could attract fresh capital and further boost adoption. Will XLM Hit $0.4292? Analysts Weigh In Crypto analyst Ali Martinez sees a potential 16% surge in XLM’s price, pointing to an inverted head and shoulders pattern forming on Stellar’s 4-hour chart. This pattern often signals a reversal from a downward trend, suggesting that a breakout may be on the horizon. Currently, XLM is trading around $0.32, with a key resistance level at $0.37. If this level is breached, the price could rise toward $0.4292, as projected. Despite a 26.6% decline over the last month, Stellar’s network activity is showing strong recovery signals. The number of active addresses has hit a record 9 million, while over $32.54 million worth of XLM has been withdrawn from exchanges, indicating accumulation by long-term holders. Open Interest (OI) has also risen by 3.82%, showing that traders are positioning themselves for a potential breakout. Wrapping Up A potential Cardano ETF could give ADA the push it needs to break through key resistance levels, while Stellar’s technical patterns suggest a possible rally to $0.4292. Both projects offer compelling reasons to watch closely, but Web3Bay is presenting a different kind of opportunity. With its focus on RWAs, NFTs, and a seamless marketplace model, Web3Bay is aiming to redefine digital asset trading. As it continues its presale, currently in Stage 5 with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524, early investors could find themselves well-positioned as the platform gains traction.

As reported by Reuters on Mar. 6, the move, which grants a one-month exemption for U.S. automakers, eased concerns that the trade war could damage domestic manufacturing and weighed on the dollar, fueling demand for risk assets like crypto. The decision came after Trump met with executives from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Investors see the delay as an indication that tariffs may not cause as much economic disruption as anticipated. According to the price tracker on crypto.news, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is currently trading at $91,651, up 5% over the last 24 hours. The broader crypto market also advanced, gaining 2% amid improved risk sentiment. Although it is still in the “Extreme Fear” zone, the Fear and Greed Index increased 5 points to 25, indicating that investors are still being cautious. Crypto-related stocks also saw significant gains, with Coinbase (COIN) rising 4% and MicroStrategy (MSTR) jumping 12%%. At the same time, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell to its lowest level since November, historically a bullish signal for Bitcoin.

As confidence in XRP wavers, Web3Bay continues to gain traction, raising over $1.6 million in its presale as investors seek assets with stronger long-term potential. With XRP slipping and Web3Bay gaining momentum, many are asking: Could Web3Bay be the more reliable choice amid crypto market fluctuations? XRP’s $350 Million Decline Sparks Investor Concerns XRP has been hit hard, shedding more than 7% of its value as it struggles to hold key support levels. This steep sell-off comes as part of a larger crypto downturn, with Bitcoin dipping below $90,000 and Ethereum struggling to maintain its $2,500 support. Market uncertainty has been compounded by the recent collapse of the LIBRA project and the $1.6 billion Bybit hack, creating widespread caution among investors. Data from on-chain analytics shows that XRP’s market cap suffered a $350 million reduction, leaving traders on edge. Analysts warn that if XRP fails to break back above its resistance zone, the asset could face more downside pressure, potentially testing the $1.80 range in the near future. Web3Bay’s $1.6 Million Presale Success Defies Market Trends While XRP battles volatility, Web3Bay continues to capture attention with its impressive presale momentum. Investors looking for stable, high-growth opportunities are turning to Web3Bay, which has now surpassed $1.6 million in funding, demonstrating strong demand for projects with practical applications. Web3Bay is not just another token; it is designed as a decentralized e-commerce solution aimed at reshaping online transactions. By cutting out middlemen, lowering transaction fees, and giving users full control over purchases, Web3Bay presents a clear use case that sets it apart from speculative assets. Unlike XRP, which is heavily influenced by regulatory uncertainties and shifting market sentiment, Web3Bay operates on a model that directly ties its value to real-world adoption. This has made it one of the fastest-growing crypto presales of 2025, with over 390 million tokens already sold. Web3Bay vs. XRP—Which Crypto Holds Greater Potential? One of the key concerns for XRP holders is its struggle to maintain consistent momentum. Despite occasional price spikes, XRP remains highly dependent on external factors such as institutional interest and regulatory decisions. Web3Bay, on the other hand, offers a more structured investment opportunity. Unlike XRP, which relies on market speculation, Web3Bay’s value is driven by adoption in the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. The project’s presale structure also provides a predictable growth path, ensuring that early investors benefit from progressive price increases. Currently, 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.004562, and investors who secure their holdings now stand to benefit significantly. With projections indicating potential returns exceeding 4,200%, Web3Bay presents an alternative that combines utility with high-growth potential. Final Thoughts—Which Crypto Stands Out? As XRP faces a steep decline and overall market volatility remains high, investors are seeking safer and more rewarding opportunities. Web3Bay has positioned itself as a leading option, proving that projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications continue to attract smart investors, even in uncertain times. While XRP may regain its footing, its unpredictable nature makes it a riskier bet compared to Web3Bay’s structured growth model. With $1.6 million already raised and investor interest continuing to rise, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the top crypto opportunities of 2025. With the next presale price increase approaching, the question remains: Will you secure your Web3Bay tokens now or miss out on what could be one of the biggest opportunities in the market?

Gox Moves $1 Billion in Bitcoin Amid Market Turmoil and New Tariffs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mt. Gox, the bankrupt crypto exchange, has started moving Bitcoin again. As per a latest update from Arkham Intelligence, on March 6, 12,000 BTC, worth over $1 billion, was transferred from its wallet (1PuQB), with a transaction fee was just $1.64. At the same time another 166.5 BTC, worth around $15 million, was sent to Mt. Gox’s cold wallet (1Jbez). The remaining Bitcoin was moved to an unknown wallet (1Mo1n), which now holds 11,834 BTC. ARKHAM ALERT: MT GOX MOVING $1B $BTC pic.twitter.com/VpIkHdJQkl — Arkham (@arkham) March 6, 2025 Mt. Gox-linked accounts now hold 36,080 BTC, worth around $3.26 billion, according to Arkham data. This is the first major Bitcoin move from Mt. Gox wallets in a month. The last transfer was only 4 BTC between cold wallets. It’s unclear what the recent transaction was for. In December, Mt. Gox moved about 1,620 BTC through unknown wallets, just two weeks after transferring over 24,000 BTC. The Bitcoin move happened during a week of market ups and downs, caused by new trade tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump, which began on March 4. These tariffs shook high-risk assets like crypto. Bitcoin’s price fluctuated a lot, going from a high of $94,770 on March 3, to a low of $82,681 on March 4. By March 5, Bitcoin had bounced back to over $90,000. New Repayment Deadline Mt. Gox, founded in 2010, quickly grew to become the largest bitcoin exchange by 2013, handling 70% of global bitcoin trades. However, in early 2014, it stopped withdrawals and trading. The platform shut down soon after, and the company filed for bankruptcy, losing over 800,000 BTC. Thousands of creditors are still waiting for their bitcoin to be returned. In October 2024, Mt. Gox announced a new repayment deadline of October 31, 2025.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ARKM|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 03:02:20

The battle between traditional government-issued currencies and cryptocurrency reshapes the financial ecosystem. This is forcing individuals, businesses, and policymakers to rethink the very nature of money itself. While fiat currencies have ruled for centuries under government control, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are challenging this monopoly, presenting a borderless, censorship-resistant alternative. But are cryptocurrencies the future of finance, or do they remain a speculative asset vulnerable to volatility and regulatory crackdowns? This article breaks down the core differences between crypto and fiat, looking at their impact on economic stability, inflation, security, and global adoption. Origin and Control: Who’s in Charge? The key difference between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies is who controls them. Fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR), are government-issued and centrally regulated. Their supply is controlled through monetary policies, such as interest rate adjustments and money printing. Fiat currencies also have unlimited supplies, as governments can print more m… The post Cryptocurrency vs. Government Currency: What’s the Difference? appeared first on Coin Edition .",Learn|News|Cryptocurrency 101,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-03-06 03:26:18

XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has formed a bullish cup-and-handle price action pattern in the four-hour timeframe and is on the verge of a breakout. Amid ongoing price fluctuations, the price has reached the neckline of the pattern. Based on recent price action and historical trends, if the asset breaks out of the pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $2.55 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 12% to reach the $2.83 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View However, the neckline of the pattern coincides with the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in the same timeframe, which also acts as a resistance level. Current Price Momentum XRP is currently trading near $2.52, having registered a modest gain of 1.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 45%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. $13 Million Worth of XRP Inflow The potential reason behind XRP’s struggle to gain momentum is the ongoing inflow from the exchanges. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , investors and long-term holders have potentially offloaded nearly $13 million worth of XRP tokens onto exchanges. This substantial outflow onto exchanges is currently causing prices to struggle, as it has the potential to create selling pressure and drive downside momentum. XRP’s Major Liquidation Levels At press time, traders betting on the long side are currently dominating, while those betting on the short side appear exhausted. Traders are over-leveraged at $2.40, having built $57 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $2.55 is an over-leveraged level where traders have built $8.50 million worth of short positions.

The coin is now inching closer to the $2 mark, recovering from a major drop from its all-time high of $3. Currently, Pi Coin is trading between $1.70 and $1.95, sparking hope among investors for a potential rebound to its peak value. The broader cryptocurrency market remains volatile, with major coins like Bitcoin influencing the price of Pi Coin. Despite this, Pi Coin has established itself as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, even without being listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. The immediate support level for Pi Coin is at $1.60. If selling pressure continues, this level could be tested once again, following recent market trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below 50, signaling weak bullish momentum. Pi Network’s Growing Presence and Potential Analyst Kim Wong said that Pi Network stands out among crypto projects for its aim to build a functional digital economy, allowing Pi coins to be used in real-world transactions, such as purchasing goods and services, and powering decentralized applications (dApps).

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,350 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh upward move above the $2,220 support zone. The price is trading above $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key rising channel forming with support at $2,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,275 and $2,350 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Eyes A Comeback Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $2,350 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $2,220 and $2,250 support levels. A low was formed at $2,003 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,150 and $2,200 resistance levels. It even tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a key rising channel forming with support at $2,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,275 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,340 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,340 resistance might send the price toward the $2,420 resistance. An upside break above the $2,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,500 resistance zone or even $2,550 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,275 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,240 level. The first major support sits near the $2,220 zone. A clear move below the $2,130 support might push the price toward the $2,080 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,050 support level in the near term.

In a recent presentation, Pal walked through a range of macroeconomic indicators, historical price behaviors, and liquidity metrics that he says paint a compelling picture for an extended uptrend in digital assets. Bitcoin Bull Market Depends On M2 At the heart of Pal’s thesis lies the notion of Global M2 money supply, a metric tracking the total liquidity in circulation worldwide. Pal observed that Bitcoin, along with other risk-on assets, tends to correlate closely with changes in Global M2. “If this is the case, then M2 is going to keep going up all f***ing year. If that is the case, then crypto and risk assets like tech will do well all year.” By comparing current liquidity trends to those seen in 2017—when the dollar weakened considerably and equity markets soared in US President Donald Trump’s first term—Pal argues that the macro backdrop appears similarly poised for expansion. According to him, if major economies continue easing, it may drive the next phase of explosive crypto growth. Related Reading: Inverse Head And Shoulders Breakout Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Headed To $300,000 Pal’s thesis revolves around the impact of global liquidity, particularly the role of Global M2 money supply as a leading indicator for Bitcoin and risk assets. He presented a correlation between Global M2 growth and crypto market performance, stating: “If this is the case, then M2 is going to keep going up all f***ing year. If that is the case, then crypto and risk assets like tech will do well all year.” His analysis draws parallels to 2017, when Trump’s fiscal policies and monetary easing led to a prolonged period of dollar weakness, which fueled the crypto cycle. Similar conditions are unfolding now, with expectations of rate cuts and stimulus measures. A crucial factor in Pal’s extended bull market thesis is the business cycle, which he tracks through the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Index. Historically, an ISM reading above 50 signals economic expansion, which correlates with Bitcoin’s price surges. He noted: “Bitcoin goes up as the ISM goes up If the ISM gets up to its normal cycle peak of somewhere between 56 and 65, that will give us the magnitude of the rise in Bitcoin.” Pal suggested that if ISM continues its upward trajectory, Bitcoin’s price could exceed $300,000 or higher. However, he refrained from making precise forecasts, emphasizing that probabilities, not certainties, drive market analysis. Addressing the altcoin market, Pal maintained that Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) remain key components of his portfolio. Despite Solana’s recent drawdown of over 53%, he dismissed fears of a long-term decline: “Solana has overshot versus global M2 […]Solana should outperform Bitcoin for the rest of the cycle and Ethereum too, with Sui outperforming Solana.” His broader view on altcoins is based on risk appetite shifts as financial conditions ease. Historically, altcoins outperform Bitcoin in the latter half of the cycle when investors seek higher-beta opportunities. Pal criticized the notion that there will be no altcoin season in this cycle, stating, “That’s all f****ing nonsense.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s ‘KISS Of Death’? Arthur Hayes Warns Of Recession Before Surge Pal emphasized that large pullbacks are a feature, not a bug of crypto bull markets. He detailed past corrections, pointing out that the current cycle has seen seven 20%+ corrections while maintaining a 600% gain from the lows. He warned traders against leverage and panic selling, reinforcing his “Don’t F* This Up**” thesis: “To make the money, to unf*** your future, you’re going to have to learn to deal with volatility.” He compared the current correction to 2017, which saw multiple 30-40% pullbacks before peaking. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates that the market is the second most oversold in this cycle, suggesting a potential recovery in the coming months. Extending The Cycle To 2026 One of Pal’s most striking assertions is that the current cycle could extend into 2026 rather than peaking in 2025, as many analysts have projected. His reasoning is based on the prolonged period of economic stagnation before growth acceleration. He stated: “The business cycle is taking a long time below 50. It’s starting to expand now. That has probably extended the cycle into 2026.” While he clarified that this is not a prediction but a working hypothesis, the implications could be significant. A longer cycle would allow for higher valuations, a sustained investment influx, and a gradual rather than explosive blow-off top. Pal reiterated that the crypto market follows a predictable pattern, with a year-long “banana zone” of exponential growth. He noted that the current correction phase aligns with past cycles and should lead to a renewed rally by April-May. “We are now in correction phase one […] Then as we go into March, April, May, we start accelerating up again into the next phase of the banana zone.” However, he warned that investors should expect another major correction before the final market top, cautioning against overleveraging and late-cycle exuberance. Summarizing his outlook, Pal urged investors to maintain perspective and resist emotional trading. He emphasized the importance of long-term vision, proper portfolio construction, and patience: “You guys need patience more than anything else and need to understand markets […] Our futures are resting on the same thing.” At press time, BTC traded at $88,617.

The upcoming High Roller Mode will introduce crypto wagering with $CHILL, raising the stakes for both casual players and high-level competitors. SOL Arena integrates the dynamic, community-driven Solana ecosystem directly into the game, where memecoin projects, NFT communities, and token holders unite under shared teams. “Our vision is to merge casual gaming with degenerate memecoin activity and crypto network effects,” said James Au , CEO and Game Director of Chillchat, “to deliver an exciting new player experience that redefines the thrill of ‘winning’.” What’s Next? Token Launch and Mobile Play Following the Challengers NFT mint in February 2025 , SOL Arena’s next significant milestone is the launch of its ecosystem token, $CHILL, at the end of March.

In the first weeks of President Trump’s second administration, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, headed by the staunch Trump supporter and tech-billionaire Elon Musk, has uncovered a plethora of government misspending. Taking inspiration from President Trump’s money-saving agenda, Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, has filed a request to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to submit the total number of American tax dollars spent on crypto enforcement actions over the past four years. Coinbase Issues Public Record Request A La Doge The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by tech wizard Elon Musk, has made a clear impression on the crypto industry. After damning reports of government misspending came to light thanks to Mr Musk’s determination and grit to dismantle corruption in the US government, many others are now also questioning whether misspending could have occurred in other branches of government. Coinbase can now breathe a sigh of relief after the SEC dropped its latest enforcement case against the exchange. But no, says Coinbase: there's no time to relax. The exchange wants the SEC to offer a report detailing every dollar and resource it has devoted to enforcing and investigating the broader crypto industry in recent years. The exchange has taken the step to receive the information from the agency by filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request , aimed at getting hold of the SEC’s financials concerning enforcement actions against crypto firms. Detailed Request Coinbase’s request seeks clarification on the expenses the SEC incurred from April 17, 2021, to January 20, 2025, linked to investigations into crypto activities. Coinbase’s request is comprehensive and seeks to include various aspects surrounding the SEC’s actions, including: The number of investigations launched against crypto firms; Number of employees involved in the enforcement actions; Additional detail on third-party contractors engaged in enforcements and investigations; Total and complete financial expenditures on these actions. Paul Grewal took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to speak further about these actions. In a thread, Grewal posted: We know the previous @SECgov ’s regulation-by-enforcement approach cost Americans innovation, global leadership, and jobs, but how much did it cost in taxpayer dollars? Today @Coinbase submitted a FOIA request asking the SEC to explain how much its war on crypto cost taxpayers.… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 3, 2025 Adding; “What do we hope to find out? How many investigations and enforcement actions were brought – and how much they cost; how many employees worked on these investigations/enforcement actions – and how much they cost; how many third-party contractors were used in these investigations/enforcement actions – and how much they cost.” Adding; “We also want to know more about the previous SEC’s infamous “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit” within the Enforcement Division – what was their budget, how many employees worked on it, how much did those employee hours cost?” Concluding with the following statement: “We’ll never stop fighting for government transparency on behalf of our customers and this industry. It may take time to get the full picture, but I think we’ve shown that we will do what it take for as long as it takes. You can read our FOIA request here.""

This first-of-its-kind event is expected to play a crucial role in the future of U.S. crypto policy, possibly launching a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Several key figures in the industry, including members of former President Donald Trump’s crypto task force, are expected to attend. However, as the guest list has started to take shape, one notable name is missing: Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson. According to Unchained, a White House source confirmed that Hoskinson was not invited to the summit, nor has Cardano been involved in any policy discussions or meetings with the administration. “They are running around town trying to push their own sort of narrative. They are not involved in anything about trying to influence policy and they are not invited to Friday’s summit,” the White House source told Unchained. Hoskinson’s absence is particularly surprising given recent comments from President Trump. On Sunday, Trump mentioned that Cardano’s ADA, would be part of a crypto reserve, which led many to expect Hoskinson’s attendance at the event. Confirmed Guests for the Summit Despite the exclusion of Hoskinson, several high-profile crypto industry leaders will be in attendance. The confirmed guest list includes: Brad Garlinghouse – CEO of Ripple Michael Saylor – Founder of MicroStrategy David Bailey – CEO of Bitcoin Magazine Matt Huang – Co-founder of Paradigm JP Richardson – CEO of Exodus Kyle Samani – Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital Zach Witkoff – Co-founder of World Liberty Financial Sergey Nazarov – Co-founder of Chainlink Brian Armstrong – CEO of Coinbase Vlad Tenev – CEO of Robinhood Arjun Sethi – CEO of Kraken Kris Marszalek – CEO of Crypto.com Hoskinson had previously hinted that he might attend a fundraising dinner for the pro-crypto PAC MAGA Inc., but the White House confirmed that he was not invited to that event either. Key Focus of the Summit The summit is set to run from 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET on March 7 and will be led by David Sacks, President Trump’s appointed AI and crypto czar. One of the main points of discussion will be the handling of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated in a recent interview that Bitcoin would be treated differently than other altcoins, as it is a significant part of President Trump’s crypto strategy.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 04:04:17

The price is now rising and might clear the $2.550 resistance zone. XRP price started a decent upward move from the $2.20 support zone. The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.480 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it clears the $2.550 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.80 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.60 and $2.50 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $2.25. Finally, the bulls appeared near the $2.20 support zone. A base is forming and the price is now recovering losses above $2.30. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.00 swing high to the $2.211 low.

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level. The next resistance is $2.70 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.00 swing high to the $2.211 low. A clear move above the $2.70 resistance might send the price toward the $2.80 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.880 resistance or even $2.920 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.480 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.40 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.40 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.320 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone.

The price of Cardano has soared by more than 40% from last week and analysts think ADA is not done yet . RTX has entered the PayFi market as a stealthy competitor against established altcoins like Stellar and Ripple while offering promising profit potential. Let us examine Cardano price current growth trend alongside Remittix’s discreet market rise in 2025. Current Cardano price Data Points Toward Positive Outlook; ADA Will Surpass The $2 mark. Cardano has taken the spotlight following President Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement. Cardano experienced an 80% price increase within two hours when it joined BTC, ETH, XRP and SOL on the exchange platforms which caused widespread market interest.. The Cardano price currently maintains a price at $1 while its market capitalization has reached $36.16 billion with $4.8 billion in daily trading volume. ADA has risen to $1 from its previous position at $0.64 thus becoming the reserve’s most successful cryptocurrency with strong recovery. Many analysts predict a 200% price increase for Cardano while forecasting it will reach $2.2 by mid-2025 and $3 by year end. The reserve introduces a pioneering approach that might prompt worldwide acceptance of its model. The announcement’s pro-crypto vibe has fueled this Cardano price upward rally. Cardano’s price strength shines with a circulating supply of 35.94 billion ADA. Public discussions link Cardano’s current market rise above the other reserve coins to its sustainable blockchain technology and smart contract capabilities. Market experts warn that the $2 billion FTX unlock process may yet harm price gains but the Cardano price outlook stays optimistic at this time. Remittix Is The Low Profile Potential PayFi Powerhouse Of 2025 The rising popularity of Cardano does not overshadow Remittix (RTX) as it develops its distinct market position. Remittix presale initiated at $0.0694 successfully attracted almost $13.5 million while attracting more than 30,000 holders who have purchased over 515 million tokens which increased 362% from its initial price of $0.015. Remittix stands apart from ordinary altcoins because it leads the PayFi movement. Users will be able to send cryptocurrency which automatically transforms into national currencies available in more than 30 different countries at affordable rates. The platform serves as a financial bridge for freelancers and families who want to avoid bank expenses while aiming at the $190 trillion global remittance sector. Cardano’s $30+ billion cap towers higher than RTX’s current presale numbers, but this just means Remittix’s room for growth is way higher and price changes will feel more agile and earn bigger yields. Remittix operates through practical methods while Cardano relies on reserve-driven boosts for its operations. Remittix provides an innovative solution that connects cryptocurrency transactions to traditional cash flow while delivering a new approach. Looking Forward; Why Remittix Will Soar Past $0.5 Soon What’s Remittix’s deal? Money transfer process is straightforward because cryptocurrency converts instantly into traditional money without bank delays. Cross-border workers along with families who need to transfer funds overseas benefit from Remittix by saving their wallet funds from unnecessary fees. The steady climb of Remittix price from its current position under 10 cents to reach $0.5 offers investors a more dependable investment opportunity than Cardano price gains. The market scarcity of RTX tokens may increase their value because demand continues to grow. Jump aboard RTX presale right now before the opportunity runs away.

Dogecoin, Cardano & XYZVerse Surge as Key Indicator Flashes Bullish",https://nulltx.com/1-target-in-sight-dogecoin-cardano-xyzverse-surge-as-key-indicator-flashes-bullish/,"Could Dogecoin, Cardano, and XYZVerse be on the brink of a major breakout? These digital assets have experienced a significant surge, boosted by a crucial market signal pointing toward bullish momentum. With prices climbing and key thresholds in sight, the stage is set for potential landmark achievements. What implications might this have for the broader market? XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin’s Wild Ride: From Meme to Crypto Sensation Dogecoin began in 2013 as a joke. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it used the Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin was designed to be plentiful, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. At first, it was just a “memecoin.” But in 2021, its value skyrocketed. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, reaching a market value over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media and support from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s rise showed the power of community and how the internet can influence finance. Dogecoin’s technology is simple. It doesn’t have features like smart contracts. But its strength is in its community and widespread appeal. In the current market, some investors still find Dogecoin attractive because of its active fanbase. However, its unlimited supply means it may not hold value as well as coins with a fixed supply, like Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies offer more advanced technology and real-world uses. But if the social media buzz continues, Dogecoin could stay strong. Its story reminds us that in crypto, fun and community can drive value as much as technology. Cardano’s ADA: The Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrency Changing the Game Cardano is a rising star in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible and sustainable blockchain designed for smart contracts. Developers can build apps, create crypto tokens, and design games on it. Its coin, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake ADA on the network. Cardano stands out because it’s eco-friendly. It uses Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake system that saves energy compared to traditional methods. Cardano’s innovation lies in its two-layer system: one for transactions, one for smart contracts. This design could allow it to process up to a million transactions per second. Since March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market, ADA looks attractive due to its scalability and green approach. As concerns about energy use in crypto grow, Cardano’s solution is timely. While Ethereum has recently shifted to proof-of-stake, Cardano’s layered architecture and early adoption of these principles make it stand out, making ADA a promising option. Conclusion The bull run of 2025 boosts DOGE and ADA, but XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans in crypto.

Sui (SUI) Primed for Rebound Despite Recent Dips Sui is currently priced between $2.66 and $3.59, facing a dip but holding on. The price has dropped over the past month and week, but a six-month rise of nearly 200% shows resilience. The RSI suggests it’s undervalued, presenting a potential for growth. The current nearest resistance lies just under $4, and if Sui breaks this, it might aim for $4.91. With improving technical indicators, a rebound could drive a price increase of over 30% from current levels. Support holds at $2.13 to protect further dips. While recent trends show a fall, signs of a possible altcoin season bring hope for Sui’s rise. Mantle Set to Soar or Stumble: Crypto’s Underdog Tale Mantle (MNT) is dancing between $0.68 and $0.90, showing some mixed signals. The MACD is in the red, implying caution. But, the RSI at 46.46 suggests it’s nearing a potential bounce. For now, the price looks pressured, having dropped more than 10% in a week. In the next move, breaking the $1.02 resistance could trigger a rally, possibly taking it up near the $1.24 mark, a 38% leap from current levels. However, slipping past the $0.58 support might spell more trouble. Momentum indicators show sideways movement. It’s a waiting game for now, and crypto enthusiasts are eager to see where this coin goes next. Conclusion While SUI and MNT show limited short-term potential amid market pressures, Catzilla presents itself as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility in governance, incentives, and staking, Catzilla unites enthusiasts to dismantle toxic systems.

Two standout projects have recently emerged for those looking to dive into this vibrant sector: Arctic Pablo Coin and Pudgy Penguins. Each offers distinct features and potential benefits for investors seeking the top meme coins to invest in this week. Arctic Pablo Coin: Embarking on a Frosty Financial Expedition Imagine traversing icy tundras, uncovering mystical secrets hidden beneath snow-covered lands. That’s the story of Arctic Pablo ($APC), a meme coin designed to turn myths into money. As Pablo travels through legendary locations, each presale phase offers a piece of this adventurous narrative, transforming every coin into more than just currency—it’s a ticket to a mythical journey. Arctic Pablo’s presale is ingeniously structured around Pablo’s expedition, with each phase representing a new location on his map. Currently, the presale has reached ChillVille, the 13th phase, with tokens priced at $0.000070. Early investors have a golden opportunity, as the launch price is set at $0.008, offering a staggering potential return on investment (ROI) of over 11,285.71% from this stage to the listing price. For instance, a $1,000 investment now would yield approximately 14,281,270 APCs, which could be worth $114,250.16 upon launch. Arctic Pablo employs a deflationary token burn mechanism to enhance scarcity and value. Unsold tokens are permanently eliminated weekly during the presale, and any remaining tokens post-presale will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment. This strategy aims to boost investor value and ensure long-term sustainability. Additionally, Arctic Pablo offers a staking program with an attractive 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Investors can stake their APC tokens and watch their investments grow, with all staked coins vested for two months from the launch date. This initiative rewards holders and encourages long-term commitment to the project. Arctic Pablo places a strong emphasis on community involvement. The project offers referral incentives, allowing participants to earn rewards by inviting others to join the journey. This approach fosters a collaborative environment and accelerates the project’s growth by leveraging the power of community networks. It is one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week. Pudgy Penguins: From NFTs to Meme Coin Stardom Pudgy Penguins began as a collection of 8,888 unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain in August 2021. The project quickly gained traction, becoming a cultural icon within the crypto community. In April 2022, Pudgy Penguins underwent acquisition by Luca Schnetzler for a sum of 750 ETH, equivalent to $2.5 million at the time. Building on its NFT success, Pudgy Penguins introduced its official coin, PENGU. This move allowed the ever-expanding Pudgy Penguin fanbase and the hundreds of millions of people outside of crypto to join “The Huddle.” PENGU is a symbol for community, memes, and good vibes. As of March 5, 2025, PENGU is trading at approximately $0.006743, with a 24-hour trading volume of $104,977,998.07. The token reached an all-time high of $0.06845 on December 17, 2024, and has since experienced a decline of about 90.4%. Despite this, the community remains bullish, with 89% expressing positive sentiment towards PENGU. Conclusion: Seizing the Meme Coin Moment Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin and Pudgy Penguins stand out as top meme coins to invest in this week. Arctic Pablo offers a unique adventure-driven narrative, structured presale phases with escalating prices, a deflationary token burn mechanism, and a lucrative staking program with 66% APY.

It forms a bullish pattern on the 4-hour chart, but there’s no assurance if it will come into play. Altcoins are back in a recovery mode after witnessing a serious downfall after opening short this week. However, Link remains bearish on the daily chart but has managed to stay above $13 over the past week. This price level is now considered as support. The recovery came after witnessing a dramatic sell-off from $17.5 two days ago. The bulls intercepted the drops yesterday and pushed back. They are now taking charge on the day. Though the pressure is not strong yet to consider a buy. A push above the previous weekly high should set the stage for retracement before resuming bearish. On the 4-hour chart, Link signals a potential bullish move with a double-bottom formation, but it is not certain if it will play out. A break above its neckline should validate a temporary shift while the buyers regroup. Losing the current holding support could invalidate the bullish move, hence advancing drops to a new multi-month low. Technically, the price has reached an oversold region on the daily chart. We can expect a small recovery while the trend remains bearish. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The main resistance level to watch for now is $17.5. If the price breaks higher, $19.8 is the next resistance to keep in mind, followed by $22.3. For pullback, there’s close support at $15.4. A break below the holding $13.1 support could slip the price to $11. If this level fails to produce a bounce, it may navigate $10 for support.

ETH experienced a rollercoaster performance earlier this week before rebounding with a 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This recovery follows a broader market correction that initially led to fear among investors. While Ethereum’s performance remains closely linked to Bitcoin’s price action, recent on-chain data suggests that ETH may enter a renewed accumulation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly RSI Drops To Lowest Level Since May 2022 – More Selling Pressure Ahead? MVRV Ratio and Institutional Accumulation Trends A post uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform by a contributor known as Mac has particularly pointed out Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which suggests the asset is currently undervalued. The latest data indicates that large-scale investors are increasing their ETH holdings, signaling potential support at key price levels. According to Mac, these accumulation patterns could influence Ethereum’s trajectory in the coming weeks. Mac revealed that the MVRV ratio, a key on-chain metric used to assess whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued, has fallen below 1 for Ethereum. Historically, such levels indicate an undervalued zone, meaning that Ethereum is trading close to the average purchase price of all holders, including institutional investors. ETH MVRV: Reaching a Highly Undervalued Zone “When MVRV falls below 1, it signals entry into an undervalued zone in the cycle, indicating an opportunity to buy at a level close to the average purchase price of all holders (including whale investors).” – By @MAC_D46035 pic.twitter.com/urj348TZng — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 5, 2025 The analyst also mentioned that in past market cycles, when Ethereum’s MVRV dropped below 1, it was followed by notable price recoveries. Additionally, there has been a surge in the number of ETH accumulation addresses—wallets that receive ETH but have never withdrawn. This suggests that large investors and institutions are strategically increasing their holdings, particularly at the current price range of $2,200–$2,300, where the realized price for whale investors is concentrated. This level is expected to act as a strong support zone, reinforcing the possibility of sustained accumulation. Market Conditions and Long-Term Ethereum Outlook Beyond accumulation trends, macroeconomic factors continue to play a role in shaping Ethereum’s price movements. Mac noted that liquidity policies in the US, particularly the Trump administration’s trade and monetary policies, have so far influenced risk asset performance, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Below Parallel Channel – Is ETH Collapsing To $1,250? Stricter monetary policies and inflation concerns could contribute to “sharp price drops.” Despite this possibility, Mac concluded, noting: However, Ethereum still maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is a proven network with thousands of mature DeFi projects. As such, institutional investors are likely to accumulate more in this undervalued zone. Therefore, from a long-term perspective, the outlook for Ethereum remains positive.

With president Donald Trump’s administration changing regulatory attitudes, a new SEC crypto task force in place, Coinbase is mapping out its execution strategy. Alesia Haas, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, confirmed the decision at the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference on Wednesday, saying Coinbase had originally wanted to go public with a security token. “We tried to go public with a security token. We tried to go public on our own products. And we could not, and we ran into brick walls,” said Alesia. “The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shut down those plans.” The SEC’s legal battle with Coinbase ended in a major court victory for the company last month. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong addressed this during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, saying, “We fully won that case. It was dismissed with prejudice. We did not pay a single dollar in settlement. We did not change a single aspect of our business.” So this victory cleared the way for Coinbase to pursue security tokens again. The company believes the current Congress is the most pro-crypto ever, with Trump pushing to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Brian said, “We have the House, the Senate, and the Executive all fully excited and aligned on this.” A key part of Coinbase’s regulatory focus is stablecoin legislation. Brian explained, “Creating stablecoin regulation will be a huge unlock for a digitized dollar.” Coinbase is also pushing for clear market structure laws to define which crypto assets count as commodities, securities, or payment stablecoins. In the earnings call, Brian described this as “key to understanding who is regulating you.” Payments are another major growth area. Brian told Coinbase shareholders that: “The majority of all payments are going to be happening on stablecoins eventually.” He pointed to the speed, low fees, and global reach of stablecoin transactions, adding, “Sending USDC on Base takes less than one second and costs less than one cent.” Coinbase’s revenue strategy and market expansion Brian laid out Coinbase’s 2025 priorities: driving revenue, expanding crypto utility, and scaling its infrastructure. The company’s trading, staking, and stablecoin businesses each pulled in over $700 million in 2024, and it is adding new features to grow those numbers in 2025. Coinbase is also expanding derivative trading and plans to support millions of tokens by integrating decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Brian said, “We’re adding best-in-class derivative trading support for customers that are power users or sensitive on fees.” Another important business area is Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), which Brian compared to Amazon Web Services (AWS). “This is what Amazon did with AWS, allowing our infrastructure to be utilized by third-party companies,” Brian said. He believes this could become a major revenue stream as more businesses integrate crypto APIs for custody, trading, staking, and payments. The company’s subscription service, Coinbase One, now has 600,000 paying subscribers. Brian described it as “Amazon Prime for crypto”, saying, “It creates a sticky customer. Once they become a Coinbase One member, they do more trading volume with us.” The service offers zero-fee trading, improved rewards, and premium support, which Coinbase says will help lock in users. Alesia jumped in to explain that international expansion as another revenue driver. Just last December, Coinbase secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider license in Argentina and the UK and is working on a MiCA license in Europe. Brian pointed out that Coinbase now has a repeatable playbook for entering new markets. “Every market we entered two years ago—Brazil, Canada, Australia, Singapore—has already become profitable.” Coinbase’s next steps and future priorities With a war chest of $9 billion, Coinbase is looking at acquisitions too. Alesia described the company as “the most acquisitive in crypto” and said it evaluates deals based on customer growth, new licenses, and talent acquisition. “We have always had an appetite for M&A. And it’s in support of our product road map and is in support of: Can we add customers? Can we add assets? Can we add products? Can we add licenses? Can we add talent? And so the tuck-ins that you mentioned, we’re really pleased to find opportunities to add talent that can accelerate our product roadmap,” Alesia said. Coinbase is also strengthening its policy efforts. The company’s StandWithCrypto.org now has 2 million voters advocating for pro-crypto candidates, with a goal of 4 million by midterm elections in America next year. Brian said, “We’re going to continue to donate to Fairshake, the Super PAC that had excellent results in the last election.” Looking ahead, Brian said the biggest challenge is focus. “We have too many opportunities in front of us to pursue simultaneously.” Alesia agreed, saying, “We need to make sure we are marching towards our biggest priorities and not getting distracted.” Brian then told shareholders, “And so we try not to get caught up in the hype, but we also try not to get caught up in any despair when it happens in crypto. And right now, I’d say we’re more in like danger of being in hype. It’s a very positive moment. And so we’re just being very deliberate about how we grow this business, how we allocate capital to the next year.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $635 resistance. BNB price is moving higher above the $585 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $595 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $600 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $588 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Surge After forming a base above the $550 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $565 and $570 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $588 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $637 swing high to the $548 low. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $600 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. However, the bears seem to be active near the $605 and $606 levels. The price is now trading above $600 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $606 level. The next resistance sits near the $616 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $637 swing high to the $548 low. A clear move above the $616 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $635. A close above the $634 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $665 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $606 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $600 level. The next major support is near the $595 level. The main support sits at $588. If there is a downside break below the $588 support, the price could drop toward the $570 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.

Forget waiting for Bitcoin to double in five years. The real game is in fast-moving, community-driven tokens with explosive potential. Enter BTFD Coin, Gigachad, and Ponke—three meme coins you need to have on your radar right now. BTFD Coin’s presale is in full swing, with the Bulls stampeding toward the finish line. Over $6.26 million has already been raised, with Stage 14 nearly sold out. That means two things: 1) You need to move FAST, and 2) There’s still time to double your tokens using the LAUNCH100 bonus code . But don’t blink, or you might miss it. It’s time to break down why this meme coin (and its wild Bulls Squad) is leading the pack, and why Gigachad and Ponke are also worth a serious look. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad’s Charge Toward Crypto Glory You know what they say—Buy The Dip. That’s exactly what BTFD Coin is all about: taking advantage of opportunities when others hesitate. And right now? This is one of those moments. Stage 14 of the presale is almost sold out, and once it hits the exchanges, analysts predict an opening price of $0.0006, with moonshot potential to $0.006—that’s a jaw-dropping 3650% ROI if you get in now at $0.00016. The Bulls Squad: Your Crypto Hype Team Picture this: You’ve got $3,000 sitting in your wallet, wondering where to go. Enter the Bulls Squad—a team of four mascots designed to hype up the BTFD ecosystem. Baby Bull is all about growth, stacking your early investment into serious gains. Raging Bull rides the market waves with power moves. Nerdy Bull breaks down the data so you don’t have to, and Peoples Bull? He’s the ultimate community leader, keeping the Bulls united. Now, do some math (don’t worry, Nerdy Bull’s got you covered). $3,000 at today’s presale price ($0.00016) gets you 18.75 million BTFD tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that stash turns into $11,250. If it rockets to $0.006? You’re looking at $112,500. Not bad for a meme coin backed by a rock-solid community and an insane 100% bonus using the LAUNCH100 code. BTFD’s Secret Weapon: Staking & Play-to-Earn BTFD has an actual ecosystem that rewards investors at every corner. Staking rewards? 90% APY . A Play-to-Earn game? Yep, and it feeds right back into the BTFD economy. Plus, in a bearish market, securing a low-entry price during presale is a genius move. This presale is closing fast. Don’t sleep on this opportunity—BUY NOW. Gigachad: The Alpha Energy of Crypto If you’ve spent any time online, you know the Gigachad meme—the epitome of confidence and dominance. That’s exactly what the Gigachad crypto project is all about. Trading at $0.018203 with a market cap of over $169 million, Gigachad has carved out a space for itself with a meme-backed identity that screams power. With a maximum supply of 10 billion tokens and only 9.3 billion in circulation, scarcity could drive the price higher. The last 24 hours have been a bit red, but if you’re a true Gigachad, you know that dips are where the magic happens. If you’re looking for the best cryptos for beginners with established credibility, high liquidity, and a devoted following, Gigachad is a strong bet. Ponke: The Meme Coin with the Tightest Community Community is everything in meme coin culture, and Ponke has it locked down. With a market cap of $65 million and a circulating supply of 555.5 million tokens, this one is all about holding strong and growing together. Ponke’s price is sitting at $0.117658, and with a 24-hour trading volume of over $8 million, it’s clear the market is watching. This token is driven by a dedicated army of holders who believe in the long-term value of the Ponke ecosystem. If you’re after a meme coin that thrives on trust, stability, and long-term momentum, Ponke could be your pick. Claiming the BTFD Coin 100% Bonus: Here’s How Visit the presale page .

The cycle repeats itself, time and time again, with a level of predictability that borders on comforting. A meme coin takes off, a new wave of speculation follows, and the game resets. Now, we find ourselves at the start of another cycle. Doge Uprising ($DUP) is surging as its presale gains momentum, while Pudgy Penguins and Peanut the Squirrel steady themselves and try to stop the bleeding from last week. Which of these projects can turn speculative enthusiasm into something more substantial? Doge Uprising ($DUP): The Rising Power If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you know that meme coins are about more than just memes. The most successful projects tap into something deeper, something that extends beyond speculative trading and into the psychology of belonging. Doge Uprising understands this. Presale buyers are moving in quickly, and the demand is heating up as prices rise in each stage. Then there’s the 30% staking rewards, making $DUP not just a meme coin but an ecosystem that rewards long-term holders. A dystopian narrative that keeps engagement levels high—because storytelling, as much as tokenomics, drives the best crypto plays. A great meme coin needs to create its own gravity, a reason for people to stay. Doge Uprising is proving that it understands this game better than most. Pudgy Penguins: The Blue-Chip Meme Project That Refuses to Die There was a time when Pudgy Penguins NFTs were the underdog, the long shot, the unexpected breakout. Now, though, the brand is established, and the Pudgy narrative remains one of resilience rather than meteoric rise. It certainly needs its resilience this week after an 18% drop, which compounds its 88% fall from a peak of $0.05738. Pudgy Penguins’ belligerent holders hope and pray that it won’t fade away anytime soon. Regardless, the real high-reward plays aren’t found in established projects, no matter how they’re faring—they’re found in projects on the rise. Peanut the Squirrel: A Wild Card in the Meme Market Every meme coin needs a gimmick. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) has one, and it’s exactly what you’d expect. The narrative here is simple: Squirrels hoard nuts, traders hoard tokens. It’s the kind of self-aware absurdity that crypto traders eat up. And to be fair, PNUT has a shot at becoming a sleeper hit. Compared to all the red seen across the market this week, PNUT has flown back up almost 20%. It’s small-cap and under the radar, which means the room for growth is substantial. It plays into the accumulation meme—perfect for a market addicted to narratives. But it lacks the structured mechanics of Doge Uprising, meaning its success is purely hype-dependent. Why Doge Uprising Has the Edge in 2025 The difference between a coin that pumps and a coin that lasts is utility. That’s where Doge Uprising pulls ahead. $DUP offers staking rewards, something neither Pudgy Penguins nor Peanut the Squirrel provides. $DUP has a structured presale, meaning early buyers aren’t left to battle whales post-launch. The crypto market moves fast, and new meme coins rise overnight. But Doge Uprising is making all the right moves at the right time, and that could make all the difference. Can Memes Make 100x Dreams?

The payments firm recently announced the National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA), a nonprofit aimed at educating the public about digital assets, with Ripple contributing $50 million in funding. Meanwhile, comments from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, reaffirming the company’s right to sell XRP for operational purposes have sparked debate among investors. Ripple’s XRP Sales Spark Investor Concerns Amid CTO’s Blunt Remarks Ripple Labs’ right to sell XRP tokens for operational capital has become a heated topic after the company’s chief technology officer (CTO), David Schwartz, confirmed that the company is not obligated to act in investors’ interests. His remarks, coupled with recent discoveries of massive XRP reserves linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, have stirred uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. The debate was ignited when Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, raised concerns about Ripple’s freedom to offload XRP tokens without obligation to token holders. In a March 5 post on X, Rochard wrote, “XRP isn’t a security because Ripple doesn’t actually owe you ‘utility’ or anything else.” “They are free to dump on you and you have no right to do anything about it other than join them in dumping XRP,” he warned, adding that investors should recognize they are “not investing in Ripple,” but rather receiving tokens “created out of thin air” with no guaranteed value. Rather than refuting Rochard’s claims, Ripple CTO David Schwartz—known by the online alias “JoelKatz”—surprised many by agreeing with the sentiment. He affirmed that Ripple has no obligation to XRP holders beyond its own business goals. “100% correct. IMO, Ripple can, will, and should act in its own interest,” Schwartz wrote. “You should not expect Ripple to act in your interest to the detriment of its own interest or those of its shareholders.” The blunt acknowledgment from a top executive has unsettled some investors, who fear that Ripple’s continued sales of XRP could exert downward pressure on the token’s price. Historically, large XRP sales by Ripple have sparked price declines, as increased token supply dilutes demand. Investor anxiety escalated further after blockchain investigator ZachXBT disclosed a previously dormant XRP wallet valued at over $7 billion. The massive holdings, potentially linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, have raised questions about the long-term intentions of early XRP stakeholders. “With the announcement of the US Crypto Reserve, here’s your reminder that XRP addresses activated by Chris Larsen still hold 2.7B+ XRP ($7.18B), and these addresses tied to him transferred $109M+ worth of XRP to exchanges in January 2025,” ZachXBT revealed in a March 3 Telegram post . While some XRP supporters believe Larsen may no longer have access to these funds—since most of the wallets have been inactive for over six years—others worry about the potential market impact if such a vast amount of XRP is sold. XRP’s Short-Lived Rally Amid Trump’s Crypto Reserve Proposal Despite the concerns surrounding Ripple’s XRP holdings, the token recently saw a price surge following news that US President Donald Trump had directed his Working Group on Digital Assets to include XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) in a proposed US strategic crypto reserve, alongside Bitcoin. The announcement triggered a temporary rally in the altcoin market, with XRP climbing to a high of $2.99 on March 2. However, the enthusiasm quickly faded, with the token retreating to $2.50 at the time of writing. Market analysts remain cautious about the sustainability of the rally, citing the need for congressional approval before any US government crypto reserve can be established. Aurelie Barthere, a principal research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, noted that the process could be prolonged and complex. “I think constituting a reserve by buying new tokens is a complex process that will need Congress’s vote, so it will take time. I would be a bit wary of the sustainability of today’s move,” Barthere said. As Ripple continues to assert its right to sell XRP for operational purposes, investor sentiment appears divided. On one hand, Ripple’s ability to generate liquidity through token sales helps sustain its operations and fund ecosystem developments. On the other, persistent sell pressure from Ripple and early stakeholders risks undermining long-term investor confidence in XRP. With regulatory scrutiny still looming over Ripple’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and questions surrounding the company’s influence over XRP’s supply, traders remain wary of future volatility. As the debate unfolds, the key takeaway from Schwartz’s comments is clear: Ripple will always act in its own interest. Whether that aligns with the interests of XRP holders is another matter entirely. Ripple Launches National Cryptocurrency Association With $50M Grant to Promote Crypto Education In related news, Ripple Labs has announced its involvement in launching a new nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public about cryptocurrency’s role in empowering individuals and businesses. The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) aims to provide accessible information on crypto adoption and ensure Americans stay informed about developments in the sector. The announcement, made on March 5 via X by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, revealed that he will serve as president of the nonprofit while continuing his legal duties at Ripple. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse further disclosed that the blockchain payments firm would fund the NCA with an initial $50-million grant to support its educational initiatives. According to the NCA’s official website, the organization has been established to help Americans understand cryptocurrency by sharing real-world adoption stories. While the group did not explicitly state any plans to directly engage in politics, it emphasized the importance of keeping the public informed about upcoming changes in the crypto industry. Despite these claims, Ripple has recently become increasingly active in political contributions, particularly in the United States. The company contributed $45 million to Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC) focused on influencing voter sentiment in the 2024 election cycle. Alderoty also personally donated $300,000 to a committee backing Donald Trump, further fueling speculation about Ripple’s political involvement. Additionally, both Alderoty and Garlinghouse met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January and later attended his inauguration events in Washington, DC, as official guests. The NCA is registered as a 501(c)(4) organization, a classification under US law that allows unlimited corporate and personal donations while remaining exempt from donor disclosure requirements. These types of organizations are often used for lobbying, issue advocacy, and political engagement, raising questions about whether the NCA could eventually take on a more political role in the crypto industry. The timing of the NCA’s launch coincides with major developments in the US regulatory landscape regarding cryptocurrency firms. Under Trump’s administration, the SEC has ended several high-profile enforcement actions, including lawsuits against Coinbase, Cumberland DRW, and Consensys. However, Ripple remains in legal limbo as the SEC continues to pursue its appeal in a $125-million judgment against the firm. While many crypto-related cases have been dropped, Ripple’s legal battle remains unresolved, making its recent political engagements and the formation of the NCA even more significant. XRP’s Role in the National Crypto Stockpile Proposal As Ripple navigates its ongoing legal battle, its ties to the Trump administration continue to deepen. CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed his attendance at a March 7 crypto summit at the White House, where discussions on the future of digital assets will take place. Perhaps most notably, Trump announced that XRP would be one of five cryptocurrencies included in the proposed “national crypto stockpile.” While the proposal has drawn enthusiasm from XRP supporters, many legal experts question its feasibility and legality. Critics argue that Congress would need to approve any such reserve, and government involvement in selecting specific cryptocurrencies could raise concerns over favoritism and regulatory overreach. Ripple’s moves in the political and regulatory spheres suggest a shift from being a blockchain payments firm to a major crypto policy influencer. Through the National Cryptocurrency Association, the company is positioning itself as an advocate for crypto education and regulatory clarity in the US. With a $50-million funding boost, the NCA has the potential to become a significant voice in shaping public perception and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency. However, its political undertones, ties to Trump, and Ripple’s ongoing SEC battle ensure that the organization’s true intentions will remain a topic of intense debate in the months ahead. As Ripple continues to assert its influence over crypto policy and regulation, the impact of the NCA and its broader implications for the future of digital assets in the US will be closely watched.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-06 05:30:00

Most new cryptocurrency users adopt centralized exchanges for coin storage, and their reasons are understandable. For instance, crypto exchanges are most users’ gateway into the crypto industry. They serve purposes like providing options to buy and trade cryptos easily. However, it is crucial to understand the inherent risks of leaving one’s crypto assets on such exchanges. Why Users Choose Centralized Exchanges Apart from buying and trading cryptos, most centralized exchanges provide extended services that benefit crypto users. Staking, lending, margin trading, and consistent liquidity represent some features that attract crypto users to centralized exchanges. Such users store their assets in custodial wallets on the exchanges to make it easy for them to carry out their activities.

Trump’s Reserve Plans On Sunday, President Trump shared some plans for the reserve on social media. He revealed that the reserve would include alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, SOL, and ADA. Trump later clarified that BTC and ETH, being valuable, would be the main focus of the Reserve.

In parallel, a heated debate over crypto regulation and national security unfolded in Congress, with Representative Sean Casten warning of crypto’s role in illicit finance, while Representative Warren Davidson pushed back by arguing for financial privacy. US Sanctions Darknet Marketplace Operator The United States imposed sanctions on Behrouz Parsarad, which is an Iran-based operator of the now-defunct darknet marketplace Nemesis, along with his cryptocurrency addresses, which recently benefited from Bitcoin price fluctuations. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on March 4 that Parsarad established Nemesis in 2021, and used it as a platform to facilitate the sale of drugs, false identification documents, hacking resources, and other illicit services catering to cybercriminals. (Source: US Department of The Treasury ) With the sanctions in place, US citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with Parsarad or any companies where he has more than a 50% stake. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the sanctioned assets include 44 Bitcoin and five Monero addresses that received more than $850,000 between July of 2022 and March of 2024. The total volume of cryptocurrency handled by Parsarad is estimated to exceed $1.6 million, largely due to price appreciation over time. The majority of Parsarad’s crypto transactions were tied to Nemesis, but he also sent over $12,000 to various darknet marketplaces like ASAP Market, Incognito Market, and Next Generation. His activities also showed indirect exposure to cryptocurrency mixers, which is a method often used to obscure the origin of illicit funds. OFAC revealed that before a joint US, German, and Lithuanian law enforcement operation shut down Nemesis and seized its servers in March 2024, the marketplace grew to host 30,000 active users and 1,000 vendors. The platform had built-in money laundering features that allowed criminals to conduct transactions with relative anonymity. (Source: Chainalysis ) In addition to providing a hub for cybercriminals, Parsarad was actively involved in laundering virtual currencies for narcotics traffickers and other illicit actors operating on Nemesis, according to OFAC. Authorities estimate that he amassed millions of dollars throughout the marketplace’s existence. Despite law enforcement actions, he reportedly continued efforts to re-establish his operations. While Western law enforcement agencies have cracked down on darknet marketplaces, the ecosystem is still highly active. TRM Labs’ 2025 Crypto Crime Report estimates that darknet markets generated more than $1.7 billion in revenue in 2024. This was only a slight increase from the previous year. Russian-language darknet marketplaces continue to dominate, benefiting from limited enforcement action by Russian authorities, while Western darknet markets face growing instability. The start of 2024 saw multiple high-profile exit scams , including the sudden disappearances of Bohemia Market and Cannabia Market in January, which Dutch authorities later linked to an ongoing investigation. In March, Incognito Market also collapsed under suspicious circumstances, with its administrator ”Pharoah” allegedly attempting to extort users before shutting down the platform. Despite the enforcement efforts and operational disruptions in Western markets, darknet marketplaces are very resilient, with new actors constantly trying to fill the void left by shuttered platforms. US Customs Releases Seized Bitcoin Miners US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reportedly began releasing Chinese-made crypto mining equipment after months of detainment at various ports of entry. According to Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, thousands of mining units have been released after the seizure of up to 10,000 units. Kulyk suggested that some CBP officials were intentionally creating obstacles for the Bitcoin mining sector. Ethan Vera , chief operating officer at Luxor Technology, confirmed that while some shipments were being released, the majority remained held. The delays primarily affected Bitmain Antminer application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and were reportedly linked to a US Department of Commerce investigation into Bitmain-related chip designer Sophgo. The investigation began in October when chips ordered by Sophgo in Taiwan were found in a Huawei AI processor. Huawei has been under US sanctions since 2019, though Sophgo denied having any business ties with the Chinese tech giant. Despite these issues, ASICs from other Chinese manufacturers were not affected by CBP’s actions. Some companies faced financial strain because of the prolonged detainment. One firm even reported in November that it accumulated over $200,000 in holding fees for 200 ASICs that are still awaiting release. The CBP’s actions were reportedly carried out at the request of the US Federal Communications Commission Agency, which only added another layer of regulatory scrutiny to the situation. (Source: Blockspace ) The release of the miners is happening during the Trump administration’s ongoing trade policies, including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. The administration's trade measures with Canada and Mexico are also proceeding as planned. Given that China supplies 98% of the chips used in crypto mining, the disruption in shipments posed very major concerns for the industry. Bitmain, which is the largest manufacturer of these chips, has since expanded its production into the US to mitigate future delivery issues, with hopes of strengthening partnerships in the sector. The United States still plays a dominant role in global Bitcoin mining operations, with almost 38% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate originating from the country. Additionally, four of the most valuable Bitcoin mining firms—MARA Holdings, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, and Riot Platforms—are based in the US. US Lawmakers Clash Over Crypto and National Security In the middle of these sanctions developments, US Representative Sean Casten expressed his concerns that crypto-friendly regulations pose a national security threat. Casten made this statement during a March 5 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee , while debating the “Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act of 2025.” He accused President Donald Trump and Elon Musk of weakening anti-money laundering laws and financial surveillance measures. He also argued that the proposed crypto regulations will make it nearly impossible to trace the origins of funds being transferred, and claimed that all ransomware attacks in the United States are funded by cryptocurrency . Casten even criticized his colleagues for advocating policies that will reduce oversight and make illicit financial activities easier to conduct. Representative Casten His comments drew a lot of criticism from pro-crypto Representative Warren Davidson, who pushed back against Casten’s stance. Davidson accused Casten of advocating for a surveillance state and argued that the US should not follow China’s example in regulating financial transactions. He urged lawmakers to uphold constitutional principles rather than expand government control over financial activities. The debate over financial surveillance happened during broader concerns about government overreach and digital privacy. In April of 2024, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden warned that the agency was on the verge of expanding its control over the internet. He pointed to changes in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the ambiguous definition of “electronic communications surveillance provider,” which he argued could compel people working with service providers to act as government surveillance agents. Snowden has long been critical of centralized digital systems and in November 2024, he called for decentralization as a safeguard against the dangers of concentrated digital power, including artificial intelligence. David Holtzman , a former military intelligence officer and chief strategy officer at Naoris, echoed Snowden’s warnings in December 2024. Holtzman argued that AI-driven surveillance poses an unprecedented threat to privacy and human freedom, and stated that decentralization is the only effective countermeasure against the rise of authoritarian digital control.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-06 05:36:19

However, it looks poised for a retracement but is yet to chart gains today. Doge went through a serious breakdown last week and charted a double-digit loss. It later managed to round up the week on a strong note after a bounce back from a low of $0.183. The primary meme coin encountered resistance and crossed into the new week bearish. It lost momentum but later reestablished support above the recent low due to a rejection. This led to a bounce and is now looking poised for a buy following a notable increase in the last 24 hours. A retracement movement is slowly underway. However, Doge’s bearish swing is still intact on the daily chart following a lower low and lower high movement from its peak level of $0.49. The potential retracement movement should bring a slight relief. Failure to push higher could bring another impulsive movement in the form of a lower low. This could lead to an extension of the bearish swing, which might cause another serious bleeding in the mid-term. While the bulls are yet to gain control of this market, the price must climb back above the previous monthly high before considering a shift in the trend. Having lost 52% in 90 days, Doge is currently indecisive. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview There has been little-to-no movement since the start of today. A surge from the current trading level could bring a retest at $0.24. Higher levels for a retracement are $0.305 and $0.4. Towards the downside, the $0.183 level is providing support. A crack from there may cause another roller coaster to $0.16 and maybe $0.13. Key Resistance Levels: $0.24, $0.305, $0.4 Key Support Levels: $0.183, $0.16, $0.13 Spot Price: $0.2 Trend: Bearish Volatility:Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On Mar. 2, Trump directed the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to create a reserve comprising key cryptocurrencies. While initial reports highlighted assets like Ripple ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ), Trump later clarified that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum would be central to the initiative. The move has sparked controversy, with some claiming that the reserve may increase the value of assets owned by Trump and his associates. According to reports, Trump and his cronies own more than 60% of WLFI, which raises questions regarding a potential conflict of interest. However, The Trump Organization claims that the president has distanced himself from commercial activities and has denied any misconduct. His children, a separate ethics attorney, and an outside investment firm currently supervise WLFI’s management. Despite these assurances, watchdog groups remain skeptical, pointing to past instances where Trump’s business and political interests appeared intertwined.

Now, imagine there’s a new highway built just for you—no traffic, no delays, just smooth sailing. That’s Avalanche (AVAX) in the world of crypto. It’s designed to be faster, cheaper, and more scalable than many of its competitors, including Ethereum. But does it live up to the hype? Let’s dive into everything you need to know about Avalanche. What is Avalanche? Avalanche is a blockchain platform that’s designed for speed, low transaction fees, and scalability. Think of it as Ethereum’s faster, younger cousin. It allows developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and even launch their own blockchains (subnets) while keeping everything running smoothly. It was built to solve some of the biggest problems in crypto: slow transaction speeds, high fees, and network congestion. Ethereum, for example, sometimes struggles with high fees and slow transactions during peak times. Avalanche aims to fix that by offering near-instant finality and extremely low costs. At its core, Avalanche has its own cryptocurrency called AVAX. It’s used for staking, paying fees, and securing the network. But the real magic of Avalanche lies in its unique structure. Unlike traditional blockchains, Avalanche operates on three different blockchains, each with a specific purpose. We’ll get into how that works in a bit. History of Avalanche Avalanche was created by Ava Labs, a company founded by Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell University professor and blockchain expert. The project started in 2018, and by 2020, it officially launched. Here’s a quick timeline: 2018 – The Avalanche consensus mechanism was first introduced by a team of researchers. 2019 – Ava Labs raised funding and started working on the network. 2020 – Avalanche launched its mainnet, making it publicly available. 2021 – Avalanche gained massive traction, with AVAX’s price skyrocketing and partnerships forming. Since then, it has become one of the top blockchains, attracting developers, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts. History of Avalanche 2018 – The Avalanche consensus mechanism was first introduced. 2019 – Ava Labs raised funding and started working. 2020 – Avalanche launched its mainnet. 2021 – Avalanche gained massive traction. How Does Avalanche Work? Unlike traditional blockchains, Avalanche doesn’t rely on a single chain. Instead, it uses three different chains to improve efficiency: X-Chain (Exchange Chain) – This handles asset creation and transfers, similar to how Bitcoin is used for transactions. C-Chain (Contract Chain) – This is where smart contracts are executed, making it compatible with Ethereum’s DApps. P-Chain (Platform Chain) – This manages validators and helps create custom subnets (individual blockchains). Why does this matter? Because by splitting tasks between these chains, Avalanche avoids congestion, making transactions super fast and cheap. For example, Ethereum processes around 15 transactions per second (TPS). Avalanche? It can handle over 4,500 TPS. That’s a game-changer. Advantages of Avalanche Avalanche has some major advantages that make it stand out: Speed – Transactions settle in less than two seconds. No more waiting for minutes or even hours. Low Fees – Compared to Ethereum’s sometimes ridiculous gas fees, Avalanche keeps costs low. Scalability – The network doesn’t slow down even when usage increases. Ethereum Compatibility – Developers can easily move their projects from Ethereum to Avalanche. Security – Avalanche’s unique consensus mechanism makes it more resistant to attacks. Eco-Friendly – Unlike Bitcoin, which uses proof-of-work (PoW), Avalanche uses proof-of-stake (PoS), which is much more energy-efficient. Disadvantages of Avalanche Competition – Ethereum, Solana, and others are also working on scalability solutions. Centralization Concerns – Some critics argue that a small number of validators control most of the AVAX supply. Adoption – While growing, it still needs more developers and projects to truly compete with Ethereum. Is Avalanche a Good Investment? This is the big question: should you invest in AVAX? Like any crypto, AVAX has had its ups and downs. It saw huge gains in 2021, reaching an all-time high of around $146. However, it also faced major corrections. Here’s why some investors are bullish: Strong technology – Avalanche’s speed and low fees make it attractive for DApps. Growing ecosystem – More projects are launching on Avalanche. Institutional interest – Big players are taking notice. But there are risks too: Crypto volatility – Prices can swing wildly. Regulatory uncertainty – Governments may crack down on crypto. Competition – Ethereum and others aren’t standing still. If you believe in Avalanche’s long-term potential, it could be a solid investment. But always do your research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Is Avalanche a Good Investment? Here’s why some investors are bullish: Strong technology Growing ecosystem Institutional interest But there are risks too: Crypto volatility Regulatory uncertainty Competition The Future of Avalanche Avalanche has a bright future, but it won’t be an easy ride. Here’s what could happen next: More Adoption – If more developers and institutions join, Avalanche could challenge Ethereum. Better Upgrades – Avalanche continues to improve its scalability and security. Stronger Partnerships – More collaborations could boost its ecosystem. Price Growth? – If demand increases, AVAX could see price appreciation. Of course, nothing is guaranteed in crypto. Avalanche has potential, but it also faces challenges. Final Thoughts Avalanche is like the high-speed train of the crypto world. It’s fast, efficient, and designed to handle huge amounts of traffic without slowing down. If you’re into crypto, it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on. Will it replace Ethereum? Maybe not. But will it play a major role in the future of blockchain? Very likely. So, whether you’re an investor, developer, or just curious about crypto, Avalanche is one name you should know. FAQs What is Avalanche (AVAX) and how does it work? Avalanche is a fast, low-cost blockchain using three chains (X-Chain, C-Chain, P-Chain) to improve scalability and efficiency. How is Avalanche different from Ethereum? Avalanche is faster (4,500 TPS vs. Ethereum’s 15 TPS), has lower fees, and supports subnets for custom blockchains. Is AVAX a good investment? AVAX has strong tech, growing adoption, and institutional interest but faces risks like volatility and competition. What is the future of Avalanche?

He said that the NWF’s savings level did not allow considering risky investments such as crypto, which he said were ‘too volatile’. The deputy Finance Minister confirmed that the NWF would maintain its current regulatory structure, which included 60% yuan and 40% gold. Kolychev also added that he had not heard of any discussions about creating a strategic crypto reserve in Russia. He emphasized the importance to Russia–from the point of view of sovereign budget reserves–that the assets invested in these reserves could be sold very ‘quickly and without a large price revaluation.’ Russia to retain investment strategy for the National Welfare Fund Vladimir Korechev, 🇷🇺 Deputy Minister of Finance, told the media on March 4 that the Ministry does not consider or intend to use crypto as an investment tool for the national welfare fund, because of volatility. The main reserves are still RMB and gold — David Lee (@DavidLe76335983) March 5, 2025 Kolychev revealed that the Russian Finance Ministry had no immediate plans to buy or hold any crypto assets as part of the NWF’s investments but has claimed that this could change if a key condition is met. He said that it was premature to talk about the possibility of including crypto assets, which he considered to be too volatile and risky. The deputy minister explained that the NWF’s liquid funds should be topped up to 7-10% of Russia’s GDP before Moscow considers buying ‘riskier’ assets like crypto. After that, investing NWF funds in less liquid and more profitable assets would be possible. However, Kolychev also pointed out that Russia was ‘still far’ from reaching its desired levels of diversified reserve portfolios, which was why Moscow only bought gold and yuan reserves for the time being. He maintained that he had not caught wind of any discussions about creating a Russian crypto reserve, similar to what President Trump’s administration had conceived in the United States. “When we get there, we will be able to think about different assets, including crypto. However, for now, the volatility signs are not favorable.” – Vladimir Kolychev President Trump signed an executive order in February ordering the creation of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) within the next year, hinting that it could potentially buy TikTok. Trump told reporters that the U.S. was ‘going to create a lot of wealth for fund’ although the executive order’s text was sparse on details, simply directing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to submit a plan for ‘such a fund within 90 days’, including recommendations on funding mechanisms, investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model. Russia remains skeptical about a strategic crypto reserve According to Kolychev, the Russian Central Bank will make the final decisions on including crypto in the NWF reserve. However, the Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina is reportedly a known crypto-skeptic who has attempted several times to orchestrate a total China-style ban on crypto in Russia. The Russian government ruled out the possibility of a strategic crypto reserve back in December 2024, noting that it would take a cautious stance and wait for other nations to take the lead in buying Bitcoin (crypto). Anton Siluanov, the Russian Finance Minister, stated that the country would be ‘better off keeping its powder dry.’ Siluanov told a Financial University student audience that ‘the issue of creating a crypto reserve could be considered in the future’ but added that the matter was not currently ‘on the table’. He pointed out that Russia did not take those kinds of risks despite the Americans talking about building a national Bitcoin reserve now. VanEck analysts estimated that the U.S. could cut its debt by 35% by 2049 if Washington starts buying Bitcoin. U.S. lawmakers have already ‘set the stage’ for the SBR by crafting bills that would prepare the legal framework for such a state and/or federal investment. Russian lawmakers have also reportedly urged their government to act fast to keep up with Washington. However, Siluanov said that ‘maybe someday’ the Russian government ‘will come around to the idea.’ Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Following the announcement, Arbitrum’s price soared 12.98% to $0.4258.

Another positive catalyst is that Arbitrum formed a falling wedge pattern, which is made up of two falling and converging trendlines. These two lines are nearing their confluence levels, signaling a potential rebound that can push the Arbitrum price to $1.2470. On-chain data among layer-2 networks | Source: Artemis Meanwhile, on-chain data from Artemis suggests that traders jumped on the recent news, with daily transactions climbing 25% to 2.8 million over the past week. The top three most active addresses appear to be linked to Tether’s and Circle’s smart contracts, hinting at increased stablecoin conversions, which might signal traders’ willingness to take advantage of the price movement. What is ARB Founded in 2016 by Steven Goldfeder, Harry Kalodner, and Joshua Goldfeder, Arbitrum is a layer-2 blockchain designed to help Ethereum handle more transactions at lower costs. It addresses Ethereum’s high fees and congestion by offloading some processing and data storage from the main Ethereum network. Since Ethereum’s smart contract execution requires nodes to process every step, transaction costs can quickly add up. By handling some of this work off-chain, Arbitrum aims to reduce congestion, offering lower fees, and improving overall efficiency.

The XRP price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP price has surged 2.79% in 24-hours to $2.51, with trading volumes at $5.63B. Ripple’s XRP finally neared the long-awaited $3 mark after President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President announced a new U.S. strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP and other digital assets . Also, a number of SEC cases that had cast doubt on the future of leading cryptocurrency companies have been dropped, giving hope for a favorable outcome in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. Amid this, Brazil’s securities regulator has approved the first spot XRP ETF , indicating a rising demand from institutions. After the US SEC acknowledged an XRP ETF filing by Grayscale and the NYSE, top analysts are predicting that the XRP price might hit $10 if it gets approved. Considering all these positive developments, our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “ Will XRP reach $10 in 2025? ” by providing short term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $2.46 Market Cap $141.02 billion Trading Volume $14.24 billion Circulating Supply 57.94 billion XRP All-time High $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time Low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 24-hour high $2.95 24-hour low $2.43 XRP Price Analysis XRP price at the time of press is changing hands at $2.51 with a gain of 2.79% over the previous day. If the bullish momentum sustains, XRP could eye at its next resistance levels at $2.65 followed by one at $2.80. Overcoming which, the doors would open for the $3 milestone. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, XRP price will remain range bound between its key support levels at $2.25 and $2.30. XRP Price Prediction 2025 A few factors will likely shape XRP’s market performance in 2025. The main factor that will decide XRP’s trend in 2025 is the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . Successively, analysts are expecting a resolution in March, considering that the SEC has dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. However, there’s more in store, as the U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned XRP being included in the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. Moreover, Ripple and Ondo Finance will be bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to XRPL, to improve speed, efficiency, and adoption by institutions. Adding to this, backed by BlackRock, OUSG has expanded to XRPL to provide spot settlement and lower costs for institutions. If things go in favor of Ripple, XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness a strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market.

He argues that government control over digital assets could undermine decentralization. Notably, his statement follows reports that Ripple allegedly pitched Solana (SOL) as part of a national reserve to justify XRP’s inclusion. This debate unfolds just ahead of the US Crypto Summit on March 8, an event gaining traction after Donald Trump’s recent crypto policy remarks. Solana Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko On US Strategic Reserve Anatoly Yakovenko recently shared his views on X, listing his preference for handling a strategic reserve. Yakovenko strongly believes the best approach is to have no reserve at all. According to the Solana co-founder, government oversight of crypto could spell disaster for decentralization, contradicting the core principles of blockchain technology. However, as a secondary option, he suggests that individual states, rather than the federal government, could manage their own Strategic Reserves. This, he believes, would act as a hedge against potential mistakes by the US Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, if a US Strategic reserve is inevitable, Yakovenko emphasizes that it should be based on measurable and rational criteria. He points out that such benchmarks could even favor Bitcoin, but stresses the need for objectivity. Ripple’s Alleged Push For SOL in US Reserve Anatoly Yakovenko’s statement comes in response to a recent report alleging that Ripple promoted Solana’s inclusion in the US Strategic Reserve. According to sources, the move was an attempt to make XRP’s inclusion seem more legitimate. This revelation has sparked debate within the crypto community, raising concerns about lobbying efforts in shaping national crypto policies. With Ripple’s ongoing legal battles and its push for regulatory clarity, the company’s reported strategy is drawing mixed reactions. Some see it as a practical approach to gaining government recognition, while others argue it could lead to favoritism in the crypto space. Besides, the Solana co-founder’s comment also comes amid heating momentum between XRP community and Bitcoin maxis . The BTC advocates have long countered XRP’s inclusion in the US Strategic Reserve, criticizing Ripple and its executives of lobbying efforts. US Crypto Summit In Focus The discussion around a US Strategic Crypto Reserve gains momentum as the US Crypto Summit approaches. Scheduled for Friday, the event is expected to bring together President Trump, policymakers, industry leaders, and analysts to discuss the future of digital assets in the country. Meanwhile, Trump’s recent proposal to include SOL, XRP, and Cardano (ADA) in a national reserve has already stirred controversy. While his stance signals potential government support for crypto, it also raises questions about the implications for decentralization and regulatory oversight. Besides, the summit further gained traction as Donald Trump’s family project World Liberty Financial betted $20 million on Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. While some deem this a regular accumulation process, many market watchers anticipate something big to come at tomorrow’s US Crypto Summit.

He stressed that the experiment is only at the discussion stage at the Finance Ministry and Bank of Russia, however. The discussion has been underway for months. Russian Deputy Finance Minister and director of the ministry’s Financial Policy Department Alexei Yakovlev spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a financial forum held by the Expert RA credit rating agency. He said an experimental legal regime was under discussion that would allow certain Russian investors to trade cryptocurrency. Trading would be for the super-qualified Trading by super-qualified investors is under consideration. There is no definition of super-qualification, however. Yakovlev said, “Not necessarily banks, but more professional market participants. They could be physicists but with a very, very, very high level of qualification.” At present, a qualified investor in Russia has to have property valued at 12 million rubles ($133,111 at current rates), but that benchmark will be raised to 24 million rubles next year. Yakovlev said an experimental legal regime, super-qualified investors, and the elimination of risks are necessary before a proposal can be made to the government. So far, the idea is “in its infancy,” he added. Domestic trading is not a new idea The Russian government has long discussed crypto trading. International settlements using cryptocurrency are allowed on an experimental basis under legislation introduced in July. That legislation also foresaw experimental licensing of crypto exchanges or another trading system for “specially qualified” investors. In September, Yakovlev’s predecessor as Financial Policy Department director Ivan Chebeskov, stated , “We prefer an integrated approach without any experimental regimes because as much as you can experiment, the whole country is basically already doing it.” By contrast, Yakovlev said on March 5, “Allowing digital currency into domestic circulation is a completely different story and requires much more scrupulous work, which we are carrying out.” It is legal for Russian citizens to buy and own cryptocurrencies but not to trade them. Cryptocurrency exchanges are operating in Russia now, but they do so in a legal gray zone. State-run cryptocurrency exchanges have been proposed at existing exchanges in Moscow and St. Petersburg. International trading got a lukewarm reception International crypto settlement is a poor choice to help with sanctions evasion due to the transparency of blockchain technology, lawyer Alexander Nektorov told Kommersant newspaper. “It will be possible to track the chain of transactions on the blockchain, as well as, in some cases, establish the entity that owns the wallet used for cryptocurrency transactions,” he said. Nonetheless, Sberbank, VTB and Alfa-Bank, some of the country’s leading banks, have expressed interest in participating in the experiment. State-owned Sberbank also volunteered to be part of the domestic trading experiment. A Russian Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) has also been eyed as a way to get past the sanctions. Its launch has been delayed. CBDC is “often seen as a way to evade sanctions, columnist Taisiya Romanova told RBC, but “at the moment, there are simply no partners for it.” Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev told reporters on March 4 that Russia is not considering creating a cryptocurrency reserve like the United States. Crypto assets are too volatile, he explained. The National Welfare Fund, a sovereign wealth fund, is made up of 40% Chinese yuan and 60% gold. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Timing is everything in crypto, and knowing which projects have momentum can make all the difference. Let’s dive into the top contenders ready to take off. What Is The Best Crypto to Buy Right Now Finding the best crypto to buy right now means looking beyond the hype and identifying projects with real momentum.

Despite its humorous name, FartCoin is building momentum, and its presale is gaining traction every day. With over $1.2 million raised so far, it's on its way to its next milestone of $1.5 million. Currently priced at $0.00145, FartCoin offers a solid entry point before the price jumps to $0.00175. Analysts predict the launch price could hit $0.004, showcasing substantial upside potential for early investors. Unlike other meme coins that rely purely on social media, FartCoin adds value by engaging its community and creating a fun, interactive ecosystem.

Crypto trading can be a tricky business, with many investors chasing after the latest Bitcoin or volatile meme coins, only to face disappointing returns.

With the current presale price at $0.00313 and a projected launch price of $0.007, the potential for growth is undeniable.

Litecoin has been a key player in the crypto market for a long time, but a new rival, FXGuys, is drawing attention with its fresh take on DeFi besides in-house trading. FXGuys is now in Stage 3 of its pre-sale, priced at $0.05, and has collected more than $4 million. Many investors ask: Which of these two assets might best boost their investments? Litecoin’s Position in the Market Litecoin keeps its role as a quicker and more effective choice than Bitcoin. As one of the first digital coins, it holds a solid reputation, many users along with a loyal group. Its small fees plus fast transfers make it a favorite for payments. At press time, LTC price is at $102 with a market capitalization of over $7.7 billion. Even with its steadiness, Litecoin does not offer lively rewards or ways to share earnings like new projects such as FXGuys do. The FXGuys Advantage: A Revolutionary PropFi Project FXGuys is more than an altcoin. It stands as the leading PropFi project that connects decentralized finance with personal trading. With a special program that funds trading, FXGuys gives traders up to $500,000 in cash so they can try the financial markets without the risk of using their own money. This method attracts both experienced and new traders in search of funds, which makes FXGuys a tool that supports actual trading activity. A key aspect of FXGuys is its staking feature. When users commit the $FXG token, they earn a share of 20 % of profits plus fees from broker trades. This setup builds a steady flow of income and makes FXGuys one of the top DeFi tokens that offers clear benefits beyond mere hype over price changes. Institutional-Level Trading Without Barriers Unlike traditional proprietary trading firms, which often require extensive background checks and capital contributions, The FX Guys introduce a fully decentralized model with no KYC requirements. Traders can instantly fund their accounts using fiat (over 100 local currencies) or crypto, ensuring seamless participation. Additionally, instant funding prop firms typically have strict limitations, but FXGuys provides access to multiple trading platforms, including MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade, depending on geographic location. The Trade2Earn program further enhances the appeal of FXGuys by rewarding every trade with $FXG tokens, ensuring liquidity and consistent demand. This makes it an attractive option for those looking for high-potential altcoins that serve a functional purpose in the financial ecosystem. FXGuys vs. Litecoin: Which One Should You Choose? Litecoin remains a safe choice for investors who need steadiness, but its chance to grow is small compared to a new platform like FXGuys. Top trading companies want new ideas. FXGuys leads this turn, giving revenue-share stakes, trader cash support, and a broker-backed crypto trading group. With more people using it and planned rewards, FXGuys shows a better promise for those seeking high returns. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Final Thoughts For investors checking out crypto options, comparing FXGuys to Litecoin shows an important difference. Litecoin is well known and mainly works as a currency for buying and selling, with few extra uses. FXGuys, however, changes the way one trades in addition to using DeFi , with real benefits through its prop trading funding plan staking rewards as well as immediate funding model. As FXGuys moves forward in its presale phase, the time to buy $FXG tokens at a low cost grows shorter. With a reliable funding method, an increasing user base along with a staking system that benefits long-term owners, FXGuys aims to become a leading DeFi coin with great potential. Investors seeking an asset to boost their portfolio should check out FXGuys before its price increases.

XRP price rebounds as $2 emerges as a new baseline; Ripple investors are happy but are still hedging their bets with DTX Exchange. Table of Contents XRP gains 11% with technical adoption DTX Exchange: Closing window of opportunity Conclusion The Ripple network’s regulatory struggles and the XRP price free-fall have been major discussion points recently. However, experts who claimed that XRP price would rebound soon have been proven to be right, as the XRP price seems to be on a rebound from the $2 range it hit before the weekend. Ripple charts are green for the first time in several days as the XRP price rose over 11% in daily trading. However, many investors who have been burnt by the free-falling prices are cautious. They are choosing projects with clearer gain paths over potential performance, especially as Ripple’s case with the SEC continues to drag. Most profit-seeking investors are rushing to join the bonus and final presale round of DTX Exchange. This project is drawing in investors with its useful features and huge growth potential. While XRP is on the path to recovery, DTX is also on course to establish itself as a major player in the market. XRP gains 11% with technical adoption Ripple’s XRP price recovered to $2.17 as technical adoption news emerged from South Korea. While the XRP price recovery is highly welcome for its long-suffering investors, it could likely drop again as investors try to quit their positions with some gains. In addition, the XRP price is down by 30% from the early February price ranges. The lowering market volume is a welcome sign, however, as it seems investors are willing to wait things out. Ripple’s market volume is down by 19%. Another elephant in the room is its excess supply, which concerns many trading experts. You might also like: Solana volume makes new highs but leading weekly gainers are JUP, DTX Exchange DTX Exchange: Closing window of opportunity While Ripple and its XRP price charts show some welcome recovery, DTX Exchange is ready to close down its presale. With almost 60% of tokens sold from the bonus round, investors need to move fast to get in position for clear 200% listing gains. Seasoned investors are shifting focus to DTX, with its high utility features that allow for higher adoption and, therefore, a clear use case. DTX Exchange has been in the news for its feature-rich hybrid trading platform, which will allow users to trade multiple asset classes, including cryptos and stocks. DTX Exchange also has optimized conventional trading exchange features, such as an automated investment manager and copy trading features, which help to improve the investment process. Copy trading allows users to follow the investment strategies of experienced traders and apply them to their portfolios. Early buyers are likely to see quick gains after launch and get access to phenomenal discounts and voting rights. Conclusion The XRP price chart is a delight to watch right now, but many diehard Ripple supporters are now questioning the stability of its growth potential. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange’s presale success underscores a market hungry for platforms that prioritize flexibility over dogma. Bonus tokens are available for $0.18, and the listing price is $0.36, making it a simple 200% gain for current investors once the project launches.

According to data from Defi Llama, in February, Ethereum’s ( ETH ) total value locked fell to $50 billion from a peak of $71 billion in January. Additionally, decentralized exchange volumes have been declining as capital flows into alternate ecosystems such as layer 2s and Solana ( SOL ). DEX volume fell from $92 billion in December to $82 billion in February, a 11% decline. Ethereum network fees, on the other hand, have decreased from $142 million in January to barely $46 million in February, indicating a decline in demand. The upcoming Pectra upgrade , which is expected to enhance network functionality and fee efficiency, might be a short-term catalyst. However, it is still unclear if these upgrades will be enough to stop the decline in DeFi activity. Furthermore, technical issues or delays could slow down the momentum and maintain ETH within its current range.

Ethereum technival analysis. Credit: crypto.news Despite the price uptick, low trading volume suggests hesitation among buyers. ETH needs a strong push past resistance to sustain gains, or it risks another pullback. A decisive break above $2,846 may open the path to $2,946, while failure to hold current levels could lead to a retest of $2,200 support. Meanwhile, sentiment remains mixed ahead of the White House Crypto Summit on Mar. 7. Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed the formation of a national crypto strategic reserve , with Ethereum being among the cryptocurrencies. Although some see this as a sign of a possible reversal, analysts caution that if enough regulatory clarification is not reached, the summit may become a “sell-the-news” event and lead to further downturns.

Pal’s post comes just 24 hours after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shared his plan to reduce interest rates in the US. Crypto market rebounds after Trump tariffs spook global financial markets, send US dollar tumbling The crypto market cap plunged from above $3.2 trillion to below $3 trillion in the last few weeks, TradingView data shows. Last week, the digital asset space’s total valuation plummeted to a low of around $2.55 trillion following US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. China, one of the nations slapped with tariffs, immediately retaliated and imposed 10-15% tariffs on US farm products. China’s embassy also said on X, “If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.” Trump’s tariffs have subsequently ignited fears of a global trade war, which has negatively impacted the US dollar index. According to TradingView data , the index has fallen more than 3% in the past week. While the US dollar index falls, the crypto market seems to be recovering. In the last 24 hours, the market cap has risen over 5%. Bitcoin has also erased its losses from the past week to trade at $92,563.12 as of 12:45 a.m. EST.

Ever wondered how global events ripple through different markets? Today, we’re diving into the exciting world of Forex, where Asia FX is making waves! Buckle up as we explore how the dollar’s dramatic dollar slide to a 4-month low, spurred by Trump tariff relief, is creating ripples across the financial landscape and what it means for you. Why is Asia FX Experiencing Such a Powerful Surge? Let’s cut to the chase: Asian currencies are flexing their muscles! We’re seeing a notable uptick in Asia FX , and it’s largely thanks to the weakening US dollar. But why is the dollar losing its grip? The answer lies in recent economic developments and a shift in market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown: Trump Tariff Relief: Easing trade tensions, particularly those initiated during the Trump era, are playing a significant role. When tariffs are reduced or removed, it signals a potential for increased global trade. This often weakens the dollar as investors anticipate a less protectionist US economic policy. Dollar Weakness Narrative: The narrative around the US dollar has shifted slightly. After a period of strength, driven by high interest rates, there are now expectations of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This anticipation naturally leads to a dollar slide as investors look for potentially higher yields elsewhere. Asian Economic Resilience: Many Asian economies have shown resilience and even strong growth despite global headwinds. This economic strength makes their currencies more attractive to investors seeking diversification and growth opportunities. Think of it like this: imagine a tug-of-war. For a while, the dollar team (strong US economy, high interest rates) was pulling hard. Now, the Asia FX team (improving trade outlook, resilient Asian economies) is gaining momentum, causing the dollar to lose ground. The Dollar Slide: What’s Driving the Downward Trend? The dollar slide isn’t just a blip; it’s a notable trend driven by a confluence of factors. Understanding these factors is crucial, especially if you’re involved in currency trading or keeping an eye on global markets. Let’s break down the key drivers: Easing Inflationary Pressures: While inflation remains a concern globally, there are signs that inflationary pressures in the US might be easing slightly. This reduces the urgency for aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which in turn can weaken the dollar. Anticipation of Fed Rate Cuts: The market is forward-looking. Traders are increasingly pricing in potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the near future. Lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns, contributing to the dollar slide . Geopolitical Factors: Global geopolitical events and shifts in international relations can also influence currency valuations. Easing trade tensions, as mentioned earlier with Trump tariff relief, is one such factor. Conversely, any new geopolitical instability could trigger a flight to safety, potentially strengthening the dollar again. To illustrate, consider the table below showing how key Asian currencies have performed against the US dollar recently: Currency Recent Performance vs. USD Key Drivers Korean Won (KRW) Significant Gains Strong export data, easing geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula. Taiwan Dollar (TWD) Moderate Gains Robust tech sector performance, stable economic outlook. Singapore Dollar (SGD) Steady Gains Sound monetary policy, safe-haven appeal in Asia. Chinese Yuan (CNY) Slight Gains Government stimulus measures, gradual economic recovery. This table clearly shows the positive momentum behind Asia FX and highlights the tangible impact of the dollar slide . Trump Tariff Relief: A Game Changer for Currency Markets? The mention of Trump tariff relief might raise eyebrows. How does this policy shift impact currency markets, especially Forex market dynamics? Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, have a wide-ranging impact: Trade Flows: Tariffs disrupt traditional trade flows. When tariffs are imposed, imports become more expensive, potentially reducing trade volumes. Conversely, tariff relief can stimulate trade, making international transactions smoother and potentially boosting global economic activity. Currency Valuation: Tariffs can impact currency valuations in several ways. Initially, tariffs might strengthen the domestic currency as imports become pricier and domestic goods more competitive. However, prolonged trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs can harm economic growth and weaken the currency in the long run. Trump tariff policies were a major factor in trade tensions, and their easing is now contributing to the current dollar slide . Investor Sentiment: Trade policies significantly influence investor sentiment. Protectionist trade measures can create uncertainty and risk aversion, while moves towards free trade and tariff relief are generally seen as positive for global growth and market stability. The current Trump tariff relief is being interpreted as a step towards a more predictable and less confrontational trade environment. In essence, Trump tariff relief is acting as a catalyst, signaling a potential shift towards a more open global trade environment. This shift is weakening the dollar and providing a tailwind for Asia FX . Navigating the Forex Market: Opportunities and Strategies in a Shifting Landscape For those involved in currency trading or managing international assets, the current Forex market dynamics present both opportunities and challenges. The dollar slide and the rise of Asia FX require a nuanced approach. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially when it comes to currencies. Consider diversifying your holdings across different currencies, including Asia FX , to mitigate risk and potentially capture gains from different market movements. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on global economic news, central bank policies, and geopolitical developments. Factors like inflation data, interest rate decisions, and trade policy announcements can significantly impact Forex market trends. Technical Analysis: Utilize technical analysis tools and charts to identify potential entry and exit points in currency trading . Look for trends, support and resistance levels, and other technical indicators to make informed trading decisions. Risk Management: Always practice sound risk management. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and avoid over-leveraging your positions. The Forex market can be volatile, and managing risk is paramount. Let’s consider an example: Imagine you believe the dollar slide will continue and Asia FX will strengthen further. You could consider a long position in an Asian currency like the Korean Won (KRW) against the US dollar (USD). However, remember to do your own research, analyze market conditions, and manage your risk appropriately. The Future Outlook: Will Asia FX Continue its Ascent? The million-dollar question: Is this Asia FX rally sustainable? Will the dollar slide persist? While no one has a crystal ball, we can analyze current trends and expert opinions to get a sense of the future outlook: Continued Dollar Pressure: Many analysts believe that the dollar may remain under pressure in the near to medium term, especially if the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. This would continue to support Asia FX . Asian Economic Growth: The growth trajectory of Asian economies will be a crucial factor. If Asian economies continue to perform strongly, their currencies are likely to remain attractive to investors. Global Trade Dynamics: The evolution of global trade relations and policies will also play a significant role. Further easing of trade tensions and a move towards more open trade could be positive for Asia FX . Volatility Risks: It’s important to remember that Forex market s are inherently volatile. Unexpected events, geopolitical shocks, or shifts in economic sentiment can quickly change market dynamics. Be prepared for potential volatility and manage your risk accordingly. In conclusion, the current surge in Asia FX and the dollar slide are significant developments in the Forex market . Driven by Trump tariff relief and shifting economic dynamics, these trends present both opportunities and challenges for investors and traders. By staying informed, employing sound strategies, and managing risk effectively, you can navigate this evolving landscape and potentially capitalize on the exciting movements in the world of currencies.

Analyst ‘Ali Martinez’ spotlighted a remarkable spike in TRON network activity as it scales new highs, whilst ‘Crypto Patel’ revealed that a $1 price target is potentially achievable this bull cycle. As a result, traders and investors optimistically eye the Justin Sun-backed token amid a broader market recovery. Analyst Forecasts TRX Price To $1 At the time of reporting, TRX price witnessed a 2% uptick and exchanged hands at $0.2458. The coin bottomed and peaked at $0.2407 and $0.2465 intraday. Notably, the rising trajectory aligns with the broader crypto market’s recent recovery-like trend. Simultaneously, analyst Crypto Patel took to X , revealing that TRON is showcasing a strong momentum and a $1 price target potentially looms. According to the price chart shared by the analyst, the coin’s price holds strong support at $0.140. A sustained hold above this level remains bullish. Source: Crypto Patel, X The best ‘buy zone’ lies at $0.160 – $0.180, given the opportunity presents itself, per the analyst. Notably, the current price levels are considerably above the mentioned support zone, whilst sustained demand could propel new highs. Can The Analyst’s Prediction Come True? Intriguingly, it’s noteworthy that the analyst predicted a 200-300% surge in TRX price during October last year. Back then, the coin’s price traded around the $0.16 level, per CoinMarketCap data. Subsequently, the price hit a $0.426 level as of early December 2024. This past chronicle is worth considering, although the price soon fell amid broader market trends. TRON Network Activity Surge Bolsters Bullish Prediction On the other hand, TRON network activity rose substantially, reaching a 2-month-high as of March 4. According to analyst Ali Martinez, 2.94 million active addresses were recorded on the network recently. This data suggested rising market interest in the Justin Sun-led crypto project, paving a bullish road ahead. Source: Ali Charts, X Crypto Market Recovery Bolsters Hope Simultaneously, the broader crypto market’s recovery -like trend has solidified investors’ optimism on TRX price. Bitcoin and altcoin witnessed notable gains amid pro-crypto developments in the U.S. Donald Trump’s strategic crypto reserve announcement appears to have substantially boosted the market sentiment. Moreover, the looming U.S. crypto summit set for Friday has also glimmered hope over the market’s future prospects. Crypto market participants continue to monitor TRON extensively amid broader developments, signaling that a bull run to $1 is possible.

Ethereum price has also gained by 4.6% to around $2,300. All the top-ten cryptos by market cap have also registered strong gains, with Dogecoin (DOGE) leading the pack with a staggering 10% rise. Despite these market-wide gains, volatility risks remain. Mt. Gox has moved $1 billion in BTC, triggering concerns of a looming selloff. Retail traders also appear to be leaving the market amid declining volumes on PumpFun and a drastic drop in the meme coin market cap. Crypto Prices Face Volatility Risks as Mt. Gox Moves $1B Bitcoin Defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt.Gox has moved 12,000 BTC valued at approximately $1.09 billion. According to Arkham , these coins were moved to a new wallet address, sparking speculation of upcoming creditor repayments. Mt.Gox Bitcoin The Mt.Gox Bitcoin repayments could increase volatility in the crypto market. The creditors that have waited for more than a decade may opt to sell once they receive BTC. This large sell-off could trigger a short-term drop in crypto prices. Moreover, if these coins end up in the market at a time when the demand is low, it could impact Bitcoin’s rally towards $100,000. PumpFun Volumes Plunge 94% – Can Solana Price Sustain Gains? Transaction volumes on the Solana meme coin launchpad PumpFun have declined by 94% as most crypto prices tumbled. These volumes are now at their lowest level in nearly a year, suggesting that interest in meme coins is dropping. PumpFun Volumes PumpFun volumes peaked in January after the release of Solana meme coins like TRUMP and MELANIA. However, interest has gradually faded as these meme coins lost nearly all of their gains barely one month after launching. These declining volumes have sparked a bearish Solana price prediction after it dropped by 27% in one month. At press time, SOL trades at $149 after a 4.7% drop in 24 hours. Meme Coin Market Cap Drops by $59B As Dogecoin Price Rebounds The total meme coin market capitalization has dropped by $59 billion from its 2025 peak of $116 billion amid falling crypto prices. At press time, the total meme coin market cap stood at $57 billion after falling by more than 50% year-to-date. Meme Coin Market Capitalization This decline shows traders have become hesitant to buy meme coins . However, the declining interest is prevalent in newer meme coins, as the hype fades, interest has returned to older meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). At press time, Dogecoin price had posted a notable 10% gain to trade at $0.21, while Shiba Inu price had surged by 5%. What’s Next for Crypto Prices Crypto prices show signs of heightened volatility. The $1 billion BTC transfer by Mt.Gox could stir panic selling and cause Bitcoin to fall below the $90,00 psychological level again. Given that altcoins have been tracking Bitcoin price, signs of weakness could also plunge altcoin prices. Meme coins are no longer draining liquidity from the broader market. Reduced interest in new meme coins has led to PumpFun transaction volumes falling by 94%. Older meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen renewed interest, which may bode well for price.

Analysis from digital assets trading firm STS Digital suggests that Friday's White House crypto summit could lead to heightened activity. U.S. President Donald Trump, who promised a strategic crypto reserve in the lead-up to the November election, will host top players from the industry, including Coinbase, Chainlink and Exodus. The latest rumor suggests that at the summit, Trump may announce the creation of a strategic bitcoin (BTC) reserve, shifting away from the Sunday disclosure that hinted at the basket of altcoins like XRP, Cardano""s ADA and Solana (SOL) along with BTC and ether (ETH) as the core. The pricing of BTC, ETH and SOL options on Deribit suggests traders are bracing for a volatile weekend in the aftermath of the summit. ""Options markets are showing the nerves (and illiquidity) going into the weekend and the raft of potentials. The Friday vs Saturday IV [implied volatility] Spread is nearly 25 vols wide across the board with Friday expiries missing the expected variance,"" Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital, told CoinDesk. Implied volatility, a metric derived from the pricing of options, indicates how much traders expect the asset's price to fluctuate over a specific period. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. Early Thursday, bitcoin options expiring Friday suggested an annualized implied volatility of 56%, while those expiring on Saturday traded at 80% volatility. The 24-point gap indicates expectations for increased price turbulence following Friday's summit. A similar pattern was seen in ether and solana options. The table shows implied and forward volatilities for BTC, ETH, and SOL and straddle breakevens (expected price swings). Forward volatility is calculated by comparing the implied volatility of options with different maturities and indicates the expected volatility over the period between the two specified expiration dates, in this case, Friday and Saturday. The 105% BTC forward volatility translates to a 5.5% price movement expected between Friday 08:00 UTC and Saturday 08:00 UTC. (Deribit options expire at 08:00 UTC). In other words, BTC could swing nearly $5K in either direction following the summit. ETH and SOL volatilities are pricing a move of $135 and $13, respectively. Per Anderson, expectations for large volatility often end up in disappointment. ""Quite often, large expected volatility like this is a disappointment in crypto as expectations > reality. That said, the breakevens do not feel large and options are by far the safest play for directional views in this environment,"" Anderson said, pointing to risks involved in taking directional bets in options expiring Mar. 14. ""We would expect option prices further out in tenor to come lower after the event as fears subside and volatility decays,"" Anderson noted.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Trump|Options,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|ETH|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 07:52:19

To be included in the reserve, a cryptocurrency must have maintained an average market cap of at least $500 billion over the past calendar year. Bitcoin is currently the only asset that qualifies. Initially, the bill proposed a 10% allocation and included stablecoins and staking options, but an amendment reduced the allocation to 5% and removed these provisions. Further, HB302 requires the assets to be held by a qualified custodian or in an exchange-traded product.

President Trump announced he had directed a working group to move ahead with a Crypto Strategic Reserve – a very bullish signal for market participants. In his first days in office, President Trump made numerous policy changes, enacted several executive orders and has the country buzzing with news and updates from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Tech-wunderkind Elon Musk heads DOGE and aims to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the ""Save America"" Movement."" The almost daily revelations of the extent of the mismanagement of taxpayer money are serving Trump well, as the transparent sharing of this information with US citizens allows the average American to see and witness the chaos that went on under previous administrations. Trump's initial moves in the infancy of his term have certainly garnered him some new support, and his continued commitment to other campaign promises also goes a long way in improving his approval rating. Trump's Proposed National Strategic Reserve of Cryptocurrencies On Sunday, March 3, President Trump announced on Truth Social that ""a U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry."" Trump also announced that he has ""directed a Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve."" According to Trump's announcement, the ""… Reserve that includes Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). "" The Reserve will also include Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), according to President Trump's executive order on digital assets in January 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) Will Likely Make Up Entire Reserve According to Bitwise CEO Matt Hougan, investment chief at Bitwise, recently said that while Trump's Crypto Reserve Announcement is bullish, Hougan cautioned that the market is ""misreading things."" Hougan explained his views thoroughly in a March 5 market note . The Bitwise bigshot said while President Trump did include several large-cap altcoins such as XRP, ETH, SOL, and ADA, the President's planned Reserve may eventually mainly consist of ""entirely Bitcoin."" In his market note, Hougan elucidates. ""Market participants have soured on the announcement because the proposed reserve holds more than Bitcoin."" Adding; ""The inclusion of small-cap assets in the announcement unnecessarily complicated matters."" Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) Would Be The ""Heart of the Reserve"" President Trump's initial announcement said the Reserve would include Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA). The President later added that BTC and ETH would be ""the heart"" of the crypto reserve. In his clearly and well-set-out memorandum, or market note, Hougan explains that the first proposal is never the final proposal. Hougan predicts that the big names in the industry will have something to say about the Reserve, and it might receive some industry pushback. Hougan opines the ""boldness of the initial proposal has widened the Overton window for what the reserve can be."" He continues by asserting, ""Until Sunday, the very idea of a strategic crypto reserve seemed unlikely. Now, a bitcoin-only reserve sounds almost conservative. After the dust settles, I suspect the final Reserve will be nearly entirely bitcoin, and it will be larger than people think."" Hougan further argues that despite industry leaders' worries over a Bitcoin-only reserve, it is nothing of concern. Hougan poignantly rests people assure by saying: ""In the end, this is bullish.""

The recent price movement has drawn attention to shifting supply dynamics, particularly between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH). This trend, analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor XBTManager, provides insights into Bitcoin’s current market cycle and what could come next. Related Reading: Crypto Markets Are Misreading Trump’s Strategic Reserve, Says Bitwise CIO Short-Term vs. Long-Term Holders: A Market Balancing Act According to XBTManager, Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH) has triggered an increase in STH supply while LTH supply declines. This transition typically signals a market shift, as long-term holders begin selling their assets while short-term traders accumulate. This dynamic has historically played a role in determining peak levels, as increased activity from short-term holders suggests heightened speculative interest. XBTManager explains that analyzing who is buying and selling Bitcoin is crucial in identifying market trends. As long-term holders sell their BTC, the supply moves into the hands of short-term traders, who often react more quickly to price fluctuations. This shift indicates that Bitcoin may be in a pullback phase following its recent ATH, leading to a potential period of price consolidation. Additionally, institutional buyers and ETFs have continued to accumulate Bitcoin, behaving similarly to short-term holders during this phase. MicroStrategy (MSTR), a major corporate Bitcoin investor, has also followed retail buying patterns. While institutional inflows support Bitcoin’s price, XBTManager warns that a prolonged consolidation period is possible due to liquidity demands. The analyst suggests that once STH begins selling and LTH starts accumulating again, the market may stabilize, creating a more favorable environment for long positions. What’s Next for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s supply shift suggests a cooling-off phase, market participants are watching for signs of a potential trend reversal. A report from CryptoQuant highlights that real spot demand has been declining, meaning that despite recent price gains, sustained upward momentum may be difficult unless demand returns. Additionally, IntoTheBlock recently revealed a surge in active Bitcoin addresses following last week’s price drop. This increase suggests heightened on-chain activity, often seen in periods of market transition. Whether this signals a renewed accumulation phase or continued volatility remains to be seen. Last week’s drop triggered a surge in active addresses, pushing the daily average to its highest level since December, when Bitcoin surpassed $100k. This uptick in on-chain activity coincided with an increase in zero-balance addresses, indicating capitulation. pic.twitter.com/eiESdiwERN — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 4, 2025 For now, supply trends, ETF inflows, and liquidity conditions are worth monitoring to assess Bitcoin’s next move. If long-term holders re-enter the market and demand recovers, Bitcoin could see renewed upward momentum.

While the top altcoins like ETH, SOL, LTC, etc., and a few more attract marginal gains, altcoins like Ondo & Movement have triggered over a 20% upswing in the past 24 hours and are trying hard to keep up the momentum. What’s next for these altcoins? Will ONDO Price Mark a New ATH? Ondo Finance is one of the leading tokenizations of Real World Assets (RWA), which is leading the cryptos with over 20% gains. The major reason behind the surge is the token achieving a major milestone, which sheds light on the rising investor confidence. In a recent update, ONDO’s total value locked (TVL) has reached an all-time high of over $1 billion, making an extraordinary rise from the lows of around $185 million. This showcases the rapid growth within the RWA space, as the ONDO price is also flashing massive bullish signals. As seen in the above chart, the ONDO price is trading within a descending parallel channel and is trying hard to reach the resistance. Meanwhile, the technicals have turned bullish as the DMI is about to undergo a bullish crossover. Besides, the RSI is maintaining a strong ascending trajectory. Meanwhile, the bearish divergence in the ADX raises some concerns, suggesting a drop in the pace of the rally. Therefore, the ONDO price is believed to test the resistance but may fail to surpass it as the volume remains within a restricted range. However, if the volume increases, then the ONDO price may trigger a breakout and may probably form a new ATH above $2. Movement (MOVE) Price Aims for a 35% Upswing After a bullish start, the MOVE price began to trade within a descending parallel channel following a rejection from the highs. While the price is trying hard to validate a strong ascending trend that could push the price above $0.5 and eventually break the resistance and, in turn, break the bearish pattern. Besides, the decreased volume raises some concerns, but with the growing bullish market sentiments, the MOVE price is also expected to demonstrate massive price actions. As mentioned above, the MOVE is also stuck within a descending parallel channel. The Bollinger Bands have begun to squeeze, hinting towards a drop in volatility. This suggests the price is undergoing a strong consolidation phase and is preparing for a breakout. Meanwhile, the CMF has risen above 0, hinting towards the growing strength of the bulls against the bears. Therefore, the buying pressure is slowly mounting, which may push the price towards the resistance of the channel and eventually trigger a breakout above $0.6. Therefore, the prices of ONDO & Movement remain stuck within a similar pattern and are undergoing a strong consolidation phase. Hence, a breakout appears to be imminent after the accumulation reaches it’s edge.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ONDO|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 08:02:06

However, despite the ongoing downturn, there is a noticeable resilience among short-term holders (STHs), who have continued to accumulate Bitcoin, hinting at the possibility of a recovery in the near future. Despite the losses, the growing number of new wallets, particularly those holding small amounts of Bitcoin, reflects strong belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential, with over 50,000 new wallets joining the network over the past month. Bitcoin's price has been moving around key resistance levels, particularly nearing a critical price point that could trigger a breakout. If the cryptocurrency can break through this resistance, it could rise to even higher levels, potentially heading toward the $100,000 mark. However, if the resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break through, it may experience further declines and test lower support levels. This uncertainty in price movement creates a situation where short-term holders are vital in sustaining the market’s optimism. Despite the challenges, Bitcoin’s network growth and the increasing number of wallets indicate that short-term holders are holding strong, and their involvement remains crucial for a possible rebound. Although Bitcoin has experienced sharp declines, the number of wallets holding smaller amounts has increased, signaling that more investors are joining the market despite the fluctuations. This growing participation suggests that, even during times of market struggle, many investors remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential . The price has recently shown signs of recovery, but the real test lies in whether it can break through resistance levels and hold above them to maintain its bullish momentum. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold its ground above certain support levels, it may see a further dip. Despite these risks, the overall sentiment remains that Bitcoin's price could eventually surge if bullish momentum returns. Bitcoin's price movements and the growing participation of short-term holders reflect the market's ongoing struggles but also a potential foundation for a comeback. While Bitcoin's price faces significant resistance, its ability to rally could be a key sign of strength for the broader cryptocurrency market. The commitment of short-term holders is a crucial factor in Bitcoin’s ongoing volatility and potential recovery, as these investors continue to demonstrate their confidence in the asset despite the short-term price fluctuations.",,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-06 08:02:26

WLFI has purchased $10 million Wrapped Bitcoin (110 WBTC), $10 million Ethereum (4468 ETH), and $1.5 million Movement (3.42 million MOVE). Arkham Intelligence noted that the crypto project has already spent a total of $336 million to invest in 9 tokens. “Despite the market drawdown from Trump’s tariffs, he keeps buying back ETH through his company on every dip. This should clearly signal only a bullish sentiment and shows how serious he is about crypto.” – Rekt Fencer , Founder of X DAO There is no way to know whether WLFI sold the assets because the project transferred most of the tokens to Coinbase Prime some time ago. World Liberty Financial also acknowledged that they have not sold any of their assets so far. The analytic platform expects WLFI’s current paper loss to reach $88 million if the assets have not been sold. The firm noted that Ethena might experience the largest loss percentage, around 63%. Ethereum is also expected to have the largest loss amount, $67.35 million ETH, roughly a 31% drop. It’s worth noting that the additional investment of $21.5M tokens by WLFI came in the wake of the upcoming White House Crypto Summit in the early morning of March 7. Rekt Fencer, Founder of X DAO, mentioned that the crypto summit will be the biggest catalyst and a key turning point for the crypto markets this week. He also expects a shocking outcome in the crypto market because Bitcoin and the crypto reserve will be in discussions at the summit. Fencer pointed out some probable results at the summit, such as a 0% tax for U.S. crypto projects, clarity on BTC reserve implementation, and new details on the crypto reserve. He also believes that WLFI’s additional investment indicated a bullish sentiment on crypto even after a market drop from Trump’s tariffs. Trump hosts the White House Crypto Summit tomorrow Donald Trump revealed on Sunday some plans for the reserve to include alternative digital assets such as XRP, SOL, and ADA. He also added that BTC and ETH “will also be at the heart of the Reserve.” The event will also discuss the development of regulatory frameworks surrounding virtual assets and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong highlighted on Sunday that BTC would probably be the best option for a strategic reserve because it’s simple and has a clear story as a successor to gold. Armstrong also argued that if people preferred more variety, they could do a market cap-weighted index of digital currencies to keep it unbiased. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged on Tuesday that Bitcoin would be treated differently than the altcoins the President mentioned in his announcement. Lutnick said that Trump spoke about a BTC reserve all during the campaign trail, and “I think you’re going to see it executed on Friday. The summit will feature CEOs, investors and other influential figures from the crypto space, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, and Exodus CEO JP Richardson. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett also revealed that the roundtable will include more than 25 participants, including members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets.

Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will hit his price target in December 2025 when the median line of the Gaussian channel peaks.

Last week, Dave the Wave suggested that BTC may be following in the footsteps of its August 2024 correction when it dipped to the 0.382 Fibonacci level before launching fresh rallies. “A BTC observation. Now a 38% real correction of the move up as per last time.” Traders use the Fibonacci retracement tool to spot potential entry and exit points based on the Fibonacci ratio.

This partnership with Bridge allows users to pay directly from their non-custodial wallets, using cards and bank transfers, without needing to hand over control of their assets. This move aligns with the growing demand for stablecoin payments, as more consumers seek to use digital assets in their daily lives. Wirex’s partnership with Bridge ensures seamless integration , offering users greater access to digital payments and contributing to the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. The expansion comes at a time when the US is focusing on stablecoin regulation, which could speed up their adoption. Stablecoin regulation in the US is expected to drive greater market growth , with various industry leaders like Circle, Coinbase, and Ripple collaborating with lawmakers to shape new policies. Regulatory clarity could further boost the integration of stablecoins into mainstream financial systems, encouraging more businesses to enter the market. With Visa's reach, Wirex users can now make purchases at over 80 million merchants worldwide. As of early 2024, Stripe, a leading payment provider, acquired Bridge for $1.1 billion, solidifying the growing role of stablecoin payment systems in everyday transactions. Wirex’s US expansion has the potential to significantly drive revenue growth , as the market for digital payments continues to grow. The company’s co-founders noted that the strong demand for stablecoin payments and the adoption of digital assets are key drivers for the expansion into the US, making it a critical market for the company. In addition, the US stablecoin market has surpassed a total market cap of $225 billion, and regulatory clarity could further increase adoption. Major financial institutions, such as Bank of America, are also closely monitoring the space. Bank of America’s CEO stated that they could launch their own stablecoin if favorable regulations are put in place. Wirex’s move signals the increasing importance of the US market for stablecoin adoption, with more Web3 businesses likely following suit as regulations evolve.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-06 08:05:29

The scammers used the account to promote a fake cryptocurrency called “National Hong Kong Coin”, prompting a swift warning from the government. Notably, the scammers announced the launch of the fraudulent coin on Solana, garnering widespread attention. However, Hong Kong Legislative Council member Ng Kit Chuang clarified that the government hasn’t issued the cryptocurrency. Fake National Hong Kong Coin: What to Know Earlier today, a fake X account impersonating Hong Kong’s Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced the launch of the National Hong Kong Coin on Solana. In an attempt to legitimize the deceptive claim, the scammers used a photograph of the Chief Executive. In addition, the scammers wrote on X, “This strategic step marks a new era in digital innovation and economic growth for Hong Kong”. Subsequently, Legislative Council member Ng Kit Chuang has reassured the public that the government has made no official announcement regarding the issuance of a cryptocurrency. He warned investors to be cautious and not fall victim to such scams, emphasizing the importance of verifying information through official channels before making any investment decisions. Government Warns Against Fake National Hong Kong Coin Following the scammers’ false announcement on the Hong Kong Coin, the government issued a warning. In an official statement, the SAR government clarified that the Chief Executive’s account is fake and the shared information about the crypto launch is completely false. Legislative Council member Ng Kit Chuang’s clarification comes amidst growing concerns and queries from citizens and Web3 industry experts about a fake social media post claiming the launch of the National Hong Kong Coin. The government has firmly debunked the claims as fraudulent, and Ng has urged the public to remain cautious and vigilant. The Rise of Government Crypto Scams It is noteworthy that the fake Hong Kong Coin incident is part of a broader trend of crypto scams that involve impersonating celebrities and government officials to dupe investors. Recently, scammers promoted a fake meme coin impersonating Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Scammers created a fake account , “SaudiLawConf”, to promote a fraudulent crypto called “Saudi Arabia Meme Coin”. However, the legitimate Saudi Law Conference soon discovered that their X account had been hacked and issued a warning about the crypto scam. Similarly, the launch of Libra token , promoted by Argentinian President Javier Milei, has also created controversy. The token, which jumped by 3000% to an ATH of $4.5, soon reached its low, when the pulled $87M worth of LIBRA, leaving investors with significant losses.

Here's Why!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ripple-xrp-was-invited-to-fridays-grand-summit-but-this-altcoin-included-in-the-reserve-was-not-heres-why/,"The White House Cryptocurrency Summit, which will be hosted by Donald Trump on Friday, is being followed with great curiosity in Bitcoin and altcoins. As anticipation grows in the crypto market ahead of the summit, Trump is expected to launch a US strategic crypto reserve at the event, which will be the first of its kind. While the guest list for the summit, which will be attended by many important names from the cryptocurrency industry and politics, has begun to take shape, it was seen that a notable name was missing. This was Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was not invited to the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Unchained reported, citing a White House source with knowledge of the guest list. The Cardano founder’s non-invitation comes despite Trump posting on Truth Social on Sunday in which he announced that ADA would also be part of the crypto reserve. “They're running around town trying to push their own narrative. They're not involved in anything that's going to influence policy and they weren't invited to Friday's summit,” a White House source told Unchained. Hoskinson’s absence is particularly surprising given President Trump’s recent comments, as he was expected to attend the event following Trump’s announcement that ADA would be part of a crypto reserve. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve would elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” Trump wrote in a post on Sunday. According to the confirmed guest list, the summit will include “Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor, Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang, Exodus CEO JP Richardson, Multicoin Capital Managing Partner Kyle Samani, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) co-founder Zach Witkoff, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi, Crypto .com CEO Kris Marszalek.” *This is not investment advice.

Despite this, there remains a strong belief in the potential for sustainable growth, especially as the volatile nature of crypto tends to weed out underperforming projects, leaving room for more promising ones. As the industry endures a bear market, it can actually help refine the space and eliminate weaker projects, which could ultimately pave the way for long-term innovation. AI agents were once considered the next big thing in Web3, but their sudden decline has led some to believe that the sector may have been nothing more than a speculative bubble. The massive drop in market cap in just a few months has led to widespread doubts, and many in the community wonder whether the demand for AI agents will be overtaken by other trends, such as meme coins. Despite this, not all is lost for AI agents, and the ongoing volatility presents an opportunity to filter out unsustainable projects and spotlight the ones with strong fundamentals . Developers and investors who remain dedicated to the space still see potential, especially in the area of DeFi-powered AI agents (DeFAI) . According to DeFi Warhol, a developer in the space, the initial rush to adopt AI agents led to inflated expectations, but now that the dust has settled, there’s a chance for serious, well-built projects to rise above the noise. The first phase of hype was followed by disillusionment when the market turned bearish, but Warhol believes that the current climate presents an opportunity to invest in projects with solid, sustainable foundations . AI advocates such as 0xJeff are optimistic about the future of AI, particularly through the lens of DeFi integration . He points out that combining the power of AI with mature sectors within decentralized finance can unlock tremendous value, given the enormous market size. The value of DeFi’s TVL (total value locked) is estimated to be around $100 billion, and integrating AI with DeFi could significantly enhance user experience by simplifying complex financial instruments. The fusion of DeFi and AI offers a potential path forward for AI agents to break out of their current slump and become more accessible and useful to the average user. One of the biggest advantages of combining AI with DeFi is that it could help demystify complex financial products like liquid staking, yield farming, and stablecoins , making them easier to understand and use. AI could provide the interface for more intuitive interactions, making complicated processes more digestible for everyday users. During ETHDenver, the Ethereum community’s largest event, AI integration in DeFi was a key topic of discussion, indicating that the hype surrounding AI in crypto isn’t completely dead. While the market may have cooled, serious, thoughtful development in the sector is still underway, particularly in DeFAI. In the end, while the AI agents sector has experienced a significant downturn, the current market challenges could lead to the emergence of more viable and functional projects in the long run. By focusing on practical use cases like DeFi integration, AI agents can maintain relevance in the evolving world of crypto, where the best projects will thrive, and the weaker ones will be weeded out. The AI agents bubble may have popped, but the opportunity for meaningful growth and innovation in this space is far from over.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-06 08:09:08

In a recent budget hearing, Sun expressed concern about the increasing number of crypto-related frauds in the country. She warned that the risk of losing money in scams was high and that victims often had little chance of recovering their funds. Her warning comes as crypto scams reportedly made up a quarter of Singapore’s total fraud losses last year. Sun’s statements reflect a growing sense of caution among government officials, despite Singapore’s previous reputation as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction. While Sun’s remarks were focused on public protection, other political figures have taken a harsher stance. Member of Parliament Tan Wu Meng suggested that crypto fraudsters should face severe punishment, including caning, depending on the severity of their offenses. This shift in tone has raised questions about whether Singapore’s stance on cryptocurrencies is starting to change. However, it is too early to tell whether this will result in an official policy overhaul. Although Singapore has long been known for its progressive attitude toward blockchain and crypto, there has been increasing concern about the rise of crypto-related scams. In fact, Singapore has been one of the leaders in granting crypto business licenses in Asia, and the country was named the “world’s most crypto-friendly country” earlier this year. Despite this, incidents of crypto fraud are on the rise, with law enforcement investigating several crypto firms for possible financial crimes. Sun emphasized that crypto scams have become more advanced, making it harder for the average person to spot fraud. In the past, many scams were easily recognizable due to language or accent issues, but these scams have become more sophisticated over time. Additionally, victims are increasingly willing to hand over their money to scammers, with reports stating that 80% of the funds lost in crypto fraud cases were voluntarily given by the victims. At the moment, no new policy changes have been announced, but the government has indicated that more legislative measures may be on the way to address the issue of crypto fraud. Sun urged citizens to use the anti-fraud resources provided by the government to protect themselves from scams. However, some reports suggest that the government is leaning towards more punitive measures, potentially involving stricter regulations or penalties for those involved in crypto fraud. While there has been no formal policy shift, Singapore’s government appears to be increasingly concerned about the risks posed by cryptocurrencies, especially in terms of scams and fraud. The combination of high-profile political figures pushing for stronger measures and growing public concern about crypto fraud suggests that future legislation may take a harder stance on crypto-related crimes. Despite this, it is important to note that Singapore’s crypto-friendly reputation has not been fully overturned yet, and the country still remains a key player in the global blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Overall, it’s clear that the Singapore government is grappling with the challenges posed by the rise of crypto scams, but the full impact of these recent warnings and potential regulatory changes remains to be seen. While the country’s reputation as a crypto hub remains intact for now, the situation is evolving rapidly, and citizens and businesses will need to stay vigilant as the government assesses its approach to crypto regulation. Regulatory shifts, political figures advocating for harsher penalties, and public concern about crypto fraud indicate that Singapore’s crypto policies may be in for significant change in the coming months.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-06 08:12:48

Here’s the Impact,https://timestabloid.com/5-37-billion-xrp-in-24-hours-heres-the-impact/,"On March 3, over $5.37 billion worth of XRP was transferred, marking a significant surge in network activity. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted this in a recent post on X, sharing a chart illustrating the sharp increase in XRP transactions. The timing of this surge is particularly notable, as it coincided with a market collapse that some have attributed to market manipulation . Over $5.37 billion worth of $XRP was transferred in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/P1NnZpeY6V — Ali (@ali_charts) March 5, 2025 Recent Market Trends On March 2, XRP experienced a sharp increase, reaching $2.97—its highest price since early February. This rally coincided with President Donald Trump’s announcement of a national crypto reserve , which includes XRP and four other major cryptocurrencies. However, shortly after this jump, the price crashed, leading to speculation that large holders may have aided the sudden volatility. Now, the asset shows signs of recovery, and the movement of billions in XRP suggests that major investors are actively repositioning themselves. Whale Accumulation During Market Uncertainty Whales have been accumulating XRP in substantial amounts. Recent reports indicate that whales acquired roughly 1 billion XRP as the price dropped and began to recover. These strategic purchases suggest that institutional players and high-net-worth investors see potential in XRP despite recent price fluctuations. The correlation between sudden price movements and large transfers has raised concerns about possible market manipulation. Some analysts believe that the rapid price jump on March 2, followed by an immediate decline, was triggered by coordinated whale activity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This pattern has been observed in the past, where significant price swings align with heavy accumulation or distribution by large holders. However, the recent price action suggests XRP is leaning toward a bullish turn. XRP’s Current Market Phase With large quantities of XRP being moved, analysts debate whether the asset is in a local distribution phase . This phase typically occurs when major investors start selling after a price surge, potentially leading to a correction. However, given the renewed accumulation by whales, the market may still be in an accumulation phase, where investors buy in anticipation of future gains. XRP has begun its recovery, aided by accumulation and the excitement surrounding the announcement of the national reserve. If whales continue accumulating, the buying pressure could push the price up further. The asset is trading at $2.46, up 6.19% from yesterday, and still climbing.

The surging demand for energy-intensive GPUs that feed the AI beast risks straining national grids and testing sustainability goals over the coming decade. Not so long ago, it was Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that were attracting flak for their energy footprint. While Bitcoin mining remains a power-hungry process, Ethereum has moved on to greener pastures following its transition to Proof-of-Stake. But no sooner had the environmental lobby gotten over its critique of crypto, it’s found another adjacent industry to attack in the form of AI.And it’s hard to dispute the facts as they stand: AI has one hell of an appetite for energy. From training massive language models to powering real-time inference in data centers, AI’s energy consumption is skyrocketing. All transformative technologies, to be fair, entail a massive spike in production – a trend that can be traced as far back to the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century. It’s the price of progress.Nevertheless, the rate at which AI’s energy footprint has increased poses a pressing question: how can the world meet this energy need sustainably and reliably? The answer lies in a blend of technological foresight and strategic energy investment. And one energy source in particular has the potential to meet that need. It is, unsurprisingly, nuclear. What’s perhaps more surprising is the opportunity it presents shrewd investors to load up on U3O8 – yellowcake used in uranium production – without needing a geiger counter and a lead suit. AI Is Coming for Your Energy We commonly envision AI as an energy saver, freeing us from the drudgery of planning meals, preparing reports, and designing school newsletters. But we rarely consider that for everything AI gives back to us in free time, it consumes in other ways. GPUs, such as those in Nvidia’s H100, draw 700 watts each, and a single data center can house thousands. Do the math, as they say. While AI’s relationship with energy is complex , regions where there is a high concentration of data centers place a significant impact on the local grid. Data centers are typically clustered together for efficiency reasons, which demands reliable energy infrastructure that can keep up. Renewables such as wind and tide aren’t cut out for this sort of work. Nuclear, on the other hand, is a perfect fit with its ability to crank up capacity at the push of a button. As the U.S. seeks to recenter itself as a tech hub, with a particular focus on AI and crypto, it’s safe to say its energy footprint is only going to climb. Particularly as new chip manufacturing plants come onstream to keep the AI juggernaut ticking over. Today’s energy mix, dominated by fossil fuels, with nuclear a distant third behind renewables, faces a reckoning. Solar and wind, while growing, are intermittent, leaving gaps that can’t sustain AI’s round-the-clock demand. Battery storage, also advancing, can’t yet bridge the lulls for data centers needing constant power. Fossil fuels, meanwhile, clash with net-zero targets, with this tension pitting AI’s promise against sustainability. Which is why the demand for a reliable and scalable energy solution brings us back to nuclear. Uranium Demand Ramps Up Given its zero-emission design and predictable output, it’s no wonder nuclear energy is being mentioned in the same breath as AI. The future technology of the 1950s is now the power source for the future tech of the 2020s. As a result, uranium – the primary fuel for nuclear reactors – is seeing renewed interest, particularly as countries pursue net-zero goals. One of the interesting side-effects of uranium’s increased demand is that it’s presented an opportunity for astute investors to capitalize on rising global energy consumption, exacerbated by an increase in AI. Enterprising RWA platforms have latched onto this, with the likes of xU308 enabling traders to acquire tokenized uranium. Operating on the Tezos blockchain, xU308 presents a compelling case for uranium investment, noting that it has delivered more than 3x the return of the S&P 500 in the last five years. 1/4 ⚛️ Built on @etherlink and powered by @Tezos , is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for trading tokenized physical uranium. This platform makes it possible for retail investors to access uranium without having to spend more than 5 tez. 🧪 pic.twitter.com/vVc1i4bAUB — Tezos (@tezos) December 5, 2024 As more RWAs arrive onchain, including many associated with the AI economy – such as NVIDIA stock and tokenized GPU compute – uranium presents an asymmetric bet on rising demand for artificial intelligence. For investors seeking portfolio diversification coupled with a future-proofed bet on growth in global energy demand, uranium looks like a reliable choice. Lowly correlated with other commodities, it appears largely immune from geopolitical crises and tariff wars. In the long-term, anticipated improvements in solar, wind, and battery technology may allow renewables to take over from fossil fuels. But for the next 5-10 years, it’s clear that there’s a gap to be filled between fossil fuels, with their dirty but effective capacity, and renewables with their capricious promise of a greener world. Into that gap nuclear effectively slots, providing the short to medium-term answer to the world’s energy demands. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Gox-linked wallets highlight the evolving regulatory and market dynamics within the cryptocurrency sector. While South Korean authorities are closely monitoring Japan’s stance on crypto ETFs as they weigh potential approval, the defunct exchange Mt. Gox has transferred 12,000 BTC amid a week of market volatility. South Korea Moves Closer to Decision on Bitcoin ETFs Amid Changing Global Stance on Crypto Regulation South Korea is edging closer to making a decision on the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the nation’s regulators closely monitoring developments in Japan. According to a report from Maeil Business Newspaper (MK), South Korean authorities are studying Japan’s evolving stance on digital assets as they deliberate on the potential introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in the country. The Maeil Business Newspaper reports that South Korea’s financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), has been analyzing Japan’s recent legislative trajectory concerning digital assets. This includes reviewing policy trends from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) and sharing insights with relevant institutions in South Korea. Japan has traditionally maintained a conservative approach toward cryptocurrency regulations. However, recent discussions suggest a potential shift, with the FSA considering positioning cryptocurrencies as financial products alongside securities. This move could pave the way for the approval of crypto ETFs in Japan, a prospect that South Korea is observing with keen interest. On Feb. 10, Japanese publication Nikkei reported that Japan's financial regulators might lift the ban on crypto ETFs, allowing them to be traded similarly to traditional financial instruments. The discussions in Japan are expected to continue through the first half of 2025 before a concrete legislative plan is proposed to the National Assembly in 2026. While South Korea has yet to make a definitive move on Bitcoin ETFs, top financial officials acknowledge the growing global trend toward these investment vehicles. At a recent virtual asset committee meeting, Kim So-young, vice chairman of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), reiterated the country’s cautious approach. “I have continued to say that I would carefully review [spot Bitcoin ETFs], and it is similar in the broader context. There are countries that have not yet introduced it. There are England and Japan,” Kim said at a press conference following the meeting. The comments shed light on the regulatory balancing act South Korea faces. On the one hand, the country recognizes the potential benefits of regulated Bitcoin ETFs, such as providing safer investment options for retail and institutional investors. On the other hand, authorities remain wary of the risks associated with cryptocurrency market volatility and potential financial crime. The push for regulatory clarity in South Korea comes at a time of political turmoil. The country’s crypto regulatory landscape has been evolving rapidly following the dramatic arrest of former President Yoon Suk Yeol on Jan. 15. Yoon was detained after allegedly attempting to impose martial law in the country, an event that has significantly reshaped the nation’s political scene. Despite the political turbulence, South Korea’s financial regulators have maintained their focus on strengthening crypto oversight. On Feb. 13, the Financial Services Commission announced new guidelines permitting universities and charitable organizations to sell cryptocurrency donations starting in the second half of 2025. The move marks a significant step in integrating digital assets into broader financial and philanthropic ecosystems. At the same time, enforcement actions against crypto platforms have continued. On Jan. 16, Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was served with a suspension notice for alleged violations of Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. In response, Upbit filed a lawsuit against South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit in an effort to overturn the sanctions, arguing that the regulatory action was overly restrictive. South Korea's Growing Crypto Market and ETF Potential South Korea is one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets, with more than 30% of its citizens reportedly investing in digital assets. The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies has fueled demand for regulated investment products like Bitcoin ETFs. If South Korea decides to approve Bitcoin ETFs, it could significantly boost institutional participation in the country’s crypto market. South Korea's interest in Bitcoin ETFs follows a broader global trend. The United States approved its first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, a landmark development that attracted billions of dollars in inflows. Similarly, other countries, including Hong Kong and Canada, have already introduced regulated Bitcoin ETFs. For South Korea, approving Bitcoin ETFs would provide investors with a more structured and transparent way to gain exposure to Bitcoin while benefiting from regulatory oversight. However, authorities remain cautious, weighing potential risks such as market manipulation, fraud, and investor protection concerns. While South Korea has not yet made a final decision on Bitcoin ETFs, ongoing discussions and Japan’s evolving stance could influence the country’s regulatory direction. If Japan proceeds with lifting its crypto ETF ban, South Korea may feel added pressure to follow suit, especially given its reputation as a global financial and technology hub. As regulatory conversations continue, the South Korean government is expected to take a measured approach, ensuring that any move toward Bitcoin ETF approval aligns with its broader financial stability goals. In the meantime, investors and industry stakeholders will be watching closely for further developments that could shape the future of crypto investment in the country. With global adoption of Bitcoin ETFs on the rise, the question remains: Will South Korea take the leap, or will it continue to observe from the sidelines? Mt. Gox Moves 12,000 Bitcoin Amid Market Volatility, Stirring Speculation on Creditor Repayments In other Bitcoin news, the long-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has once again made significant Bitcoin movements, transferring 12,000 BTC worth over $1 billion on March 6. The latest transfer, first flagged by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, comes amid a turbulent week in the crypto market, raising speculation about its implications for creditors awaiting long-overdue repayments. According to Arkham Intelligence, the Mt. Gox-linked wallet (1PuQB) conducted the large transfer with a transaction fee of just $1.64. As part of the transfer, 166.5 BTC—approximately $15 million—was moved to a Mt. Gox cold wallet (1Jbez), while the remaining 11,834 BTC was directed to an unidentified wallet (1Mo1n). This transaction marks the first notable Bitcoin movement from Mt. Gox-controlled wallets in a month. The previous transaction, in early February, saw just 4 BTC shuffled between cold wallets, an insignificant sum compared to the latest move. The motivations behind this transfer remain unclear, though it adds to a growing pattern of Bitcoin activity linked to the collapsed exchange. Mt. Gox-related wallets currently hold approximately 36,080 BTC, worth around $3.26 billion, per Arkham data. Past large-scale movements from these wallets have often preceded creditor repayments, fueling speculation that further distributions could be on the horizon. This is not the first time that Mt. Gox-related wallets have seen major movements in recent months. In December, the exchange transferred approximately 1,620 BTC through unknown wallets. Just two weeks earlier, it had moved more than 24,000 BTC—one of the largest transactions associated with the exchange in years. The timing of these transactions often raises concerns in the market, as creditors continue to await their long-overdue repayments. The official Mt. Gox trustee had previously extended the repayment deadline by a full year, pushing it back to Oct. 31, 2025. While the purpose of the latest transfer remains undisclosed, past transactions of this nature have sometimes been associated with preparatory movements for creditor distributions. Bitcoin's Volatility Amid Macroeconomic Uncertainty The timing of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin movement coincides with a week of heightened volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride, hitting a high of $94,770 on March 3 before plunging to $82,681 on March 4. Since then, it has rebounded. One key driver of this market turbulence has been geopolitical and macroeconomic factors. On March 4, new trade tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump took effect, rattling global markets and affecting high-risk assets like Bitcoin. While digital assets are often touted as a hedge against traditional financial instability, they remain highly sensitive to broader economic trends and policy shifts. With Bitcoin transfers from Mt. Gox-linked wallets making headlines once again, creditors are watching closely for any signs of progress in the repayment process. Although the official deadline for creditor distributions remains set for late 2025, the recent movements could hint at preparatory steps being taken behind the scenes. Given the significant number of Bitcoin still under Mt. Gox’s control, further transactions in the coming months could provide additional clues about the exchange’s repayment strategy. For now, the market remains on edge, with investors keeping a close eye on blockchain movements tied to the infamous exchange. As Bitcoin continues its volatile price swings, traders and creditors alike are left wondering: is this the beginning of long-awaited repayments, or just another chapter in the Mt. Gox saga?",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ASIA|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-06 09:30:00

Some market watchers suggested that its price could be preparing for a massive surge to a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Cardano 125% Pump Coming? Analyst Says ADA ‘Could Be Poised’ For Rally To $2.20 Stellar Getting Ready For 300% Breakout Stellar has seen a 9% surge in the past day, recovering from this week’s market dump and rallying to the $0.30 mark again. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Stellar could witness a 300% breakout soon as the cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish pattern. After the November 2024 breakout, XLM started to form a bullish flag, with the 600% post-US election rally forming the pattern’s flagpole. Since then, Stellar has been consolidating between the $0.63 and $0.25 price range, forming the pattern’s flag. Since hitting its 3-year high in December, XLM has seen a 52% price decrease, failing to break above its downtrend line. During the February market retraces, the cryptocurrency retraced nearly 40% from its monthly opening, hitting its lowest price action since November. Over the weekend, Stellar followed the rest of the crypto market, fueled by US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve comprised of “made in the USA” cryptocurrencies like XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). XLM surged around 25% from the range’s lower levels to $0.37, retesting the $0.35 key resistance. The $0.32-$0-35 range has been a key zone for the cryptocurrency since the Q4 2024 breakout, serving as a crucial support level until turning into resistance in February. As the analyst pointed out, “A sustained break above the $0.42 resistance could trigger a bull run to $1.60.” Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency’s recent performance has failed to reclaim a key level in the mid-zone of its 3-month price range. XLM Following 2017’s Playbook? XLM failed to hold the $0.35 level amid the Monday market dump, retracing 20% and erasing the Sunday gains. Breaking above this resistance could send Stellar’s price to the bull flag’s upper range while failing to reclaim it could send the price to the pattern’s lower range between $0.20 and $0.23. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency continued bleeding and retested its recent lows as support. XLM bounced from $0.27 above the $0.30 level on Wednesday morning, attempting to reclaim it. Technical Analyst Charting Guy highlighted that XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently broke out of a 96-day downtrend “while price consolidated in the golden pocket with time capitulation getting to people.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price ‘Between Heaven And Hell’: $2,000 Level Retest Key For ETH’s Next Move He also noted that XLM’s bull flag “coincidentally targets” the 1.272 Fibonacci level at around $2.46. After its recent performance, the cryptocurrency appears to be following its 2017 pattern, which adds “more confluence to 1.272 fib target,” he explained. In Q4 2017, Stellar saw a similar price breakout, followed by a consolidation period within a bullish flag. XLM then broke out of this pattern and rose over 190% to ATH in early 2018. To the analyst, “Once we break above the top of the golden pocket, it’s game on.” At the time of writing, Stellar trades at $0.30, a 2.4% increase in the weekly timeframe.

The markets rallied, buoyed by positive news from the White House, while plummeting sharply due to stringent steps taken in trade with other countries. Meanwhile, the ongoing manipulation phase has happened previously in the past, which has resulted in a massive explosion. Hence, the BTC price appears to have reached the edge, which could elevate the levels towards a new ATH soon. The BTC price has been trading within a narrow range, suggesting the bulls could be accumulating strength before the next price action. With a rise above $90,000, the price has seen a momental shift and is expected to trigger a strong bullish trend if it rises above the pivot. Currently, Bitcoin has entered one of the most important ranges ahead of the White House Crypto Summit. Hence, the revelation about the Crypto Statergic Reserve is expected to kick off a strong rally, probably above the psychological barrier at $94,200 initially and later close to $99,000. The Bitcoin price has remained stuck within a defined price range between the 200-day & 50-day MA, which are acting as strong support and resistance at the moment. Although the price rebounded from the support, the bullish validation has yet to occur, which could take some more time. The BMSB is about to flip to bullish as the levels are heading towards a bullish crossover. However, the RSI remains stuck below the descending trend line, which has been a strong resistance from long. A rise above the line may only validate a change in the trend, and until then, the token may remain consolidated below $93,300. The next few days are expected to be highly volatile as the upcoming Crypto Summit is hosted by the U.S. President, Donald Trump. Almost all the crypto personalities, including the founders & CEOs of Ripple, Cardano, Ethereum, etc., and many more, are expected to be part of it. Moreover, the president is expected to reveal a Bitcoin Statergic Reserve, which is expected to increase the market volatility. On the other hand, Trump’s World Liberty Financial bought $10 million worth of BTC, ETH, & MOVE, which raises the possibility of a breakout. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is expected to receive yet another bullish boost soon after the summit that may elevate the levels above the bearish influence.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ETH|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 09:34:06

The fund's distributions are primarily return-of-capital, making it tax-efficient but volatile, with income dependent on Bitcoin's volatility. Compared to MAXI, YBTC's capped upside limits its potential, making it less attractive despite its higher yield and frequent payouts. Aggressive investors might consider a small allocation in YBTC, but conservative investors should avoid it; I rate YBTC a hold. Introduction Recently, I covered a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) income fund called MAXI. After that article, I began to hear about other Bitcoin income ETFs, and in particular the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF (YBTC) came up several times. I'm always searching for ETFs to build better portfolios with, and if this fund could replace MAXI in my portfolio, it's worth taking a look at. As far as I can tell, YBTC is the oldest Bitcoin covered call ETF on the market, so it has that going for it at the very least. Launched a little over a year ago in January 2024, YBTC has performed decently, returning 42% to shareholders in total return (which includes dividends paid, but not reinvested), and losing a little under 14% in price. This kind of erosion is expected for covered call funds, typically, and returns are expected to come primarily in the form of distributions. Data by YCharts Compared to BTC itself, the fund found itself lacking somewhat, returning less than half what BTC did over the same timeframe. That is to say, however, that owning BTC does not necessarily produce income on its own. While YBTC underperformed on the total return front, it did produce a very high yield all the while. YBTC Dividends & Yield YCharts only allows me to show TTM (""trailing twelve months"") distribution rates, so this is zoomed into 2025, since there is no data from before that due to how young the fund is. The current rate, based on the TTM formula , is almost at 55%, having previously reached a high of nearly 57%. Data by YCharts The distributions come weekly, which can be relevant to some investors, especially those needing the income in order to pay for expenses, and prefer the weekly cash infusions over monthly like MAXI pays. In the two charts below, the ""D"" symbol denotes a distribution event. Data by YCharts The fund has only been paying weekly since 2025, and issued dividends monthly before that. That's why the actual dividends will be much higher than current ones, which are lower per payment since there are more of them. When looking at the full version of that chart, going back to inception, we see the older dividends at a much higher rate. Don't expect the fund to go back to those anytime soon, unless they go back to monthly distributions. The average of $0.50/share is much closer to the norm moving forward than the all-time $1.308/share average dividend. Data by YCharts The fund is actively managed, meaning that its dividends will be volatile, sometimes going as high as it was in April 2024, or as low as recently, a massive gap even when adjusting for the change from monthly to weekly payments. When looking at yields, make sure you understand which metric you are looking at for the fund, and what it represents. YCharts uses TTM, but the Roundhill website seems to be using a FWD or ""forward"" metric, as it advertises a far lower rate. Roundhill Investments Also, note the very low 30-Day SEC Yield. This is due to the way that rate is calculated, which only includes distributions of investment income. This means that the options income, premium received from the covered call strategy, doesn't count as it is classified as return-of-capital (""RoC"") when distributed to shareholders. YBTC Tax Considerations When looking at the YBTC 19a-1 forms, where they classify their distributions, we see that returns from the last distribution were entirely RoC. Roundhill Investments They did experience a year-end investment income distribution, paid out on 12/31. This should be expected for the future end-of-year dividends as well, but the other weekly distributions will likely continue to be RoC. Roundhill Investments RoC isn't a bad thing, necessarily; this is not the fund just paying shareholders their own capital, it is how options premium is accounted for. Options premium distributions are taxable as RoC, and so Roundhill among other managers distributing options-based ETFs are opting to keep their distributions as close to 100% RoC as possible. It just changes how taxes are paid. Distributions that include RoC are counted against the cost-basis of your shares, and only create a taxable event when you sell those shares. This means that the income is tax-deferred until the sale of the shares, or until your cost-basis becomes zero. If you get to zero on your cost-basis, new RoC distributions would be considered long-term capital gains, according to this IRS publication . A nondividend distribution reduces the basis of your stock. It is not taxed until your basis in the stock is fully recovered. This nontaxable portion also is called a return of capital; it is a return of your investment in the stock of the company. If you buy stock in a corporation in different lots at different times, and you cannot definitely identify the shares subject to the nondividend distribution, reduce the basis of your earliest purchases first. When the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, report any additional nondividend distribution you receive as a capital gain. Whether you report it as a long-term or short-term capital gain depends on how long you have held the stock... Example 1. You bought stock in 2010 for $100. In 2013, you received a nondividend distribution of $80. You did not include this amount in your income, but you reduced the basis of your stock to $20. You received a nondividend distribution of $30 in 2023. The first $20 of this amount reduced your basis to zero. You report the other $10 as a long-term capital gain for 2023. You must report as a long-term capital gain any nondividend distribution you receive on this stock in later years. Of course, this is only relevant to investors holding this fund outside a tax-advantaged account. It does mean that YBTC is ""tax-efficient,"" so to speak, because it offers investors the flexibility of choosing when to create the taxable event, and at what may be a lower rate, depending on your tax situation. For most folks, their long-term capital gains tax rate will be lower than their income tax rate. YBTC Strategy & Holdings Followers of mine should have seen me write about the YieldMax family funds before. Roundhill operates essentially the same strategy as YieldMax funds do, which is that they open synthetic long positions using bought calls and sold puts on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and the Bitcoin US ETF Index ( CBTX ), and sells call against those positions. If you want a deeper explanation and breakdown for this strategy, I suggest reading my article on AMZY , a YieldMax fund with the same principal strategy. This strategy results in YBTC's holdings looking like this, entirely options. Presumably, they are also holding 100% of NAV in cash to secure all of these options. That is also presumably where the net investment income is coming from in the year-end distributions. Roundhill Investments YBTC Risks There are several risks associated with this fund that investors need to consider when investing in YBTC. The first is that its upside exposure to Bitcoin is capped. Roundhill publishes the cap daily on its website . This shows us how much upside is left on the contracts traded; the fund is actively managed and trades essentially every day. Holdings and the caps are updated daily on the website, however, so it's relatively easy to keep track of if one wanted to do that. Roundhill Investments This cap is what leads to the inevitable underperformance of most of these kinds of funds to their reference assets, because they still incur all the downside of the reference asset, only buoyed by the income received. Data by YCharts They often lose more than they gain, since the gains are capped, which leads to losses that grind down the fund's price over time. Data by YCharts There is also great risk in the options strategy, as it is complex and is subject to price changes based on the underlying options math as opposed to spot exposure. Consider that volatility in the underlying asset, Bitcoin, creates higher premiums for YBTC, and thus more income. However, the opposite is also true, in that low volatility leads to lower income. Volatility can change the return profile of the fund dramatically, which is not present in holding Bitcoin on its own. One of the reasons I prefer MAXI is due to it not having an upside cap on BTC, and instead generating its income from options spread sold on indices and commodities. That has led to periodic outperformance and underperformance of Bitcoin itself, whereas YBTC has only trailed the asset. Data by YCharts Investors need to be comfortable with the possibility of this continuing, as well as the risk of inconsistent dividends due to their value being reliant on Bitcoin's volatility. Investors will have a very hard time anticipating future incomes because of this. Suitability I am recommending that investors carefully consider YBTC. Aggressive investors could consider up to a 3% allocation in a diversified portfolio, and moderate investors could consider up to a 1% allocation. Conservative investors are cautioned to stay away from cryptocurrencies entirely, let alone Bitcoin funds that sell options like YBTC. In my own portfolio, MAXI holds a 2.5% allocation. You can check that out here . I am giving YBTC a hold rating as I believe it is doing its job of generating Bitcoin income, but that a better alternative in MAXI exists that doesn't suffer from the same cap to Bitcoin. Conclusion Ultimately, the Roundhill Bitcoin Income Strategy ETF ( YBTC ) is a very high yield opportunity, and one that may pay off, but may not. Its upside cap to Bitcoin is very low, considering how volatile Bitcoin itself is, and its volatility toward the upside is one of the primary benefits to owning it in the first place. YBTC earns a hold because I believe that we have a better ETF on the marketplace for this job, but I can see why some investors would be interested in the fund for its high, weekly distributions. A rate of 55% is nothing to sneeze at, and YBTC is one of few funds that can claim that they distribute income every week.

Caitlin Long – Building the Bridge Between Traditional and Digital Banking Last but not least, Caitlin Long is one of the top women crypto personalities in the world. She is a veteran Wall Street executive with over 20 years of experience and later joined the crypto space as a crypto banking innovator. Long founded the Custodian Bank, a Wyoming-based bank that is both a digital asset custodian and a traditional financial institution. As a digital asset custodian, it manages keys and tokens and provides conventional banking services. Final Thoughts This blog mentioned six of the most influential women in the crypto space, but there are many more who have done equally appreciative work. These women have shaped the DeFi industry, and their role goes far beyond holding digital assets. With their vision for development, they will play a significant role in expanding and evolving the crypto industry. So, on Women’s Day, let’s celebrate the pioneers who are building the future of finance and influencing others to do the same.

The expected easing comes as markets reprice at least three Fed rate cuts for 2025 and Germany and China take the fiscal easing route to shore up their respective economies. In other words, the ECB's impending easing could only add to the ongoing global liquidity easing, offering bullish cues to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. ""Overall, liquidity conditions are supportive and rising, to keep risk and crypto pushing higher, despite this recent correction on growth concerns,"" founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoclub said in Thursday's edition. Volatile bond markets The European Union's headline inflation is still not at the central bank's target of 2%, which raises concerns about the impending rate cut and its impact on the European bond markets. Germany’s 10-year bund has climbed to 2.8%, its highest since 2011, pricing in more supply in the wake of Germany's fiscal stimulus announcement. The spike has narrowed the U.S.-German yield spread in favor of the euro, driving the dollar index lower. That, coupled with the tariff threat, has the DXY index falling faster than in President Trump's first term. The U.K. bond yields have also topped those of the U.S. Meanwhile, Japan’s 10-year bond has surpassed 1.5%, a 17-year high, as the Bank of Japan struggles to rein in inflation after three rate hikes after almost ten years of negative interest rates.

He believes that a crypto reserve will lead to the failure of decentralization once the government is put in charge of it. Yakovenko proposed that the state should run its own reserve as a hedge against the Fed making a mistake.

No reserve, because if you want decentralization to fail you’d put the government in charge of it. 2. Or states run their own reserve as a hedge against the fed making a mistake 3. Or if there has to be a reserve, it’s based on objectively… https://t.co/LfYXCIeRnG — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) March 6, 2025 Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has distanced himself from a potential crypto reserve in the United States and gave his reserve order of preference. He argued that a crypto reserve could eradicate decentralization once the U.S. government is put in charge of it. “I don’t care what they are, they can even be constructed such that only bitcoin satisfies them right now, they just must be objectively measurable and rationally justified.” -Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs Yakovenko also added that the United States could run its own crypto reserve as a hedge against the Fed making a mistake in the future. He believes that the state should base the reserve on objectively measurable requirements if there has to be a reserve. The crypto firm co-founder also highlighted that the Solana ecosystem will get it done “if there is a target to beat.” Crypto analytic platform Polymarket estimated that 64% of Bitcoin is being used as a U.S. reserve, with Ethereum following at 42%. The firm also identified the chances of XRP and SOL being included for a reserve at 29% and 28%, respectively. The crypto industry is bracing for the White House Crypto Summit on Friday to get further details on the makeup of the reserve, including whether additional tokens will be added. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick mentioned that a Bitcoin strategic reserve was something Trump was interested in since he spoke about it all during his campaign trial. Lutnick believes that the other tokens “will be treated differently –positively, but differently.” Ripple pitches to Trump to include SOL in the crypto reserve plan Crypto journalist Laura Shin mentioned that Ripple pitched SOL as part of a national reserve in the United States. Shin argued that sources familiar with the conversations revealed that Ripple made the move to make the inclusion of XRP in a reserve seem more legitimate. Two sources familiar with the matter disclosed that Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty reportedly pitched to the President to include SOL in the crypto reserve plan announced on Sunday. Both Ripple executives argued that the inclusion of Solana will give it more legitimacy among the crypto community. The incorporation of Solana as a reserve helped the digital asset firm convey that it was advocating for a crypto reserve that included other virtual tokens. The crypto firm issuer of the XRP token has gained criticism over the years for being a speculative asset with insufficient usage to justify its $145 billion market capitalization. Trump mentioned three tokens, XRP, SOL, and ADA, for potential crypto reserves, but the tokens are not considered stores of value. The inclusion of the tokens has raised questions from Ripple leaders about whether the reserve is a serious project and if it will accumulate large gains. The leaders were also wondering if the reserve is simply a way to give early investors and the insiders behind the tokens a public relations boost. Garlinghouse said on Sunday that the crypto industry will achieve its goals and beyond “IF WE WORK TOGETHER.” He also appreciated the President’s vision of a government digital asset reserve representative of the industry. Ripple’s CEO said that “maximalism is the enemy of the industry’s progress” and was glad to see the U.S. finally moving past Bill Hinman and Biden’s SEC’s “very broken thinking.” National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden raised his concerns about Solana’s venture capital influence in November last year. He called out Solana’s reliance on venture capital and suggested that it compromised the network’s decentralization. Snowden also described the digital asset as “born in prison,” implying that its independence on VC funding could limit its autonomy and alignment with blockchain’s principles.

Analysts see parallels to 2017, predicting a potential surge to somewhat ridiculous levels. On the other hand, some warn of a bearish H&S pattern, suggesting a pullback unless XRP clears $2.85. What Could Be Next for XRP? Despite the experienced volatility, Ripple’s native token remains one of the best-performing leading cryptocurrencies, with its price soaring by almost 15% in the past week and currently trading at around $2.57. Perhaps the most evident factor contributing to its rally is Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration will create a strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP (among other assets). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Pro-Ripple market observers (who are usually quite vocal) have noted the token’s resurgence and made interesting price forecasts for the near future. The X user JAVON MARKS suggested that the pattern XRP broke out of in November 2024 resembles that of 2017. As such, the analyst expects a bull run “greater than many think or even imagine to possible.” CrediBULL Crypto said the asset’s valuation has declined by 15% from where they took profit, and the trader now doubts they will get another chance to increase their exposure at prices below $2. “OI has completely reset back to levels it was at before our 5x impulse off the lows, spot premium is steadily increasing here at the highs, and funding is even flipping negative,” they stated. Overall, the analyst claimed that XRP looks “incredibly healthy here, and any dips that we may get are a gift.” For their part, EGRAG CRYPTO recently outlined a truly shocking prediction. The X user maintained that XRP could be gearing up for its next “big leap” due to several factors, such as a retest of “the bull market support band” and a “noise consolidation” at the $2-$3.40 range. They reminded that in 2017, the coin followed “a classic Fib extension move, smashing Fib 1.618, consolidating, then making another parabolic move to Fib 2.236.” The analyst thinks that if history repeats, this could result in a price explosion in the $27-$222 range. Such high levels would require XRP’s market cap to skyrocket to at least $1.5 trillion. The current capitalization of the asset is less than $150 billion, making the prediction somewhat unlikely. A Reversal in the Cards? Contrary to the overall bullishness among industry participants focusing on XRP, some believe a pullback is not out of the question. One X user recently suggested that the asset’s pattern remains on “H&S watch,” envisioning a potential bearish reversal. The market observer claimed that XRP should soar above $2.85 to negate the chances of a correction.

BTC rose to $92,700 before profit-taking saw it decline to $90,800 in European morning hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) surged as much as 10% to lead gains among majors, with Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and ether (ETH) rising 6%. XRP and BNB Chain’s bnb showed muted gains with a 2.5% jump, underperforming a 3.5% rise in the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) . Thursday’s price action helped buoy bulls after crypto markets roller-coasted this week as President Donald Trump revealed plans for a strategic reserve of tokens, including XRP, ADA and ETH, on Sunday, sending the market higher by 12%. But that euphoria was doused as traders awaited concrete plans and a fresh round of U.S. tariffs went into play, with broader markets retracting on Tuesday. There has been a steady ascend in crypto markets, in line with a CoinDesk analysis , as watchers expect clear plans to emerge at Saturday’s summit. “Investors view this as an asymmetric event with high stakes,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in Wednesday broadcast message, referring to the summit. “Will it serve as the unexpected catalyst that sends prices soaring, or will it expose crypto’s fragility and trigger a deeper sell-off?” “Lens out. Corporate bond spreads are widening, with high-yield spreads now sitting at 290 bps above Treasuries, while the investment-grade vs. high-yield spread stands at 200 bps. While this isn't signaling panic, it's a trend worth monitoring closely,” QCP cautioned. FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich noted that bitcoin's share of the crypto market exceeds 60%, which is typical in periods of fear, while ether’s share has dropped to a five-year low of 9% — a troubling sign for altcoin investors as any inflows are bound for BTC. “Bitcoin continues to flirt with the 200-day MA, popping out on Tuesday shortly after touching that level below $83,000. Wednesday morning's market dynamics reflect cautious attempts to form a bottom,” Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email. “A return to the area above the 50-day at $97,000 is a marker of bullish success,” he added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|XRP|ADA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 09:40:54

Expert Insights,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-price-surge-is-now-the-perfect-time-to-invest-expert-insights/,"The post XRP Price Surge: Is Now the Perfect Time to Invest? Expert Insights appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the start of this month, the XRP market has seen a growth of 18.45%. On the second day of the month alone, the market surged by approximately 34.08%. In the last seven days, with an impressive growth of 13.4% , it has outperformed top cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB and Solana. A video recently shared on X by a crypto expert, identified as STEPH IS CRYPTO, suggests that it is the ideal time to enter the XRP market. Here is everything one should know about his commentary! XRP’s Bullish Chart Pattern The crypto expert pointed out that a falling wedge pattern has formed in the XRP market. A falling wedge is a chart pattern where the price action is consolidating between two downward-sloping trendlines. This pattern is generally considered bullish, meaning it often precedes a price breakout to the upside. The expert advised investors to ignore the fake breakouts, like the one occurred on March 2. He asserted that if the XRP price closes above the $2.5 level , the next target could be as high as $3.38. Short Squeeze Could Push XRP Higher Projecting the current Binance XRP/USDT Liquidation Heatmap chart signal, which shows the concentration of a significant amount of liquidity in short positions, the expert noted that many traders are betting on XRP’s price to decline. He opined that if market makers target this liquidity, it could trigger a short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when a rapid price increase forces traders with short positions to buy XRP to cover their losses. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Ripple vs SEC Lawsuits To Resolve in March Hint Pro-XRP Lawyer , Fear & Greed Index Suggests a Buying Opportunity #XRP : 3 REASONS TO GO ALL IN NOW!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/cMsAT98Dp2 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) March 5, 2025 The Crypto Fear and Greed Index now stands at 25. This figure indicates that fear is the dominant feeling among crypto traders right now. Yesterday, the index was at 20. Last week, it was at 10. The expert invited attention to this index. Historically, extreme fear leads to price rebounds. In conclusion, XRP is showing signs of a bullish breakout , and market conditions suggest a potential price rally.

Russia ‘s largest and sanctioned cryptocurrency exchange Garantex has temporarily shut down all of its services after Tether froze over 2.5 billion rubles worth of USDT. “Dear users! We have bad news,” Garantex said in a March 6 statement on Telegram. “Tether has waged war against the Russian crypto market and blocked our wallets for more than 2.5 billion rubles.” The exchange announced it is “temporarily suspending all services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals,” while its team works to resolve the issue. “We are fighting and will not give up!” it added. Garantex also warned Russian users that “all USDT in Russian wallets is now at risk.” As of press time, Tether made no public statements on the move. The stablecoin issuer has previously faced scrutiny for its transactions with Russian-linked entities.

Despite the restrictions, it continued operations, serving Russian users via sanctioned Russian banks. The shutdown follows the European Union’s recent decision to add Garantex to its sanctions list, part of a broader effort to target financial networks linked to Moscow. U.S. Treasury’s OFAC first blacklisted Garantex in April 2022, citing its role in processing transactions tied to illicit actors and darknet markets, including funds linked to the Russian Ransomware-as-a-Service group Conti and the now-defunct Hydra marketplace.

While Bitcoin soared past $90,000, altcoins also exploded: the XRP coin retested $3, while the SHIB coin targeted a breakout above $0.000015. Amid this bullish outlook, demand for new AI coins like IntelMarkets (INTL) exploded. Offering a cushion against market shocks and promising significant gains as a low-cap, it has been dubbed the best ICO to invest in. In addition, its quantum-proof crypto custody solution sets it apart from popular trading protocols—the next-gen exchange. IntelMarkets (INTL): Introducing the First Quantum-Proof Crypto Custody Solution IntelMarkets (INTL) stands out for its innovative blend of AI and DeFi. Aiming to transform the $36 billion crypto trading scene, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels, not forgetting its quantum-proof crypto custody solution. Meanwhile, it has higher growth prospects than the SHIB coin and XRP coin, contributing to the rising demand. In the tenth stage of the ICO, over $11.2 million has been raised in early funding, with a token priced at $0.091. Experts consider it a steal at the current price, tipped for a 55x rally after Tier-1 exchange listings. With plenty of room to run, it is among the best altcoins to invest in—a must-have this cycle. Besides its future growth, it intends to transform the crypto trading landscape. It will introduce the first quantum-proof crypto custody solution: the Quantum X wallet. Designed to address the risk from the advancement in quantum computing, it has been called a trailblazer. At the same time, it will feature the first native AI blockchain and advanced trading bots trained on over 100,000 data points. Ripple (XRP): Shaking Off Bearish Pressure The XRP coin wasn’t unscathed during the latest bloodbath, retesting lower price levels. However, with the bull back, it retested $3, although now hovers around $2.6 after a slight decline. Meanwhile, top analysts are optimistic, maintaining a bullish stance. Cdelipa, a leading expert, expects the XRP coin price to reach $5 in the next 3 months. Meanwhile, TylieEric suggests a bounce in the XRP coin price after the recent correction, targeting a rally toward $10 and $15. Also, technical indicators like the 200-SMA and 100-EMA signal a bounce in the XRP coin price. Despite the potential upswing, investors are betting more on IntelMarkets (INTL) due to its upside. The emerging cryptocurrency defies broader bearish trends and with plenty of room to run, it is among the best coins to invest in this year. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Targeting the $0.000015 Support The memecoin sector was hit the hardest during the latest market decline. However, an overall market rally pushed the SHIB coin upward. It retains around $0.000014 and is on track to flip $0.000015 into support Given bullish technical indicators like the 9-HMA and neutral RSI, the SHIB coin might experience further upswings. Also, top analysts like Smellyrino suggest a rally toward $0.000016 during its next leg up. Cr0w_agent, sharing a similar sentiment, targets a big leap in the SHIB coin price in the coming days. However, considering the rising interest in IntelMarkets, a top ICO, it might be a better bet than the SHIB coin. Moreover, it has higher growth prospects as a low-cap—perhaps the best new crypto to invest in. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Crypto Unicorn After Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP) Buzzing with optimism, IntelMarkets (INTL) has been hailed as the next big thing. Its bullish AI narrative and quantum-proof crypto custody solution put it in the spotlight. It experiences rising demand despite SHIB coin and XRP coin soaring, poised for a 55x rally after listing.

Kate Cooper, the newly appointed CEO of OKX Australia, believes the election could be a pivotal moment for institutional participation in the digital asset sector. In a recent interview , Cooper expressed hope that long-awaited crypto legislation—two years in the making—will finally see the light of day. She noted that the industry has been demanding clear and fit-for-purpose regulations, which could open the doors for greater institutional involvement. Institutional Crypto Adoption Ahead? “There is already an inflow of retail users thanks to the current bull market,” she said, adding that a well-defined regulatory framework would encourage large financial institutions to enter the space with confidence. Cooper’s background positions her as a key voice in this discussion. Before joining OKX, she worked at two major Australian banks—NAB and Westpac—where she focused on digital assets and innovation. She also previously served as the Australian CEO of Zodia Custody, an institutional crypto platform. “Certainly, when I was at NAB, the key barrier to really entering or moving beyond the proof-of-concept stage was regulatory clarity,” she emphasized. Crypto Voters Could Influence Election Outcome in Australia With the election expected to be closely contested, crypto investors could play a crucial role in deciding the next government. A YouGov poll conducted on February 19 revealed that 59% of current crypto holders are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports digital assets. The race is tight, with the center-right coalition currently leading 51% to 49% against the ruling center-left Labor party, according to another YouGov poll. Whichever party secures victory may have a significant influence on shaping Australia’s approach to crypto regulation. Cooper predicts that if the winning party implements new crypto laws, stablecoin adoption in Australia could surge. She pointed out that stablecoins have already seen massive global adoption in 2024, with $27.6 trillion in annual transfer volume—outpacing Visa and Mastercard combined. While Australia currently has no plans to create a national crypto reserve , Cooper believes the country needs a clear strategy to cement its position in the digital economy.

Following its brief recovery to $170 after the US strategic crypto reserve fund was announced, the altcoin price has dropped back to the $140 region. Similarly, the DOGE price has fallen to the $0.2 level. On the flip side, IntelMarkets (INTL) has remained resilient. It has weaved through the bear market, giving early investors 900% returns on their investments. As a new-generation AI-based trading platform, IntelMarkets could be the next big thing in the investment market. Its price is expected to skyrocket by 20x after launch, positioning it as the best crypto investment now. Solana (SOL) Price Drops As Strategic Fund Loses Steam Over the past week, the Solana price has witnessed high volatility. Bears and bulls have been battling for dominance. The Solana price dipped to lows of $120. However, the announcement of a strategic crypto reserve fund by President Donald Trump triggered a massive Solana price pump. As a result of the announcement, the Solana price briefly crossed the $190 mark. However, as the hype faded, the Solana price returned back to lows at $140. For the bulls to return, the Solana price must form a strong support above $150. According to CENK, the Solana price could skyrocket to $280 in the next few weeks. Another expert, called Trader Tardigrade, says a big Solana price move is coming. He noted that the current oversold RSI had propelled the Solana price to new levels in the past. Trader Tardigrade expects the altcoin price to soar to $440 in the coming months. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Drop, Number Of New Addresses Plummets Dogecoin (DOGE) briefly enjoyed the price pump from the strategic crypto reserve, rising to $0.24. DOGE being classified as a collectible by the SEC also played a part in the increase. However, the memecoin has been on the decline. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the DOGE price has plummeted by 17.8% on the weekly chart. The memecoin now trades at the $0.200 range. In addition to the DOGE price drop, there has been a massive decline in the number of new addresses created on the Dogecoin network. In a recent tweet, Ali Martinez posted a chart from Glassnode, which revealed that over 1.29 million addresses were created on November 21, 2024. However, the figure dipped to 30,815 on February 23, 2025. Looking ahead, market experts like Olivier D Maximus say the DOGE price could increase soon. According to him, the DOGE price is trading in an ascending channel and is at the lower part. Olivier notes that the DOGE price has to cross $0.3350 for an uptrend to begin. If this happens, the DOGE price might soar to $0.65 in the next few weeks. IntelMarkets (INTL) Brings Advanced Tools To Retail Traders IntelMarkets (INTL) is revolutionizing the cryptocurrency trading market through the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized finance (DeFi). This new platform provides traders with market analysis and trading tools that were previously available only to large investors. IntelMarkets has a decentralized marketplace for AI agents. The marketplace provides ready-to-use agents that are built for high performance and can find opportunities and make trades in the market. It also has customizable agents that can be set to suit the investor’s needs and objectives for investment and trading. Another proof of IntelMarkets’ focus on the implementation of advanced technologies is the cooperation with NVIDIA. The platform uses NVIDIA’s H200 GPUs to guarantee real-time updates and trading experience. This improves the AI platform as it helps in the fast analysis of large data sources to give traders the right information. Meanwhile, IntelMarkets has a native token called INTL. It is currently in the presale stage and is priced at $0.091. With over $11.2 million raised, IntelMarkets is one of the best DeFi projects to watch out for. IntelMarkets Tagged As the Next Best Crypto To Buy While the Solana price continues its range-bound movement, IntelMarkets stands out as the next moonshot coin. Its AI trading tools and adoption of advanced technologies have piqued the interest of investors. Notably, only those who join the crypto ICO now can get the highest returns after launch.

For instance, it is clear DOGE bears remain strong with its value on a downtrend. Meanwhile, XRP managed to see some green charts thanks to the recent Donald Trump announcement for a US crypto reserve which will feature this token. , Although market experts like CryptoELITES and Captain Faibik remain optimistic for DOGE and XRP, all eyes are on a new presale token, IntelMarkets (INTL) . Since it was recently listed on CoinMarketCap, millions of new traders gravitated towards this phase ten presale star. As it aims to redefine crypto trading forever, many investors think it may have a higher upside potential than DOGE and XRP. IntelMarkets (INTL) Skyrockets 911% in Value Months Before Listing While the Dogecoin price and the price of Ripple are showing some volatility, IntelMarkets (INTL) is gaining all the attention – for a good reason. This altcoin was recently listed on CoinMarketCap which is a bullish development for any token. As a result, millions of new traders could gravitate to this project. Hype was already high for IntelMarkets, as it will bring something innovative to crypto trading—the first AI-driven trading platform. On it, traders will get to experience self-learning robots that improve their performance over time, as well as the Intell-M® channel analysis tool, which provides consolidated insights from 10K data platforms. With all these features, IntelMarkets could stand out from its rivals like Coinbase. The INTL native token will power this platform. Holding this token brings governance voting rights and access to new IntelMarkets features first. Thus, over 8M INTL tokens have been sold in phase ten of its presale. Currently, INTL costs just $0.091, a 911% rise from its starting price of $0.009. But, this altcoin price will increase to $0.10 in the next phase and go on to $0.11 once a Tier-1 CEX lists it. That’s an easy 20% profit and much more coming. CryptoELITES: The Dogecoin Price Could Hit $5 Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the best meme coins, but its value has dropped. CoinMarketCap shows that the Dogecoin price fell over 35% on the one-month chart. Its value moved between $0.30 and below $0.20 during that time. However, crypto analyst CryptoELITES remains bullish on Dogecoin (DOGE). According to his X post, this meme coin has started its big move and may see a breakout soon. As per CryptoELITES, the long-term target for the Dogecoin price sits at $5. Although this Dogecoin price prediction is turning some heads, many investors are looking at INTL instead. The Dogecoin price will grow slower as its market cap is around $30B. This means DOGE will need a lot of new money to roll in. The Price of Ripple (XRP) Could See a Rally, Expert Claims Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is showing some slight gains on the price charts. In the past seven days, its value has jumped from around $2.10 to over $2.30. In other words, as per CoinMarketCap, the price of Ripple increased nearly 10% in just a few days. The community is still watching Ripple (XRP) because of what analysts like Captain Faibik said. Notably, Faibik made an X post saying that the price of Ripple may jump more since it has formed a bullish pennant on its daily timeframe. He foresees a 100% rally for the price of Ripple. Some traders are still skeptical about the movement of the price of Ripple. This is because its value has surged over 250% on the YTD chart. Therefore, its highest upswings may have passed. Because of this, traders are turning to INTL more. Is IntelMarkets (INTL) Set to Outpace Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP)? With the Dogecoin price and the price of Ripple both remaining in limbo, the door has opened for IntelMarkets (INTL) to gain attention. This project will stand out from DOGE and XRP as it has a smaller market cap. As a result, INTL will see faster price gains with less money. Unlike these top altcoins, INTL is also tied to the AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. Thus, its long-term growth potential and stability look amazing. Due to all these factors, some investors think INTL has a higher upside potential than DOGE and XRP. If it manages to see the same growth as other exchange tokens like BNB did, its upcoming 20% growth could just be the tip of the iceberg.

Announced on Mar. 6 on Solv Protocol’s official Medium page, this partnership aims to bridge Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum’s ( ETH ) expanding decentralized finance ecosystems. Through this integration, SolvBTC holders can stake their assets, earn rewards, and access cross-chain liquidity within the Soneium ecosystem. SolvBTC is a token that is 1:1 backed by Bitcoin, earned when users deposit Bitcoin into Solv Protocol. Furthermore, SolvBTC Liquid Staking Tokens, SolvBTC.LSTs, will make advanced yield strategies possible, improving Bitcoin users’ scalability and flexibility. A key part of the initiative is Solv’s Staking Abstraction Layer, which makes it easier to stake on several blockchains. SAL enables Bitcoin owners to participate in DeFi more easily, extending the cryptocurrency’s capabilities beyond simple holding or trading.

Solana's (SOL) dramatic climb from a few pennies to over $200 demonstrated how high-potential blockchain businesses can generate life-changing returns. Top Solana investors are now acquiring Rexas Finance (RXS), a new cryptocurrency priced below $0.30. Many wonder whether it can mirror SOL's amazing run. Early Solana Rally: A Case Study in Explosive Growth. Solana hit the market in 2020 for a mere $0.22 per token. Few investors recognized its potential then, but its groundbreaking proof-of-history (PoH) consensus and rapid transaction speed immediately distinguished it from competitors. By the end of 2021, having surged to an all-time high of $260, SOL had generated over 118,000% gains in less than two years. Early acceptance by institutional investors, ecosystem expansion, and Solana's capacity to manage 65,000 transactions per second at a fraction of Ethereum's cost helped explain Solana's ascent. As the need for scalable blockchain applications developed, Solana positioned itself as the preferred choice over Ethereum, propelling its price into uncharted territory. Investors are looking for the next high-potential blockchain business, and Rexas Finance is a good contender. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Unique Newcomer with Massive Potential. Rexas Finance, like Solana, is entering the market with innovative utility. Unlike hype-only coins, Rexas Finance focuses on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, offering a tangible use case predicted to dominate the next wave of cryptocurrency adoption. Rexas Finance allows users to tokenize real estate, commodities, and financial instruments at its foundation, making them more accessible, liquid, and transparent. The platform includes a no-code token generator, which enables organizations and people to establish blockchain-based assets easily. Utility: The Key to Long-Term Success Solana's scalability helped it flourish. Rexas Finance stands out by emphasizing the tokenization of tangible assets, which will be a $50 billion sector by 2025 and rise to $16 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance's cross-chain capability makes it a versatile and easily accessible platform for global investors. Rexas Finance has included a capability to manufacture and trade asset-backed NFTs via Rexas Gen AI offers. These NFTs let investors engage in high-value assets without full ownership expenses by representing ownership of fractionalized real estate, fine art, and commodities. Furthermore, new blockchain initiatives have a unique venue on the Rexas Launchpad to raise money and start effectively. Like Solana's early adopters, this function provides early investors access to high-potential entrepreneurs and allows them to engage in verified initiatives at the ground level. Rexas Finance also provides staking and liquidity mining services through token ownership, enabling users to generate passive revenue. Staking RXS tokens allows investors to profit from yield farming, governance involvement, and ecosystem incentives, developing a strong incentive to hold and help maintain the integrity of the network. Strategic Decisions: Setting Rexas Finance Up for Great Rally Zero Venture Capital Funding Unlike many altcoins, which rely on venture capital (VC) funding, Rexas Finance chose a public presale. This assures that early investors do not face huge token dumps from institutional backers, who frequently sell their holdings after the listing. By focusing on a fair start, Rexas Finance has created a community-driven environment with high investor confidence. Increasing Visibility Being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko improves Rexas Finance's market visibility. Early postings on these sites help projects gain traction, attract retail investors, and build credibility in the cryptocurrency field. Certik Audit: Strengthening Security and Trust Security is a primary consideration for blockchain initiatives, and Rexas Finance has completed a Certik audit , one of the most respected security evaluations in the crypto business. This validation assures the project is free of serious weaknesses, making it a more secure investment choice than unaudited initiatives. Multistage Rexas Finance Presale: $46M+ Raised Since its inception in September 2024, the Rexas Finance presale has sparked intense interest among early investors. The project has completed eleven presale stages ahead of schedule, with the twelfth now 90% completed. As of this writing, $46.1 million has been raised from selling 450 million tokens. The presale price has increased from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20, showing investors are becoming more interested. With the last presale stage nearing completion, Rexas Finance's excitement grows as it prepares to list on at least three tier-1 exchanges on June 19, 2025. Can Rexas Finance Produce Solana-Like Returns? Solana's success sprang from innovative technology, solid institutional support, and a growing ecosystem. Rexas Finance is on a similar path, with its revolutionary RWA tokenization architecture, community-first strategy, and high-profile security validation. Analysts anticipate that RXS might reach $50 by 2025, riding the wave of RWA adoption and strategic exchange listings. Expert forecasts suggest the token's deflationary nature could result in a multi-thousand percent gain in the coming years. Conclusion Solana demonstrated that early acceptance in a high-utility blockchain project can lead to substantial advantages. Rexas Finance offers a similar opportunity, combining real-world utility, significant presale momentum, and strategic market entry. With its imminent exchange launch and rising demand for RWA tokenization, RXS could be the next big thing in crypto. Act fast before the anticipated rally.

The altcoins are also well in the green on a daily scale, with XRP going close to $2.6, while SOL is near $150. BTC Above $90K It has been a wild ride in the cryptocurrency space in the past several weeks. Just this past Sunday, when BTC’s price had calmed at around $85,000 following the previous rollercoaster, President Trump confirmed plans to create the US crypto strategic reserve and namedropped several assets, including bitcoin. Its price reacted with an immediate surge that drove it north by ten grand within hours. After reaching that multi-day peak, though, the bears stepped up and pushed the cryptocurrency down by $13,000. As a result, BTC found itself dropping to $82,000 on Tuesday. The bulls managed to defend that level and didn’t allow any dip beneath $80,000. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover some ground and spiked above $90,000 during the Thursday Asian trading session. Its ascent was stopped at $93,000, but the asset still trades above $90,000 despite a minor rejection. Its market capitalization has tapped $1.8 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is above 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Turn Green Most altcoins have also charted impressive gains over the past few days and since yesterday. Chainlink and Avalanche are now leading the way from the larger-cap alts. LINK has jumped by another 7% and now sits above $17. AVAX has neared $22 after a 5.5% increase. XRP, SUI, SOL, and DOGE have risen by about 3-4%, while ETH, TRX, and LTC are also in the green. Even more impressive gains come from MOVE, ONDO, and CRO, all of which have jumped by double-digits in the past day.

Airdrop farming is quickly becoming the most effective way to accumulate free tokens, and Ethereum remains the dominant network for high-value airdrops. Investors who understand the potential of curated, automated airdrop participation are already positioning themselves for the next big wave of free crypto rewards. While many projects require users to manually track and claim airdrops, one altcoin is revolutionizing the process. Skyren DAO has built an ecosystem that automates airdrop collection, ensuring that SKYRN holders receive steady rewards without constantly monitoring the market. This shift in strategy is attracting serious attention from DeFi investors — and it’s happening just as Ethereum’s ecosystem prepares for another expansion. Why the Ethereum Network Is the Best Place for Airdrop Farming Ethereum remains the strongest blockchain for launching and distributing new tokens. The majority of top-performing airdrops in recent years — including Uniswap (UNI), Optimism (OP), and Arbitrum (ARB) — all originated from Ethereum-based projects. Airdrop hunters understand the power of Ethereum’s ecosystem, but there’s one challenge: participating in every major airdrop takes time, effort, and transaction fees. That’s where Skyren DAO’s solution stands out. Skyren DAO’s Role in the Airdrop Farming Boom Skyren DAO was designed for hands-free airdrop farming. The project’s infrastructure automatically collects airdrops from partnered Ethereum-based projects, rewarding SKYRN holders without them needing to hunt for new opportunities manually. How Skyren Makes Airdrop Farming Effortless Automated Airdrop Collection – Instead of requiring users to manually claim rewards, Skyren’s smart contracts handle the process , delivering tokens directly to holders. Curated Airdrop Selection – Skyren’s partnerships ensure that only high-value, legitimate airdrops make it to investors, reducing the risk of scams. Staking and Yield Boosts – SKYRN holders can stake their tokens to increase their eligibility for premium airdrops, making participation even more profitable. For investors who have missed out on past Ethereum-based airdrops, Skyren presents a turnkey solution to ensuring they never leave money on the table again. For an in-depth look at how automated airdrop strategies are changing DeFi, check out Crypto Chino’s latest analysis . Phase 5 Presale: Secure SKYRN at $0.048 Before the Next Price Increase Skyren DAO’s Phase 5 presale is now live, with SKYRN available at $0.048.

Presale investors will receive priority access to high-value airdrops and staking benefits, making it the best way to capitalize on Ethereum’s next wave of token distributions. Final Thoughts: The Evolution of DeFi Rewards Ethereum has already proven itself as the go-to blockchain for airdrop farming, but Skyren is making the process easier and more profitable. By automating token claims, curating high-value airdrops, and integrating staking bonuses, SKYRN is transforming how passive investors generate rewards in DeFi. Investors who want to maximize their exposure to Ethereum’s best opportunities should act now — before the SKYRN presale reaches its next phase.

With Pi Day (March 14) around the corner, investors are eagerly awaiting a major announcement. Adding fuel to the excitement, market analyst Kim H Wong believes Pi Coin is on track to secure listings on Binance, Coinbase, and other leading platforms. Pi Network Major Listings: Expert Weighs In Renowned crypto analyst Kim H Wong recently shared his insights on Pi Network’s potential listing. According to Wong, Pi stands apart from other crypto projects due to its real-world utility and massive community support. He pointed out that crypto aims to build a functional digital economy where users can trade goods and services using Pi Coins. Unlike many speculative tokens, Pi focuses on practical applications, including decentralized applications (dApps). User Base & Following In Focus Another critical factor is its immense user base. Wong highlighted that the Pi Network app has been downloaded over 150 million times, boasting 65 million active users. In addition, Pi secured a monumental milestone , with its X following soaring to 4 million. This makes it among the top followed cryptocurrencies on X. Meanwhile, Wong also emphasized Pi Coin’s trading activity, noting that it has been listed on multiple centralized exchanges (CEXs) since February 20, 2025. Despite not being available on Binance or Coinbase, Pi’s 24-hour trading volume has recorded a massive surge. He also added that Pi Coin ranks as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and if meme and stablecoins are excluded, it ranks eighth. Given these factors, Wong believes it’s only a matter of time before major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase list Pi token. He further stated that if they fail to do so, they would be missing out on a massive opportunity. Potential Impact Of A Binance Listing If Binance and Coinbase list Pi Network, it could dramatically boost investor confidence and increase trading volume. Typically, assets listed on these exchanges experience significant price surges due to increased visibility and liquidity. Additionally, speculation is growing about Pi’s potential inclusion in the US Crypto Reserve list. Given Donald Trump’s recent support for US-issued cryptocurrencies, some believe Pi could play a role in the evolving digital asset landscape. Pi Coin Price: What Lies Ahead? Pi’s ranking as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency is noteworthy, considering all the top 10 cryptos are listed on Binance. This has led many to believe that Binance will eventually add Pi to its trading platform to stay competitive. Also, the community lauded that without these major listings, the crypto has achieved new heights in the market. Besides, with Pi Day approaching, all eyes are on Pi Network’s next move. If a major exchange listing is confirmed, it could trigger a strong rally for Pi. Pi Coin’s value today hovered near the flatline at $1.93 and its trading volume fell 1% to $772 million. Notably, the crypto has touched the brief $2 mark in the last 24 hours.

Cronos ( CRO ), the native token of Cronos Chain , soared by 15.8% on Thursday amid speculation that it could be included a strategic crypto reserve, recently unveiled by the U.S. President Donald Trump . Per crypto.news price tracking page, the price of CRO jumped to $0.09 on March 6, with its trading volume soaring by nearly 100%, according to data from crypto price aggregator platforms. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1897473838595674310 You might also like: Crypto.com and Kalshi face CFTC scrutiny over Super Bowl event contracts The pump comes a few hours after Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed in an X post that Crypto.com’s chief executive Kris Marszalek “will be attending the White House Crypto Summit on Friday,” without disclosing the sources. As a result, Marszalek joins a growing list of more than a dozen crypto executives set to attend the event, alongside Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. Despite the speculation, CRO has not been officially confirmed as part of the national crypto reserve. However, Trump’s earlier statements suggest that U.S. authorities may incorporate multiple tokens, as he noted that the strategic crypto reserve will include “other valuable cryptocurrencies,” in addition to Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). While initial expectations centered on Bitcoin as the sole asset in the reserve, Trump’s comments expanded the range of tokens that could potentially be included.

Ex-White House Director Hints at Resolution,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/xrp-news-is-the-sec-dropping-ripple-case-ex-white-house-director-hints-at-resolution/,"The post XRP News: Is the SEC Dropping Ripple Case? Ex-White House Director Hints at Resolution appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a recent podcast interview on The Wolf of All Streets, former White House Director of Communications, Anthony Scaramucci, made a claim that the SEC might have dropped its lawsuit against Ripple (XRP). This news has created a buzz in the crypto community, especially after a series of recent events that hint at major developments. During the podcast, when Scott Melker mentioned the SEC dropping cases against Coinbase, Gemini, ConsenSys, and others, Anthony Scaramucci interrupted and said “Ripple” twice, suggesting that the SEC may have already dropped its case against Ripple. While the case between Ripple and the SEC is technically still ongoing, many believe that the lawsuit could be quietly dropped, possibly in favor of a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP. If Scaramucci’s assertion is true, this could mean substantial gains for XRP holders, though confirmation from the SEC is still pending. The news has drawn mixed reactions, especially from Bitcoin maximalists, who believe Bitcoin should dominate the crypto space. However, many others see a future where multiple cryptocurrencies, including XRP, can coexist. The White House Crypto Summit on March 7, 2025, will also likely discuss creating a U.S. strategic crypto reserve, which could influence cryptocurrency regulations, including XRP. As a result, it’s expected that the SEC may soon end its case against Ripple, although no official statement has been made yet. As the Ripple-SEC case continues to unfold, the crypto world waits for more details. Will the SEC officially drop the lawsuit, or is this all just speculation? Time will tell, but the developments so far suggest that Ripple’s battle may be nearing its end, with the potential for big shifts in the crypto market.",News|Uncategorized|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 10:08:18

Authorities and regulators have warned traders not to get scammed by the fake coin. On March 6, Hong Kong lawmaker and active crypto supporter Johnny Ng warned traders that an account impersonating the Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee was promoting a Solana ( SOL )-based coin claimed to be the region’s “National Hong Kong coin.” Ng confirmed that the coin was false and that the Hong Kong government is not involved in the launch at all, labeling it a scam . “The government has made it clear that this information is absolutely false and is intended to deceive. Citizens are reminded to be cautious and not to be misled by such scams!” said Ng in his recent post . The account Ng was referring to boasts the username “JohnLeeKa_Chiu.” The impersonator posted about the launch of what it claimed was going to be the “National Hong Kong coin” March 6 at 3:00 AM Hong Kong time. He said the token would be available to trade on the Solana blockchain. “This strategic step marks a new era in digital innovation and economic growth for Hong Kong.

What Is the Most Critical Level to Watch for ETH? Glassnode Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-did-ethereum-whales-behave-in-the-recent-drop-what-is-the-most-critical-level-to-watch-for-eth-glassnode-explained/,"One of those that suffered the biggest decline during the correction in Bitcoin and altcoins was undoubtedly Ethereum (ETH). While the Ethereum price retreated to the $2,000,000 level, the increasing expectation before the White House Crypto Summit to be held on March 7 has led the ETH price to reach the $2,300 level. While Ethereum has been experiencing volatile movements, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained what ETH investors have been doing during the recent price fluctuations. Stating that Ethereum investors are actively managing their positions, Glassnode said that it lowered its cost basis by purchasing the dip. After Ethereum surged to $2,500 before the recent drop, it pulled back to $2,050, a level seen in November 2023. Glassnode said that according to data, Ethereum investors with an initial cost base of $3,500 sold throughout February but then bought the dip and re-entered at $2,500 and $2,050. At this point, Glassnode said investors have lowered their cost basis by 10% to $3,200. Additionally, Glassnode said that a major resistance area has formed at $2,800, where investors have accumulated around 800,000 ETH. This suggests that $2,800 will be a critical level for investors to watch if the price of Ethereum recovers. Signals Bullishness for Ethereum! On-chain analytics firm Santiment also weighed in on Ethereum, saying that the downward trend in social media signals a potential bullish trend for ETH. According to Santiment, Ethereum sentiment has fallen to yearly lows, lagging behind other top cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap. However, Santiment noted that sentiment on social media for ETH has deteriorated, which is a good sign for ETH and points to a potential reversal in price. Ethereum sentiment has declined to year-low levels as the asset has underperformed relative to other top caps. For those patiently holding their $ETH , the bearishness being projected across social media is a good sign of a potential turnaround once crypto markets stabilize. pic.twitter.com/iRaKTvb0Tu — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 6, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

As per the last check during the Asian afternoon session, its gains stood at over 33% from its local low on Tuesday. The altcoin’s market cap was seated at over $1.15 billion, while its daily trading almost tripled, hovering over $258 million. Today’s gains were triggered after U.S. President Donald Trump linked crypto project ‘World Liberty Financial’ purchased $1.5 million worth of MOVE tokens, among other altcoins, from a newly created multi-signature wallet. With the White House Crypto Summit just a day away, MOVE has sparked speculation in the crypto community that it could be part of the crypto strategic reserve plans that President Trump recently revealed to position the U.S. as the “Crypto Capital of the World.” The summit, set for Friday, March 7, will be chaired by venture capitalist David Sacks and Congressman Bo Hines. It’s expected to bring together crypto founders, CEOs, investors, and policymakers to discuss the future of digital assets in the U.S. and marks another step in Trump’s push to make America a leader in digital finance. With pro-crypto sentiment gaining ground in policymaking circles, investors seem to be betting that MOVE could also benefit from potential government-backed initiatives—especially since it aligns with the “ Made in USA ” narrative.

Meanwhile, Santiment data shows a 146% increase in daily active addresses, which is often seen during times of increased trading activity among holders. Source: Santiment MOVE was trending on X and CoinGecko even though its social sentiment was negative at press time. Typically, this means the price gains followed recent events. MOVE price analysis Technical indicators show that the altcoin is recovering from its bearish momentum, which has prevailed since early January of this year. On the 4-hour/USDT price chart, MOVE has once again broken above the descending trendline that had been forming with lower highs and lower lows since Jan. 6, which traders view as a precursor for a trend reversal. MOVE price, BB and MACD chart — March 6 | Source: crypto.news MOVE was trading close to the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting strong buying pressure, with new money flowing into its market. The MACD lines have also pointed upwards, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line while remaining above the price line, confirming a possible trend reversal—especially as the altcoin’s trading volume has spiked over the past day. Further CoinGlass data shows that investors have been accumulating MOVE, with net outflows from exchanges totalling nearly $11.5 million over the past 12 days, showing that its investors believe in more potential future gains ahead. Hence, MOVE could potentially rally to its psychological resistance at $0.55, a level it failed to break on March 3. If it manages to move above this level, the next target for MOVE would be $0.68, a resistance level it struggled to break multiple times in early February.

Online casinos have so much to offer players that the industry is now competitive with more traditional forms of gambling, including land-based casinos. As more players have joined online casinos, so the market has diversified. One of the more recent developments has been the creation of crypto casinos. Crypto casinos have capitalised on the increased popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among the wider public. These casinos generally combine a cryptocurrency purchasing or trading platform with an online casino that accepts cryptocurrencies. The entire site uses blockchain technology, giving users an anonymous and secure platform to play on. Cryptocurrency has always occupied an unsettled space in the financial world but this doesn’t mean that these casinos are any riskier than regular online casinos. The current political situation in the United States has had dramatic negative impacts on the cryptocurrency market but we’ve already seen similar dips followed by even bigger recoveries. During this low point, it’s likely that many new investors will be drawn in by the low prices and the potential for recovery. For those new to cryptocurrencies or those experienced investors who have never tried crypto casinos, this guide will have everything that you need to know about online crypto casinos. We’ve used the expertise of the researchers at JohnSlots to create this guide, and readers are encouraged to consult their dedicated guides for further information about individual casinos. Security at crypto casinos One of the reasons that most crypto investors cite for getting involved in cryptocurrency is because of the security it offers. Cryptocurrency exists using blockchain technology. The blockchain acts as a ledger, with each link being a record of what account has touched that coin. It makes it nearly impossible for cryptocurrency to be stolen without leaving a clear trail. Since crypto casinos function using blockchain technology as well, they have the same security features. Crypto casinos also offer far more anonymity than traditional online casinos. Traditional online casinos require extensive proof of identity and address in order to withdraw any funds. This can feel very invasive. Crypto casinos, on the other hand, have strict systems in place to preserve player anonymity. A user name and wallet ID are the only forms of identification that are required, since the blockchain provides any required verification of ownership of the cryptocurrency account. Currencies you can use Regular online casinos have begun to accept certain cryptocurrencies in order to remain competitive against crypto casinos. However, they typically only have the capacity to accept the most popular and widespread coins. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most widely accepted at regular online casinos. Crypto casinos recognise the variety of coins on the market and the popularity of alt coins, independent coins and regionally popular coins. Most of the big crypto casinos have platforms where users can invest in the cryptocurrencies that they want to use. This makes it very streamlined and easy. The commonly accepted cryptocurrencies at crypto casinos are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Tether, Binance Coin, USD Coin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Solana and Tron . Some crypto casinos even accept user suggestions to add coins to their accepted currencies list. Some crypto casinos will also accept a very limited selection of fiat currencies. This is to facilitate conversion of cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and to act as a bridge for players who are still uncertain about investing in cryptocurrencies. Using multiple currencies Crypto investors usually have one coin that is closest to their heart, but they also understand the importance of having a diverse portfolio in a fluctuating market. While investing in multiple cryptocurrencies is the norm, it is not common to use more than one cryptocurrency at a crypto casino. At most crypto casinos, the player selects which cryptocurrency they will be using with that account. The account is linked to a dedicated wallet associated with a single cryptocurrency. In rare cases, a crypto casino will accept more than one currency per account. Only using a single currency at a crypto casino is the smartest thing a player can do – it’s difficult enough to keep track of a casino budget in one currency, so adding a second cryptocurrency has the potential to create confusion. Games at crypto casinos When crypto casinos first appeared on the market, their game selection was incredibly limited. Most developers did not create games that were compatible with blockchain casino platforms. This meant that the sites had to create their own games or host the same limited selection of games as all other crypto casinos. As they’ve grown in popularity, crypto casinos have been able to offer far more games to their players. Software providers have realised that crypto casinos were an untapped market with the potential to be incredibly lucrative. Today, crypto casinos can offer slots, table games and live dealer games from the same big name developers as traditional online casinos.

Kraken even provided trading fee credits alongside the payouts to avoid profiting from the distribution process. The first repayment round, which started on Feb.18, covered approved Convenience Class claims valued at $50,000 or less. Small claimants will receive full repayment plus post-petition interest of 9% per annum by April 11. Larger claimants (with claims valued above $50,000), including institutional investors and VC firms, have been not been issued any repayments as of yet. Complex legal disputes and asset recovery efforts have delayed the distribution to larger investors. But with the next repayment round slated for May 30 , larger investors will start receiving their funds (+9% interest accrued per annum), with roughly $16 billion earmarked for total distributions.

With its price lingering currently at $0.2155, far from its all-time high of $0.7376, the powerhouse meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) has faced notable challenges in recent months. Even after a modest 9.33% increase in the last 24 hours, DOGE has struggled to maintain momentum enough to recover from an 18.93% decline over the past month. Additionally, Dogecoin’s technical outlook is mixed, with crypto analysts noting that DOGE must hold above the $0.20 support level to avoid further losses. While some predict a slow recovery, with price targets of $0.50 to $0.82 by year-end, $2 seems increasingly unlikely—at least for now. Furthermore, recent market conditions and macroeconomic factors, including inflation and liquidity constraints, have added to the pioneer meme coin’s challenges. Moreover, as whales continue to accumulate DOGE tokens, the overall market sentiment remains cautious, with many questioning whether the hype surrounding Dogecoin can drive it to new heights. In recent news, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, recently proposed a collaboration with Elon Musk to make Dogecoin the currency of X. If this ambitious partnership comes to fruition, it could dramatically impact Dogecoin’s future, possibly giving DOGE the boost it needs to reach new heights and solidify its place in the mainstream financial ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano founder, proposes to Elon Musk making Dogecoin the currency of X in an exciting post on X; posted by dogegod (@_dogegod_) on X As 2025 progresses, the real question remains: Can Dogecoin break out of its slump, or is the $2 target simply out of reach? While Dogecoin’s journey to $2 seems increasingly uncertain, its future remains tied to market sentiment and the strength of its community. On the other hand, JetBolt (JBOLT) is forging new ground with its groundbreaking presale, reeling in crypto whales with its zero-gas technology.

As Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to maintain momentum above $0.20, its $2 dream seems further out of reach. Meanwhile, JetBolt’s (JBOLT) presale continues to captivate whale interest, with its zero-gas technology and growing ecosystem showcasing distinct innovation in today’s market.

As one prominent market participant observed, a bullish uptrend might take longer as sentiments in the United States remain primarily bearish. “Bitcoin market will likely remain slow until sentiment in the U.S. improves.” Ki Young Ju wrote, pointing to the underwhelming absence of significant on-chain activity as a key indicator. Notably, current market sentiments in the U.S. largely differ from those observed in the latter part of the previous year. Between November and December 2024, they leaned more positively as Bitcoin reached an ATH of $105,000. https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1896846195877937300?s=46&t=qzsvHvtDB3yjTaoaylh-2g Interestingly, key indicators are still neutral as displayed on the Coinbase premium index chart covering network activity from March 2nd to March 4th, 2025. Ju maintains that neutrality “suggests that the bull cycle is still intact.” Additionally, fundamentals have remained strong, and more mining rigs have resumed online activity. Should the bull cycle finish at this point, Ju asserts that the trend will not mirror the sentiments of key market participants. “If the cycle ends here, it’s an outcome no one wanted—not old whales, mining companies, TradFi, or Trump. (FYI, the market doesn’t care about retail.)” He wrote. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s historical volatility index has now risen to 3%, as a result, price upswings have hit their highest levels of BTC volatility since early December. At report time, Bitcoin, up by 4.50% today, is valued at $91,408 per coin. The asset saw a major price swing today, surging to $92,500. $85,765 remains a key support level to watch out for, as a break below this point could indicate a potential downside. Conversely, a break above $93,165, a key resistance level could suggest a bullish trend reversal.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|USA,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|MINING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-06 11:32:16

According to local news agency Maeil Business Newspaper (MK), the Democratic Party's Governance Plan Center will hold a seminar titled 'Trump 2.0 Crypto Finance Era, South Korea's Response Strategy' to discuss Korea's crypto policy in response to the Donald Trump administration. It was stated that the seminar will discuss the potential inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves managed by the Bank of Korea and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The seminar will also discuss ways financial institutions can use Bitcoin as an ETF, bond collateral asset, and foreign exchange transaction tool. Additionally, the development of Korean stablecoins and methods for raising institutional capital using Real World Asset tokens will be discussed. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has previously denied creating a national Bitcoin reserve. FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan said that South Korea is not keen on the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. The FSC chairman also said that South Korea will wait to see how other countries and the market react to Trump's BTC reserve plan before taking action on Bitcoin.

Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA price is attempting to surge toward $3.5; however, it faces repeated rejections. As a result, the price has been dropping. Will TIA price recover? If buyers maintain the current momentum and push the price toward the resistance of $3.5, we might see a strong recovery. Will TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment?

Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction March 2025 $2.4 $3.1 $4.5 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025.

Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

The new development comes after Donald Trump’s announcement to integrate a Strategic Crypto Reserve in the long term. A notable price surge was recorded shortly after, with leading assets BTC, ETH, and XRP securing gains of 10%, 13%, and 34%, respectively. Gains previously sustained have since been lost as traders rushed to initiate sales across various exchanges. Shortly after Trump’s announcement, Bitcoin inflows on exchanges moved from 500-1000 to a staggering 6,739 BTC. Within a 1-hour timeframe, ETH saw inflows soar to 300,000 ETH. Similarly, exchanges ushered in 2 billion XRP in inflows, with hourly inflows nearing 193 million. Per CryptoQuant’s report, the recent drop in asset prices suggests that spot demand has carried through into contraction territory. Market reacts to the inclusion of altcoins to the highly anticipated Strategic Crypto Reserve Trump’s remarks have been a major topic of conversation among key market players. The President’s decision to include ETH, XRP, ADA, and SOL in the crypto reserve has warranted criticism from key figures. Analyst Peter Brandt questioned Trump’s credibility while raising concerns about including altcoins such as ETH and XRP in the crypto reserve. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, along with the Winklevoss twins, the founders of the Gemini exchange, have taken to X to express support for Bitcoin as the only asset fit to be included in the crypto reserve. “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve. Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar and that digital asset is bitcoin.” Tyler Winklevoss tweeted. While the altcoins above are listed on Gemini, Winklevoss maintains that for an asset to be considered “Strategy Reserve” material, it “needs to be hard money that is a proven store of value like gold.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-06 11:37:00

Discussions about banning deepfakes have been circulating for some time, but—so far—nothing concrete has been implemented. AI-generated history Just as sinister as deepfakes, however, is AI’s overall role in preserving facts. Indeed, while many consider artificial intelligence to be unbiased, AI is subject to the very same biases and lies as its creators. DeekSeek exemplifies this. An AI tool developed by the Chinese, it will refuse to utter any mention of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, for example, essentially erasing this incident from history. In fact, users can watch the chatbot do this before their very eyes. While governments have been rewriting history for centuries, from burning books in the Nazi era to changing text with the Gutenberg Press, AI represents a new dynamic in the permanence with which this can be done digitally and the speed at which false information can reach people via the internet. In addition, AI is used by many for research, relied upon as a reliable information source, and is increasingly used in classrooms. Despite these ethical concerns, however, tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services are steamrolling forward and integrating AI tools like DeepSeek into their cloud services. This means that anyone using their infrastructure—and that’s basically the majority of people with access to the internet—will be exposed to an AI tool that will only tell the truth if it’s programmed to. How can we trust a biased tool to preserve historical information or data? Blockchain-based solutions It’s clear that in a future where humans and AI increasingly co-exist with each other, we have to find another way of preserving information, images, and—most importantly—historical facts. A solution where this data cannot be erased, tampered with, or re-written—and blockchain is the only technology that provides this solution today. A blockchain is an immutable ledger where information can never be deleted or altered. Any transaction or other data is stored in the blockchain forever once it has been recorded. A fitting way to preserve history in a world where records depend on the whims of politicians and other powerful individuals. This is perhaps the most noble of use cases for blockchain’s censorship resistance—not an attempt to evade, but to preserve. Several ventures are already working on creating blockchain-based solutions specifically designed to preserve history and facts. This includes Story, a blockchain designed to turn intellectual property from writing, music, paintings, or simply ideas into tokenized assets to be stored and even traded on-chain. A permanent cloud Meanwhile, Arweave is a blockchain that offers a solution to store any data in a decentralized cloud forever—or for at least 200 years, guaranteed. This model contrasts traditional cloud services, like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services, which underpin the entire internet. If you have photos or Word documents stored on your Google Drive, for example, they are stored in the cloud—but this cloud storage is vulnerable to breaches, synching problems, or accidental—or deliberate—deletions. Data stored in the cloud can also be censored or deleted by a government or other authority, which puts a big question mark over the idea of storing any important facts of historical data “in the cloud.” Permanent, decentralized cloud solutions eliminate all these problems. Once it’s uploaded, it is stored forever—it cannot be tampered with, deleted, or altered in any way. You can always say who uploaded the data and when and what the original information contained in it is. It’s a perfect solution for information that needs to be preserved, like historical records. It’s also impossible to pass deepfakes off as a real thing on a permanent blockchain cloud network because it would be immediately clear who the creator of the fake video or image is. Equally, the origin of legitimate announcements could be easily verified, so never again would anyone have any doubts about the orders a president is giving to his troops in the middle of a major conflict. Finally, this tamperproof method of data storage also guarantees the provenance of information, which can be incredibly important in arbitrating “he said, she said” debates which so often stand in the way of verifying historical facts. At a time when these facts are increasingly under threat from technology that can create life-like deepfakes of politicians and celebrities, it’s time we explore the only solution that can truly preserve history.

After months of anticipation, analysts suggest that bullish catalysts—including new ETF proposals and renewed institutional interest—may finally propel Ripple’s native token to fresh highs. Meanwhile, XRP isn’t the only contender to watch: an up-and-coming AI Agent Launchpad called XRPTurbo (XRT) is generating headlines for its ambitious DeFi roadmap, with experts forecasting possible 100x gains during its presale stage. [Join Xrpturbo Presale] Is a $4.20 Breakout for XRP Inevitable? Despite some recent market volatility, XRP has managed to sustain a solid price floor, inching up around 6.6% in the past week. The crypto community is abuzz with rumors that the SEC is reviewing additional XRP ETF filings—a move that many believe could open the floodgates for institutional money. If approved, these ETFs might introduce a level of mainstream acceptance for XRP, providing the token with the momentum it needs to shatter its long-standing resistance levels. Still, doubts linger. Skeptics point out that regulatory uncertainty continues to hang over Ripple’s head, despite various legal victories in recent months. Will the SEC’s final stance be enough to quash the rally, or can XRP maintain its upward trajectory? Why XRPTurbo (XRT) Presale Could 100x As XRP grab the spotlight, analysts are pointing to another opportunity: XRPTurbo (XRT) . Touted as an AI Agent Launchpad on the Ripple blockchain, XRPTurbo merges advanced AI solutions with XRP’s quick settlement times and low transaction fees. The project’s roadmap includes yield-farming automation, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and on-chain analytics—features that many experts believe could catalyze a new wave of DeFi growth. What’s more, industry watchers note that XRT’s ongoing presale has garnered significant attention from early adopters. The token’s supply and pricing structure favor broad participation, potentially mirroring the dynamics that propelled certain meme coins and DeFi tokens to staggering gains. With major DEX listings expected post-presale, some are betting on a 100x surge if market conditions remain favorable. [Buy $XRT Tokens] Don’t Miss the Next Big Leap The crypto market is, as always, a realm of ‘what ifs.’ Will XRP finally breach $4.20 in March and reclaim its position among top-tier assets Or might XRPTurbo carve out its own legacy with an explosive 100x presale run? For risk-tolerant investors, the window of opportunity may be closing fast. While skeptics urge caution—citing regulatory risks and market volatility—the allure of high-reward ventures continues to drive capital toward projects that show both innovation and community support. As the countdown to March begins, one thing is certain: the crypto landscape never remains still for long, and fortunes can shift in a matter of days.

It bears mentioning that large holders have been aggressively selling since last year. Following XRP’s 500% price rally in November, whales have slowed accumulation. The current pattern suggests that XRP is in a local distribution phase—a core part of the market cycle. The distribution phase follows the accumulation and markup phases. At this time, sellers and buyers trade sideways, with heightened hope, greed, and fear as market players anticipate a price hike. While many bullish price indicators are spotted during this phase, the market typically shifts as negative sentiment intensifies. With the market poised to witness breakouts, consolidations, and pullbacks around this time, the distribution phase could last for weeks or months, after which the markdown phase begins. On-chain metrics show spike in trading volume as XRP holds support at $2 A key trend worth attention is the massive surge in trading volume as XRP holds support around the $2 price level. The trend indicates that demand for the asset is still strong. Last month, XRP recorded a sharp price decrease from February 25th to February 27th, as selling pressure intensified and market trades halted accumulation. As a result, expectations for March are mixed. At the time of this report, XRP, the third largest crypto by market cap, has seen daily gains cross 5%. XRP also beat BTC and ETH to become the highest weekly gainer, raking in 8.10% in weekly gains.

Despite the market crash, WLFI continues to invest heavily in crypto, showing confidence in its long-term growth. WLFI Tripled Ether Holdings In a Week According to on-chain data from Lookonchain, WLFI recently transferred $25 million USDC into a newly created multi-signature wallet, signaling its intent to expand its crypto portfolio. The fund executed major purchases, including; https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1897462956021137889 4,468 ETH for $10 million at an average price of $2,238 per ETH. 110.6 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for $10 million at $90,420 per BTC. 3.42 million MOVE tokens for $1.5 million at $0.439 per token. With about $3.5 million USDC still available, speculation is rising that WLFI could continue adding to its holdings soon. Currently, ETH remains WLFI’s largest holding with $16.34 million , followed by $14.8 million in WBTC and $13.25 million in USDT stablecoins. WLFI Faces Heavy Losses Despite buying more crypto, WLFI is facing over $89 million in unrealized losses across nine tokens. This comes at a time when the crypto market is struggling due to big events like the $1.4 billion Bybit hack, the largest in crypto history, and other economic concerns. While many investors are moving toward real-world assets (RWA) for safety, WLFI is taking a different path, believing in a long-term crypto comeback. WLFI’s Crypto Fund Expands Strategy WLFI’s recent investments come after launching its Macro Strategy fund , which focuses on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and selected altcoins. The goal is to build a strong and balanced crypto portfolio while exploring new opportunities in DeFi. Meanwhile, speculation is growing that Trump’s family may launch “one or more giant businesses” on Ethereum and even hinted at the possibility of Ethereum being used in government operations noted by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|USDC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 11:46:47

Aside from a significant price bump, $ADA’s investor volume also skyrocketed, which has spiked everyone’s interest in what’s being touted as one of the best cryptos to buy now . Keep reading to find out everything about Cardano’s 2025 price prediction. We’ll paint a clear picture (combined with both fundamental and technical analysis) to understand where $ADA could be headed next. Cardano 2025 Price Prediction at a Glance Here’s a brief summary of all the important factors at play for Cardano and the effect they should have on its price this year: Cardano is respecting the 50 EMA on the weekly chart – BULLISH It has bounced off a well-established support/resistance zone – BULLISH We’re seeing the ‘break and retest’ pattern on both the weekly and daily charts – BULLISH The important resistance level of $1.30 is hovering above current prices – BEARISH All major moving averages are sloping upwards on the daily chart – BULLISH Inclusion in Trump’s US Crypto Reserve – BULLISH Potential launch of a Cardano ETF – BULLISH As you can see, a vast majority of signs are pointing north, so Cardano is rightly expected to generate handsome yields in 2025 (and beyond). Although it’s difficult to put a finger on an exact price target, our analysis (which you’ll see below) suggests that Cardano could reach as high as $3.10 in the coming few months. Diving Deeper Into Cardano’s Chart Technical analysis 101 dictates that we use the higher timeframes (the weekly and the daily) to form the primary context about a stock/crypto’s current and future prices. $ADA’s Weekly Chart Screams Bullishness One look at $ADA’s weekly chart, and it immediately comes across as a crypto ready to explode . The biggest bullish sign is how well it’s respecting the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The crypto has taken support on the 50 EMA twice in the last four weeks. Plus, two important short-term moving averages – the 20 EMA and the 10 EMA – are both pointing upwards, signaling immense bullish strength. Another reason for joy among $ADA supporters should be that the crypto has found support at a previous resistance zone, i.e., between $0.60 and $0.80. Moreover, this isn’t just a normal resistance; it’s where $ADA’s last higher high was, which means we have a classic ‘break and retest’ pattern in front of us. This is an extremely well-known technical analysis pattern, one that traders often look at for fresh entries. Buying a crypto when it’s ‘retesting’ essentially means getting it at a discounted price, which increases the overall profits you can churn out of it. This is also a pattern we can use for predicting where Cardano’s next potential rally could take it. Essentially, we could see a move similar to the one in November last year, meaning $ADA can surge past $1.730 in just the next month or two. For a longer-term Cardano price prediction, we can use the Elliott Wave theory , which suggests that we could be seeing the onset of an impulse (or motive) wave. If this holds true, $ADA can even reach its all-time highs of $3.10 in 2025. Perhaps the only thing to watch out for is that $ADA’s current resistance level of around $1.30 is a major one. After all, that’s where the crypto really fell from (almost 80%) in March 2022. It’s also where $ADA’s November 2024 rally eventually faded. Lots to Cheer for on Cardano’s Daily Chart as Well $ADA’s daily chart, unlike $ETH’s, aligns with its weekly chart to confirm the larger bullish picture. The crypto has broken out of its recent downtrend, which was frankly just a correction so long as we put the weekly chart into perspective. Additionally, Cardano is showing a similar ‘break and retest’ pattern on the daily chart as it is on the weekly. This happens to be a great confluence (or double confirmation). Furthermore, all the major EMAs, including the 200 EMA, which is the granddaddy of all moving averages, are sloping upwards. According to this chart, Cardano is looking ripe to capture the recent highs of $1.3278 in the first half of 2025. Once that’s accomplished, we should see the crypto holding well to aim for the $1.730 level. Cardano’s Market Sentiment Of course, the biggest piece of positive news for Cardano buyers is its recent inclusion in Trump’s US Crypto Reserve. The announcement saw $ADA rise by over 70% in a day. It’s currently trading at $0.9546 . Even better, this upmove in price was accompanied by large institutional buying. Put together, whales have bought around 420M $ADA in the last week . Investor interest in Cardano is swelling up, meaning we can expect current prices to hold and rise higher. Additionally, the prospective launch of a Cardano ETF (exchange-traded fund) later this year could easily see the crypto surge past all price targets. On February 11, Grayscale announced that it wants to launch an ADA ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. An ETF would further crank up investor participation in Cardano, as those interested in $ADA would be able to invest in it without having to buy the token. Currently, only Bitcoin and Ethereum have ETFs. Cardano could well be the third one to join the list. It’s also worth noting that Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, said that he didn’t know Trump would include $ADA. Cardano’s founder being unaware of its inclusion in the Crypto Reserve could be a very positive sign. After all, it shows that the crypto was picked purely because of what it brings to the table. Is Cardano the Best ‘Science’ Coin? Experts Say MIND of Pepe May Offer Better Returns Although Cardano is undoubtedly a great opportunity to invest in a development-first ‘science’ coin that grows slowly and steadily over time, there are other more profitable investments out there, like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . $MIND is the next biggest AI agent project that can be your trading partner. By leveraging its self-evolving and autonomous build, $MIND will interact with crypto influencers online (on dApps and platforms like X). It will analyze every single market sentiment and bias to then cut through all the noise and identify the best cryptos to invest in .

The MIND of Pepe presale has already amassed over $7.1M, and it shows no signs of slowing down. 1 $MIND is currently available for just $0.0034539 – here’s how to buy it . Putting aside the crypto market’s bullish signals, volatility is often the ultimate portfolio killer. Whether you invest in $ADA or $MIND (or both), make sure you only put in an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, we urge our readers to do their own research before investing. None of the above is financial advice, after all.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-06 11:48:06

Meanwhile, Elluminex, a DeFi hub on the TON blockchain, progresses through its presale, with 5.4 million $ELX tokens sold. Both projects highlight contrasting approaches to decentralizing finance—one navigating legacy challenges, the other building anew.

With SolidProof-audited contracts and a $0.08 next-stage price, Elluminex balances accessibility and deflationary rigor – key for attracting TON’s Telegram-linked user base. Also, in contrast to XRP, the Elluminex core team includes a skilled developers from major blockchain projects, all holding a lot of experience in DeFi, smart contract creation, and inter-chain operability. Divergent Paths, Shared Ambitions XRP’s institutional DeFi push contrasts Elluminex’s grassroots ecosystem build. Yet both face scalability tests. XRP’s cross-border settlements require banking adoption; Elluminex needs to lure developers to TON. Analysts compare $ELX’s presale to Solana’s 2021 growth, where DEXs like Raydium spurred 86% TVL , resulting in SOL gains. For investors, XRP offers regulatory-risk exposure, while Elluminex presents untapped network potential. Neither guarantees success, but their trajectories could redefine how DeFi bridges traditional and blockchain finance. Elluminex: A Better Call Over XRP? XRP’s DeFi integration hinges on legal outcomes, while Elluminex bets on TON’s scalability. The former battles legacy perceptions; the latter avoids them entirely. As XRP eyes $3.55 and Elluminex advances its presale, both underscore DeFi’s evolution—one adapting existing systems, the other constructing anew. For cautious optimists, these parallel journeys highlight blockchain’s dual future: reforming finance from within and rebuilding it from scratch.

40820674,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24778,1741262040,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What is USDT0?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/token/what-is-usdt0/,"USDT0 is a bridged version of Tether’s USDt stablecoin, designed to extend USDt’s availability to blockchains where it is not natively issued. It operates on a “lock-and-mint” mechanism, meaning that USDt is locked on Ethereum while an equivalent amount of USDT0 is minted on the destination chain. This system is powered by LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard, which facilitates secure and seamless cross-chain transfers. Unlike standard USDt, USDT0 is not directly issued or redeemable by Tether but is managed by Everdawn Labs, making it a distinct asset that requires users to swap between USDT0 and USDt through a conversion tool. USDT0 aims to address interoperability challenges in the blockchain ecosystem by enabling easier transfers of stablecoins across different networks without relying on fragmented liquidity pools or traditional bridges. It has been introduced on blockchains such as Ink, Berachain, and MegaETH, with plans for expansion to additional networks. The OFT standard ensures that USDT0 maintains a 1:1 backing with USDt on Ethereum, and transfers are validated by a decentralized security model involving oracles and relayers. This approach reduces the complexity of cross-chain transactions while enhancing liquidity management. One of the key distinctions of USDT0 is that it is not available for direct trading. Instead, it serves as a transport mechanism to facilitate the movement of USDt across different ecosystems. Users can deposit or withdraw USDT0 on supported exchanges, such as Bitfinex, and utilize a currency conversion tool to swap it for standard USDt. This design allows for the seamless use of USDt on networks where native issuance is not feasible, providing users with more flexibility without compromising the underlying backing of the stablecoin. The introduction of USDT0 carries implications for both blockchain users and platforms. For users, it offers a more efficient and secure means of transferring stable value across chains, reducing the risks associated with third-party bridges. For exchanges and Decentralised Finance (DeFi) platforms, it simplifies integration and liquidity management by unifying stablecoin supply across multiple networks. While USDT0 reflects a growing focus on cross-chain interoperability, its distinction from standard USDt, particularly the involvement of a third-party issuer, requires users to remain aware of the underlying mechanics and any associated risks when interacting with the asset. What is the USDT0 Token? Unlike standard USDt, which is directly issued and redeemable by Tether on supported networks like Ethereum and Tron, USDT0 operates through a “lock-and-mint” mechanism. When a user transfers USDt to a non-native blockchain, the equivalent amount of USDT0 is minted on the non-native destination chain, while the original USDt is securely locked on Ethereum. This ensures that each USDT0 token maintains a strict 1:1 backing with USDt on Ethereum, preserving the stable value peg to the US dollar. USDT0 is built using the OFT standard developed by LayerZero, which allows tokens to move seamlessly across multiple blockchains. This standard eliminates the need for traditional bridging solutions, which often involve liquidity pools and can expose users to risks such as bridge exploits or price slippage. Instead, USDT0 enables users to transfer stablecoins between supported blockchains efficiently and securely, with transactions validated through LayerZero’s decentralised messaging and verification system. The initial launch of USDT0 began on networks like Ink and Berachain, with further expansion to additional blockchains anticipated. The introduction of USDT0 addresses the growing demand for interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem, allowing USDt to operate more efficiently across different networks. It offers a practical solution for users seeking to move stablecoins between ecosystems without relying on fragmented bridging systems or managing liquidity pools. This development reflects the ongoing evolution of stablecoins as the blockchain industry continues to prioritize cross-chain functionality and interoperability. Get started with USDT0: Create a Bitfinex account here . Verify your account to Basic Plus. On the Currency Conversions dropdown menu, for “From” choose Tether USDt. For the “To” dropdown menu, choose USDT0 on either Arbitrum One, or Ink. Be aware that you cannot currently exchange USDT0 between the Arbitrum One and Ink variants. Convert USDt to USDT0 here USDT0 Tokenomics USDT0’s tokenomics are structured around a “lock-and-mint” model designed to ensure that each USDT0 token is fully backed by an equivalent amount of USDt on Ethereum. This system maintains a strict 1:1 peg between USDT0 and USDt, which itself is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. When a user moves funds into USDT0, the corresponding USDt is locked on Ethereum, and an equivalent amount of USDT0 is minted on the destination blockchain. This ensures that the total supply of USDT0 across all chains is always matched by an equivalent reserve of USDt, preventing inflation or the creation of unbacked tokens. This model allows USDT0 to function as a stable representation of USDt across multiple networks, supporting interoperability without compromising the underlying stability of the Tether ecosystem. The minting process begins when a user initiates a cross-chain transfer by locking USDt on Ethereum. This is done through a smart contract that holds the locked USDt securely. Once the transaction is validated, the LayerZero messaging protocol sends a message to the destination chain. Upon receipt of this message, the USDT0 contract on the target blockchain mints an equal amount of USDT0 tokens, reflecting the locked funds on Ethereum. This process is designed to be secure and reliable, utilizing LayerZero’s OFT standard and dual verification networks (DVNs) to confirm that the correct amount of USDt is locked before USDT0 is issued on the new chain. This ensures that no tokens are minted without proper collateral. Redemption follows the reverse process. When a user seeks to move USDT0 back to Ethereum or convert it to USDt, the USDT0 tokens on the source chain are burned. Once this burn is confirmed, a LayerZero message is sent to the contract holding the locked USDt on Ethereum, instructing it to unlock and release the equivalent amount of USDt to the user. This burning mechanism ensures that USDT0 tokens are only created when backed by USDt and are destroyed when redeemed, maintaining the supply balance across chains. This system prevents excess issuance of USDT0 and upholds the 1:1 backing, reinforcing the stability and reliability of the token as it moves across different on-chain ecosystems.

Pi Network’s X (Twitter) account following has surpassed 4 million, outpacing major cryptos like ETH, SHIB, and XRP. Is PI Ready to Rally Again? Pi Network’s native token began trading on February 20, nearly six years after the controversial crypto project’s birth. Some of the exchanges that embraced the asset upon the launch of the Open Network include Bitget, OKX, and MEXC. The price of PI registered substantial fluctuations in its first trading days, plummeting below $0.65 and rising to an all-time high of almost $3 on February 27. In the following days, the valuation retraced to approximately $1.50 before consolidating to the current $1.90 (per CoinGecko’s data). PI Price, Source: CoinGecko According to some industry participants, it might be time for another resurgence. The X user Coinvo claimed that PI “is bouncing perfectly off the point of control.” The investor suggested that the level stands at $1.58. Another market observer, using the X moniker MOON JEFF, thinks the current price represents a great buying opportunity. They believe PI’s spike above $5 is just a matter of time. Last month, the X user Pi Blockchain predicted that the next wave could send the value to $4 or even $40. Others have been even more bullish, envisioning an explosion to a whopping $314.159 – a number symbolically linked to π (Pi) ≈ 3.14159. It is important to note that such a figure would require PI’s market cap to skyrocket above $2 trillion (assuming the circulating supply is around 7 billion coins). As of writing these lines, its capitalization stands at around $13.4 billion, making the forecast highly implausible (to say the least). Pi Network’s Latest Achievement The project has become more popular lately, perhaps due to the major milestone mentioned above. As CryptoPotato recently reported , Pi Network’s followers base on X (formerly Twitter) has surpassed 4 million people. In comparison, well-known cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) trail behind. Pi Network is particularly popular in Asia, with South Korea, Vietnam, China, Japan, India, Singapore, and other nations becoming strongholds. Not long ago, Wu Blockchain estimated that the project’s users in South Korea exceeded 1.3 million, outpacing the local customer base of behemoth exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.

Schiff’s surprise comments have added fire to an already furious debate about the federal government’s role in digital assets as the White House gears up for its March 7 crypto summit . Although still skeptical of most cryptocurrencies, Schiff compared Bitcoin’s addition to U.S. reserves with the country’s gold holdings, a rare shift in his skeptical attitude. Trump sparks controversy with crypto reserve blunder as Schiff softens on Bitcoin The pending White House Crypto Summit has brought attention to the changing role of the federal government in digital assets. Things took an unexpected turn when Donald Trump flubbed the rollout of a Strategic Crypto Reserve by omitting Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap in his first announcement. Trump wrote on Truth Social, “A Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.” That exclusion immediately produced confusion and contention across the industry. Nearly two hours later, the President attempted to clarify, writing: “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other critical cryptocurrencies, will be part of the Reserve.” In an unexpected reversal, Schiff reluctantly conceded the case for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, likening it to the country’s gold reserves. Schiff has repeatedly derided BTC as a speculative asset devoid of true value, but this time, he appears to have conceded that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is becoming an irresistible trend. However, he did not spare harsh words for other digital assets in the reserve, which he said were “pure speculation with no real backing.” Schiff also warned about the broader economic challenges ahead, stating: Trump hasn’t prepared Americans for just how bad things are going to get, or the level of austerity that would be required to repair the damage done by decades of bad fiscal and monetary policy. The coming shot of fiscal and monetary “stimulus” will be the overdose that kills us. Peter Schiff White House Crypto Summit set to define Bitcoin’s role in U.S. strategic reserve In January, the Trump administration published Executive Order 14178, which set the stage for the U.S. Crypto Stockpile. Framed as a hedge against inflation and a measure of financial resilience, the initiative has ignited a heated debate over the reserve’s makeup. While it’s clear that Bitcoin dominates the crypto market, the debate remains over whether other digital assets deserve the same status in the U.S. reserve. “That’s because Bitcoin is the foundation of the crypto economy,” said Michael Saylor, CEO of Strategy. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, took a strong stand, saying “only Bitcoin” belongs in the reserve. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , in turn, proposed a more measured take, commenting that while Bitcoin is the “right tool” — “I appreciate the administration’s broader intent.” Overdrawing the “war chest” reserve will ultimately be 99.9% Bitcoin and larger than most people think, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. Secretary of the Treasury Howard Lutnick confirmed BTC’s special status in the reserve in a statement. He also said that President Trump is “interested in a Bitcoin strategic reserve” and that more details on other cryptocurrencies will be released soon. After the White House’s announcement, the leading crypto surged to $94K, fueled by optimism over institutional recognition, but it soon recovered to $78K. Growing concerns over federal intervention and asset selection caused a swift pullback. Led by Crypto Czar David Sacks and Executive Director Bo Hines, the fraternal pair will host a White House summit with heavy hitters in the financial and industry policy-making wings. The full guest list remains under wraps, and speculation has swirled around who will be present to help clarify U.S. crypto policy. However, several industry luminaries have confirmed they will be attending the event publicly. As a result, the summit will reportedly confirm the White House crypto initiative front and center, which would be a milestone in U.S. financial strategy.

The bill, House Bill 302, will now head to the full House floor for a vote, making New Hampshire one of seven U.S. states actively pushing for Bitcoin-related legislation. New Hampshire to Adopt Bitcoin? If the bill clears all legislative hurdles, the New Hampshire treasurer would have the discretion to allocate up to 5% of the general fund, revenue stabilization fund, or other authorized state funds into Bitcoin or precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. While the bill does not explicitly mention Bitcoin, it stipulates that eligible digital assets must have maintained an average market capitalization of $500 billion over the past calendar year—a threshold only Bitcoin currently meets. The bill, introduced by Republican Keith Ammon and co-sponsored by Democrats Chris McAleer and Carry Spier, originally proposed a 10% allocation cap but was later revised to 5%. Ammon stated that the bill underwent amendments to remove stablecoins and staking provisions, aligning it with a more conservative approach to state-backed Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin Gaining Political Traction Across Multiple U.S. States New Hampshire now stands alongside North Carolina , Oklahoma, and Texas, all of which are awaiting full House votes on their respective Bitcoin-related bills. Meanwhile, Utah and Arizona have already advanced similar legislation, reflecting a broader state-level movement toward Bitcoin adoption in government treasuries. Momentum for Bitcoin-friendly policies has also picked up at the federal level. On March 2, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for a Crypto Strategic Reserve , which would include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. However, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan suggested that the reserve would likely be composed almost entirely of Bitcoin, reinforcing its dominant position in the digital asset landscape. New Hampshire’s Treasurer Monica Mezzapelle has signaled potential interest in Bitcoin investments should the bill pass, marking a potential shift in how U.S. states approach cryptocurrency as part of their financial strategy.

Analyst Names 5 Altcoins That Could See 10x Gains in March!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sol-rally-slowing-down-analyst-names-5-altcoins-that-could-see-10x-gains-in-march/,"As interest in SOL’s rapid growth begins to wane, investors are looking for the next big opportunity in the cryptocurrency market. A noted analyst has pinpointed five altcoins that could potentially increase tenfold in value this March. These emerging tokens may offer substantial returns, capturing the attention of those keen on capitalizing on the latest trends. XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 10 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.0025, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Sui: The User-Friendly Blockchain Set to Transform Crypto Sui is a new blockchain platform that’s making waves in the crypto world. It’s designed to be secure, powerful, and able to handle lots of users worldwide. What makes Sui special is its focus on making things easy for everyone. Instead of using complicated processes, it uses simple models to manage data. It also uses a secure programming language called Move to fix common problems in other blockchains. Sui stands out because it puts the user first. With features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions, it removes the usual hassles of using blockchain apps. This means more people can access and enjoy Web3 applications. In the current market, where usability and scalability are key, Sui looks promising. Compared to other coins, Sui offers a blend of strong technology and great user experience. As the crypto market evolves, coins like Sui that focus on accessibility could be the ones to watch. SEI: The Lightning-Fast Blockchain Transforming Trading SEI is breaking new ground as the first Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for trading. Aiming to give exchanges an edge, it can handle a massive number of orders per second with a transaction finality of just 380 milliseconds. Built with a deep commitment to security and backed by large institutions, SEI is poised to revolutionize how trading platforms operate on the blockchain. In today’s market, SEI’s specialized technology positions it as a promising contender. Its focus on speed and security addresses key challenges faced by decentralized exchanges. Some believe that if SEI reaches its upper price targets, it could see significant growth by 2030. Compared to other coins, SEI’s unique approach and potential for high performance make it an attractive option for those interested in innovative blockchain solutions. MANTRA: Bridging Institutions to Web3 with Security and Speed MANTRA is a new blockchain designed with security at its core. It aims to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a good fit for institutions and developers. By offering a permissionless blockchain that supports permissioned applications, MANTRA combines openness with control. This allows big organizations to benefit from blockchain technology without compromising on compliance. Built on the Cosmos SDK, MANTRA is compatible with other networks and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. It uses a Proof-of-Stake system for security and can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second. With built-in tools, developers can create and manage assets that meet regulations. The user experience is also improved to help newcomers and institutions join Web3 easily. In the current market, where security and compliance are becoming more important, MANTRA stands out. Compared to other coins, its focus on real-world applications and regulatory adherence could make it attractive to those looking for a robust and scalable blockchain solution. Pi Network: The Social Cryptocurrency You Can Mine on Your Phone Pi Network is a mobile-first cryptocurrency that allows anyone to mine Pi tokens without needing special hardware or draining their phone’s battery. Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates, it aims to make digital currency accessible to everyone. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining process, Pi users simply check in daily on the app to verify their presence. By building trust circles with 3-5 reliable contacts, users contribute to a global trust graph that secures the network without massive computing power. The potential of Pi Network lies in its innovative approach to decentralization and user engagement. By leveraging the Stellar Consensus Protocol, Pi creates an interconnected community where users are rewarded for their contributions, such as growing trusted networks and running full nodes. As the project moves toward its open network phase, it presents an intriguing development in the cryptocurrency landscape. Compared to other coins, Pi’s emphasis on accessibility and energy efficiency aligns with current market trends favoring sustainable and user-friendly blockchain solutions. While it’s still in its early stages, Pi Network’s unique model makes it a project worth watching in the evolving crypto market. Conclusion Though SUI, SEI, OM, and PI show promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for massive growth through a unique, community-driven ecosystem.

Analysis Firm Warns!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-for-bitcoin-ethereum-and-solana-after-the-great-white-house-crypto-summit-analysis-firm-warns/,"As US President Donald Trump becomes one of the most influential factors in the cryptocurrency market, his statements and moves can cause the market to rise or fall. At this point, while expectations are increasing that Trump may announce the creation of a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve before the White House Cryptocurrency Summit that Trump will host on March 7, STS Digital warned investors after the White House crypto summit. Digital asset trading firm STS Digital has warned of increased market volatility for Bitcoin (BTC) following the crypto summit held at the White House on March 7, Coindesk reported. STS Digital said that after the peak, the price could experience price fluctuations of around $5,000 up and down. Deribit options data suggests investors are bracing for post-peak volatility, said Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital. Anderson noted that investors are also preparing for volatility in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in addition to Bitcoin. “Options markets are showing tension and illiquidity heading into the weekend. “Implied volatility was measured at 105% for BTC, which corresponds to an expected price movement of 5.5% between Friday 8:00 UTC and Saturday 8:00 UTC. At this point, BTC could swing around $5,000 in either direction after the peak. ETH and SOL prices could also swing $135 and $13, respectively.” *This is not investment advice.

A surge like this is proof of how well the market can survive despite all odds. $DADDY is not an enigma in its success, as there are more meme coins capable of replicating this success. $CHONE has a statistically high chance of yielding a higher return than the current gains of $DADDY. $DADDY Leading the Charge For Market Recovery $DADDY has been green all week despite a downtrend in the market . As a coin personally promoted by Andrew Tate, $DADDY has experienced phenomenal growth in the last seven days. The market has outliers like $DADDY, which are always pushing forward when the market seems to be in a state of decline. One marker for growth would have to be the airdrops that occurred over 6 days ago. Over $1 million worth of $DADDY was distributed, likely pushing the value of the coin upwards. $DADDY has taken the initiative to make sure their numbers stay high. They also have an active community since Andrew Tate is promoting it. $DADDY’s success isn’t the type that can’t be replicated by other coins in the market. While it has kept itself safe from market conditions, the pump might be reaching its end. Regardless, a lot of money is still changing hands as the 24-hour trading volume is at $5.5 million, and the market cap is at $39.1 million. $CHONE Could Outshine Recent Gains In the Meme Market While the market is feeling good about $DADDY, there are newer, finer coins like $CHONE that are more than capable of taking over the media. $CHONE especially has a refreshing narrative that exceeds the potential of its rivals in the market. $CHONE is the kind of meme coin that is most attractive to experienced traders, with its market cap below $500k. It’s the best type of meme coin to ape into, as it is the kind that experiences massive blowouts. Daily trading volume is just under $68k, with a price hike of 9.8% in the last 24 hours. $CHONE has a chilled outlook but it has been designed for efficient growth. Its use of AI emphasizes its potential for growth even though its avatar is a chill drone. $CHONE is bound to experience growth in the near future and will be able to surpass market players like $DADDY. Meme Coins Still Have A Stake In Crypto’s Future The market is steadily recovering, and more meme coins are gaining liquidity from big players. $DADDY might be proof that the market is getting back on its feet, but $CHONE would be the coin used to restore investors’ egos. As more market players emerge, experiencing exponential growth, $CHONE will become a stable figure, like $DADDY, climbing the ranks to establish itself. $CHONE currently sits at a good entry point of $0.00045, encouraging traders to take advantage of a high-growth potential.

You bet your tail is out there, just waiting to explode. The trick is sniffing out the ones with real potential before the pack catches on. Some meme coins are all bark and no bite, but how about a few? They’re ready to run wild. One of those top dogs is Dawgz AI, a meme coin with actual utility. With staking rewards for ETH buyers and high-frequency trading bots making moves 24/7, it’s got serious bite. 1. Dawgz AI Not all meme coins are created equal. Some are just funny names and hype, while others actually make you money. Dawgz AI is in the second category; it’s built to win. Why Dawgz AI Stands Out Most meme coins rely on pure luck. Dawgz AI? It’s got high-frequency trading bots working 24/7, making real moves so you don’t have to. And while other coins hope for value, $DAGZ delivers; with staking rewards for ETH holders, passive income comes easy. Pro Tip: Early dogs get the best bones. Dawgz AI’s presale momentum is strong; miss it, and you’ll be chasing gains later. What Makes It Better? Dawgz AI isn’t just some meme coin gamble. It’s got strong tokenomics, an 8.888B stock, and actual utility, which 99% of meme coins lack. While others bark, Dawgz AI fetches profits . Fun Fact: The project has already raised $2.3M in presale. Next stop? $2.6M and a price jump. While others hope to moon, Dawgz AI is built for it. 2. Bonk Coin Some dogs never stop chasing the ball. Bonk is one of those, a Solana-powered meme coin that’s been around long enough to prove it’s got staying power. But does it have what it takes to lead the pack in 2025? Why People Like Bonk Strong community: People love a good underdog story, and Bonk has that vibe. Solana-backed: It runs on fast, low-fee transactions, which is a big plus. Hype cycles: Every now and then, Bonk gets a new wave of attention. Pro Tip: The best crypto to buy now for 2025 is one with both hype AND utility. Fun Fact: Bonk had a crazy rally in 2023, but what’s next? Dawgz AI is still in the early, explosive phase, so don’t miss it. 3. Fartcoin Yes, Fartcoin is real. It’s loud, it’s ridiculous, and somehow, people are actually buying it. But is it just a joke, or could this be the next big meme coin? Why People Love Fartcoin Let’s be honest: Fartcoin is all about fun. It leans into the absolute chaos of meme culture, and sometimes, that’s enough to pump a coin. Maximum meme potential: If you thought Dogecoin was funny, this one takes it to another level. A loyal fanbase: Some people are ride-or-die for the meme, and that can create real buying pressure. Hype-driven gains: It only takes one viral moment to send a meme coin flying. Fun Fact: In 2024, a random meme coin jumped 5,000% overnight because Elon Musk tweeted a single emoji. That’s crypto for you. Fun Fact: AI-powered crypto coins are expected to dominate in 2025. Why? Because they actually do something. Comparison Table: Dawgz AI vs. Bonk vs. Fartcoin The best cheap crypto to buy isn’t the one that just makes you laugh; it’s the one that actually makes you money. Feature Dawgz AI Bonk Coin Fartcoin Utility AI-powered trading bots Meme-only Meme-only Staking Rewards Yes, for ETH holders No No Presale Momentum $2.3M raised, next target $2.6M Already launched Already launched Community Support Growing rapidly Large following Small, but loyal Long-Term Growth Potential Strong Questionable Very risky $DAGZ wins this round. Which Coin Is Most Profitable in the Future? When it comes to future profitability in crypto, Dawgz AI stands out as the most promising investment opportunity. While many coins rely on hype, Dawgz AI is built on real utility, AI-driven innovation, and a strong meme culture, making it a high-growth contender in the market. Unlike typical meme coins, Dawgz AI combines humor with cutting-edge AI technology, creating a unique blend of entertainment and utility. The project has already gained massive attention, with investors recognizing its potential for outsized returns. With smart investors eyeing Dawgz AI as the next major breakout, now is the time to secure your position before prices surge. Would you rather chase past trends or get ahead of the next big thing? The answer is clear - Dawgz AI is the coin to watch for future profits. Which Penny Crypto Has 1000x Potential? Everyone wants to find the next cheap coin that explodes overnight. But not all low-cost cryptos are built to last. Dawgz AI has everything a breakout meme coin needs: a strong presale, real AI-powered trading, and staking rewards for ETH holders. Unlike random low-cap coins that rely on hype alone, Dawgz AI combines meme culture, AI-driven technology, and strong community backing, making it a legitimate contender for massive growth. AI + Meme Power – Combining AI innovation with the viral appeal of meme coins, Dawgz AI taps into two of the biggest trends in crypto. Early-Stage Opportunity – Still in presale, Dawgz AI offers a ground-floor entry before major exchange listings. Massive Market Interest – Investors are recognizing its potential, and early momentum suggests it could be the next breakout success. Proven Growth Model – History shows that the best meme coins with strong communities and use cases can explode in value - Dawgz AI fits the bill perfectly. Final Thoughts What is the best cheap crypto to buy now? That’s easy: Dawgz AI is the top dog in this race. It’s got staking rewards, AI-powered trading bots, and real momentum, making it more than just another meme coin. Bonk? It’s got history but no real utility. Fartcoin? It’s hilarious, but do you really want to bet your portfolio on a joke? The best meme coins aren’t just funny; they’re profitable. Dawgz AI delivers both. Pro Tip: The best crypto to buy right now is the one that’s still in presale before the big price jump. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While venture capitalists chase the next theoretical moonshot, seasoned investors have spotted something extraordinary – a presale token that’s already making money, not just promises. The battle lines have been drawn between BitLemons (BLEM) , with its functioning casino platform generating real revenue today, versus innovative contenders like Solaxy (SOLX) and BTC Bull (BTCBULL) with their unique value propositions. As the clock ticks down on BitLemons’ Stage 2 presale, investors are asking a crucial question: why gamble on tomorrow’s promises when you can bank on today’s profits? Is Real Revenue Better Than Speculative Promises? BitLemons ($BLEM) stands out in the crowded presale marketplace as the only option with a fully operational product generating actual revenue today . Unlike competitors still in development phases, BitLemons’ crypto casino is processing transactions and creating value 24/7. With over 8,000 games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic, BitLemons is disrupting the $450 billion traditional casino market through its innovative GambleFi protocol. This isn’t just another token hoping to find utility – it’s a revenue-generating machine with clear tokenomics: 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) allocated directly to tokenomics 15% for strategic token buyback & burn (creating deflationary pressure) 15% for staking rewards (incentivizing long-term holding) How Does Solaxy (SOLX) Compare to BitLemons’ Proven Model? Solaxy (SOLX) presents an innovative technical solution as a Layer 2 scaling platform built on Solana, designed to enhance blockchain efficiency and transaction speeds: Technical Innovation: Solaxy aims to improve Solana’s performance through off-chain processing, transaction bundling, and modular infrastructure – addressing real scalability challenges in the blockchain space. Clear Tokenomics Structure: With a total supply of 138,046,000,000 tokens strategically distributed (30% for development, 25% for staking rewards, 20% for treasury), Solaxy demonstrates thoughtful financial planning. Staking Benefits: Solaxy’s dedicated staking program with dynamic APY rewards provides an attractive incentive for long-term holders. While Solaxy’s technical roadmap is impressive with smart contracts audited by Coinsult, its full Layer 2 blockchain launch isn’t expected until Q2-Q3 2025. BitLemons offers immediate benefits through its dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof and an operational platform that’s already generating revenue today. Can BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) Deliver on Its Bitcoin-Based Promises?

Bitcoin, the crypto market leader, briefly topped $92,700, extending the recovery from lows around $81,500 on Tuesday. MOVE, CRO, ONDO and Render traded 10% to 17% higher as of writing. Broadly speaking, AI, gaming and Layer 2 coins are the best-performing crypto sub-sectors for the past 24 hours. The positive move could be attributed to rumors that President Donald Trump will unveil a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve during Friday’s White House crypto summit. Meanwhile, hopes that Trump's tariffs will likely not endure have helped restore the risk sentiment on Wall Street and Germany and China's fiscal rockets have offered support to Asian and European equities. Still, we haven't seen a notable decline in the volatility indices. At press time, Volmex's BVIV index, which measures the implied or expected 30-day price turbulence, held just five points below Tuesday's high of 66% but well above the February low of 49.6%. Perhaps traders see Friday's crypto summit as the make-or-break moment for crypto, as the President, having promised big for months, is now expected to deliver the goods as soon as possible. In traditional markets, VIX, Wall Street's fear gauge, held at 23.65 Wednesday, the highest since mid-December, according to data source TradingView. Meanwhile, the MOVE index, which measures the 30-expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury notes, remained elevated at 104, the highest since November (check chart of the day). The elevated volatility in bonds is particularly concerning as it is known to cause financial tightening and weigh over risk assets. For now, however, a weaker dollar seems to be compensating for that. Still, the sticky vol indices in traditional markets raise an important question: Is the market's concern solely about tariffs, or are there underlying worries related to a significant slowdown driven by other factors such as potential fiscal consolidation? The spread between yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note and the three-month Treasury bill has again turned negative, inverting the yield curve to suggest recession - consecutive quarterly contractions in the GDP. ""[This is] generally not a good sign,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter said in Wednesday's edition. Early this week, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model signaled a nearly 3% contraction in the U.S. GDP in the first quarter. The number is due for an update today. Recession fears will likely strengthen if we don't see an improvement today, potentially pressuring risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Acheson summed up the situation best: ""We are still navigating the tussle between narratives – on the one hand, risk-off sentiment driven by macro uncertainty could keep BTC and other crypto assets depressed for a while. On the other hand, the “safe haven” narrative is gaining strength, as positive news from the White House highlights the astonishing shift in official support."" Stay alert!

The launch of sGHO, featuring no withdrawal or deposit fees, is part of Aave DAO's aggressive growth strategy to drive GHO adoption during a depressed yield market. Alongside sGHO, Aave is pursuing other initiatives to expand GHO's user base, such as introducing it as a gas token across different blockchains and integrating it into various ecosystems, while also approving a treasury rebalancing to reduce risks and improve liquidity on Aave v3. Derivatives Positioning Funding rates for most major tokens, except ADA, XRP and TON, are positive, per data source Velo Data. The negative figure for the three coins suggests bias for shorts and potential for a short squeeze should the spot price hold resilient. BTC, ETH funding rates remain mildly positive. Market stability has yet to bring a notable increase in the CME BTC and ETH's future open interest. This shows institutions are likely still wary of potential downside risks.

These are representatives and/or core developers of Hedera ( HBAR ), Algorand ( ALGO ), Aptos ( APT ), and MultiversX ( EGLD ), respectively. “There are many domain experts who need to be in the room, like Leemon Baird from HBAR, or Silvio Micali from ALGO, or Avery Ching from APT, or Beniamin Mincu from EGLD.

Many unconfirmed lists of supposedly invited names to the White House Crypto Summit have been circulating on the web. Nevertheless, most are either highly speculative or intentionally fake lists, requiring caution. Right now, one of the most trusted sources on the matter is Eleanor Terrett, from Fox Business , verifying each name. Eleanor has been checking the candidates and confirming each one individually through a series of posts on X. So far, the journalist has confirmed the following participants for Donald Trump’s White House Crypto Summit: Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO; Arjun Sethi, Kraken CEO; Michael Saylor, Strategy Founder and Executive Chairman; Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO; Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink (LINK); Kyle Samani, Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital; Zack Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial (WLFI); JP Richardson, Exodus CEO; Matt Huang, co-founder of Paradigm; David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine; Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini; Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini; Kris, CEO of CryptoCom. Notably, there are no Ethereum ( ETH ), Ripple’s XRP , Solana ( SOL ), or Cardano representatives among Terrett’s confirmations. This is surprising, considering Trump has shown support to these cryptocurrencies, hinting at adding them to the U.S. reserves. Nevertheless, it is still soon to take conclusions as the confirmations are increasing overtime. The market has all eyes on the meeting that could open doors for both bullish or bearish decisions moving forward.

On March 6, the overall market cap for memecoins nearly reached $62 million, surging by 5% in the past 24 hours of trading. Among the top traded tokens, FARTCOIN ( FARTCOIN ) rose by nearly 27% to a price of $0.35 while the official Trump coin ( TRUMP ) went up by 2.3%. TRUMP is currently trading hands at $13.70. The meme coin market went through a major slump following a series of “presidential meme coin” drops, starting from the official TRUMP meme coin to the LIBRA meme coin endorsed by Argentinian President Javier Milei. It seems the market is recovering slowly from the crash. More recently, an Argentine federal prosecutor Eduardo Taiano told media outlets that he was intent on freezing around $110 million in assets as part of an ongoing investigation into the Argentinian President’s involvement in the collapse of the LIBRA meme coin, according to local media outlet Clarin . You might also like: MELANIA team tokens worth $39m unlock amidst LIBRA collapse Not only that, the prosecutor has also submitted a request to access to President Milei’s deleted social media posts, specifically the ones which indicated he allegedly promoted the Solana ( SOL ) -based memecoin. As part of the the probe, authorities would be able to freeze funds in digital wallets linked to the meme coin scandal. On-chain data shows that there were at least eight wallets linked to the LIBRA team which made a profit of $107 million before the token’s eventual downfall. Recently, funds amounting to $4.5 million were moved from one of the wallets to a new digital address. It was later reportedly used to purchase the POPE meme coin, which could indicate possible money laundering efforts. The POPE meme coin is currently trading hands at $0.18. What is the LIBRA meme coin scandal? The scandal was dubbed “Libragate” by traders and has led to Argentinians calling for the impeachment of President Javier Milei. It started when Milei shared a post on his social media account on Feb. 15 at 5:01 EST, promoting a token that he claimed would help boost the “Argentine economy by funding small projects.” However, the memecoin crashed not long after its launch, wiping out $4.4 billion in market capitalization thus affecting the overall meme coin market. According to a Nansen report , between Feb. 14 until Feb. 18, around 86% of LIBRA traders suffered losses amounting to $251 million.

Ondo ( ONDO ) price was trading at $1.60 on Thursday, marking a 30% increase from its lowest level this year. However, strong technical and fundamental indicators suggest a potential rebound in the coming weeks. A key factor supporting a potential recovery is the continued growth of Ondo Finance’s ecosystem. According to DeFi Llama, the total value locked in Ondo’s ecosystem has surpassed $1 billion for the first time. This marks a significant increase from $541 million at the start of the year. Ondo TVL chart | Source: DeFi Llama This growth is driven by its two tokenized assets: Ondo Short-Term US Treasuries Fund (OUSG) and Ondo US Dollar Yield Token (USDY.) USDY currently holds over $589 million, while OUSG has $419 million in assets.

USDY offers an annual percentage yield of 4.35%, while OUSG yields 4.03%. Ondo’s price could also be influenced by investments from Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial. WLFI now holds 342,000 ONDO tokens, valued at over $400,000. Ondo was one of the top donors to Trump’s inauguration committee, which has fueled speculation that the project may be considered for inclusion in the U.S. strategic crypto reserves. Ondo price analysis Ondo price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ondo Finance has been in a strong downward trend in recent months, in line with a broader market decline. On the positive side, the coin has formed a falling wedge pattern, which comprises two descending and converging trendlines. A bullish breakout usually happens when the two lines are nearing their confluence levels. Ondo price has also formed a cup and handle pattern, another popular continuation sign. The upper side of this pattern is $1.4825, while its depth is 65%. There, measuring this distance from the upper side of the cup brings the Ondo price target at $2.4610, up by 113% from the current level.

In a recent post , Yakovenko clarified his stance regarding President Trump’s plans to establish a national crypto reserve that would include major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Cardano ( ADA ) as well as Solana ( SOL ). He also confirmed that he was not asked on whether SOL would be included in the crypto reserve line up. “No reserve, because if you want decentralization to fail you’d put the government in charge of it.” said Yakovenko. According to the Solana co-founder, if there truly has to be a crypto reserve then it should be created based on “objectively measurable requirements” in order for the project to be fair and decentralized for all parties involved. “I don’t care what they [the measures] are, they can even be constructed such that only bitcoin satisfies them right now, they just must be objectively measurable and rationally justified,” Yakovenko stated.

At press time, Yakovenko has not confirmed his attendance for the White House Crypto Summit set to be held on March 7. Meanwhile, a number of other crypto figureheads such as Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor, Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong have confirmed their attendance among others. Earlier today, crypto journalist Laura Shin claimed that sources say Garlinghouse urged President Trump to include Solana in the crypto reserve in order to make the inclusion of XRP in the reserve “seem more legitimate.” When asked whether that was true, Yakovenko said that he was not asked about the inclusion of Solana in Trump’s national crypto reserve nor was he the one that pitched it.

NYSE Arca has filed a proposal to list and trade shares of the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF, renewing the interest in the DOGE price. The approval of the ETF product could be a big thing for Dogecoin. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is a new platform that is merging traditional finance with blockchain technology under the same roof. The recent increase of listing price to $0.36 has increased the demand in the project. DTX Exchange’s 2x profit is the biggest attraction, making it a better option than slow DOGE price growth. DOGE Price Shows Bear Dominance Despite Dogecoin ETF News The weekly candle of the DOGE price shows that it has dropped from a high of $0.24 to $0.185, a drop of 19.40%, reflecting how strongly sellers drove the price lower after the recent surge. The optimism surrounding the Dogecoin ETF filing by Bitwise has failed to ignite any momentum in the DOGE price. Bitwise filed a registration with the regulators for the Dogecoin ETF in late January. If approved, the proposal would mark one of the first meme coins and Dogecoin ETFs to be listed in the U.S., granting regulated access to Dogecoin to the investors. ETF approvals have always seen delays in the US, and a delay in Dogecoin ETF can push the DOGE price towards new lows. Currently, the lower trendline of the wedge pattern is acting as a strong support; a breakdown from this will create a long-term bearish trend or consolidation in the DOGE price. Expert investors have already booked profit and are rotating funds into potential utility projects like DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange: A Better Alternative to Dogecoin While the DOGE price has long struggled to gain momentum, DTX Exchange (DTX) is rapidly expanding its trading ecosystem. What distinguishes DTX from other platforms is its first-mover advantage in the hybrid trading space. The platform's hybrid protocol allows users to trade 120k+ assets, such as stocks, gold, crypto, and forex, in one place. No other platform currently offers multi-asset trading, which gives DTX Exchange a unique advantage in the market. Unlike meme coins, which rely on hype and community support, DTX Exchange has already shown its capability with the launch of its proprietary Phoenix Wallet. The wallet has already been downloaded by 385,000 people, showing strong support for the project. Additionally, in the recently held blockchain testnet, DTX’s VulcanX achieved 200,000 TPS, breaking previous records. DTX Exchange offers real-world use cases and follows a clear roadmap, making it one of the most promising projects of 2025. With trading innovation, a profit-sharing model like a VIP rebate is another major attraction for investors as they can generate consistent income through this model. In the last round, $0.18 is the cost for each DTX token, purchasers will benefit as they are sold at a price lower than the listing price. The launch price is $0.36, and the traders will get a 200% at the time of listing. With a unique market positioning, the DTX Exchange could be able to uplift to $3, a gain of approximately 1,500%. Conclusion While the Dogecoin ETF has sparked investors' interest, the DOGE price remains volatile without any real utility. Many investors are turning to DTX Exchange , attracted by its limited supply and high growth potential. The platform aims to be a one-stop solution for traders, confirming the growing demand for multi-asset access. Investors have to enter the presale soon as the bonus round is the last chance to enjoy massive gains before the 2x listing.

Liv has officially introduced cryptocurrency trading services via its Liv X app, allowing customers to buy, hold, and sell digital assets, the firm said in a press release shared with Cryptonews.com. The feature, which became available on March 5, is powered by Aquanow, a licensed crypto asset service provider. Liv X Platform to Support Five Cryptos at Launch Initially, the platform will support five major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. To ensure the security of digital assets, Liv has partnered with Zodia Custody, a regulated cryptocurrency custodian that received a strategic investment from Emirates NBD in late 2024. The UAE has emerged as a significant hub for cryptocurrency adoption, driven by progressive regulations and increasing institutional and retail investor interest. A survey conducted by the International Financial Group Ltd found that one in ten UAE residents has invested in digital currencies, with Emiratis displaying the highest level of interest. Furthermore, a report by Chainalysis estimates that between July 2023 and June 2024, the UAE received over $30 billion in cryptocurrency transactions, placing it among the top 40 countries globally and making it the third-largest crypto economy in the MENA region. “With the highest crypto adoption rate in the UAE, we are keen to launch our own virtual asset offering to capitalise on this trend,” Marwan Hadi, Group Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management at Emirates NBD, said.

The platform offers innovative financial products such as Money Ahead Deposits, Goal Accounts, Digital Gold Investment Accounts, and a Cashback Card that provides up to AED 1,500 per month in rewards. “Incumbent institutions like Emirates NBD will play a pivotal role in driving the next wave of digital asset adoption and Aquanow is proud to be the leading crypto provider chosen by financial institutions both here in the GCC and globally,” Phil Sham, Chief Executive Officer of Aquanow, said. Saudi Economist Urges Gulf States to Develop Unified Crypto Payment Regulations Last month, Ihsan Buhulaiga, a former member of the Saudi Shura Council and a noted economist, called for Gulf Arab states to establish a unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, arguing that the region needs a coordinated approach to the growing use of digital assets as a payment tool. He urged GCC countries, which include Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman, to collaborate on crypto regulations. Despite Saudi Arabia’s strict stance against cryptocurrency transactions, other Gulf nations, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have introduced regulatory measures to govern digital asset usage. As reported, the UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the European Union’s (EU) newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.

For Dogecoin, large transactions have plummeted nearly 88% since mid-November 2024, leading to diminished liquidity and investor confidence. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is witnessing a rapid increase in whale interest. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale, MUTM tokens are priced at $0.015, with a projected launch price of $0.06, offering investors a potential 300% return on investment. The project has raised more than $2.2 million and attracted over 4200 holders in record time. This promising outlook is attracting significant attention from large investors seeking new opportunities in the crypto market. Ethereum and Solana: once giants, now facing whale exodus Both Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), two of the largest movers in the cryptocurrency space, are also feeling the pinch as whale activity is not present. Ethereum has lost 12% over the last 24 hours to $2,111, as large investors are seemingly being held back in an uncertain market environment. Solana (SOL) is little better off as its whale accounts, or addresses that have more than 10,000 Solana, have plummeted significantly, leading to flat price movement. Currently, Solana hovers around $139, struggling to maintain its previous momentum. High-value investors are scanning the horizon for better opportunities, with these declines and many seem to be eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big play. Mutuum Finance presale gains traction as investor interest skyrockets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is experiencing a surge in investor enthusiasm, with its presale gaining significant momentum. Over $2.2 million has already been raised, with more than 4200 investors securing early positions. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2, demand continues to grow as investors anticipate the next price increase. With a projected launch price of $0.06, early participants stand to gain up to 300%, with additional upside potential once the token reaches major exchanges. Mutuum Finance is transforming decentralized lending with a unique dual-lending model that incorporates both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model employs smart contracts to optimize liquidity pools with efficient use of capital by real-time manipulation of interest rates that dynamically adjust according to market conditions. P2P bypasses middlemen so that the users can enter lending contracts directly with complete openness and full autonomy over terms. With the option of fixed and floating interest rates, the system is ideal for a broad variety of risk profiles and provides users with greater financial flexibility. Audited smart contracts also provide better security for a secure and convenient lending experience. Growth potential & exclusive investor rewards Mutuum Finance is building a solid foundation with plans for strategic token buybacks, staking rewards, and prominent listing on exchanges. To commemorate its rapid expansion, the site launched a $100,000 giveaway, giving 10 lucky winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a referral program that boosts member involvement through incentives for bringing in new investors to the site. With increasing demand for novel DeFi solutions, Mutuum Finance will become an important stakeholder in the digital finance industry. As whale interest in Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) declines, it’s clear that large investors are moving toward new opportunities. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raising over $2.2 million and attracting 4,200+ holders, its Phase 2 presale at $0.015 is rapidly gaining traction. Investors who act now stand to gain 300% before launch, with even greater upside potential post-listing. With its innovative DeFi lending model and strategic growth plans, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the next big crypto play. Secure your MUTM tokens today before the price increases.

L2 Impact On AI Projects,https://coingape.com/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-spotlights-l1-vs-l2-impact-on-ai-projects/,"Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has recently shared vital insights on the impact of L1 vs L2 for AI projects looking to venture into the blockchain industry. In an X post this Thursday, CZ cracked on how AI projects could leverage two branches of the same tech differently. Notably, L1 offers sovereignty whilst L2 offers efficiency, a topic of constant debate across the broader sector. Binance Founder Spotlights Impact Of L1 vs L2 Capabilities On AI Projects In his X post on March 6, CZ tapped into the question: “Does it matter if a new AI project is an L1 or an L2?” The Binance founder revealed that the ultimate goal for an AI project is to leverage blockchain in aiding with better AI economics rather than the project core being used to develop a better blockchain. L1 vs L2 Saga: Here’s What To Know “Having your own L1 feels like you have more sovereignty, more decentralization,” CZ added. However, this also paves the way for a lot more effort in regards to nodes, validators, etc, indicating more computational and financial load. On the other hand, L2 eliminates “all that work,” CZ stated. This statement indicates that the utilization of L2s eliminates all computational and financial costs, unlike L1s. Moreover, the Binance founder also spotlights how users can enjoy benefits such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), perpetual futures (perps), and other existing DeFi tools. CZ concluded by saying, “Is L1 cooler than L2 or the reverse? Old topic, but wondering if sentiment has changed or not,” setting off waves of discussions across the broader sector. CZ Offers Advice Amid Recent Market Turbulence On the other hand, Changpeng Zhao took the stage to offer investment advice amid the recent market dip. Intriguingly, rather than offering investors assurance, the Binance founder urged market participants to reduce their investment sizes if the dips seemed worrying. “Dips are a part of free markets,” CZ added, while also rationalizing the broader volatility. For context, the crypto market saw a bloodbath in February, attributable to macro heat and liquidity hurdles. Nevertheless, Bitcoin and Altcoin prices recovered as March kicked off, aligning with Donald Trump’s U.S. crypto reserve and crypto summit plans. Traders and investors stay on their toes amid broader developments while CZ continues to spark buzz market-wide with his comments. The post Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Spotlights L1 Vs.

33767162,[object Object],1741267836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Addresses Holding Over 10,000 ETH Droped To 919 In Two Weeks – Insights",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-addresses-holding-over-10000-eth-droped-to-919-in-two-weeks-insights/,"Ethereum (ETH) has struggled below the $2,300 mark for the past few days, following two weeks of massive volatility and aggressive price swings. After a period of uncertainty, Ethereum remains in a downtrend, with bulls unable to reclaim key resistance levels. Since the start of February, ETH has lost over 40% of its value, reflecting the broader market weakness and increasing negative sentiment toward the asset. The lack of bullish momentum has left traders cautious as Ethereum continues to trade near multi-month lows. On-chain data from Glassnode reveals a concerning trend—the number of addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH has dropped to 919, down from 999 in late February. This significant decline suggests that large holders have been offloading their ETH, likely due to strong selling pressure and fear-driven market conditions. With Ethereum facing continued resistance and heavy selling, all eyes are on whether ETH can stabilize or if further downside is ahead. The coming days will be crucial in determining if Ethereum can reclaim key price levels or if selling pressure will push the asset even lower. Traders are watching for a potential shift in momentum, but for now, Ethereum remains under bearish control. Ethereum Whales Sell During Price Breakdown Ethereum is trading at low levels after failing to reclaim the $2,500 mark, leaving the market uncertain about its next move. Analysts remain divided, with some calling for a continued drop as ETH’s price action remains unstable, while others see signs of a potential recovery forming at key support levels. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data from Glassnode, revealing that the number of Ethereum addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH has dropped to 919, down from 999 in late February. This suggests that whales have been selling heavily during the latest correction, likely driven by fear and liquidity issues. The capitulation of big players is often a bearish sign, signaling uncertainty among institutional investors and raising concerns about further downside risk. 10K | Source: Ali Martinez on X"" width=""980"" height=""551"" srcset=""https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=1200 1200w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=640 640w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=980 980w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=750 750w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eth_2299fb.jpeg?w=1140 1140w"" sizes=""(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"" /> Despite this wave of selling, Ethereum has held a key demand level around $2,200, suggesting that a potential reversal could be forming. If ETH manages to stabilize at this level, it could build momentum for a rebound in the coming weeks. The next few weeks will be crucial for ETH’s price action. If bulls regain control, Ethereum could attempt another push toward $2,500 and beyond. However, failure to hold current levels could result in another leg down, extending its bearish phase and keeping traders on edge. Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,300, stuck in a range after failing to hold above $2,500 or break below $2,000. The market remains uncertain, with volatility swinging ETH’s price up and down, preventing a clear trend from forming. For bulls to confirm a recovery rally, a push above the $2,500-$2,600 range is essential. Reclaiming this zone would signal strong buying momentum, potentially shifting sentiment back in favor of bulls. Without this move, Ethereum remains at risk of continued consolidation or another leg down. However, for now, the main focus is on holding the $2,200 demand level. This key support zone has kept ETH from breaking lower, but if it fails, selling pressure could intensify, pushing Ethereum toward sub-$2,000 levels. With market uncertainty still high, traders are watching whether ETH can stabilize above $2,200 or gain momentum toward higher resistance levels. Until Ethereum breaks out of its current range, volatility is expected to continue, keeping both bulls and bears cautious about the next major price move.

As XRP keeps gaining momentum, another token gaining attention in the news is DTX Exchange. With 700,000+ holders already registered, DTX is made to be quick, secure, and fully transparent. Its non-custodial design ensures users never have to lose ownership of their funds, and its on-chain order book ensures transparency of trades for all. The presale is sold out but this is the final chance to get before listing on DTX at $0.36, as DTX is in its bonus stage. DTX Exchange: The Rare 4x Opportunity Before Listing Imagine buying a token early, seeing it double in price before launch, and then realizing you could have made 4x instead of 2x. That’s exactly what DTX Exchange is offering right now. And because the presale is set at $0.18 with the listing price of $0.36, investors already have a 2x return in hand. But by buying with promo code ""LIST2X,"" investors double their token amount, and that 2x becomes a flat-out 4x profit before DTX lists on major exchanges. DTX is redefining the crypto trading rules. Unlike traditional platforms that store user funds, DTX is completely non-custodial, and therefore each trader has complete control of their assets at all times. Another standout feature is DTX's distributed liquidity pools, which are designed to eliminate price slippage and give traders the best possible execution. The numbers do not lie; 700,000+ holders are already part of the DTX ecosystem with demand continuing to increase. The project has already surpassed $15.2 million in presale, an obvious reflection of its strong investor confidence. Because DTX is in its bonus stage, this is the final opportunity to join before it lists on major exchanges like ByBit and Binance at $0.36. U.S. Government Policy Change Pushes XRP Higher XRP price is surging aggressively following a major policy move by the U.S. government in favor of digital assets. The government stated that Ripple's XRP would be part of a new Crypto Strategic Reserve that would bring billions into the economy. Investors did not hesitate to grab the opportunity to buy more XRP, hoping to drive its price higher. By doing so, Ripple's XRP is a more valuable finance asset, according to MarketWatch. XRP price had remained dormant before this news, but now XRP is currently at around $2.47 and has gathered close to an 8% increase in the last 7 days. Institutional investors like finance institutions and hedge funds will start investing in Ripple's XRP, experts predict. Source: CoinMarketCap Investors are expecting that XRP price will keep rising on account of clearer regulation and wider acceptance in finance, as reported by Barron. Now that the U.S. government has officially given its seal of approval for Ripple's XRP, many believe that it will stay strong for the long term. The market shows a clear pattern, XRP price is now no longer a speculative risk but a true digital currency with true use in the financial market. More investors jumping in, and Ripple's XRP just continues to increase. Conclusion The US government's policy move will pump billions into the XRP price, pushing Ripple even further into the spotlight. But while XRP continues to gain attention, DTX Exchange is building itself up to be the next big thing. Particularly because of its staking rewards program where the owners can receive passive returns and value appreciation. With 700,000+ holders already joined, demand is more pressing than ever. This is the final pre-listing opportunity to invest, and through the ""LIST2X"" offer, investors are given twice their DTX balances along with a 100% return before trading begins.

The trading platform also halted all trading services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals. The latest freeze action aligns with recent EU and OFAC sanctions targeting Russian financial entities evading restrictions. Despite enforcing USDT freezes on illicit transactions, Tether remains non-compliant with the EU’s MiCA regulations. On March 6, Russian crypto exchange Garantex reported that stablecoin giant Tether had frozen access to its wallets holding over 2.5 billion rubles ($27 million) in USDT. The platform warned Russian users that their USDT holdings could also be at risk, as Tether’s freezes may continue targeting funds linked to sanctioned entities. This latest block comes after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the Garantex exchange in 2022, accusing it of facilitating over $100 million in illegal transactions. Garantex Exchange Temporarily Suspends Services According to an announcement on its Telegram channel, the Garantex exchange has temporarily suspended all trading services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals.

ALL TRADING AND WITHDRAWAL SERVICES HAVE NOW BEEN SUSPENDED ON THE PLATFORM. pic.twitter.com/6iyjQnDcBE — Karan Singh Arora (@thisisksa) March 6, 2025 The platform’s team is actively working to resolve the issue, but no timeline has been provided for when services might resume or how the matter will be addressed. Tether has not yet released an official statement regarding the frozen Garantex exchange wallets. However, financial experts believe the freeze is directly linked to recent international sanctions and violations. EU and U.S. Crack Down on Garantex Exchange Over Sanctions Evasion Early last month, the EU introduced its 16th package of sanctions in response to Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. As part of these measures, the Garantex exchange was sanctioned due to its close financial ties to Russian banks already under EU restrictions. Authorities accused the platform of facilitating transactions that helped Russia circumvent financial sanctions, enabling sanctioned entities to move funds despite international restrictions. This marked a major moment in regulatory history, as it was the first time the EU sanctioned a cryptocurrency exchange. The recent action against the Garantex exchange mirrors a similar crackdown by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in April 2022. According to OFAC investigations, over $100 million in Garantex transactions were linked to illicit activities, including nearly $6 million from the Russian ransomware group Conti and approximately $2.6 million from Hydra, a now-defunct Russian darknet marketplace. To put these developments into a deeper context, a 2024 report by Chainalysis highlighted how Russia and Iran have been leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and no-KYC exchanges to sustain financial operations despite international sanctions. The report estimated that sanctioned entities in both countries received $15.8 billion in cryptocurrency throughout the year, making up nearly 39% of all illicit crypto transactions. The latest EU restrictions and the Tether freeze on Garantex exchange wallets are expected to further cut Russia’s access to Western banking systems, cryptocurrencies, and other financial tools. Tether Freezes: A Recurring Pattern in Crypto Crime Crackdowns Tether freezes are not uncommon, and the action against the Garantex exchange is part of a larger pattern. In November 2023, Tether froze $225 million in USDT in collaboration with OKX, targeting a human trafficking ring in Southeast Asia running a global pig butchering scam. The freeze was carried out at the request of the U.S. Secret Service and marked the largest seizure of Tether’s USDT to date. JUST IN: Tether freezes $225 million in $USDT linked to human trafficking group. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) November 20, 2023 More recently, in February 2025, Tether froze approximately $46 million USDT by blocking 11 TRON addresses and seven Ethereum addresses associated with illicit activities. In the same month, another 181,000 USDT was frozen due to its links to the ByBit hack , which resulted in losses of $1.46 billion. Regulatory Scrutiny on Tether’s USDT and Its Compliance Challenges Despite these enforcement actions, Tether has faced criticism over its transparency and regulatory compliance. The company has been under scrutiny for not fully disclosing the composition of its reserves, raising concerns about the stability of Tether’s USDT. Additionally, it has encountered compliance challenges with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations , which require major stablecoin issuers to hold at least 60% of their reserves in bank deposits. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, has opposed this requirement, arguing that it could expose stablecoin issuers to increased financial risks. MiCA Regulations: Tether CEO Criticizes Bank Deposit Requirement for Stablecoins Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino( @paoloardoino ), has criticized the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, particularly challenging the rule requiring stablecoin issuers to hold reserves… pic.twitter.com/XgXZ08mcam — EchoeWeb (@Echoeweb) June 5, 2024 As the situation unfolds, users of the Garantex exchange remain in limbo, awaiting further updates on whether Tether freezes will continue and whether the exchange can resolve the issue. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does Tether decide which wallets to freeze? Tether freezes wallets based on law enforcement requests, regulatory actions, or suspected illicit activity. While the company has not fully disclosed its internal decision-making process, past freezes suggest it closely collaborates with U.S. and global regulators. Can affected users recover their frozen USDT? Once USDT is frozen, recovery depends on whether Tether receives clearance from authorities or finds sufficient justification to release the funds. In most cases, frozen assets linked to sanction violations remain inaccessible indefinitely. Could other stablecoin issuers follow Tether’s lead in freezing sanctioned wallets? While Tether is the most active in enforcing freezes, other issuers like Circle (USDC) and Paxos (USDP) have also cooperated with regulators in freezing wallets. However, decentralized stablecoins like DAI may not be as easily controlled by centralized entities. What impact do Tether freezes have on the broader crypto market? Tether freezes can create panic among traders, leading to liquidity disruptions on affected exchanges. They also raise concerns about censorship risks in crypto, potentially driving users toward more decentralized alternatives.

While Bitcoin remains Scaramucci’s largest holding, with over 50% of his portfolio allocated to BTC, he has also invested in Solana ( SOL ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), and Polkadot ( DOT )—assets chosen primarily for their utility. Speaking on the Bankless podcast in early January, Scaramucci highlighted Solana as his top choice among layer-one blockchains, citing its speed and low transaction costs as key advantages. His outlook on Bitcoin remains equally optimistic, having predicted last year that BTC would surpass $100,000 in 2024, fueled by surging demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). Looking ahead, he believes pro-crypto policies under a new administration could drive Bitcoin’s value even higher, potentially doubling by 2025. However, despite his optimism for digital assets, he warns that Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies, particularly a blanket tariff approach, could introduce economic headwinds, potentially pushing the U.S. into a recession—a factor that has weighed heavily on market sentiment. Anthony Scaramucci’s portfolio performance in 2025 For investors who mirrored Anthony Scaramucci’s crypto portfolio with a $1,000 investment made on January 1, 2025, the results have been rough, with all his favored assets deep in the red. Bitcoin is down 2.84% year-to-date, trading at $91,419, amid persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly plunged below $85,000 after Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico, triggering a market-wide selloff and wiping out over $985 million in liquidations . The downturn erased gains from a short-lived rally sparked by Trump’s March 2 announcement of a strategic crypto reserve , which had initially boosted sentiment in the digital asset market. However, Bitcoin rebounded sharply, surging to $92,700 after Trump postponed new automobile tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month, easing investor concerns. Altcoins take a harder hit While Bitcoin has managed to recover some losses, Solana, which Scaramucci and SkyBridge Capital have favored over Ethereum ( ETH ), has taken a significant hit, dropping 23% to $148. BTC and SOL price year-to-date (YTD) charts. Source: Finbold Other altcoins in his portfolio have performed even worse. Avalanche has plunged 38% to $22, while Polkadot has fallen 31% to $4.58, as risk-off sentiment and regulatory uncertainty continue to weigh on the broader crypto market. AVAX and DOT price year-to-date (YTD) charts. Source: Finbold A $1,000 investment : Where does it stand now? Taking all these factors into account, a $1,000 investment split evenly between Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot would have suffered a 23.34% loss, bringing the portfolio’s total value down to $766.58. While his high-conviction bets on Bitcoin and select altcoins have delivered strong returns in past bull cycles, the portfolio’s performance equally highlights the vulnerabilities of a narrowly focused approach. A more diversified portfolio , incorporating stablecoins and a broader mix of cryptocurrencies, could help cushion against sharp market swings. Still, with signs of a short-term recovery taking shape, the focus now shifts to whether this rebound can gain momentum and turn into a sustained rally in the months ahead.

Through staking, RCOF holders can further profit from 10% Annual Percentage Yields (APY), generating a sustained revenue stream and improving liquidity in the ecosystem. Moreover, RCOF is the main currency used for reward distribution, cashback, and promotional offers, so offering even more value to members of the RCO Finance community.

Upbit held over 5.9B XRP in its reserves, nearly double the reserves on Binance. | Source: Cryptoquant XRP is also the most actively traded asset on Upbit, with over $651M in daily volumes. Upbit almost matches Binance in terms of XRP activity, and it also offers a Korean won premium for the asset. XRP has been revived with a narrative of being a “Made in USA” crypto. The native token, which was at one point airdropped widely, only regained its value status after the US Securities and Exchange Commission withdrew intentions of prolonging a lawsuit that ran for years. Upbit also retains its advantage after Binance restricted and delisted XRP pairs. Currently, Upbit is driving a significant part of XRP activity based on Korean won pairs. The premium on Upbit lifted XRP to as high as $2.65, while most exchanges traded the asset at around $2.58. The Korean won is also growing its share of XRP activity, often rising above 20% of all trading volumes. The Korean won increased its share of XRP trading, as South Korean exchanges reacted to the popularity of XRP. | Source: Cryptocompare XRP also had a sudden spike in trading as of March 6, becoming the most actively traded asset in the Korean markets. The exchanges are isolated from international liquidity due to banking requirements, but they often reflect global crypto trends with even greater trading enthusiasm. Upbit boosts buying for ‘Made in USA’ crypto Upbit is showing a trend for active trading for some of the assets labeled as “Made in USA.” The recent spike in XRP activity tracked US attempts to onboard top assets for a government reserve. XRP also rallied after mentions of new crypto-friendly legislation . Other South Korean exchanges choose different paths for carrying XRP. Kucoin divested its holdings in the past few months. Bithumb started accumulating again at the end of 2024 and now carries over 1.5B XRP. Among top trending tokens, Upbit also saw a spike in trading volumes for Ondo (ONDO). The asset has links to US-based crypto activities and is one of the tokens held by Trump’s World Liberty Fi. ONDO traded at $1.19 on Upbit, with a small premium against the general price of $1.17 on other exchanges. Ondo Finance was not mentioned in the potential US strategic reserve, though it was one of the leading platforms for real-world asset tokenization. In addition to active trading, Upbit’s wallets also accumulated currently trending assets. Upbit currently carries over 391M ONDO, up from 280M at the beginning of the year. Ondo’s founder Nat Eliason will attend the White House crypto meetup, which will include top founders and influencers like Ripple Labs’ Brad Garlinghouse also confirmed to be in attendance. XRP recovers open interest The recent market enthusiasm for XRP is helping the asset recover its open interest . Within hours, XRP added $100M to its positions, from $1.44B to $1.54B. XRP still carries over 68% in long positions, causing some concerns about liquidations. The recent rally also caused $1.82M in liquidations in the past hour, as XRP became the most liquidated asset in the short term. This time, the XRP price expansion is causing a clearance of short positions , affecting those that were bearish about the asset. XRP currently rides on the narrative of wider US-based adoption. The price is having a short-term breakout, with some predictions of trading above $3. Currently, the retail sentiment for XRP is neutral, but smart money traders remain bullish.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-spot-etfs-continue-to-make-outflows-as-market-anxiety-continues-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced significant net outflows on March 5, signaling continued investor caution amid recent market volatility. Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs See $101.6 Million Net Outflow on March 5 According to the latest data, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $38.3 million, while Ethereum spot ETFs saw even larger outflows, reaching $63.3 million. This brings the total net outflows for both assets to approximately $101.6 million in a single day. Market Sentiment and ETF Trends The outflows reflect the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market as investors potentially reallocate funds or take profits amid price volatility. Ethereum’s higher rally compared to Bitcoin suggests that investors may be more hesitant about ETH’s near-term prospects. The decline in ETF inflows follows a strong start to the year, which saw record demand for Bitcoin ETFs after they were approved in the U.S. in January. However, recent market corrections combined with macroeconomic concerns and regulatory scrutiny have led to increased selling pressure. Analysts will be watching closely to see if this trend continues or if investors will turn to spot ETFs as a long-term risk strategy. Despite the recent outflows, institutional interest in crypto ETFs remains strong, and upcoming regulatory decisions on Ethereum ETFs in particular could shape the market’s direction in the coming months. *This is not investment advice.

The growing adoption of its blockchain and increasing institutional interest have positioned SOL as a key contender in the next market rally. However, while SOL’s growth potential is promising, another emerging crypto is capturing the interest of investors seeking even higher returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rapidly growing DeFi project, is attracting investors looking for significant upside. With a decentralized lending platform and a structured financial model, the project is positioned to see major adoption. As its presale continues to gain traction, analysts predict MUTM could reach 150x in the upcoming bull run, making it one of the most talked-about investment opportunities in the space. Solana (SOL) Analysts have projected an 80% surge for Solana (SOL) as market conditions improve and investor confidence grows. The prediction is based on increasing network activity, expanding use cases, and strong technical indicators pointing toward a potential breakout. With Solana’s blockchain gaining more adoption in DeFi and NFT sectors, its long-term prospects remain positive, driving speculation of significant price appreciation. Institutional interest in Solana has also played a role in shaping this forecast. Large investors have been accumulating SOL, further reinforcing the bullish outlook. Additionally, upcoming network upgrades and enhanced scalability solutions are expected to strengthen its ecosystem, potentially pushing its price higher in the next market rally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Solana is expected to see significant gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a high-growth contender with far greater upside. The project is building a decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem that allows users to earn passive income, access liquidity, and participate in a structured DeFi economy. Unlike many speculative tokens, MUTM is backed by a functional model that provides real financial utility. One of the main factors behind MUTM’s projected 150x surge is its presale performance. Over $2.2 million has been raised so far, with more than 4,200 holders securing early positions. Currently priced at $0.015, the token is set for a 50% increase in the next presale phase, creating urgency among investors before it reaches wider exchange accessibility. Mutuum Finance isn’t just another DeFi project—it’s creating a peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform designed to revolutionize decentralized finance. By allowing users to supply liquidity and earn APY, while enabling borrowers to access funds with overcollateralized loans, the platform ensures a sustainable financial model. Additionally, a stablecoin integration is being developed, further strengthening the project’s ecosystem and increasing demand for MUTM. What makes this projected 150x surge even more compelling is that the beta version of the lending platform is expected to launch alongside the token’s official release. This will drive immediate demand, as users will be able to engage with the platform from day one. With increasing adoption and exchange listings planned, the price of MUTM is anticipated to skyrocket post-launch, following a path similar to early-stage DeFi projects that saw exponential growth. With Mutuum Finance’s presale accelerating, investors recognize that early entry presents the greatest opportunity for substantial returns. As the next phase approaches, with a 50% price increase to $0.02, those who buy in now stand to benefit before the token reaches public markets. Given the project’s structured financial model, presale momentum, and upcoming platform launch, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most promising investments in the next bull run. For those who missed early opportunities in assets like Solana, Mutuum Finance offers a second chance to invest in a high-potential DeFi project before mainstream adoption sends prices soaring.

DOGE has remained a top-10 asset by market cap but its price swings have been unpredictable despite its proven resilience. However, DOGE lacks the utility, staking mechanisms, and structured rewards currently sought by investors. Meanwhile, DOGE holders want yield-generating ecosystems that offer more than market-driven price fluctuations. Real investment opportunities are, therefore, shifting toward DeFi protocols that generate passive income since memecoins primarily thrive on speculation. The shift to DeFi investments has led traders Solaxy and Skyren DAO which offer long-term sustainability, DeFi participation, and high-yield staking opportunities. Solaxy scales Solana’s network for a high-speed future The Solana ecosystem has continued to see significant growth despite frequent network congestion and high transaction demand revealing the chain’s scalability problem. Solaxy aims to solve these bottlenecks by offering a Layer-2 scaling solution that bundles transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Solana’s mainnet. Solaxy’s technology enhances transaction speed while reducing congestion, making it a crucial part of Solana’s long-term expansion. Solaxy’s successful approach is reflected in the platform’s generation of $22 million from presale order, which also highlights investor confidence in its potential. The Solaxy ecosystem prioritizes security and efficiency, and its smart contracts have already been fully audited by SolidProof to ensure smooth transactions and efficient functionalities. Solaxy has also partnered with Best Wallet to enable the direct purchase of SOLX tokens within the wallet application. Solaxy’s low transaction fees, enhanced scalability, and strong backing from the Solana community have placed it ahead of other DeFi protocols. Skyren DAO offers passive income, staking rewards, and airdrop automation Skyren DAO is built on Polygon’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure, which provides a seamless environment for staking and automated airdrop collection. Skyren is unlike many other DeFi projects that require constant participation because it ensures that investors earn rewards without active management. Skyren’s staking mechanism allows users to lock SKYRN tokens and receive consistent APY rewards, turning passive holdings into steady income streams. Skyren DAO’s ‘governance participation structure’ plays a key role in giving token holders the power to vote over staking rates, airdrop partnerships, and future protocol upgrades. Skyren’s airdrop collection is fully automated to ensure that SKYRN holders receive tokens from vetted projects across Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains. The user-friendly Skyren platform also eliminates the manual tracking and claiming of airdrops. Skyren DAO’s priority on security and transparency is reflected in how thorough its smart contracts are audited to avoid vulnerabilities. Skyren’s system is also KYC compliant which ensures that users ‘remain accountable’ and ‘adhere to regulations’. Each of the three tokens plays a critical role in crypto Dogecoin, Solaxy, and Skyren DAO serve a different role in the crypto ecosystem. Solaxy and Skyren DAO provide real utility and earning opportunities although Dogecoin remains a popular memecoin. Feature Dogecoin (DOGE) Solaxy (SOLX) Skyren DAO (SKYRN) Primary Use Case Digital currency Solana Layer-2 Scaling DAO, Staking & Airdrop Rewards Blockchain Dogecoin Network Solana Polygon Passive Income No Yes, via staking Yes, via staking & airdrops Scalability Low High, via Layer-2 High, via Polygon Governance Community-driven, but no voting Limited Full DAO voting power Smart Contract Audits Not required Completed by SolidProof Completed by Solidproof, Cognitos and Cyberscope Team Verified No No Yes Presale Fundraising None $20M+ Active at $0.048 Dogecoin’s strength lies in its large user base but the ecosystem lacks the structured earning opportunities currently sought by DeFi investors. Solaxy provides infrastructure for Solana’s long-term growth while Skyren DAO is a direct source of passive income for investors. DOGE holders explore Solaxy and Skyren DAO Dogecoin has proven its longevity despite investors seeking alternative projects that provide structured rewards rather than relying on price appreciation alone. Solaxy presents a long-term scaling solution for Solana, which addresses real network inefficiencies while integrating staking rewards. Skyren DAO focuses on passive income generation, automated airdrops, and providing staking rewards on the Polygon chain. Dogecoin holders are diversifying their positions into the Solaxy and Skyren DeFi projects that offer ongoing rewards and governance participation. Investors secure SKYRN at $0.048 before the presale ends Skyren DAO’s Phase 5 presale is closing soon and it offers one of the most attractive entry points in DeFi. SKYRN investors who secure their tokens now will gain exclusive access to staking pools and premium airdrops before the token launches on exchanges. How to Buy SKYRN Before the Presale Ends Go to Skyren.io and access the presale page. Connect a Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Select a preferred cryptocurrency for payment. Confirm the transaction and receive SKYRN instantly. Stake or hold for long-term rewards. Investors who enter before the presale ends will secure the best positioning before SKYRN reaches public trading. Final Thoughts: Dogecoin’s Community Expands Into DeFi Dogecoin remains a symbol of community-driven crypto success, but many investors are now focusing on structured DeFi opportunities. Solaxy is solving Solana’s issues, making it a critical piece of blockchain infrastructure, while Skyren DAO is building an ecosystem where passive income is automated and effortless. With SKYRN’s presale ending soon, Dogecoin holders looking for long-term returns are securing their positions before the market catches on. The next evolution in DeFi investing is here. DOGE, Solaxy, and Skyren DAO are leading the charge — secure your position before it’s too late.

Although that phrase might sound somewhat shady, it’s actually a positive development that embodies what crypto initially stood for: freedom. These types of casinos allow people to bet using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or some of the alt coin alternatives in a way that doesn’t require them to hand over any personal information. In some cases, not even a name. But it’s not all upside in the eyes of the more traditionally minded. To them, although these anonymous sites provide some benefits such as privacy and indeed freedom, with the abandonment of the regulation of conventional gambling outfits, they also come with certain risks. The Appeal of Anonymous Crypto Casinos One of the main attractions of anonymous crypto casinos is the privacy, but also the flexibility they offer. Traditional online casinos require players to provide personal information and undergo verification processes. In contrast, many more libertarian-minded crypto casinos allow users to gamble without revealing their identity or which country they live, enabling a higher degree of anonymity. Secondly, and purely from a playing perspective, it’s also significantly quicker to register. Casino players really enjoy signing up fast, so that they can jump on the games they like without waiting around for any regulatory checks. This is especially true with players that opt for crypto. The lack of Know Your Customer (KYC) checks is a significant plus point and similarly, withdrawals are faster processed when there are no wait times for identity documentation to be verified. Additionally, crypto transactions often bypass traditional financial institutions, resulting in faster deposits and withdrawals with lower fees.For many players, these kinds of benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks that may arise from the lack of regulatory oversight. Lack of Regulation: A Double-Edged Sword Many crypto casinos do not have a centralized controlling body in the same manner as the brick and mortar land-based casinos or their traditional online counterparts. These sites are often licensed by highly regarded and trusted bodies such as the reputable EU-focused Malta Gaming Authority ( MGA ), the strategic gaming approach used in Canada or indeed the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). It’s certainly true that there are many crypto casinos that are licensed, however, it’s almost always by some of the less strict authorities (Curacao and Anjouan as two prominent examples). However, plenty of them – specifically those with the anonymous tag – do not have a proper license at all. This can unfortunately mean that players can become victims of unfair practices, or find themselves in a hopeless situation trying to get their money out from casinos acting unlawfully. However, as previously explored, the lack of regulation can also be appealing. Players are not bound by geographic or betting restrictions that licensed casinos impose, making it easier to gamble freely, especially in countries where gambling is restricted or illegal. On top of that, some game providers place geographic restrictions on their content – similar to streaming services – and anonymous casinos often allow VPN usage to help players navigate around this. Anonymity as an Enabler? The ability of anonymous crypto casinos to worsen gambling habits is a significant worry for some. On the more traditional casinos discussed previously, where fiat is the more common currency form, there are self-exclusion features often present. In addition, there is regulatory intervention where needed and even the often debated NHS are meant to assist any players who might have a problem with gambling. There are also tools suggested by Gamble Aware that help players stop gambling by self-restricting access from sites for some time by choice. The situation puts compulsive gamblers at even greater risk when they lack the safety nets available on most traditional sites. It’s unfortunate that a large number of anonymous cryptocurrency gambling platforms ignore this and leave players with no way of controlling their betting habits. On top of this, the use of crypto transactions in these games may enhance players’ ability to keep their gaming behavior secret as concerned friends and relatives don’t have any means for monitoring it. Freedom vs. Safety The freedom to gamble anonymously is a significant draw, allowing players to avoid the limitations imposed by regulatory bodies. For some, this freedom is empowering, providing greater control over their gambling experience. However, this freedom comes with responsibility. The lack of consumer protections and transparency can lead to increased exposure to unfair practices, fraud, and financial loss. Additionally, without the safety nets offered by regulated platforms, players may find it harder to avoid gambling addiction. This, it would seem, comes down to the eternal debate between freedom and safety that dominates various spheres of politics from how to school children to fears over an overly watchful ‘nanny state.’ Summary As much as they have their advantages like being very confidential, independent and having no or few rules, anonymous crypto casinos still pose some challenges. Since there’s a lack of regulatory oversight, players are not protected like they are on traditional fiat casino sites and aren’t exposed to self-exclusion tools. This, in the worst cases, means they become more likely to develop problem gambling. Although anonymous crypto casino sites give freedom of choice, it’s always important to properly consider these sites and treat such sites with a little bit of extra caution – particularly for newcomers to the scene. It's important for all individuals who want to participate in online gambling using cryptocurrencies to maintain a balance between the temptation of remaining unknown and the necessity for responsible gambling.

This has caused some EL clients to have issues including transactions in blocks. ” - reported EF protocol support manager Tim Beiko. The reason was the ”oddities” of the said contract, which issued two events (transfer + escrow) rather than one. As a result, some EL-clients ”choked” and stopped enabling transactions. It took six hours to fix the bug. The activation of Pectra in Sepolia followed similar actions in Holesky on 24 February, which at some point led to a failure with slot finalisation ”due to a configuration issue on three major clients”. Specialists also had to issue a software update. Despite the bugs discovered, the team did not postpone the rollout of the update to Sepolia to a later date. Pectra is formed from the names of two previously planned hardforks Prague (for the execution level) and Electra (for the consensus level). The EIPs include improvements in the context of account abstraction , make significant changes to validators, and aim to improve overall network performance. Earlier, the security team opened a bounty programme to stress-test the hardfork until March 24 with a prize pool of $2 million.

This move is part of a global trend where central banks are loosening financial policies to support economic growth. In the U.S., traders expect at least three interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2025, while Germany and China are relying on government spending to keep their economies stable. We cut our key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points. We are doing this because inflation is on track to settle at around our 2% target, and the economy is facing headwinds. Read today’s monetary policy decisions https://t.co/rbgOSXWVRF pic.twitter.com/cHr9hMD42H — European Central Bank (@ecb) March 6, 2025 As per the press release , the ECB has lowered its key interest rates by 0.25 basis points, bringing the deposit facility rate to 2.50%, the main refinancing rate to 2.65%, and the marginal lending rate to 2.90%, effective March 12, 2025. What This Means for Markets Lower interest rates generally lead to increased money flow, which can boost stock markets and riskier assets like cryptocurrencies . Analysts suggest this easing cycle could push crypto prices higher, despite ongoing concerns about slowing economic growth. However, not everyone sees this as entirely positive. Inflation in Europe is still above the ECB’s target of 2%, and aggressive rate cuts could create problems in the long run. ECB coming up! -25bp rate cut expected Economic projections expected to be shaved Tariffs are a BIG concern…but activity hasn't been that bad. Germany's BIG stimulus package could make them less pessimistic Will the rate cut be enough to halt the rally in EURO? pic.twitter.com/bJhsLp7A1b — Kathy Lien (@kathylienfx) March 6, 2025 Bond Markets in Chaos The bond market is already reacting. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield has surged to 2.8%, its highest in more than a decade. This has narrowed the gap between German and U.S. bond yields, which in turn is putting downward pressure on the U.S. dollar. The situation is similar to what happened during Donald Trump’s first term when global financial shifts influenced currency values. Meanwhile, the U.K. is also seeing higher bond yields, now surpassing those of the U.S. Over in Japan, the country’s 10-year bond yield has hit 1.5%, the highest level in 17 years. The Bank of Japan, which recently raised interest rates after years of keeping them low, is now struggling to control inflation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Dubai’s Banking Giant Emirates NBD Ushers in a New Era with Crypto Trading on Liv X , Uncertain Road Ahead While the ECB’s rate cut may bring short-term relief, the overall financial situation remains unstable.

Although crypto benefits from easier financial conditions, unexpected market shifts could still trigger uncertainty.

One of the main drivers of the years-long rally has been expectations of lower interest rates. In… pic.twitter.com/ocpwxQmrJy — Max Wienke (@maxwi_etoro) March 4, 2025 Max Wienke explains that while the ECB is expected to cut interest rates in March, the future remains uncertain. Inflation in the Eurozone has dropped slightly to 2.4%, supporting further cuts, but factors like Trump’s unpredictable trade policies and the Ukraine war create complications. Divisions within the ECB are growing, making it harder to predict the pace of future cuts. A key concern is that aggressive easing could fuel inflation, while slow cuts might hurt growth. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, a new Web3 mobile provider, Coldware (COLD) , is rapidly gaining attention. Institutional investors are beginning to recognize the unique potential of Coldware (COLD) , as it positions itself alongside established tokens like Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) in the Web3 space. Coldware (COLD): A New Frontier for Institutional Investment While Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) remain prominent players, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a favorite for Web3 investors. The IoT-based blockchain platform is merging decentralized finance (DeFi) with Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, creating a highly scalable and secure platform for the next generation of blockchain applications. Unlike traditional blockchain solutions that focus purely on financial transactions, Coldware (COLD) is designed to integrate with IoT devices, making it highly adaptable for a variety of industries, including supply chain management, smart cities, and digital infrastructure. The unique capabilities of Coldware (COLD) make it an attractive option for institutional investors looking to diversify their portfolios into the Web3 and IoT sectors. The growing Coldware (COLD) led to an increasing amount of institutional support. With its innovative approach to DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), Coldware (COLD) offers a practical solution that merges the IoT space with blockchain technology, paving the way for future developments in Web3. XRP Faces Volatility and Technical Challenges Ripple (XRP) has long been a favorite among crypto investors, thanks to its focus on fast and affordable cross-border payments. However, the token is currently facing some technical challenges. A bearish divergence has emerged on the weekly chart, signaling potential downward momentum. According to chart expert Bluntz, XRP is at risk of a sharp decline, possibly falling to $1.00 by the end of March 2025. While XRP has been resilient, recent technical patterns suggest a potential trend reversal, especially with a head-and-shoulders pattern indicating that the coin could experience significant bearish pressure. Despite the market's initial excitement following Ripple's inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserves, uncertainty around its price trajectory persists. As XRP faces downward pressure, some institutional investors are shifting their focus toward other projects, such as Hedera (HBAR) and Coldware (COLD) , both of which offer significant potential for growth and innovation in the Web3 space. Hedera's Scalability and Governance Model Hedera (HBAR) continues to be one of the most scalable blockchain platforms, with its unique governance modelthat sets it apart from other blockchain projects. Hedera’s consensus algorithm allows it to handle enterprise-level applications, while its governance council, which includes prominent global organizations like Google, IBM, and Boeing, ensures a high level of reliability and trust for institutional investors. **Hedera’s recent partnership with Swift, a leader in cross-border payments, has further solidified its reputation in the industry. The increased institutional interest in HBAR, alongside the rise of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, has positioned Hedera to become a key player in Web3 and enterprise adoption. As HBAR approaches new resistance levels and technical indicators suggest further upward movement, many are optimistic about its future. With its focus on scalability, security, and real-world use cases, HBAR remains a top contender for institutional investors looking to back a sustainable blockchain solution. Conclusion: Why Institutional Investors Are Shifting to Coldware (COLD) While Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) continue to be strong contenders in the cryptocurrency space, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a top-tier alternative. Institutional investors are increasingly recognizing the real-world applications of Coldware, especially in the IoT and DeFi sectors. With its focus on scalability, security, and cutting-edge technology, Coldware is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for Web3 solutions. As more institutional investors back Coldware (COLD) , it could become the leading Web3 mobile provider, challenging the likes of Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR).

According to his recent post, XRP has broken the 4-hour resistance level, a key sign that it could be gearing up for a strong rally. He also pointed out that XRP must break above $3.3999 for further gains. XRP’s Broke 4-hour Resistance Ripple native token XRP, has been moving up and down in price recently. However, technical signals now show that it might be ready for a big upward move soon. According to Dark Defender, XRP has made a key move by breaking the 4-hour resistance, signaling the start of a strong uptrend. Hi all, $XRP broke the 4-hour resistance. 3.3999 must be broken, and the RSI has the Golden Cross, which is Bullish. Thus, XRP will soon be ready to proceed to an all-time high. Supports: $2.22, Resistances: $3.3999, $5.85 Enjoy! pic.twitter.com/1BFS4B6TqP — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) March 6, 2025 Therefore Defender analysis suggests that the XRP needs to maintain the key levels at $2.22. Thus the next major hurdle is the $3.30 resistance level, which XRP must surpass to gain further momentum. If it clears this barrier, XRP could see a surge toward $5.85 , a level that has been identified as a major resistance zone. Additionally, the RSI ( Relative Strength Index ) has formed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that suggests strong upward momentum. This pattern indicates that buyers are gaining control, increasing the chances of a breakout. Market Activity Hinting Bearish Sign Even though XRP has a bullish chart, it is struggling to rise. One reason could be the recent exchange inflows. Data from Coinglass shows that investors have deposited nearly $13 million worth of XRP on exchanges, which may increase selling pressure and slow its growth. Also, the OI-Weighted Funding Rate dropped from 0.0103% on March 3 to -0.0022%, showing more selling. The ratio also fell below 1.0 to 0.9798, which could mean XRP might drop further if it keeps falling. XRP Price Momentum With a weekly gain of 17% XRP is trading $2.61 reflecting a gain of almost 5%.

The new feature, a ""mini app"" accessible via the World App wallet, will offer special features to holders of World Network's digital passport, which lets users scan their iris in exchange for an account that verifies their ""proof-of-personhood."" World Chat is the latest iteration of World's ongoing quest to help people discern bots from humans in the age of AI. ""By connecting to World ID, World Chat allows you to know when you’re chatting with a verified human,"" World developer Tools for Humanity said in a statement to CoinDesk. Those who haven’t peered into World's iris-scanning Orb will still have access to the new chat feature. The new messaging app takes design cues from Apple's iMessage, which uses blue chat bubbles for iPhone users and green bubbles for everyone else. ""Conversations with verified World ID holders feature a blue chat bubble as well as a unique World ID gem in the upper right corner,"" Tools for Humanity explained. ""Conversations with non-verified accounts feature a grey chat bubble and no such gem."" Mini Apps were launched back in October 2024, and there were more than 250 million Mini App opens in the first two months of 2025, according to Tools for Humanity. “The World App has grown so much over the past year, we've continuously heard requests for a DMs layer. And we think that for some actions like sending money, that is just way more natural and fun than going to a wallet, and sending a transaction,” Tiago Sada, the head of product at Tools for Humanity, told CoinDesk. “People have been asking for the chat product specifically.” World Chat will be available on the World App for Android and iPhone iOS users starting Thursday. In addition to World Chat, World and social protocol Friends With Benefits, are teaming up with Alchemy, Bain Crypto Capital, Blockchain Capital and Variant Fund to launch an incubator program called World Build. The program includes hackathons, building retreats, and a demo day and is meant to encourage developers to build ""Mini Apps.""

Bitwise’s allocation, the size of which was not disclosed, is leveraging a Maple bitcoin-backed lending product, and represents a significant milestone in the adoption of on-chain credit by institutional allocators, said Maple CEO Sid Powell. Maple’s BTC backed lending product is available to accredited investors in the U.S. As digital versions of real world assets become a normal component of traditional finance, firms are looking beyond things like tokenized Treasury Bills, particularly as interest rates have been dropping while DeFi yields are seeing a resurgence. Bitwise is a big believer in the future of asset management moving on-chain, Powell said, where products are transparent and firms can find opportunities that don’t exist in traditional finance. “In this case, the yield from lending against bitcoin is not a product that's already available anywhere else in traditional finance,” Powell said in an interview. “Maple packages this product in a way that's consumable by institutional asset managers.” The move required Bitwise to do some pretty serious due diligence and background work, Powell said. “It was about 12 months of discussions and work in the background between our teams to pull this together,” he said. “Bitwise is incredibly thorough and this process involved working with their operations team, their legal and compliance team, their risk team, as well as tax advisors.” As well as its high profile crypto ETFs, Bitwise has over $12 billion in client assets across separately managed accounts, private funds, hedge fund strategies, and staking.",Finance|Maple|Bitwise|DeFi,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-06 14:00:00

The platform will burn 20 million AX tokens, reducing supply to 9,999,999. AX stakers can earn tiered $AURUS rewards, with the highest tier offering 8 per staked AX. $AURUS will enhance staking, liquidity, and governance while integrating with DeFi. AURUS, a prominent Web 3 platform, is bracing for a major shake-up of its operations. The firm that specializes in the tokenization of gold and other precious metals has announced it will be migrating from its legacy AX token to a new standard $AURUS, by the end of March 2025. That transition will proceed through a token generation event (TGE) throughout the month. The platform explained that evolution through a statement on its website saying, “Built on the BASE network, $AURUS aligns with our goal to drive sustainable value and expand liquidity across our ecosystem” It further clarified that the $AURUS TGE will burn ⅔ of its AX token, reducing the digital asset’s supply by 20,000,000. The final burning event will trim AX’s current supply to 9,999,999 tokens, a figure it says represents the purity of gold. To achieve that, AURUS will burn 5,000,000 AX tokens weekly, increasing the asset’s scarcity and boosting its demand and, therefore, long-term value. Why burn now? “The $AX token burn was AURUS’s reward to its faithful community ahead of moving to $AURUS and upgrading the tokenomics,” AURUS said. The firm also shared its enthusiasm for the upcoming change. It added that it would combine $AURUS’s features to create a stable, growth-enhancing, and community-enriching environment. This would thus be looking to the token to provide incremental new utility, from stacking and liquidity provision to streamlined governance. Exclusive rewards for AX stakers AX holders will profit from the revenue the AURUS protocol generates, mainly from its tGOLD token, a gold-backed digital asset that exposes holders to the wider Web3 and DeFi sector. It is about to launch on BASE with an updated mechanism for collecting and paying out rewards in Eth. AX stakers can also qualify for the $AURUS token tiered rewards program that works as follows: Currently, over 3,960,000 $AX are staked, with the final stages of Tier 2 offering 8 $AURUS per $AX staked. Investors can still claim only 40,000 $AX in Tier 2 rewards paying out at this rate. Once this allocation is reached, the rewards will drop to Tier 3, offering 4 $AURUS per $AX. Get ready for the $AURUS launch With the $AURUS launch scheduled for April, NOW is the best time to stake and earn your rewards. You can do this by purchasing AX and staking it now on the AURUS dashboard . Powered by a team of passionate developers, AURUS is a platform that’s breaking new ground in the tokenization of commodities . It’s a comprehensive ecosystem combining the timeless value of real-world assets (RWAs) with the boundless possibilities of blockchain technology.

The uncertainty has left traders cautious, with many waiting for a strong signal of recovery before re-entering the market. Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, shared insights on X, revealing that Dogecoin may be gearing up for a rebound. According to his analysis, the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on a high time frame, suggesting that DOGE could be nearing a potential reversal. If bulls step in at current levels and capitalize on this setup, DOGE could see a strong recovery in the coming days. Is Dogecoin Preparing For A Recovery Rally? Dogecoin has been at its lowest since late 2024 as bullish sentiment fades, following a 60% decline from its multi-year high of $0.48. The correction has been brutal, with meme coins bleeding the most amid broader market weakness. DOGE now struggles to reclaim crucial liquidity levels, making it difficult to start a recovery rally. Market participants are closely watching for a decisive move, as analysts and investors remain on the sidelines, waiting for confirmation of either a break above crucial supply or a breakdown below current demand levels. Until a clear trend is established, uncertainty dominates DOGE’s price action. Despite the bearish outlook, Martinez’s insights suggest Dogecoin may be gearing up for a rebound. According to his analysis, the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the 4-day chart, which could indicate that selling exhaustion is near. The TD Sequential is a well-regarded technical analysis tool that helps traders identify trend exhaustion and potential price reversals. On higher time frames, this indicator has historically been very effective, meaning this could present a major buying opportunity if DOGE follows its typical pattern.

If buyers step in and confirm the TD Sequential’s buy signal, Dogecoin could see a strong recovery in the coming days. However, failure to reclaim key levels may lead to further downside pressure, delaying any meaningful rebound. DOGE Holding Crucial Demand Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.209 after a period of volatile price swings, briefly dipping below $0.20 before recovering above $0.22. The market remains uncertain, with bulls attempting to regain control after weeks of selling pressure. For DOGE to confirm a strong recovery, bulls must reclaim the $0.25 level and establish it as a solid support zone. This would open the door for a push above the 200-day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), key resistance levels that could trigger a breakout to higher price targets. If DOGE successfully clears these technical barriers, momentum could shift in favor of buyers, leading to a more sustained uptrend.

However, losing the $0.20 level again would be a bearish signal as it would indicate a lack of strong demand at current prices. If this scenario plays out, DOGE could drop further into lower demand levels around $0.14, a price zone that previously acted as a major accumulation area.

This recovery is happening as Donald Trump prepares to unveil the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve during the White House crypto summit. This article explores some of the best altcoins to buy now to turn $10K to $100K before March 31. 3 Altcoins to Buy Now as Bitcoin Hits $90k to Turn $10K to $100K Bitcoin price has two key potential catalysts. US bond yields are falling, hinting that the Fed will cut interest rates soon. BTC and other risky assets do well when the Fed embraces a dovish tone. Also, Donald Trump will host his crypto summit , where he is expected to unveil the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and discuss deregulation issues. Some of the best altcoins to buy now are Chainlink (LINK), Ondo (ONDO), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is one of the best crypto to buy now and see big gains. One of its latest catalyts is that Emirates NBD, a large Dubai bank, has launched crypto trading services. This is a big deal for Chainlink since it entered into a partnership with it in December. Chainlink is providing it with oracle services and is also a member of its Digital Asset Lab. Chainlink price may also do well as centralized exchange reserves dropped. CoinGlass data shows that balance reserves are 148 million, down from 168 million in November. That is a sign that many LINK holders are not selling the coin, which is a bullish sign. Chainlink Balances Ondo (ONDO) Ondo is another top altcoin to buy and turn $10K to $100K. It is a Made in USA coin that is part of Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial portfolio . Additionally, it has become a major player in the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, an industry that is expected to do well in the next few years. Ondo’s network is also seeing more demand from investors as the total value locked (TVL) has jumped to $1 billion for the first time. This is a sign that investors are interested in it. Ondo Total Value Locked Additionally, Ondo has formed both a falling wedge pattern and a cup and handle. These two are some of the most popular bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. The short-term Ondo forecast is $1.4792, up by 25% from the current level. It will then retest its all-time high at $2.14 and then continue soaring to $4.3, as shown below. Ondo Price chart Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Bitcoin Cash is one of the top altcoins to buy and convert $10K into $100K in March. The main case for BCH is that there is a probability that one or more financial companies will apply for a spot BCH ETF, which has high chances of approval. That’s because BCH is similar to Litecoin and Bitcoin, and is therefore, not seen as a security. Bitcoin Cash price has also formed a major bottom at $284, meaning that a rebound to the neckline point at $640 is possible. That rally would imply a 61% surge from the current level. Summary Altcoin prices will likely do well if Bitcoin sustains its rally above $90,000 and moves above $100,000. Such a move would raise odds of it moving above its all-time high, which will push more altcoins higher.

41236671,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137455,1741269936,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Russia Rejects Crypto for National Welfare Fund Amid Volatility Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/russia-crypto-welfare-fund/,"In a surprising move that underscores the ongoing debate around digital assets and national financial strategies, Russia has firmly stated its position on cryptocurrency inclusion within its sovereign wealth fund. Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev has publicly announced that there are no plans to incorporate cryptocurrencies into the National Welfare Fund (NWF). This decision, revealed through a report by Wu Blockchain on X, highlights Russia’s continued caution towards the volatile nature of the crypto market and its preference for traditional investment avenues. Let’s dive into the details of this significant announcement and explore what it means for the future of crypto regulation in Russia. Why Russia Crypto Regulation Excludes National Welfare Fund? The core reason behind Russia’s decision lies in the perceived cryptocurrency volatility risks . Vladimir Kolychev explicitly stated that the high volatility associated with cryptocurrencies makes them unsuitable for a strategic fund like the NWF. This fund, designed to support the pension system and finance major infrastructure projects, prioritizes stability and long-term value preservation. Cryptocurrencies, known for their dramatic price swings, do not align with these objectives. Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons cited for excluding crypto from the National Welfare Fund: Volatility Concerns: The primary concern is the unpredictable price fluctuations in the crypto market. Sudden drops could significantly erode the fund’s value, jeopardizing its primary goals. Lack of Stability: Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies are still considered a nascent and speculative asset class by many financial institutions and governments. The NWF aims for stable and predictable returns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. This uncertainty adds another layer of risk, making it less appealing for a national fund with a long-term horizon. Focus on Traditional Assets: The NWF’s current investment structure is geared towards more established asset classes, providing a sense of security and predictability that cryptocurrencies currently lack in the eyes of the Russian Ministry of Finance. National Welfare Fund Crypto: A Strategic Reserve? Interestingly, Kolychev mentioned that he is unaware of any discussions regarding the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve , similar to proposals once considered during the Trump administration in the United States. This comparison is noteworthy as it places Russia’s current stance in a global context. While some nations have explored or are exploring the potential of holding crypto as a strategic asset, Russia is clearly not on that path, at least for its National Welfare Fund. This raises a critical question: Is a strategic cryptocurrency reserve a viable concept for nations? Let’s consider the arguments for and against: Arguments for a Strategic Crypto Reserve Arguments against a Strategic Crypto Reserve Diversification: Crypto could offer diversification beyond traditional reserves like gold and fiat currencies. Technological Advancement: Embracing crypto could position a nation at the forefront of financial technology. Potential for High Returns: While volatile, crypto assets have the potential for significant long-term growth. Decentralization: Crypto’s decentralized nature could offer resilience against geopolitical risks and traditional financial system vulnerabilities. Extreme Volatility: As highlighted by Russia, volatility poses a significant risk to reserve value. Security Concerns: Crypto storage and security are complex, raising concerns about potential theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of consistent global regulation creates ambiguity and risk. Market Manipulation: The crypto market is susceptible to manipulation, which could destabilize reserves. Vladimir Kolychev Crypto Stance: A Consistent Approach? Vladimir Kolychev ‘s statements reflect a generally cautious and conservative approach from the Russian Ministry of Finance towards cryptocurrencies in the context of national financial instruments. While Russia has been exploring crypto regulation and even considering digital ruble initiatives, this latest announcement reinforces a clear separation between these exploratory efforts and the management of core national wealth funds. It indicates a strategic prioritization of stability and risk mitigation for the NWF over the potential benefits of crypto exposure. However, it is crucial to note that this decision pertains specifically to the National Welfare Fund. Russia’s broader stance on cryptocurrencies is more nuanced. The country is actively working on regulating the crypto space, with discussions around mining, taxation, and even the potential use of crypto for international settlements. Therefore, while crypto is deemed too risky for the NWF, it’s not being entirely dismissed within the Russian financial ecosystem. Navigating Crypto Investment Strategy Amidst Global Uncertainty Russia’s decision offers valuable insights for individual and institutional investors formulating their own crypto investment strategy . The emphasis on volatility and risk management, highlighted by Kolychev, is a crucial consideration for anyone venturing into the crypto market. Here are some actionable insights: Risk Assessment is Key: Understand your risk tolerance before investing in crypto. Recognize that significant price swings are inherent to this market. Diversification Matters: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Long-Term Perspective: Consider a long-term investment horizon. Crypto markets can be highly cyclical, and short-term volatility might be less concerning for long-term holders. Stay Informed on Regulation: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in your jurisdiction and globally. Regulations can significantly impact the crypto market. Due Diligence is Essential: Thoroughly research any crypto project or asset before investing. Understand the technology, team, and market dynamics. In conclusion, Russia’s decision to exclude cryptocurrencies from its National Welfare Fund underscores a pragmatic approach focused on minimizing risk and prioritizing stability for its sovereign wealth. While this may be seen as a setback for crypto adoption by some, it also serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties that still characterize the crypto market. For investors, this news reinforces the importance of cautious, informed, and risk-aware strategies when navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of digital assets.

Here Are Those Tokens,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trump-familys-crypto-investment-project-wlfi-invested-in-9-more-altcoins-here-are-those-tokens/,"The Trump family’s crypto investment project, WLFI, has allocated a total budget of $336 million to purchase nine digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), TRON (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), AAVE, Ethena (ENA), BlueMove (MOVE), Ondo (ONDO), and Sei (SEI). Trump Family's Crypto Fund WLFI Invests $336 Million in Nine Tokens However, if these assets were to be liquidated at current market prices, WLFI would face an unrealized loss of approximately $88 million, with Ethereum (ETH) taking the largest share of this decline at $67.35 million. Market Volatility Hits WLFI Portfolio The investments come amid heightened market volatility, with recent price swings affecting WLFI’s holdings. While the fund has not signaled any intention to sell, the losses highlight the risks of large-scale crypto investments. Closely watched by industry insiders, the WLFI marks a significant foray into digital assets by the Trump family, in line with Donald Trump’s increasing engagement with the crypto industry. Despite the current volatility losses, market analysts suggest that WLFI’s long-term strategy could still be profitable if the crypto markets recover. The project’s investment options reflect a mix of blue-chip cryptocurrencies like ETH and WBTC, as well as emerging tokens like ENA, MOVE, and ONDO, suggesting a diversified, high-risk approach. With Trump’s recent proposal for a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, the Trump family’s involvement in digital assets is garnering the attention of both investors and policymakers. *This is not investment advice.

Unlike previous bull markets, the focus has been very much on Bitcoin, seemingly with only the merest sniff of an altcoins season, which has so far failed to arrive. Is there still hope for prominent altcoins such as $TON, $RENDER, and $RUNE? A different bull market makes it difficult for alts to thrive The days when plenty of altcoins would go parabolic as Bitcoin took a pause may never be seen again. Literally thousands of percent in gains were made, in many cases, on just a dream and a promise. This all took place when crypto was still in its infancy, and the vast majority of investors were speculating on this new and innovative asset class. Fast forward to the bull market of 2024/2025, and investors are a lot more wary. Of course, there is still rampant speculation, but this has mostly been targeted at niches such as the Memecoins, where crazy gains have still been made. However, for most of the altcoins that were prominent in the last bull market, and some from the one previous to that, with few exceptions times have not been good. $TON, $RENDER, and $RUNE, are three altcoins that are still generally well thought of, given their technology and use cases. Can any of these three altcoins make it back to their respective highs? $TON back to launch price Source: TradingView $TON is still a relatively new cryptocurrency, having been launched late in 2022. Since that time, the price chopped sideways for more than a year, before firing to the upside in early 2023. The resulting run took $TON almost 300% higher to a price of $8.28. However, that huge run was cancelled out through the rest of 2024 and now into 2025. In fact, $TON even went down to touch the price where it was launched all the way back in December 2022. As things stand, it does look as though the bottom might have been reached, with a touch and ensuing bounce from the descending trendline. In addition, the RSI at the bottom of the chart registered the lowest low in the indicator, also since the launch. Therefore, there could well be some strong upside left in $TON if the bull market does continue through the major part of this year. That said, at this stage of the bull market, for $TON to be at these depths does not bode well. A bounce may be likely from here, but surpassing the all-time highs is probably a long shot. Still hope for $RENDER Source: TradingView As it stands, the $RENDER chart does not look particularly good either. The price broke underneath the $4.40 level, and over four consecutive weeks, this level has proved to be strong resistance. That said, the price has been gathering within a descending wedge, from which it recently broke out of. The question now is whether this will be yet another rejection from the horizontal resistance, or whether the price is just confirming the breakout? In favour of the breakout, the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing that the indicators have bottomed. A cross up of these indicators, allied with a breakout of the wedge and the horizontal resistance, should take the price back to at least $6.68. A disastrous chart for $RUNE Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $RUNE is nothing short of disastrous. Down 94% from the top in the midst of a bull market does not inspire much hope. As can be seen above, a series of lower highs and lower lows are continuing to take place. On top of this, the current price action is in the shape of a bear flag. Absolute bottom support is just below this. Unless this breaks upward, and the Stochastic RSI also crosses up, it is hard to see where the upside comes for $RUNE.
