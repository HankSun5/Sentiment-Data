Binance Has Just Received A Massive Litecoin Inflow According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large move has been spotted on the Litecoin network during the last 24 hours. The transfer in question involved the shifting of 500,000 LTC across the network. At the time that the chain executed the transaction, this stack was worth around $51.3 million. Given the large scale associated with the move, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for it. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop: $75,500? Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level Whales are the largest of investors on the network, who can carry some degree of influence in the market due to their ability to make large transactions like this latest one. As such, the behavior of these humongous holders can often be worth keeping an eye on, as even if it may not always end up impacting the LTC price, it can still tell us about what the sentiment is like among this important cohort. Generally, though, it can be hard to say for certain what the whales are doing from their transaction activity alone, considering the anonymous nature of the blockchain. Nonetheless, sometimes, one of the wallets involved in the transaction can be connected to a central entity, which can provide room for speculation. The latest Litecoin move is fortunately of this type. Here are the details of the addresses involved in the transfer: As is visible above, the whale made the Litecoin transaction from a few unknown wallets. Such addresses are those that aren’t known to be affiliated with any centralized platform, so they can be assumed to be personal, self-custodial wallets of the investor. The destination of the transaction was a wallet attached to Binance, an exchange. Moves of this type, where coins go from personal addresses to the custody of an exchange, are known as exchange inflows.

As such, exchange inflows can sometimes have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. It’s unknown, though, whether the whale truly intended to sell with the latest exchange inflow or not. In the scenario that the investor did plan for it, then it could spell trouble for Litecoin, considering the scale of the move and the fact that its price has already registered a considerable drawdown during the past week. LTC Price Litecoin has recently plummeted alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency sector, which has brought its price down to $104.

Amid this, Dogecoin (DOGE), the world’s largest and most popular meme coin, is catching the attention of crypto analysts and experts. Experts’ Bullish Views on DOGE Meme Coin Recently, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) with a bold prediction. The expert expressed a bullish outlook, noting that DOGE has maintained its position within an ascending parallel channel. Based on historical price momentum, if the meme coin holds above the $0.16 level, there is still hope that it could reach $2.74 or even $6.24 in the coming days. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1897396450528809329 Current Price Momentum Today, March 6, 2025, the overall crypto market sentiment appears bullish, with major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experiencing impressive gains of 3.25%, 2.80%, and 2.15%, respectively. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action and Upcoming Levels Amid this bullish momentum, DOGE has gained 3.29% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.204. However, despite the ongoing price recovery, the meme coin’s trading volume has dropped by 45%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Source: Trading View Besides all this, Coinpedia’s technical analysis suggests that DOGE appears bullish but is currently facing modest resistance near the $0.205 level. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the meme coin breaches this resistance and closes a daily candle above $0.21, it could soar by 18% to reach $0.245 in the coming days. Besides this bullish outlook, another factor supporting it is the current retest of a crucial support level. During the recent price drop, the meme coin found crucial support at $0.18 and is now moving upward. The daily chart shows that this support level has a history of triggering bullish price reversals.",Price Analysis|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 23:01:49

According to Robinhood, the ETH layer-2 Arbitrum ( ARB ) is now available to be bought, sold, and traded over the trading platform. google336x280] News of the addition sent ARB rallying from a price of $0.374 on March 4th to $0.421 a day later. It has since stabilized and is trading for $0.419 at time of writing, a 14.5% gain during the last 24 hours. ARB joins Robinhood’s suite of crypto products, which includes Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum, Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), popular memecoins such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Pepe ( PEPE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and dozens of others. Last month, it was Robinhood reported that it saw a staggering 8x increase in crypto trading revenue in Q4 of 2024, putting pressure on Coinbase, its competitor and the largest crypto exchange platform in the US. According to the Robinhood’s investment report, the company saw a 200% year-over-year increase in transaction-based revenues, most of which can be attributed to crypto. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its investigation into Robinhood without levying any enforcement actions against the firm. As stated by Dan Gallagher, the Robinhood’s chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, at the time, “We applaud the staff’s decision to close this investigation with no action. Let me be crystal clear – this investigation never should have been opened. Robinhood Crypto always has and will always respect federal securities laws and never allowed transactions in securities. As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed.

""Look at this mining. More and more people are turning to me. If it is profitable for us, let's do it. We have excess electricity. Let them make this cryptocurrency and so on,"" Lukashenko told Alexei Kushnarenko, the nation's new minister of energy, according to Belarusian media outlet Belta . The news comes as the U.S. government is studying the possibility of creating a national strategic crypto reserve that could include cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), ripple (XRP) and cardano (ADA). Lukashenko mentioned the White House's interest in crypto. ""You see the path the world is going. And especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep [a crypto] reserve,"" he said. ""Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves,"" Lukashenko said . Belarus wouldn't be the first nation to mine cryptocurrencies.

Remittix Dominates 2025 Best Crypto Presales,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/can-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-make-the-us-crypto-reserve-remittix-dominates-2025-best-crypto-presales,"The Dogecoin price took an instant 15% jump on Sunday following Trump's announcement a few hours earlier. This quick reaction has fueled reactions to a potential inclusion of Dogecoin in the federal crypto reserve. However, while this reaction was impressive, the Dogecoin price is not the only asset that responded positively to this announcement. So, is the Dogecoin surge simply FOMO from investors? Can Dogecoin and other meme assets like Shiba Inu join the US crypto reserve? There are hundreds of questions about the Trump announcements, but let's keep it to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu with this article. However, if you're looking for a top investment choice this year, the Remittix presale offers an option you can take advantage of. But first, let's talk about DOGE and SHIB in the crypto reserve. What Does The Dogecoin Price Brief Response Mean In The Long-Term Projection? Dogecoin remains one of the top choices when talking about the crypto meme coin market. The market cap continues to keep it at the top as the largest meme coin in the world with a cap of about $29B, standing more than a distant second, Shiba Inu. However, many factors have been acting against the Dogecoin price since the beginning of the year, with the sudden influx of new meme coins being a significant concern. This has caused a sudden shift of attention to newer meme coins with options to make a new favorite out of the hundreds of new meme coins that joined in January. The Dogecoin price downtrend in the last few weeks has caused panic, which has made many investors liquidate their positions. However, the recent surge, although brief, has fueled what looks like a return to optimism. While speculations abound about the possibility of Dogecoin joining the crypto reserve as a meme coin option, this is not immediate. The recent surge could only lead to further selling. Where Is Shiba Inu's Place In The Future Of Meme Coins? To briefly touch on Shiba Inu, its addition to the crypto reserve looks highly unlikely. This is because, unlike Dogecoin, which got most of its influence from the contribution of key figures like Elon Musk, Shiba Inu does not have such a strong backing. However, although the Shiba Inu coin is the number two meme coin in the world, recent additions like the Trump coin have posed a big risk to its influence. Hence, adding a second meme coin to the crypto reserve might not help the Shiba Inu coin. With the recent news of a 99% drop in shibarium trading activity, the sun might already be setting on Shiba Inu's dominance. Here Is Why Remittix Could Be The Primary Talk In Crypto This Year Undeniably, the crypto market is already making its way into mainstream finance. Countries such as El Salvador, Japan, and the US are already taking a strong position with cryptocurrency, and it is only a matter of time before it becomes a global currency. However, solutions around its payment integration and remittance are still in their early phases. The Remittix approach to crypto payment allows users to freely send money to different corners of the world, which is delivered directly into the receiver's account. This solution takes the best parts of the traditional banking system, creating ease with FIAT, and mixes them with the decentralization and security of the blockchain. The word in town is that Remittix is the future of crypto payment, as it delivers payment faster and at a lower fee. The ongoing Remittix token presale has become the center of all discussions this year, with over 5x in returns over the last few weeks. But there is more to come with this new token , as experts believe the launch could even bring more growth of over 50x this year, breaking all presale records. Now is a good time to take advantage of this new token, which is still in an ongoing presale round. Check the links below for information on how to buy.

Spotlight on Chainlink (LINK) and Litecoin (LTC) as potential risers. This article dives into insights from experts. Are these coins set for a bullish trend? Readers will discover whether these digital assets are primed for significant growth and what factors could drive their success. Chainlink's Price Journey: Short-Term Dips and Long-Term Growth Chainlink saw a sharp decline of 26.89% over the last month, marking recent market volatility. Over the past six months, however, it surged 49.04%, showing strong long-term growth. The performance changes signal fluctuating investor sentiment and shifting market dynamics. Price trends have adjusted significantly over different durations. Currently, Chainlink trades between 10.20 and 22.70 dollars. Resistance appears near 30.59 dollars and higher at 43.10 dollars, while support holds around 5.58 dollars. Market signals hint at a slight bearish tilt with momentum indicators below neutral. Traders can explore buying opportunities near support levels or await a breakout above resistance for short-term plays. Litecoin Market Pulse: Short-term Dip Amid Strong Long-Term Rally Last month saw Litecoin fall by nearly 6%, alongside a weekly drop exceeding 10%. Despite this short-term weakness, the coin's performance over the past six months reveals a remarkable 55% gain, highlighting a strong long-term recovery. This contrast between immediate declines and extended resilience suggests that the overall upward trend remains intact, even as recent fluctuations create challenges for short-term traders. Currently, Litecoin trades between $92.68 and $151.78, with key resistance at $175.54 and a higher barrier at $234.65. The nearest support stands at $57.33. Bears currently dominate the market with negative momentum and oscillator readings. However, the RSI at 38.20 indicates a possibility for a bounce. Traders may want to monitor these levels for potential signs of a reversal or further breakdown. Conclusion Experts believe that LINK and LTC show potential for growth this month. Both coins have unique features that make them attractive to investors. LINK benefits from its role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data. LTC offers faster transaction times and lower fees. Market conditions and investor interest will play crucial roles in their performance. Watching key indicators can provide insights into their future movements. High trading volumes and positive market sentiments could drive prices up. Overall, LINK and LTC may experience significant activity and potential price increases this month. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg , this omission indicates that crypto is not a personal priority for Trump. “If it was a personal priority, then it would have been in the speech,” Seiberg wrote in a note on Wednesday. Trump sidelines crypto in speech, signaling political strategy or low priority The exclusion particularly stood out since Trump had referenced crypto in prior speeches and on social media just days before the Congress address, according to Seiberg. He views the exclusion as “more substantive” than Trump’s silence on other topics like housing and banking, given that the president does have a crypto strategy. Seiberg highlighted a political rationale for Trump’s omission of crypto in the speech, noting that congressional Republicans seek Democratic support for stablecoin legislation in the coming months. Trump’s involvement could complicate that effort. However, he also proposed a more nuanced reason — Trump does not view crypto as a central issue in his broader political agenda. “Trump talks up crypto when he is before crypto investors. Yet we continue to believe this is not a personal priority,” Seiberg said. Generally, Trump’s speech was “long on showmanship and short on substance for even a Donald Trump address,” according to Seiberg. “As many commentators noted last night, the address more resembled a campaign rally speech than a State of the Union speech.” The White House is set to hold its first Crypto Summit on Friday, led by Trump’s crypto czar, David Sacks. Industry leaders such as Michael Saylor and Brian Armstrong are expected to attend, with reports suggesting the event may reveal details about a U.S. crypto reserve. Crypto prices rally after Trump backs five coins for ‘Crypto reserve The president’s address, spanning a record 99 minutes, served as a defiant sales pitch for the policies Trump championed during his campaign and doubled down on in his first weeks back in office. He vowed to continue enacting sweeping changes to rescue the nation from what he described as his predecessor’s destruction and missteps. Throughout the speech, he rarely addressed the American people directly, who are grappling with recent upheavals, while repeatedly taking jabs at the Democratic lawmakers seated before him. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the Democratic response after Trump’s speech, said, “America wants change, but there’s a responsible way to make change and a reckless way, and we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy.” Though Trump did not mention cryptocurrency in his Congressional speech on Tuesday night, he recently revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he says he’d like to be included in a new strategic reserve to make the US “the Crypto Capital of the World. “ The market prices of the five coins he named – Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano – swiftly jumped after the announcement. During Trump’s presidential campaign, he aggressively courted the crypto community. The previous US president, Joe Biden, had overseen a crypto crackdown due to fraud and money laundering concerns.

Speaking in parliament on the 4th of March, she noted that the regulation of cryptocurrency is complicated due to its anonymous features and is advantageous to criminals. “Our advice to the public is to stay away from cryptocurrencies. The risk of getting burned is high, and if you become a victim of a scam, the chances of getting any of your money back are slim,” said Sun Xueling. Singaporeans suffered 1.1 billion yuan losses from scams last year, 70% more than in the same period last year. Such frauds included those involving cryptocurrency and contributed to a quarter of the losses incurred. With the increased use of cryptocurrencies, criminals are now using it to compel victims to withdraw their money into digital money so that it can hardly be traced. Cybercriminals and phishing attacks have also led to the loss of money from users’ digital wallets. Though the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates local crypto operations under the Payment Services Act, most exchanges and wallets are outside its jurisdiction. Sun remarked that even professional investors have fallen to the tricks of these fraudsters. Calls for tougher fraud penalties The question as to whether penalties for fraud should be more severe was also discussed. Jurong GRC MP Dr Tan Yew Meng opined that Singapore has overly lenient laws at present. While moneylenders who handle $10,000 worth of illicit money face caning, fraudsters who steal much larger sums can go scot-free. He even advocated for compulsory caning in cases where the fraud offence is considered severe. His statements demonstrate a rising concern that regulators have voiced in recent years about the rising number of crypto scams. Sun reported that at present, the government is examining the legislative measures against fraud and increasing some of the offences that can attract caning. She mentioned that more than 80% of the victims of the scam willingly transferred the money to the fraudster through impersonation, pretence of authority or fake promises of financial gains. To reduce this threat, the Singapore government has recently passed the Anti-Fraud Protection Bill. The law, however, allows authorities to block the assets of such victims in case they do not heed the threats. It is anticipated that this should be implemented this year. However, to date, there has not been a policy amendment with regard to some of these concerns. But it should be noted that according to local media reports, new regulations might be introduced soon. However, despite the fraud cases, cryptocurrency use is rising in Singapore. Singapore’s central bank doubled the number of licenses in the market in 2024 to improve stability.

Qubetics ($TICS) aims to do just that, offering solutions to real-world problems that previous platforms have struggled to address. Its innovative features and practical applications position it as a strong contender for those seeking the best crypto for quick profit.​ Meanwhile, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) has introduced the ASI-1 Mini, a Web3-native large language model designed to support complex agentic workflows. This development opens new avenues for the Web3 community to invest in, train, and own advanced AI models. In this article, we will delve into how Qubetics ($TICS) addresses real-life challenges unmet by its predecessors, positioning itself to meet the future demands of blockchain and digital finance.​ Qubetics: Pioneering Practical Blockchain Solutions Qubetics is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to tackle real-world issues through its comprehensive ecosystem. One of its standout features is the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which simplifies blockchain development for businesses, professionals, and individuals. This user-friendly platform enables seamless creation of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and other blockchain-based solutions.​ The QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for those looking to develop blockchain solutions without extensive coding knowledge. It offers a drag-and-drop interface, pre-built templates, and real-time testing environments, making blockchain development accessible to a broader audience. For instance, a small business can create a supply chain management system using QubeQode, ensuring transparency and efficiency without the need for a dedicated development team. Similarly, artists can tokenize their work, creating unique digital assets and opening new revenue streams. These practical applications demonstrate how Qubetics is poised to become the best crypto for quick profit.​ Qubetics is in its 24th crypto presale stage, having raised over $14.6 million from more than 22,200 token holders, with over 495 Million $TICS tokens sold. The current price per $TICS token is $0.0976, with projections suggesting a potential increase to $0.25 by the end of the presale. This growth trajectory indicates a significant return on investment for early participants, further solidifying Qubetics’ position as a top choice for those seeking quick profits in the crypto market. ​ If you invest $1,000 in $TICS at its current price of $0.0976 per token, you would receive approximately 10,245 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, your investment will grow to $2,561, yielding a 156% ROI. Should the price hit $1 after the presale, your holdings would be worth $10,240, reflecting a 924% ROI. If $TICS surges to $5, your investment would skyrocket to $51,200, achieving a 5,019% ROI. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance: Merging AI and Blockchain The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) represents a collaboration between leading blockchain-AI projects: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. This alliance aims to advance decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and, ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The recent introduction of the ASI-1 Mini, a Web3-native large language model, marks a significant milestone in this endeavor.​ The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token has faced a challenging market environment, with reports labeling it among the worst-performing altcoins of the year. Previously known as Fetch.ai (FET), ASI had shown an 8% gain as of mid-February, trading at $0.755, but recent trends indicate a decline. On the technology front, the introduction of ASI-1 Mini has provided Web3 users with new opportunities to invest in and train advanced AI models. Meanwhile, industry leaders such as Sam Altman continue to explore the potential of artificial superintelligence to surpass human capabilities across multiple domains, further shaping discussions around its future. SUI: Navigating Market Volatility SUI has recently experienced significant market fluctuations. Over the past 24 hours, its price plummeted by approximately 21%, reaching around $2.34. This sharp decline aligns with a broader market downturn, with the CoinDesk 20 Index down by 3.9%. Additionally, SUI has seen outflows exceeding $600 million from its ecosystem, contributing to a 17% price drop. Technical analyses suggest potential further declines, possibly towards the $1 mark, if key support levels fail.​ SUI unlocked approximately 40.63 million tokens, accounting for 1.28% of its current circulation and valued at around $117 million. Such token unlocks can increase supply and exert downward pressure on prices. Despite recent challenges, some analysts remain optimistic. Predictions suggest that SUI could reach a $10 billion market cap, driven by institutional adoption and ecosystem expansion. However, these forecasts are speculative and subject to market conditions. Participants are advised to exercise caution, monitor market trends, and consider both technical analyses and fundamental developments when evaluating SUI’s potential.​ Conclusion: Seizing Opportunities in Emerging Cryptos Qubetics stands out as a promising platform addressing real-world challenges with practical blockchain solutions. Its innovative features, such as the QubeQode IDE, make it accessible to a wide range of users, from businesses to individual creators. The ongoing presale and projected growth present a compelling opportunity for those seeking the best crypto for quick profit .

Speaking at an American Bar Association event in Miami today, SEC acting enforcement director Antonia Apps and CFTC enforcement director Brian Young noted that enforcement will remain a priority even amid broader policy changes. “You can expect to see some changes depending on priorities and different policies that we may pursue,” Apps said, “but we will move forward with the core enforcement agenda that we have always moved forward with.” The statements come at a time when both regulatory agencies are undergoing significant transformations under Republican leadership. Since late January, the SEC has been reviewing its cryptocurrency enforcement policies, while the CFTC has been restructuring its enforcement division. Related News: Analytics Company Shares 7 ""Most Negative"" Altcoins According to Funding Rates The comments were made at a government enforcement conference focused on white-collar crime, where Justice Department officials reportedly withdrew from speaking because of ongoing changes and turmoil within the Justice Department. Both Apps and Young voiced strong support for enforcement personnel, who are facing mass layoffs and budget cuts as the administration, along with special adviser Elon Musk, seeks to reshape the federal workforce. “In addition to doing a great job, the CFTC enforcement staff are genuinely good people,” Young said. “I think the taxpayers should be indebted to them for what they do for us every day.” Young also noted that the agency prioritizes cases that have a strong likelihood of returning funds to victims of fraud or market manipulation. One of the most notable policy changes came at the SEC, which has paused or dropped active litigation and investigations related to cryptocurrencies. When asked about the future of crypto enforcement, Apps reiterated that the agency will continue to pursue cases involving fraud and clear regulatory jurisdiction. “We're not walking away,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The ministry said the National Welfare Fund (NWF)’s level of liquid funds should be topped up to reach a level equivalent to 7-10% of Russia’s GDP before Moscow considers buying “riskier” assets like crypto. Russian Crypto Reserve: Could Moscow Start Buying BTC? Per the Russian media outlets Interfax and RBC , the claims came from the Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev, who claimed that the ministry “is not currently considering” buying or holding crypto in the NWF “due to its high volatility.” Vladimir Kolychev, the Russian Deputy Finance Minister. (Source: Katerina Vorontsova/YouTube/Screenshot) When questioned on the matter, Kolychev said that the ministry would “not” make changes in the structure of the NWF’s investments. He said that the fund would continue to focus exclusively on gold and Chinese yuan holdings. Media outlets say that 60% of the fund is made up of yuan, with the remaining 40% in gold reserves. Gold bars embossed with a stamp that reads “Russia.” (Source: Kapital Strany/YouTube/Screenshot) However, Kolychev said it would be “possible to consider riskier assets” when the NWF reaches Moscow’s 7%-10% target. “When we get there, we will be able to think about different assets, including crypto. However, for now, the volatility signs are not favorable.” Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev Kolychev added that Russia is still “far” from reaching its desired levels of reserves. And that is why Moscow will only countenance buying gold and yuan reserves for the time being. We Need Liquidity, Says Deputy Finance Chief The Deputy Finance Minister said the fund’s assets “must be liquid and not subject to sharp revaluations.” He added: “When we sell our reserves, the sales should not result in us receiving 50 kopeks for each ruble we invested, instead of a ruble for each ruble’s worth of our assets.” The comments come just months after Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told university students who asked him about creating a Russian crypto reserve that the Treasury needed to “earn less, but keep its powder dry.” Trump pivots to the war in Ukraine and his talks with Russia. Trump says he has gotten “strong signals” from Russia that Moscow is ready for peace. “Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” Trump asks. Latest updates: https://t.co/vDJlBJzZHe pic.twitter.com/kVlCxo25W9 — Bloomberg (@business) March 5, 2025 Central Bank’s Final Say Kolychev concluded by saying that he was not party to any “discussions about creating a cryptocurrency reserve in Russia” similar to Washington’s own strategic crypto reserve fund. He claimed that final decisions on such matters would be taken by the Russian Central Bank. As previously reported, the Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina is a known crypto-skeptic . Nabiullina has tried on multiple occasions to orchestrate a total, China-style ban on crypto in Russia.

A recent post by cryptocurrency researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) emphasized how this system was implemented to eliminate uncertainty about XRP’s future supply and prevent concerns over centralized control. The discussion, accompanied by a highlighted excerpt from Ripple’s 2017 announcement, has reignited conversations about how XRP’s escrow functions and its broader implications. “Ripple’s Escrow Safeguards XRP’s Price” Ripple’s escrow system was designed to eliminate uncertainty about XRP’s future supply. By locking up a significant portion of XRP, Ripple ensured the market wouldn’t be concerned about centralized control over its distribution. … pic.twitter.com/5fk9ZjQjkG — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) March 3, 2025 The Purpose of Ripple’s Escrow According to Ripple’s 2017 statement, the company locked 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow system, releasing a maximum of 1 billion XRP per month over 55 months. As Ripple stated, the purpose, was “to remove uncertainty around XRP’s future supply” and ensure that a large quantity would not enter the market at once, preventing drastic price fluctuations. This strategy was designed to establish predictability in XRP’s distribution and counter fears of market oversupply. XRP Allocation from Escrow SMQKE’s post reiterated that the primary use of released XRP is “to incentivize market makers for XRP-based currency exchanges and for sales to institutional investors—not retail.” This aligns with Ripple’s original announcement, which stated that XRP would facilitate liquidity by offering “tighter spreads between currency pairs” and would also be sold to institutional investors. Unused XRP at the end of each month is returned to escrow, extending the timeline for its eventual release. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The post directly counters claims that Ripple’s escrow is a means to dump XRP on retail investors. SMQKE argued that if Ripple were indiscriminately “dumping” XRP from escrow, its price would be significantly lower. The structured and controlled release mechanism prevents sudden supply shocks that could negatively impact XRP’s market performance. Speculation on XRP’s Role in Broader Economic Strategy An X user, Wolfemother, commented on the post, speculating on a potential future use case for Ripple’s escrowed XRP . They proposed that it could be utilized as part of a “government’s strategic crypto reserve,” suggesting that the total escrowed XRP—amounting to 37 billion—could reach a value of $1,000 per XRP, equating to $37 trillion, roughly aligning with the U.S. national debt. While speculative, such theories reflect ongoing discussions about the long-term implications of Ripple’s escrow model and whether XRP could help global financial structures. As discussions continue, the system remains a key component of XRP’s market structure, negating the claims of indiscriminate token sales while also fueling broader speculation about its role in the financial ecosystem.

As 2025 unfolds, selecting the right assets could make a significant difference in building a profitable portfolio. While established tokens maintain their dominance, newer projects are introducing compelling solutions that could shape the future of blockchain technology. This guide highlights some of the most promising cryptos for 2025. Each has been analyzed based on recent developments, current performance, and long-term growth potential. From decentralized e-commerce platforms to blockchain protocols advancing decentralization, these are the projects to keep an eye on. 1. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is revolutionizing online shopping by creating a direct marketplace between buyers and sellers using blockchain technology. By removing intermediaries, the platform reduces transaction costs and enhances user privacy. Its presale has gained significant attention, with the 3BAY token currently priced at $0.00524 in its 5th stage, raising over $1.54 million. Analysts anticipate a launch price of $0.1959, potentially offering early investors a 4,200% return. The roadmap for 2025 outlines several key milestones, including full decentralization by Q4 and the introduction of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to involve the community in decision-making. Plans to integrate PayPal and other payment systems are also in motion. With its blend of practical application and strong demand, Web3Bay presents an opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential in the crypto market. 2. Near Protocol: Advancing Blockchain Accessibility Near Protocol (NEAR) continues to innovate, becoming the first non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain to integrate with MetaMask. This connection, facilitated through the NEAR Snap feature, enables seamless account creation and transactions within MetaMask, making blockchain interactions more user-friendly. Currently trading at $3.29 after a slight 2.37% decline, Near Protocol remains focused on scalability and ease of use. With growing adoption in decentralized applications (dApps) and enhanced interoperability, NEAR has the potential to solidify its place among the most promising projects for 2025. 3. Pi Coin: A Community-Powered Ecosystem Pi Coin (PI) has gained attention for its mobile-first mining approach, allowing users to participate in blockchain activities through their smartphones. With a community of over 35 million, Pi Network has generated widespread discussion, particularly following recent speculation about a possible Binance listing. In a community vote on Binance Square, 86.2% of participants supported the listing of PI, although Binance has stated that this is not yet confirmed. Despite its strong user base, potential investors should be mindful of ongoing concerns regarding the project’s legitimacy. Chinese authorities have issued warnings about possible risks related to data privacy. Those considering Pi Coin should thoroughly research before making investment decisions. 4. Hyperliquid: Innovating Decentralized Trading Hyperliquid (HYPE) is gaining traction in decentralized finance (DeFi) with its perpetual trading platform. Recent upgrades include AI-driven trading tools and zero-slippage order execution, improving efficiency and user experience. Over the past month, HYPE has risen by 23%, fueled by increasing trading volumes and platform enhancements. To further strengthen its position, the Hyperliquid Foundation is addressing transparency concerns regarding validator operations. With advanced trading features and a focus on improving accessibility, Hyperliquid is well-positioned for continued growth in 2025. 5. Chainlink: Leading Cross-Chain Data Integration Chainlink (LINK) remains a key player in the blockchain ecosystem, offering critical services for connecting smart contracts with real-world data. Its oracles facilitate seamless data transfers, supporting numerous decentralized applications. Recent updates have focused on expanding staking options and increasing institutional adoption. Although LINK’s price has seen an 18% drop, now sitting at $16.43, its fundamental technology remains strong. With continued developments and integrations, Chainlink presents a viable option for those seeking stability and innovation in their crypto portfolio. Final Thoughts Choosing the right cryptocurrencies involves weighing potential growth against associated risks. Web3Bay offers a fresh approach to e-commerce, while Near Protocol’s technological improvements make blockchain interactions more accessible. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s trading advancements and Chainlink’s role in data connectivity highlight the broad range of opportunities available. Investors should stay informed and track emerging trends to make strategic decisions. Whether looking for high-growth opportunities or established stability, these projects represent some of the most promising options for 2025.

Plus, Insights on DOGE Price Rally & ADA Price Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/achievement-unlocked-inter-milan-boosts-blockdags-presale-to-200m-plus-insights-on-doge-price-rally-ada-price-surge/,"The crypto market is delivering a new kind of excitement, and traders are all in. The Dogecoin price rally is causing a stir on the charts, while the latest Cardano (ADA) price surge is fueling discussions about whether it will break through key resistance. Also, the buzz about ETF approvals and mainstream interest keeps expectations high for both currencies. BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves on social media, partly due to its collaboration with Inter Milan, which has proven to be a catalyst for its presale success. The initiative has amassed over $200 million, selling 18.7 billion coins. BlockDAG’s social media presence has swelled to about 226,000 followers, positioning it as today’s top bullish crypto. Dogecoin Price Rally Gains Momentum Amid ETF Speculation DOGE has reached $0.2793 as the Dogecoin price rally draws more eyes, with its trading volume up by 38.41% at $2.34 billion. Analysts predict that surpassing the 0.618 Fibonacci level might send Dogecoin to a possible high of $2.30. A significant driver of the Dogecoin price rally is the short squeeze that wiped out over 28 million DOGE from short positions, causing a sharp price increase. The SEC’s nod to Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF proposal also boosts the sentiment. Analysts suggest this might open doors for broader market participation, potentially stabilizing DOGE in the long run. Cardano (ADA) Price Surge Encounters Resistance at $0.98 The Cardano (ADA) price surge has injected optimism among ADA supporters, with analysts suggesting it could hit $1.35 if it overcomes existing barriers. Currently, ADA is priced around $0.7719, with a slight 3% dip over the past day but showing promise for a recovery. A strong upward Cardano (ADA) price surge could emerge if ADA can rise above $0.9837, seen by analysts as a crucial milestone. If this is achieved, ADA could potentially climb to $1.16 and further to $1.35. The growing interest from the market has seen ADA attract $4.4 million in the past month while Bitcoin and Ethereum faced significant withdrawals. The anticipation of a Cardano ETF continues to bolster ADA’s longer-term prospects. BlockDAG’s Partnership with Inter Milan Catalyzes Presale Success BlockDAG is swiftly gaining attention in the cryptocurrency sphere, greatly aided by its partnership with Inter Milan . This collaboration is not merely about brand visibility; it’s about introducing BlockDAG to millions of soccer enthusiasts, effectively narrowing the divide between cryptocurrency and popular culture. This increased visibility is enhancing BlockDAG’s credibility and accelerating its presale activities. BlockDAG’s success is evident in the numbers, with the presale amassing a staggering $200 million and distributing over 18.7 billion coins. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, early participants have reaped a 2,380% ROI—a commendable achievement for a project still in the presale stage. This partnership has also significantly expanded BlockDAG’s social media presence, with notable increases across platforms like Telegram (71.7K), X (108.1K), Discord (20.7K), and Instagram (25.4K). Analysts are optimistic that this increased exposure will hasten the growth of BlockDAG’s ecosystem and cement its future prospects. The combination of widespread visibility and robust community engagement distinguishes BlockDAG as it continues to grow its network. Some analysts even suggest that the presale might eventually exceed $600 million due to the soaring demand for BlockDAG. Both retail and more organized interest are on the rise, indicating that BlockDAG is more than just another coin; it’s becoming a significant movement. Final Say The cryptocurrency market is ripe with new possibilities, with Dogecoin’s price rally and the anticipation of an ETF driving sustained trader interest, while Cardano’s price surge and increased attention are fueling discussions on ADA’s potential to overcome significant resistance levels. Amidst this, BlockDAG is carving out a notable niche for itself with the help of its Inter Milan partnership, which is greatly advancing its crypto presale and bolstering its social media footprint. Having already secured over $200 million, BlockDAG is reinforcing its status as a top bullish crypto. The community is keenly watching their BDAG holdings appreciate as the project captures the attention of a growing audience.

41209217,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=687702,1741219246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41209217.jpeg,Trump advisers start mapping out a plan for a national crypto reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-advisers-start-mapping-out-a-plan-for-a-national-crypto-reserve/,"President Donald Trump’s administration has officially started executing plans for its federal crypto strategic reserve, and step one is figuring out exactly how much crypto the US government already owns, according to a report from the Journal. A month into a six-month planning phase, Trump’s interagency working group is reportedly doing a full audit of existing crypto holdings, which include assets seized from criminals. Trump first floated the idea of a government-backed crypto stockpile last summer during his campaign, and in January, he signed an executive order to begin laying the foundation. Bo Hines, executive director of the working group, confirmed the process was underway, saying , “The first thing we have to do is get an accounting of what the government has. We’ll provide more insight as that continues.” Trump is expected to give a speech about the initiative on Friday at a White House industry summit, where more details will probably come. White House team counts up government-owned crypto The Justice Department and US Marshals Service oversee billions of dollars in confiscated Bitcoin and other crypto assets, mostly taken from criminals. According to the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, $18 billion worth of Bitcoin is sitting in government-controlled wallets, though accounting issues have made it unclear how much is actually secured. As part of the new plan, officials are now tallying up these holdings to determine whether they will become part of the official crypto reserve. What’s still unclear is whether the administration will also buy new crypto for the reserve. If they do, Congress might need to approve large acquisitions. There’s also the question of who exactly will oversee the stockpile—whether the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, or a newly created agency. Right now, no federal entity is set up to manage a crypto reserve of this scale. Trump’s push for a government crypto reserve has divided analysts and investors alike. Supporters say it could legitimize digital assets and integrate them into the country’s financial system. Crypto advocates have poured millions into Trump’s campaign and inauguration in efforts to make the reserve a reality. But critics argue that crypto isn’t comparable to gold or oil, which are two assets commonly stockpiled by governments. Gene Hoffman, CEO of blockchain firm Chia Network, doesn’t think the US should be making these calls yet. “The United States government shouldn’t be making this call yet,” he said . Others warn that the extreme volatility of crypto could turn a government reserve into a financial disaster if prices crash. Timothy Massad, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, believes Trump’s plan could be more about paying back campaign supporters than actual financial strategy. “It concerns me that it is a payback for their support of Trump and the Republican Party,” Massad said. Meanwhile, Bitcoin momentarily surged 10% after Trump’s announcement, proving just how much influence he has over the market. Financial advisers in the UK and US are reporting a spike in clients asking about crypto investments. Why people are concerned about Trump’s crypto plans One of the biggest issues with a government-controlled crypto reserve is security. Crypto is a prime target for hackers, and federal agencies haven’t always been great at keeping track of what they already have. The US Marshals Service has struggled to manage seized crypto, and with $18 billion in Bitcoin alone, the potential for mismanagement is quite high. Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital warned that security needs to be a top priority. He recommended keeping assets stored in cold wallets with private keys only accessible under strict controls. “There will need to be some careful consideration about how the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are held and how they are held securely,” McCauley said. Cryptos are difficult to safeguard because they are targeted by sophisticated hackers, putting a premium on cybersecurity measures for crypto exchanges and custodians that hold assets. Bybit, one of the world’s biggest exchanges, recently saw the hacker group Lazarus stole over $1.4 billion in Ethereum from its cold wallets. “Criminals have stolen tokens worth $1.5 billion from the crypto exchange Bybit, prompting a rush of customers demanding their funds back,” Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said. He compared it to the final chaotic hours of FTX, where mass withdrawals led to a complete collapse. “Although Bybit claims to be stable, the developments evoke memories of the chaotic final hours of the now-defunct FTX exchange.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

More and more people are approaching me. If it’s profitable for us, let’s do it. We have excess electricity. Let them produce this cryptocurrency and so on,” Lukashenko told Alexei Kushnarenko, Belarus’s newly appointed energy minister, as reported by local media outlet Belta. Belarus considers crypto mining amid rising global interest in digital reserves This President of Belarus suggestion emerges as the U.S. government is studying the possibility of creating a national strategic crypto reserve that could include assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Lukashenko acknowledged the White House’s growing interest in digital assets, stating, “You see the direction the world is taking, especially the largest economy. They announced yesterday that they will maintain a crypto reserve.” “Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves,” Lukashenko said . Belarus wouldn’t be the first nation to mine digital assets. The Kingdom of Bhutan, with its abundance of hydropower, already has more than 100 megawatts (MW) of operational bitcoin mining infrastructure and is set to get another 500MW worth of power online. The country currently holds $950 million in Bitcoin, according to Arkham Intelligence. El Salvador on the other hand uses geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin, though in smaller quantities. Trump pushes crypto strategy forward with first-ever summit Even with the Trump administration’s promises and enthusiasm, the industry has been left disappointed by meme coin scandals and a lack of concrete government action—aside from the dismissal of a few SEC cases and the release of a somewhat ambiguous Executive Order on January 23. That disappointment, however, just got a temporary lift. Two days ago, the White House announced it would hold its first-ever crypto summit this Friday, chaired by White House A.I. & Crypto Czar David Sacks and overseen by Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reports that the roundtable, scheduled from 6:30 pm to 10:30 pm UTC, is expected to include more than 25 participants, including members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets. As of Wednesday morning, Terrett reported that 11 crypto executives and two White House representatives had confirmed their attendance. However, it seems Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson is not invited to the Summit on Friday, according to a White House source familiar with the guest list. In fact, neither Hoskinson nor any representatives for Cardano have been invited to meet with the president since the inauguration. Many in the community had also taken X posts from Hoskinson in February to mean he would attend a fundraising dinner for pro-crypto PAC MAGA Inc. this past Saturday. As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, excitement is building within the crypto community. This marks progress toward the Executive Order’s goals of bolstering U.S. leadership in digital assets and financial technology while safeguarding economic freedom. However, for a president who closely ties stock market performance to his success, the summit’s announcement alone likely fell short. That may explain why Trump took it a step further, unveiling the first five tokens set to be included in a future crypto reserve: Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, Ripple, and Solana. Trump’s social media posts offer little additional detail on the planned “reserve,” as he referred to it in his Sunday posts. However, the choice of the word “reserve” appears to signal a shift from the administration’s stance in January’s Executive Order. The term “reserve” suggests that the government will proactively purchase more assets. In contrast, the intention stated in January’s executive order to “evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile” would be more about holding onto the $19.1 billion in crypto, 97.9% of which is in Bitcoin, that it already has from seizures across dozens of tokens.

Describing this disparity as “value asymmetry,” the report points out that Solana’s DeFi sector is growing faster and generating more revenue than Ethereum’s, but its tokens remain relatively undervalued. “Solana DeFi valuation multiples are trading lower than their Ethereum counterparts on average despite their significantly higher growth profiles, highlighting a distinct valuation asymmetry,” the report said. Franklin Templeton conducted an analysis comparing five leading Ethereum-based DeFi projects (LDO, AAVE, ENA, MKR, and UNI) to five of Solana’s top-performing protocols (JTO, JUP, KMNO, MNDE, and RAY). The findings showed that Solana projects experienced a staggering 2,400% median growth in fees year-over-year and a median valuation multiple of 9x. In contrast, Ethereum projects saw a more modest growth of 150% and a multiple of 18x. Related News: Analytics Company Shares 7 ""Most Negative"" Altcoins According to Funding Rates This valuation disparity follows a period of rapid expansion for Solana. The network’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have witnessed a surge in trading activity, led primarily by memecoin investors. In January 2025, Solana’s DEXs recorded higher trading volumes than the entire Ethereum ecosystem combined. “DeFi may be entering an era of Solana Virtual Machine dominance, moving away from the historical reign of EVM-based DeFi,” the report said. However, Franklin Templeton clarified that this does not indicate Ethereum’s decline. Instead, the firm noted that the increased activity on Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solutions indicates the strategic evolution of the network. “The shift of activity to layer-2 blockchains is evidence that the Ethereum scaling approach is advancing incrementally,” the report said. Despite the current undervaluation of Solana-based DeFi assets, Franklin Templeton predicted that this disparity may not last forever. “As Solana continues to demonstrate its resilience as a decentralized computing platform, the market may soon price blue-chip, cornerstone Solana DeFi protocols in line with comparable Ethereum protocols,” the report concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Needless to say, the Pepe coin’s speculative mania might not be over despite a downturn of over 35% in the last 30 days. However, Rollblock’s presale is changing the GambleFi sector, raising over $10.8 million in a move that makes RBLK a compelling alternative to speculative meme coins. Analysts already forecast a 100x uptick on launch for RBLK. Pepe’s market performance and risks PEPE’s meme coin hype has persisted since its launch, as the coin surged from a market cap of about $517 million to above $11 billion. Those who bought into Pepe even as early as January 2024 have managed to accumulate a 10x gain. However, past performance is never a guarantee of future results in the world of meme coins. Pepe coin’s recent dips have sparked a wave of uncertainty among holders. Traders who once saw Pepe coin as an easy path to quick profits are starting to exit their positions.

Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, boldly claims a looming debt crisis and calls it a “potential heart attack.” In a statement, Dalio argued that once we reach a point in the cycle where one borrows more money to service debt and bond holders say that it’s risky, it becomes a “debt debt spiral.” Dalio compares the current debt crisis to a heart attack waiting to happen if authorities fail to provide interventions. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Won’t Stop At $150K’ This Year, Research Firm Chief Says Understanding The Current US Debt Issue Dalio’s insights on the current economic landscape and the country’s looming debt crisis come as the crypto market cap drops to $2.76 trillion in one day. During the market shakeoff this week, the overall crypto market cap dropped by 8%, with Ethereum and Bitcoin leading the losers with 11% and 8%, respectively. The US is currently facing a growing debt and excessive budget deficits. According to recent data, the country’s national debt is now $33.6 trillion, with a massive deficit of $1.7 trillion in 2023, equal to 5.8% of the total GDP. Researchers are also warning about the increasing cost of servicing the debt, hitting $879 billion in 2023, comparable to the size of the country’s budget for national defense. Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences. pic.twitter.com/MbBpHO76mN — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) February 6, 2018 Dalio Says Alternative Stores Of Value Can Help In an interview on the Odds Lots podcast, Dalio offered insights on how the general public responds to an economic crisis. He mentioned that in times of economic uncertainties, many investors are looking at alternative stores of value. Dalio asks: What’s an alternative to money with a stable supply? He mentioned the growing role of Bitcoin and digital assets as leverage against inflation. “Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences.” he added. Dalio’s insights followed US President Trump’s announcement on the proposed US strategic reserve, which includes top coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, and Cardano. Trump’s statement was followed by a spike in crypto prices, with Bitcoin surging to over $90k after revisiting $80k. While Bitcoin’s price surged for the day, its dominance dipped from 55.4% to 50%, reflecting the shift in capital to altcoins. Historically, a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance catalyzes an altcoin run, which now excites many on social media. Is Bitcoin The Answer? Although Ray Dalio didn’t categorically mention Bitcoin as the “potential savior”, his recent statements suggest a favorable view on the premier digital asset. Due to its decentralization, Dalio highlighted the asset’s potential as a hedge against economic uncertainties.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,000 followers on the social media platform X that the XRP against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC) pair is flashing a bearish divergence on the weekly chart. Traders keep a close eye on coins flashing a bearish divergence as the signal suggests the token is losing bullish momentum and may be ready to enter a downtrend. Bluntz also notes that XRP appears to be in the midst of an ABC correction against the US dollar. “Looks increasingly like that was a complacency shoulder B wave on XRP in my opinion. If BTC and SOL taught me anything the last month, do not fade the weekly bear divs.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that an asset tends to go through an ABC pullback after completing a five-wave rally. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will fall to the $1 area to complete the ABC correction. At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.46. In January, when BTC was trading above $100,000, Bluntz said that Bitcoin appears to have completed a five-wave rally and that a market top may be in. He later updated his outlook and said that Bitcoin was flashing a bearish divergence on the monthly timeframe. Last month, he told his followers that SOL looked weak after losing the $220 level while showing a bearish divergence on the two-week chart. At time of writing, BTC is trading for $87,421 and SOL is worth $144.78.

The Federal Reserve just dropped its latest Beige Book , and it’s painting a picture of the U.S. economy that’s… well, let’s just say it’s not a blockbuster, but it’s far from a horror show. Think of it as a modest sequel – not as thrilling as the original, but still holding its own. Let’s dive into what this economic snapshot means, especially for those of us keeping a close eye on the crypto markets. Decoding the Fed Beige Book: A Glimpse into Economic Growth The Fed’s Beige Book , a report published eight times a year, offers a qualitative assessment of current economic conditions across the twelve Federal Reserve districts. Think of it as economic tea leaves, gathered from anecdotal evidence from businesses, community leaders, and other contacts. This latest edition, covering the period since mid-January, reveals a recurring theme: modest economic growth . But what does ‘modest’ really mean in the grand scheme of things, and more importantly, how does it impact our crypto world? Here’s a quick rundown of the key takeaways: Slight Expansion: Most districts reported slight or modest growth, suggesting the economy is still inching forward, albeit not at a breakneck pace. Consumer Spending Dip: Perhaps the most concerning note is the decline in consumer spending in several districts. This is a crucial indicator as consumer spending fuels a significant portion of the US economy. Manufacturing Gains: On a brighter note, manufacturing showed modest gains in some areas, hinting at pockets of resilience within the industrial sector. Job Growth Slowdown: Job growth was described as slow across the board, and wage increases are easing. This could be interpreted as a cooling labor market, which has implications for inflation. Price Pressures Persist: Prices continued to rise across districts. Interestingly, some firms are finding it difficult to pass on increased costs to consumers, while others are preemptively raising prices anticipating tariffs. In essence, the Beige Book paints a picture of an economy in a state of cautious equilibrium – growing, but with headwinds and uncertainties. Wu Blockchain, a prominent voice on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted the nuanced outlook, noting that despite policy and tariff concerns, regional outlooks remain cautiously optimistic. This cautious optimism is a key thread running through the report. The Consumer Spending Conundrum: What Does it Mean for Crypto? The dip in consumer spending is arguably the most significant detail for crypto enthusiasts. Why? Because consumer sentiment and spending power are intertwined with investment appetite, including investments in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. If consumers are tightening their belts, it could signal a shift away from discretionary spending and investments. Here’s the breakdown of why declining consumer spending matters: Reduced Liquidity: Less spending can translate to less disposable income available for investments, including crypto. Risk Aversion: Economic uncertainty often leads to risk aversion. Consumers might prefer to hold onto cash or invest in safer assets rather than volatile cryptocurrencies. Broader Economic Slowdown: Declining consumer spending can be a leading indicator of a broader economic slowdown, which can negatively impact all markets, including crypto. However, it’s crucial to remember that the Beige Book is a snapshot in time and reflects anecdotal evidence. It’s not a definitive forecast. Furthermore, the crypto market operates on global dynamics, and while US consumer spending is important, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Navigating Inflation and the Economic Outlook Inflation remains a persistent concern, as prices continue to rise across regions, according to the Beige Book. The report highlights a mixed bag when it comes to businesses passing on costs. Some are struggling, indicating potential pressure on profit margins, while others are preemptively hiking prices due to anticipated tariffs. This inflationary environment has significant implications for the economic outlook and, by extension, the crypto market. Here’s how inflation and the broader economic outlook are connected to crypto: Inflation Hedge Narrative: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often touted as an inflation hedge. In inflationary times, investors might turn to crypto as a store of value, potentially driving up demand and prices. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Central banks’ responses to inflation, particularly interest rate hikes, can impact crypto markets. Higher interest rates can make traditional investments more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Economic Uncertainty: Inflation adds to economic uncertainty. While some investors might see crypto as a safe haven during uncertainty, others might reduce risk exposure across the board. The Beige Book’s mention of cautious optimism despite these inflationary pressures suggests a belief that the economy can navigate these challenges. However, the path forward remains uncertain, and vigilance is key. Job Growth and Manufacturing Gains: Glimmers of Hope? While the Beige Book notes slow job growth and easing wage increases, the modest manufacturing gains offer a sliver of positivity. Manufacturing is a foundational sector, and any growth, however modest, can be seen as a positive sign for overall economic health. Furthermore, a cooling labor market, while concerning for job seekers, could be seen as a positive development in the fight against inflation, as it may reduce wage-price pressures. How do these factors play into the crypto narrative? Manufacturing as an Indicator: Manufacturing health can be a barometer for broader economic activity. Continued modest gains could signal underlying economic resilience, which is generally positive for all markets, including crypto. Labor Market Dynamics: A cooling labor market and easing wage pressures could influence the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. If inflation shows signs of easing, the Fed might become less hawkish, which could be beneficial for risk assets like crypto. Overall Economic Sentiment: These mixed signals – slow job growth but manufacturing gains – contribute to the overall cautious optimism reflected in the Beige Book. This sentiment, while not overtly bullish, suggests a degree of stability that can be reassuring for investors. Actionable Insights and Crypto Market Strategy So, what can we glean from the Fed’s Beige Book for our crypto strategies? Monitor Consumer Spending Data: Keep a close eye on upcoming consumer spending data releases. A continued decline could signal a more significant economic slowdown and potentially impact crypto markets. Track Inflation Metrics: Inflation remains a key driver of market sentiment. Monitor inflation reports and central bank responses closely. Stay Informed on Fed Policy: The Fed’s monetary policy decisions will heavily influence the economic outlook and market conditions. Pay attention to Fed speeches and announcements. Diversification is Key: In times of economic uncertainty, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto or any other asset class. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is volatile and operates in cycles. Focus on long-term fundamentals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term economic reports. Conclusion: Navigating the Modest Growth Landscape The Fed’s Beige Book offers a nuanced, if somewhat underwhelming, snapshot of the US economy. Economic growth is happening, but it’s modest. Consumer spending is a concern, while manufacturing gains offer a glimmer of hope. Inflation persists, and the overall economic outlook is cautiously optimistic. For the crypto market, this report underscores the ongoing economic uncertainties and the need for a balanced and informed investment approach.

41211692,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137360,1741223997,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Bitwise Files Aptos ETF Application with SEC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-aptos-etf-sec-filing/,"Get ready for a potential game-changer in the crypto investment world! U.S. asset management giant Bitwise has just thrown its hat into the ring, submitting a crucial S-1 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Aptos (APT) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This exciting development signals a growing appetite for diverse crypto investment products and could pave the way for wider adoption of Aptos within traditional financial markets. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast or potential investor? Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking news. What is an Aptos ETF and Why is it Significant? Before we get too deep, let’s break down the basics. An Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF, is essentially a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. Think of it as a basket holding various assets – in this case, the assets would be related to Aptos. A spot Aptos ETF , if approved, would directly hold APT tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Aptos without directly purchasing and managing the cryptocurrency themselves. This is a huge deal for several reasons: Accessibility for Retail Investors: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This means everyday investors who might find navigating crypto exchanges daunting can invest in Aptos through a familiar and regulated financial product. Increased Institutional Adoption: Institutional investors, such as pension funds and large investment firms, are often restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies. An Aptos ETF provides a compliant and regulated pathway for these institutions to allocate capital to the Aptos ecosystem, potentially driving significant inflows. Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: The approval of an Aptos ETF by the SEC would be a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It signals that regulatory bodies are becoming more comfortable with digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. Diversification Opportunities: For investors already involved in crypto, an Aptos ETF offers a convenient way to diversify their portfolios beyond established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In essence, an Aptos ETF acts as a bridge, connecting the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency with the established infrastructure of traditional finance. It simplifies access, broadens participation, and potentially injects substantial capital into the Aptos network. Bitwise ETF Application: A Closer Look at the Filing So, who is Bitwise, and why is their Bitwise ETF application noteworthy? Bitwise Asset Management is a well-established player in the crypto investment space, known for its expertise in digital asset funds. They manage a range of crypto-focused investment products and have been actively involved in advocating for and launching crypto ETFs. Here’s what we know about their recent filing: S-1 Filing: Bitwise submitted an S-1 form to the SEC. This is the initial registration statement required for new securities, including ETFs, to be offered to the public. It’s a crucial first step in the ETF approval process. Delaware Entity Registration: Prior to the SEC filing, Bitwise registered the ETF entity in Delaware. This is a common practice for financial entities due to Delaware’s favorable corporate laws. Spot ETF: Based on the information available, it is expected to be a spot Bitwise ETF , meaning it will hold actual APT tokens. This is different from futures-based ETFs, which derive their value from futures contracts and not the underlying asset itself. Track Record: Bitwise has a history of launching innovative crypto investment products. Their experience and credibility within the crypto space lend weight to their Bitwise ETF application. While the filing is a positive sign, it’s important to remember that it’s just the beginning of a potentially lengthy review process by the SEC. The SEC will meticulously examine various aspects of the application, including market surveillance, custody arrangements, and investor protection measures. Navigating the SEC Filing Process for Crypto ETFs: What are the Hurdles? The path to SEC approval for a crypto ETF , especially one holding a cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, is not without its challenges. The SEC has been cautious in approving spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto market. Here are some key hurdles that Bitwise and their Aptos ETF application will likely face: Challenge Description Potential Bitwise Approach Market Surveillance Concerns The SEC wants assurance that the underlying Aptos market is robust and resistant to manipulation. Bitwise will need to demonstrate strong surveillance mechanisms in the APT trading markets and potentially partner with exchanges that have robust compliance programs. Custody of Assets Secure and regulated custody of APT tokens is paramount. The SEC needs to be convinced that investor assets are safe. Bitwise will likely utilize qualified custodians that meet SEC standards for digital asset custody. Valuation and Liquidity Accurate and transparent valuation of APT and sufficient liquidity in the market are essential for ETF operations. Bitwise will need to demonstrate reliable pricing sources and sufficient market depth for APT trading. Investor Protection The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection. They will scrutinize the ETF structure and disclosures to ensure investors are adequately informed about the risks involved. Bitwise will need to provide clear and comprehensive disclosures about the risks associated with investing in an APT ETF and Aptos itself. Despite these hurdles, the fact that Bitwise, a reputable asset manager, is pursuing an Aptos ETF suggests growing confidence in the maturation of the crypto market and increasing regulatory acceptance. The recent approvals of Bitcoin spot ETFs may also set a precedent and potentially ease the path for subsequent crypto ETF applications. The Broader Crypto ETF Landscape: Expanding Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum The potential approval of an Aptos ETF would mark a significant expansion of the crypto ETF landscape beyond the established giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Currently, the majority of approved crypto ETFs focus on these two cryptocurrencies. An APT ETF would represent a move towards greater diversification within the crypto ETF space, offering investors exposure to a wider range of digital assets. This expansion is crucial for the continued growth and evolution of the crypto market. It indicates a broadening interest in and understanding of different blockchain ecosystems and their potential. Furthermore, it could pave the way for ETFs based on other promising layer-1 blockchains and emerging crypto sectors. The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has demonstrated significant investor demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. If the Bitwise ETF application is successful, it could signal the beginning of a new wave of crypto ETF offerings, bringing even more diverse crypto assets into the traditional financial system. Investing in APT ETF: Opportunities and Considerations for Investors For investors considering an APT ETF , it’s essential to weigh both the potential opportunities and the inherent risks. Here’s a breakdown to help you make informed decisions: Opportunities: Exposure to Aptos Ecosystem: Investing in an APT ETF provides direct exposure to the Aptos blockchain, a relatively new layer-1 blockchain known for its scalability and innovative technology. Aptos aims to address some of the limitations of earlier blockchains and has the potential for significant growth. Simplified Investment: As mentioned earlier, ETFs simplify the investment process. You can gain exposure to Aptos without needing to understand crypto wallets, private keys, or crypto exchanges. Potential for Growth: If Aptos continues to develop and gain adoption, the value of the APT ETF could appreciate significantly. The crypto market is known for its volatility and high-growth potential. Portfolio Diversification: Adding an APT ETF to your portfolio can enhance diversification, especially if you are already invested in traditional assets or other cryptocurrencies. Considerations: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Aptos, are inherently volatile. The price of APT can fluctuate significantly, and the APT ETF will reflect these price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the value of Aptos and the ETF. Aptos Specific Risks: Aptos is a relatively new blockchain. It faces competition from other blockchains, and its long-term success is not guaranteed. Technical issues or slower-than-expected adoption could impact its value. ETF Fees and Expenses: ETFs typically have expense ratios, which are fees charged to manage the fund. These fees will reduce your overall returns. Actionable Insight: If you are interested in gaining exposure to Aptos and are comfortable with the risks associated with crypto investments, an APT ETF , once approved, could be a convenient and accessible option. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research on Aptos, understand the risks involved, and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance before investing. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Aptos and Crypto ETFs Bitwise’s filing for an Aptos ETF is undoubtedly a significant development for both the Aptos ecosystem and the broader crypto ETF market. It signals growing institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies and a potential expansion of regulated crypto investment products. While SEC approval is not guaranteed and the process may take time, this move represents a hopeful step towards greater mainstream acceptance and accessibility of Aptos and other innovative blockchain technologies.

41211720,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137361,1741224076,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pivotal Showdown: How Tether & Circle Battle Will Shape the Cryptocurrency Future of Stablecoins,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-circle-stablecoins-crypto-future/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with discussions about stablecoins, and for good reason. These digital assets, designed to maintain a stable value, are seen by many as a crucial bridge between the volatile crypto market and traditional finance. But who will control the future of this burgeoning sector? According to a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report, the answer might hinge on the intense competition between the two giants of the stablecoin realm: Tether and Circle. This isn’t just a corporate rivalry; it’s a battle that could redefine the very fabric of the crypto landscape. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating power struggle and understand what it means for the future of digital finance. The Titans Clash: Tether vs. Circle and the Fate of Stablecoins The WSJ report shines a spotlight on the contrasting approaches of Tether and Circle, emphasizing that their ongoing competition is the key determinant of the cryptocurrency future of stablecoins. These two companies, while both issuing stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, operate under fundamentally different philosophies and strategies. Understanding these differences is crucial to grasping the stakes of this competition. Tether (USDT): Often seen as the elder statesman of stablecoins, Tether has prioritized decentralization and operating outside the traditional financial system. It has historically faced scrutiny over its reserves and transparency but remains the most widely used stablecoin in the market. Circle (USDC): In contrast, Circle has embraced regulatory compliance and aims to integrate stablecoins within the existing financial framework. USDC is known for its greater transparency and is often favored by institutions seeking a compliant digital dollar. This divergence in approach sets the stage for a high-stakes showdown. The WSJ suggests that the victor in this competition will not only dominate the stablecoin market but also dictate the direction in which the entire sector evolves. Will it be a future where stablecoins operate largely outside of traditional regulatory control, or will they become integrated into the established financial system? The answer, it seems, lies in the fortunes of Tether and Circle. Decoding the Different Paths: Tether’s Decentralized Vision vs. Circle’s Regulatory Embrace To truly understand the significance of this battle, we need to dissect the contrasting strategies employed by Tether and Circle. These aren’t just different business models; they represent fundamentally different visions for the role of stablecoins in the global financial ecosystem. Tether: Championing Decentralization and Autonomy Tether’s approach can be characterized by a commitment to the original ethos of cryptocurrency: decentralization and operating outside the purview of traditional financial institutions. Here’s a closer look at their strategy: Decentralized Operations: Tether has historically operated with less regulatory oversight compared to Circle. This has allowed them to cater to a global market, including regions with less stringent financial regulations. Market Dominance: Being the first mover in the stablecoin space, Tether has built a massive network effect. USDT enjoys widespread adoption across exchanges and DeFi platforms, making it the most liquid and widely traded stablecoin. Focus on Crypto-Native Users: Tether’s appeal is strong among users who prioritize decentralization and are wary of centralized financial systems. Its presence is deeply entrenched in the core crypto trading and investment landscape. However, this decentralized approach has come with its own set of challenges, primarily concerning transparency and regulatory scrutiny. Concerns about the backing of USDT and its reserves have been persistent, leading to ongoing debates and legal challenges. Circle: Paving the Way for Regulatory Compliance and Institutional Adoption Circle, on the other hand, has chosen a path of regulatory compliance and integration with the traditional financial system. This strategy is geared towards building trust with regulators and attracting institutional investors. Let’s examine Circle’s key tenets: Regulatory Compliance: Circle has actively sought regulatory approvals and operates under a more transparent framework. USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, enhancing its credibility in the eyes of traditional finance players. Institutional Focus: USDC is positioned as a stablecoin suitable for institutional adoption. Its transparency and regulatory compliance make it attractive to institutions seeking to enter the crypto space while adhering to established financial norms. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Circle aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By being compliant and transparent, USDC can facilitate smoother integration of stablecoins into existing financial infrastructure. Circle’s strategy, while appealing to regulators and institutions, might be perceived as less aligned with the original decentralized ideals of cryptocurrency by some in the crypto community. However, it positions USDC for mainstream adoption and potentially wider acceptance within the global financial system. The Regulatory Tightrope: How Crypto Regulation Could Tip the Scales The WSJ report rightly points out that crypto regulation will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of this stablecoin showdown. Regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on the crypto space, and stablecoins, due to their potential systemic importance, are squarely in their sights. Here’s how regulatory actions could impact Tether and Circle: Regulatory Crackdown on Tether: If regulators successfully clamp down on Tether, demanding greater transparency and stricter compliance, it could significantly impact USDT’s market position. Increased regulatory pressure could erode trust in USDT, potentially leading to a shift towards more compliant alternatives like USDC. Regulatory Tailwinds for Circle: Conversely, stricter regulations could inadvertently benefit Circle. USDC’s proactive approach to compliance positions it favorably in a more regulated environment. Increased regulatory scrutiny on competitors could make USDC a safer and more appealing option for users and institutions alike. Global Regulatory Landscape: The consistency and coordination of global crypto regulation will be crucial. Differing regulations across jurisdictions could create arbitrage opportunities and complexities for stablecoin issuers. A globally harmonized regulatory framework could provide clarity and stability to the stablecoin market. The regulatory landscape is still evolving, making it difficult to predict the exact direction. However, it’s clear that regulatory actions will be a major determinant in shaping the future of stablecoins and the competitive dynamics between Tether and Circle. What’s at Stake? The Broader Implications of the Tether-Circle Battle The competition between Tether and Circle transcends mere market share rivalry. It’s a battle for the soul of stablecoins and, to some extent, the future direction of the cryptocurrency ecosystem itself. The outcome will have significant implications for various stakeholders: For Cryptocurrency Users: The availability and characteristics of stablecoins directly impact crypto users. The dominance of either Tether or Circle could influence transaction costs, accessibility, and the overall user experience within the crypto space. For DeFi Ecosystem: Stablecoins are the lifeblood of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The stability and reliability of these assets are paramount for the continued growth and functionality of DeFi protocols. The regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) surrounding stablecoins can significantly impact DeFi innovation. For Traditional Finance: The integration of stablecoins into traditional finance could revolutionize payments, remittances, and cross-border transactions. However, regulatory acceptance and interoperability with existing financial infrastructure are crucial for this integration to materialize. For the Future of Money: Stablecoins are being viewed by some as a potential form of digital currency that could challenge traditional fiat currencies. The regulatory approach and the success of either decentralized or compliant stablecoin models could influence the future evolution of money itself. The WSJ’s assertion that the outcome of the Tether-Circle competition will shape the future of stablecoins is not an exaggeration. This is a pivotal moment for the crypto industry, and the choices made by regulators, companies, and users will collectively determine the trajectory of this vital sector. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape So, what does all of this mean for you? Whether you’re a crypto investor, a DeFi enthusiast, or simply curious about the future of finance, understanding the dynamics of the stablecoins market is increasingly important. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed about Regulatory Developments: Keep a close watch on regulatory announcements and policy changes related to stablecoins in your jurisdiction and globally. Regulatory shifts can have a significant impact on the value and utility of different stablecoins. Diversify Your Stablecoin Holdings: Consider diversifying your stablecoin holdings across different issuers, including both centralized and potentially decentralized options (while being mindful of risks). This can mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions or issuer-specific issues. Understand the Risk Profiles: Educate yourself about the reserve composition, transparency, and regulatory compliance of different stablecoins. Understand the risk profiles associated with each stablecoin before using or investing in them. Engage with the Crypto Community: Participate in discussions and forums within the crypto community to stay abreast of the latest developments and perspectives on stablecoins and their future. Conclusion: A Stablecoin Showdown with Far-Reaching Consequences The WSJ report paints a clear picture: the future of stablecoins is inextricably linked to the ongoing competition between Tether and Circle. This isn’t just a business rivalry; it’s a battle between two fundamentally different visions for the role of digital currencies in the world. Whether regulators succeed in curbing Tether’s influence, paving the way for Circle’s compliant model, or whether Tether manages to navigate the regulatory storm and maintain its dominance, the outcome will have profound implications. It will shape not only the stablecoin market but also the broader cryptocurrency future , influencing the balance between decentralization and regulation in the digital finance era.

Imagine a tool that not only predicts your revenue but also leverages the power of AI to enhance sales strategies. That’s precisely what revenue prediction startup Gong offers, and their latest milestone is turning heads. Revenue Prediction Startup Gong’s Monumental $300M ARR Milestone Gong, a pioneering revenue prediction startup , has just announced a staggering achievement: surpassing $300 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR). This news, unveiled on Wednesday, signals robust growth and positions Gong as a significant player in the SaaS landscape. Founded in 2016, Gong has carved a niche by using AI to analyze customer interactions, providing invaluable insights for businesses aiming to optimize their sales processes. This remarkable ARR figure isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to Gong’s innovative approach and the increasing demand for sophisticated revenue prediction tools in today’s competitive market. CEO Amit Bendov, in a statement to Bitcoin World, expressed enthusiasm about the company’s momentum, stating, “We’re seeing great momentum. That’s why we’re excited to share the numbers.” This surge in ARR is partially attributed to the integration of generative AI capabilities in recent years, further enhancing Gong’s ability to provide accurate and actionable revenue predictions . AI-Powered Growth Engine Fuels Gong’s Ascent Since its inception, Gong has been at the forefront of leveraging AI to transform how businesses understand and predict their revenue streams. Here’s how AI has become Gong’s secret weapon: Analyzing Customer Interactions: Gong’s core technology revolves around using AI to analyze vast amounts of customer interaction data. This includes everything from sales calls and emails to video conferences, providing a 360-degree view of the sales process. Generative AI Boost: The recent incorporation of generative AI has amplified Gong’s capabilities. This advanced AI allows for even deeper insights and more nuanced revenue predictions , helping companies anticipate market changes and adjust strategies proactively. Predictive Analytics: By identifying patterns and trends within customer interactions, Gong’s AI algorithms offer highly accurate revenue predictions . This enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales funnels, and improve overall revenue generation. The fusion of AI with sales intelligence is not just a trend; it’s a fundamental shift in how businesses approach revenue management. Gong is leading this charge, empowering companies to move from reactive sales strategies to proactive, data-informed approaches. Gong’s Valuation and Market Standing: Is it IPO Ready? Gong’s financial trajectory is as impressive as its technological innovation. Valued at a hefty $7.25 billion during its $250 million Series E funding round in 2021, led by Franklin Templeton, Gong is now being closely watched for its next move. Let’s break down the valuation context: Valuation Metrics: With a $7.25 billion valuation and $300M ARR, Gong’s valuation currently stands at approximately 24 times ARR. This places it alongside major AI companies, indicating strong investor confidence and market perception. Market Comparison: While 24x ARR is significant, it’s essential to compare it with other high-growth AI startups . For instance, Anysphere, known for its AI -powered coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at 25 times ARR, showcasing the premium the market places on cutting-edge AI ventures. Growth Trajectory: Although CEO Bendov remained tight-lipped about specific revenue growth figures, he indicated that Gong’s growth is within the “top-quartile public SaaS companies” range, suggesting an annual growth rate between 25% and 56%. This positions Gong as a high-growth company justifying its valuation and attracting further investment interest. Considering these factors, the question naturally arises: Is Gong gearing up for an IPO ? The $300M ARR milestone certainly fuels such speculation, placing Gong firmly on the IPO radar. IPO Speculation and Future Pathways for Gong The impressive ARR and growth trajectory naturally lead to discussions about a potential IPO for Gong. While CEO Amit Bendov acknowledges that going public is an important milestone, he tempered immediate expectations, stating that an IPO is not planned for 2025. Here’s a look at Gong’s potential future paths: IPO on the Horizon? : While not imminent, an IPO remains a likely long-term goal for Gong. Surpassing $300M ARR is a key indicator of IPO readiness, and as Gong continues to scale, the public markets could offer significant capital and visibility. Financial Strength: Bendov highlighted Gong’s strong financial position, noting that the company is nearly profitable and has barely touched the capital raised in its 2021 Series E round. This financial stability gives Gong flexibility in its strategic decisions, whether to pursue an IPO or consider further private funding rounds. Customer Base: With 4,500 corporate customers, including industry giants like Google, LinkedIn, and Square, Gong has established a robust and diverse client base. This broad adoption underscores the value proposition of Gong’s revenue prediction platform and its potential for continued market penetration. For now, Gong seems focused on sustained growth and further innovation in the AI -driven revenue prediction space. Whether through an IPO or continued private growth, Gong’s future looks exceptionally bright. Conclusion: Gong – A Rising Star in the AI and SaaS Universe Gong’s ascent to $300M ARR is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful validation of the transformative potential of AI in reshaping business operations. As a revenue prediction startup , Gong is not only redefining sales strategies but also setting new benchmarks for growth and innovation in the SaaS industry. The company’s journey from a nascent startup in 2016 to a potential IPO contender is a compelling narrative of vision, execution, and the strategic application of AI .

It’s not just about market caps and price predictions; it’s also about who’s dominating the crypto conversation. Santiment, the renowned on-chain analytics platform, just dropped some fascinating insights. They’ve dived deep into the digital chatter across Reddit, X, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and BitcoinTalk to unveil the definitive list of the top crypto founders everyone’s talking about. Let’s explore who made the cut and why these figures are constantly in the spotlight. Santiment Unveils Top Crypto Figures by Mentions Santiment’s recent analysis isn’t just a popularity contest; it’s a gauge of influence and impact within the crypto space. By meticulously tracking mentions across diverse social platforms, Santiment provides a unique perspective on which cryptocurrency leaders are shaping narratives and capturing public attention. This data is invaluable for understanding market sentiment and identifying key figures driving the industry’s evolution. Here’s the countdown of the top 10 most mentioned crypto founders , according to Santiment’s comprehensive analysis: Satoshi Nakamoto: The Enigmatic Pioneer Topping the list is the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Even after years of mystery surrounding their true identity, Satoshi remains the most talked-about figure. Why? Because Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency they birthed, is the foundation upon which the entire industry is built. The anonymity itself adds to the intrigue, constantly fueling speculation and discussion. Satoshi’s creation sparked a revolution, and their legacy continues to dominate conversations. Do Kwon: The Fallen Titan From groundbreaking innovator to facing legal battles, Do Kwon’s journey is a cautionary tale. As the co-founder of Terra (LUNA) and UST, Kwon was once celebrated. However, the dramatic collapse of his algorithmic stablecoin project in 2022 sent shockwaves through the market, causing billions in losses. Currently on trial in the U.S., Kwon’s story is a stark reminder of the risks inherent in crypto and the intense scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency leaders . His high mention count is unfortunately tied to the Terra debacle, making him a figure of intense discussion and debate. Vitalik Buterin: The Visionary Architect of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of EthereumIn stark contrast to Kwon’s recent notoriety, Vitalik Buterin earns his place for positive contributions and ongoing influence. As the co-founder of Ethereum, Buterin is revered for introducing smart contracts, the technology that powers decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi. His visionary approach and continuous involvement in Ethereum’s development keep him at the forefront of crypto discussions. Buterin is not just a founder; he’s a thought leader constantly pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Justin Sun: The Marketing Maestro of Tron Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, is known for his aggressive marketing strategies and headline-grabbing moves. His infamous multi-million dollar lunch with Warren Buffett showcased his flair for publicity. Whether you love him or critique his tactics, Sun’s ability to generate buzz and keep Tron in the conversation is undeniable. His high mentions reflect his active presence and often controversial but effective marketing approach. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): The Disgraced Exchange King Similar to Do Kwon, Sam Bankman-Fried’s mentions are linked to a significant market event – the collapse of FTX. Once hailed as a crypto prodigy, SBF’s empire crumbled amidst allegations of fraud. The FTX saga is a major talking point in crypto, raising crucial questions about regulation, transparency, and trust. SBF’s downfall is a stark example of the high stakes and intense scrutiny within the crypto mentions landscape. Roger Ver: Bitcoin Jesus and Bitcoin Cash Advocate Roger Ver, nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus,” is a polarizing figure. As an early Bitcoin investor, he was instrumental in its early adoption. However, he later became a staunch supporter of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), leading to significant debates within the Bitcoin community. Ver’s outspoken opinions and long history in crypto ensure he remains a frequently mentioned personality, particularly in discussions about Bitcoin’s scaling and philosophy. Ryoshi: The Vanished Visionary of Shiba Inu The founder of Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ryoshi, mirrors Satoshi’s anonymity but with a different twist. Ryoshi launched the meme coin sensation and then mysteriously disappeared, adding to the mythos of Shiba Inu. This enigmatic departure has only fueled speculation and discussion within the SHIB community and the broader crypto world. Ryoshi’s absence is as much a part of the Shiba Inu story as the coin itself, contributing to their persistent mentions. Charles Hoskinson: The Cardano Architect and Ethereum Co-founder Charles Hoskinson brings a blend of technical expertise and academic rigor to the crypto space. As a co-founder of Ethereum and the creator of Cardano (ADA), Hoskinson is respected for his methodical approach to blockchain development and his focus on peer-reviewed research. His active engagement in the Cardano community and his thought-provoking commentary on the industry keep him relevant in ongoing crypto conversations. Charlie Lee: The Pragmatic Creator of Litecoin Charlie Lee, the developer of Litecoin (LTC), positioned his cryptocurrency as a practical alternative to Bitcoin – “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” Litecoin’s focus on faster transaction times and lower fees has ensured its longevity and continued relevance. Lee’s pragmatic approach and consistent presence in the crypto space contribute to his regular mentions, especially in discussions about Bitcoin alternatives and payment solutions. Changpeng Zhao (CZ): The Binance Titan Turned Educator Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, is synonymous with Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange he founded and led to dominance. After stepping down as CEO due to regulatory issues in the U.S., CZ has transitioned to focusing on Web3 education. His journey from building a crypto empire to navigating regulatory challenges and now promoting education makes him a compelling figure. CZ’s past leadership at Binance and his current focus on education ensure he remains a prominent voice in the crypto mentions landscape. Why Do Crypto Mentions Matter? Understanding which cryptocurrency leaders are being discussed and why offers several key benefits: Sentiment Analysis: High mention counts, especially when analyzed with sentiment data, can indicate market trends and shifts in public perception towards specific projects or figures. Influence Tracking: It helps identify who the key influencers are in the crypto space, allowing for a better understanding of information dissemination and narrative shaping. Risk Assessment: Spikes in mentions, particularly negative ones, can signal potential risks or controversies associated with certain individuals or projects, as seen with Do Kwon and SBF. Community Engagement: Tracking mentions can provide insights into community focus and interests, helping projects and platforms understand what topics are resonating with their audience. Challenges in Analyzing Crypto Mentions While valuable, analyzing crypto mentions also presents challenges: Data Overload: The sheer volume of online conversations can be overwhelming, requiring sophisticated tools like Santiment’s to filter and analyze effectively. Noise and Misinformation: Social media is rife with noise, bots, and misinformation, which can skew the data and make it challenging to extract genuine insights. Context is Key: Mentions alone don’t tell the whole story. Understanding the context behind the mentions – whether positive, negative, or neutral – is crucial for accurate interpretation. Platform Fragmentation: Crypto conversations are spread across numerous platforms, requiring comprehensive data aggregation to get a holistic view. Actionable Insights from Santiment’s Analysis Santiment’s analysis of top crypto figures provides actionable insights for various stakeholders: For Investors: Stay informed about which figures are influencing market sentiment and project narratives. Monitor mentions alongside other on-chain metrics for a more comprehensive investment strategy. For Project Teams: Understand who the influential voices are in your space and track how your project and leaders are being discussed. Use this data to refine your communication and engagement strategies. For Media and Analysts: Identify key figures and trending topics to focus your reporting and analysis. Use mention data to support your narratives and provide data-backed insights. Conclusion: The Enduring Influence of Crypto Founders Santiment’s analysis underscores the enduring influence of crypto founders in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. From the enigmatic Satoshi to the visionary Vitalik and the controversial figures like Do Kwon and SBF, these individuals and their stories continue to drive conversations and influence market perceptions.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-is-designed-to-underpin-us-dollar-usd-heres-why/,"A recent tweet from Digital Perspective has sparked discussion regarding the potential role of XRP in maintaining the U.S. dollar’s dominance as the world’s reserve currency. The tweet suggests that “XRP was designed to underpin the USD dollar to ensure its dominance as the World Reserve Currency for the next 150 years.” XRP was designed to underpin the USDollar to ensure its dominance as the World Reserve Currency for the next 150 years. Ripple is playing chess while everyone else out here is playing checkers on a Maxi board. This isn`t about chasing green candles.This is about protecting the… pic.twitter.com/dR6soENyPf — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) March 4, 2025 This assertion presents an intriguing perspective on the evolving financial landscape and the role digital assets could play in global monetary policy. The Role of XRP in the Global Economy The claim that XRP was designed to support the U.S. dollar’s global standing is significant. While there is no official confirmation that XRP was specifically created for this purpose, its technological capabilities and liquidity advantages make it a candidate for high-level financial applications. XRP’s ability to facilitate near-instant, low-cost cross-border transactions has already positioned it as a useful tool for financial institutions. The tweet further suggests that “Ripple is playing chess while everyone else out here is playing checkers on a Maxi board.” This statement implies that Ripple’s long-term strategy involves global financial infrastructure, rather than focusing solely on short-term market movements. While some cryptocurrency communities concentrate on price speculation, Digital Perspective argues that the real significance of XRP lies in its potential role in economic stability and monetary policy. The Argument for a Basket of Assets In the video attached to the tweet, Digital Perspective discusses the concept of a diversified reserve backing for the U.S. dollar. The speaker states, “This is why I love the idea of a basket of assets, right? And I do mean like gold, oil, and digital assets alike.” This idea aligns with historical discussions about strengthening the dollar by tying it to tangible and digital reserves rather than relying solely on government policies or agreements such as the petrodollar system. The speaker recalls a 2019 conversation with Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the potential benefits of backing the dollar with multiple assets. He suggests that “if you could underpin the dollar with all of those things, instead of just an agreement to print more or just a petrodollar agreement, then you really would have the confidence of a dollar for the next 150 years.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 National Security and Economic Strategy A response to the tweet by X user JohnMWagner brings a geopolitical dimension to the discussion. He argues that “if folks would just re-premise the existence of utility-driven crypto, and not be blinded by gaslighting and tribalism, they would have a clearer perspective on all things being national security first.” Their statement suggests that digital assets, including XRP , should be viewed through national economic security rather than mere financial speculation. The comment also suggests that policymakers are methodically shaping a new financial framework incorporating digital assets into the existing system. The idea that the U.S. is undergoing a systematic restructuring aligns with ongoing regulatory discussions about digital currencies and their role in the global economy. Digital Perspective’s tweet and the subsequent discussion raise important questions about the future of the U.S. dollar and the role of digital assets like XRP. While there is no official confirmation that XRP was designed to support the dollar’s global dominance, its capabilities make it a viable component of a broader financial strategy.

If you’ve been watching the markets, you’ve seen Dogecoin (DOGE) fall below the $0.20 mark despite growing ETF optimism and Shiba Inu (SHIB) barely holding onto support. Meanwhile, the BTFD Coin (BTFD) presale is nearing its final stage with a mind-blowing 3650% ROI potential, making it the hottest meme coin opportunity of 2025 and the standout among the best cryptos to join for long term wins. With over $6.26 million raised and 71 billion coins sold, investors are scrambling to get in before the price jumps at launch. Meme coins have always been volatile, but smart investors know that presales are the safest bet to bypass market crashes and bear trends. That’s why BTFD Coin has captivated the crypto community. With a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a growing army of 11,200 holders, BTFD is not just another meme coin—it’s a wealth-generating machine in the making. But how does it compare to DOGE and SHIB? Can DOGE’s potential ETF approval or SHIB’s last support level change the game? Keep reading to find out why BTFD is the best crypto to join for long term and why it’s set to lead the next meme coin revolution. BTFD Coin: The 3650% ROI Presale That’s Changing the Meme Coin Game How often do you get a shot at 3650% gains? BTFD Coin’s presale started at just $0.000004 and is now at $0.00016 in Stage 14, with a final launch price of $0.0006. Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, meaning those who buy now are looking at life-changing returns. But this window is closing fast. With Stage 14 already 98.85% complete, this might be your last chance to secure a seat before the rocket takes off. Presale Success and Expert Forecasts Numbers don’t lie— BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of spectacular. Starting at just $0.000004 in Stage 1, the current price in Stage 14 has climbed to $0.00016, with a final listing price of $0.0006. With a projected moon price of $0.006, investors are eyeing a massive 3650% ROI, making it one of the best cryptos to join for long term. Over 71 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $6.26 million, while the BTFD Bulls community now boasts over 11,200 holders. The presale is nearing its final stretch, and this window won’t stay open for long! Let’s break this down with a real-world example. If you invest $500 right now at $0.00016, you’ll get 3.125 million BTFD tokens. At launch, that’s already worth $1,875. But if analysts’ moon price of $0.006 is hit? That same $500 turns into $18,750! And let’s not forget staking. BTFD’s 90% APY staking rewards mean you’re earning passive income just for holding, making it one of the most rewarding meme coins of the year. Why BTFD’s Utility and Community Power Make It Unstoppable Meme coins live and die by their community, and BTFD’s Bulls Squad is built differently. This isn’t just hype—it’s a movement. The team has gone all in with a fully launched P2E game, giving players a chance to earn BTFD rewards while having fun. Combined with staking, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an ecosystem designed for growth. How to Buy BTFD Coin Before It’s Too Late Visit the official BTFD presale site . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Select your currency and enter the amount you want to invest. Confirm your purchase and secure your BTFD tokens before the presale ends. Dogecoin (DOGE): ETF Optimism vs. Market Reality DOGE has fallen by 13% and is struggling below $0.20, despite growing optimism around a Dogecoin ETF. NYSE Arca has filed a 19b-4 with the SEC, aiming to launch Bitwise’s DOGE ETF, with Coinbase Custody managing holdings and Bank of New York Mellon handling cash assets. Market sentiment is heating up. Polymarket now places DOGE ETF approval odds at 67%, up from 55%. Bloomberg analysts are even more bullish, projecting a 75% chance of ETF approval by 2025. Yet, DOGE’s price has fallen by 16%, proving that ETF speculation alone isn’t enough to hold it up. For DOGE to recover, it needs to break back above $0.244 and hold $0.284—a challenge given the current market sentiment. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Critical Support Holding By a Thread SHIB is in dangerous territory, trading at $0.00001271 and teetering on losing another zero. It has breached the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, signaling heavy selling pressure. If it falls below $0.00001200, expect even more downside. One glimmer of hope? Selling volume is declining, hinting at potential “bear fatigue.” A breakout above $0.00001400 could shift momentum, but for now, SHIB remains in a precarious position. Final Verdict: BTFD Coin is the Best Crypto to Join for Long Term! Based on market trends, expert predictions, and real-world numbers, BTFD Coin is the clear winner among the best cryptos to join for long term gains. Unlike DOGE, which relies on ETF speculation, or SHIB, which is barely holding onto support, BTFD’s presale has already proven its strength. With 275% ROI at launch and 3650% moon potential, there’s simply no comparison. Time is running out. The final presale stages are almost sold out. If you want to maximize your gains and avoid market volatility, now is your shot. Don’t wait. Buy BTFD before the presale ends and join the Bulls Squad today! Get your BTFD tokens now .

Imagine a world where election outcomes are not just tallied but also immutably etched into a decentralized, transparent ledger. This isn’t a scene from a futuristic movie; it’s the reality unfolding in Tennessee, showcasing a novel approach to election security . Let’s delve into how this innovative step could redefine trust and transparency in electoral processes. Why Bitcoin for Election Security? Exploring the Blockchain Advantage When we talk about Bitcoin , we often think of digital currency and financial transactions. However, the underlying technology, blockchain, offers far more than just a platform for cryptocurrency. The Williamson County GOP’s decision to utilize the Bitcoin network highlights a fascinating and perhaps underappreciated aspect of blockchain technology: its robust security and immutability. But why Bitcoin specifically? Let’s break it down: Immutability: Once data is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This is a cornerstone of blockchain technology. Each block of data is cryptographically linked to the previous one, creating a tamper-proof chain of information. This immutability is crucial for ensuring the integrity of election results . Decentralization: The Bitcoin network is decentralized, meaning it’s not controlled by any single entity. This distributed nature makes it incredibly resistant to censorship and single points of failure. Unlike centralized databases that can be vulnerable to hacking or manipulation, the Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by a global network of nodes, enhancing its resilience. Transparency: Every transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is publicly viewable. While the content of the Williamson County GOP’s election results might not be publicly accessible in detail (depending on how they stored it), the fact that data was recorded at a specific block number (886,370) on the Bitcoin blockchain is verifiable by anyone. This inherent transparency adds a layer of accountability and trust. Security: The Bitcoin network is secured by cryptography and a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Work. This makes it extremely difficult and computationally expensive to attack or manipulate the blockchain. The security of the cryptocurrency network, designed to protect billions of dollars in value, is now being leveraged to protect something equally valuable – democratic processes. Cointelegraph reported that the Williamson County Republican leadership and board selected the immutable Bitcoin network to store the election results from their Republican National Convention election on March 4. These results were recorded on block number 886,370 on the Bitcoin blockchain. This act is a powerful example of how blockchain’s inherent features can be applied beyond finance, extending into areas like governance and civic integrity. How Does Blockchain Technology Fortify Election Integrity? To understand the significance of this move, let’s consider how blockchain technology, in general, and Bitcoin’s blockchain, in particular, can strengthen election integrity : Feature Traditional Election Systems Blockchain-Based Election Data Storage Data Immutability Vulnerable to tampering; digital records can be altered. Data is permanently recorded and cannot be changed once confirmed on the blockchain. Transparency Often opaque processes; audits can be complex and time-consuming. Transactions are publicly auditable; anyone can verify the record on the blockchain. Security Centralized systems are potential targets for cyberattacks and manipulation. Decentralized network; highly resistant to attacks due to cryptographic security and distributed nature. Auditability Audits can be subjective and require trust in central authorities. Cryptographically verifiable audit trail; enhances trust and reduces reliance on central authorities. By storing election results on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Williamson County GOP is essentially creating a permanent, verifiable, and transparent record of their election outcome. This doesn’t mean the entire voting process was on the blockchain, but rather the final results were anchored to this secure ledger. This distinction is important. It’s about using blockchain as a secure notary or timestamping service for critical data. Benefits of Bitcoin Blockchain for Securing Election Data What are the specific advantages of this approach? Let’s highlight some key benefits: Enhanced Trust: In an era where trust in institutions is often questioned, leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain can enhance public confidence in the integrity of election results. The verifiable nature of blockchain can reassure stakeholders that the data is authentic and untampered with. Reduced Risk of Manipulation: The immutability and security of the blockchain significantly reduce the risk of data manipulation or fraud. Altering data on the Bitcoin blockchain is practically infeasible, offering a robust defense against malicious actors. Improved Auditability: Auditing becomes simpler and more transparent. Instead of relying solely on manual recounts or centralized logs, auditors can verify the timestamp and existence of the election results directly on the public blockchain. Innovation and Leadership: The Williamson County GOP chapter is demonstrating leadership and innovation by exploring cutting-edge technology to improve their processes. This move could inspire other organizations, both political and non-political, to consider blockchain solutions for data security and integrity. Challenges and Considerations While the use of Bitcoin for securing election results is an exciting development, it’s important to consider potential challenges and limitations: Complexity and Understanding: Blockchain technology can be complex and not widely understood by the general public. Effective communication and education are crucial to ensure that this approach is accepted and trusted. Scalability for Large-Scale Elections: While suitable for storing election results, using the Bitcoin blockchain directly for every single vote in a large-scale national election would currently be impractical due to scalability limitations of the Bitcoin network itself. However, solutions like layer-2 networks or other blockchains designed for higher throughput might address this in the future. For now, using Bitcoin to secure the final results is a practical and valuable application. Public Perception and Misconceptions: Cryptocurrency and blockchain are still relatively new technologies, and misconceptions exist. Overcoming negative perceptions and educating the public about the benefits of blockchain for data security is essential. Cost and Technical Expertise: Implementing blockchain solutions might require initial investment in technical expertise and infrastructure. However, the long-term benefits in terms of security and trust could outweigh these costs. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin and the Future of Secure Data Management The Williamson County GOP’s initiative is a significant step towards exploring the potential of blockchain technology beyond finance. It opens up a conversation about how decentralized, immutable ledgers can be used to secure critical data in various sectors, including governance, healthcare, supply chain management, and more. This example could serve as a catalyst for further innovation and adoption of blockchain solutions for enhancing data security and transparency across diverse applications. While this particular instance involves a GOP chapter and election security , the underlying principle of using blockchain for data integrity is universally applicable. As blockchain technology matures and becomes more accessible, we can expect to see more creative and impactful uses emerge, further solidifying its role in the digital age. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Transparent Governance The decision by the Williamson County Republican Party to use the Bitcoin network to secure their election results is more than just a technological novelty; it’s a bold statement about the importance of transparency and security in democratic processes. By leveraging the immutable and decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, they’ve set a precedent for how technology can be used to build trust and ensure the integrity of critical data. This innovative approach underscores the versatility of Bitcoin and blockchain, extending its utility far beyond the realm of digital currencies. It’s a powerful reminder that the foundational principles of blockchain – security, transparency, and immutability – can be harnessed to address real-world challenges and pave the way for a more secure and trustworthy future.

41212407,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137369,1741225301,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Eric Schmidt Rejects Risky ‘Manhattan Project’ for Superintelligence AGI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/schmidt-rejects-agi-manhattan-project/,"In a stunning policy reversal that has sent ripples through the tech and crypto communities, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has publicly argued against pursuing a ‘Manhattan Project’-style approach to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This comes as a critical juncture for the future of AI development, especially considering the technology’s growing influence on cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations. Schmidt, alongside Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and Center for AI Safety Director Dan Hendrycks, released a compelling paper urging caution and a shift in strategy. Are we on the brink of an AI arms race, and what does this mean for the rapidly evolving world of digital assets? The Perils of a Superintelligence ‘Manhattan Project’ The core of Schmidt and his co-authors’ argument lies in the potential dangers of aggressively pursuing superintelligence with a ‘Manhattan Project’ mentality. Drawing parallels to the historical project that developed the atomic bomb, they caution against a concentrated, all-out effort to achieve AGI dominance. Why? Because this approach, they argue, is fraught with risks, especially in the current geopolitical landscape. Here’s a breakdown of their key concerns: Escalating International Tensions: A U.S.-led ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ could be perceived as a hostile act by other nations, particularly China, potentially triggering a dangerous AI arms race. Cyberattack Risks: Fearing a global power imbalance in superintelligence , rival nations might resort to extreme measures, including sophisticated cyberattacks, to disrupt or preemptively disable U.S. AI advancements. This could destabilize international relations and create a volatile environment. Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): Borrowing from the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) in the nuclear age, the authors introduce MAIM. This concept suggests that aggressive pursuit of superintelligence could lead to a scenario where nations proactively disable each other’s AI projects, creating a climate of distrust and potential conflict. Schmidt and his colleagues highlight that the assumption behind a ‘Manhattan Project’ – that rivals will simply accept an AI power imbalance – is fundamentally flawed and dangerously naive. They argue that history and current geopolitical realities suggest otherwise. Challenging the Status Quo: Is AI Safety Taking a Backseat? This paper directly challenges the growing sentiment, especially within U.S. policy circles, that a government-backed, intensely focused program like the ‘Manhattan Project’ is the optimal path to secure AI leadership and outcompete China. Recent statements from officials, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who explicitly referenced a ‘new Manhattan Project’ for AI, underscore this prevailing viewpoint. However, Schmidt, Wang, and Hendrycks present a compelling counter-narrative, emphasizing AI safety and global stability over a winner-take-all race. The debate essentially boils down to two contrasting approaches: Approach Proponents Key Beliefs Risks ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ Some U.S. policymakers and industry leaders Aggressive, government-led push is necessary to win the superintelligence race against China. Increased international tensions, cyberattacks, potential for AI arms race, neglecting AI safety concerns. Measured, Defensive Strategy Eric Schmidt, Alexandr Wang, Dan Hendrycks Prioritize AI safety , focus on defensive measures, deterring hostile AI development, and international cooperation. Potential for falling behind in the AI race if other nations pursue aggressive development, requires international consensus and cooperation. Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): A New Paradigm for AI Policy? The concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM) is a crucial contribution of this paper. It suggests a paradigm shift in how we think about AI safety and international AI policy. Instead of solely focusing on outpacing rivals in AI development, MAIM proposes a strategy of deterrence and proactive defense. This involves: Developing Cyberattack Capabilities: Ironically, to prevent hostile superintelligence development, the U.S. should enhance its cyberattack arsenal to be capable of disabling threatening AI projects in other nations. This is presented as a defensive measure, not an offensive one. Limiting Access to Key Resources: Restricting adversaries’ access to advanced AI chips and open-source models is another crucial element in deterring rapid and unchecked superintelligence development. This strategy is not about halting AI progress; it’s about steering it towards a safer and more stable trajectory. It acknowledges the reality of international competition but emphasizes the paramount importance of preventing catastrophic outcomes. Beyond Doomers and Ostriches: A Third Way for AGI Development Schmidt et al. cleverly categorize the existing spectrum of opinions on AI policy into two extremes: the “doomers” and the “ostriches.” Doomers: Believe AI catastrophe is inevitable and advocate for slowing down or even halting AI progress altogether. Ostriches: Advocate for rapid, unbridled AI development, essentially hoping for the best without robust safety measures or international agreements. The paper positions its proposed strategy as a “third way” – a measured and responsible approach that acknowledges both the immense potential and the significant risks of AGI . This “third way” prioritizes defensive strategies and international cooperation, moving beyond the simplistic dichotomy of acceleration versus deceleration. Schmidt’s Evolving Stance on China AI and Superintelligence What makes this paper particularly noteworthy is Schmidt’s involvement. Previously, he has been a vocal advocate for aggressive competition with China in AI. His earlier op-ed highlighting DeepSeek as a turning point in the U.S.-China AI race underscores his previous stance. This new paper signals a significant evolution in his thinking, suggesting a growing concern about the risks of unchecked superintelligence development and a potential shift towards prioritizing AI safety over outright dominance. This shift in perspective from a prominent figure like Schmidt carries considerable weight and could influence policy discussions in Washington and beyond. It highlights the increasing urgency of addressing the potential risks of AGI, even as the race to develop it intensifies. Implications for the Crypto and Tech World While not directly about cryptocurrency, this debate around AGI and AI safety is profoundly relevant to the crypto and broader tech world. AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain technology, impacting everything from cybersecurity and decentralized finance (DeFi) to the metaverse and NFT development. A global AI arms race or a catastrophic AI malfunction would have far-reaching consequences for all sectors, including the digital asset space. Therefore, understanding the nuances of AI policy, the risks of superintelligence , and the importance of AI safety is becoming increasingly crucial for anyone involved in the future of technology and finance. Schmidt’s paper serves as a vital contribution to this critical conversation, urging a more cautious and globally responsible approach to AGI development. In conclusion, the call to avoid a ‘Manhattan Project for AGI’ from influential figures like Eric Schmidt is a powerful wake-up call. It underscores the need for a nuanced, globally-minded strategy that prioritizes AI safety and international stability over a potentially perilous race for superintelligence dominance. The future of AI, and indeed the future of technology as a whole, may depend on embracing this more cautious and collaborative path.

Suntory and Sony are two Japanese giants already making moves to stave off potential fallout. While it’s unclear exactly what the US figurehead meant by accusing the Japanese and Chinese governments of “[killing] their dollar, their equivalent of the dollar, whatever,” one thing appears clear: Canada and Mexico will not be the only economies to face Trump trade war fallout. Fiat currencies worldwide are struggling, and of course, the group with the strongest military typically has the “strongest” currency. From a debt-based perspective , neither the yuan, the yen, or the USD are in a position of solvency or strength. Nonetheless, preparations are being made by Japan-based companies to fend off failure in the case of a potentially damaging new tariff. Japanese giants Suntory and Sony make provisions Reuters reports Wednesday (JST) that Japanese electronics behemoth Sony and multinational drinks company Suntory have begun building up supplies in the United States, with Sony increasing electronics and gaming division inventory. Suntory, for its part, has reportedly shipped tequila from it’s Mexico-based operations north of the border. Trump’s comments from the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Monday have only exacerbated fears, with Japan’s government denying the Asian state is “devaluing” the Japanese yen. The US president also mentioned Honda moving production of its next Civic from Mexico to Indiana in the speech, saying: “Well, Honda is coming, and I told you about Apple, that they’re going to be starting to build massively here — $500 billion.” Criticism of Japan may seem confusing at this juncture, as the nation’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has recently stated that the country will increase investment in the United States to an unprecedented $1 trillion dollars. This proclamation was made in the presence of Trump at a joint press conference following a Japan-US summit meeting in D.C in February. Ishiba also noted plans for Japanese automakers Toyota and Isuzu to build plants in America. Trump supporters shift positions Economic freedom and populist protectionism are butting heads in light of Trump’s trade rhetoric, as his mixed support base, some of whom even claim he is “libertarian,” struggle to hold their hodgepodge of mixed values in one place. On the one hand, classically liberal (libertarian) economists overwhelmingly favor free trade, as it tends to benefit everyone in an economy, due to the free flow of goods. However, nationalist interests in supporters who typically view themselves as anti-communist or fascist, have them vocally supporting the 25% trade impositions on Canada and Mexico, which interestingly may be met with even more, retaliatory tariffs, forcing companies like Honda to once again move back to Mexico or the countries they initially fled. Perhaps the most obvious explanation for the contradictory positions and confusing opposition to Japanese interests by Trump, is one that is age old: he’s just playing politics. Unfortunately, the fallout from such games is measured in real people’s lost livelihoods and even lives, when trade wars erupt into armed conflict. And even if Japan is not directly targeted with tariffs, it’s important to note that in a global economy, Mexico and Canada being slammed will still make things much harder for businesses with ties to those zones. Whatever may unfold, Japanese businesses are on guard, with Reuters quoting senior Oxford Economics economist Norihiro Yamaguchi as emphasizing: “Corporates are now more aware that Japan could also be a target.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

41212409,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137371,1741225352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Relief for Miners: US Government Unleashes Seized Bitcoin Mining Hardware,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-government-seized-bitcoin-miners/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency mining community, the U.S. government has started to release a portion of the Bitcoin miners it had previously seized. This news, first reported by Reuters, brings a sense of relief to many in the industry who have been closely following the saga of these detained machines. But what exactly happened, why were these Bitcoin miners seized in the first place, and what does this release mean for the future of crypto mining? Let’s dive into the details. Why Were Bitcoin Miners Seized by the US Government? Late last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), acting on the request of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), initiated a series of seizures targeting Chinese Bitcoin miners at various ports of entry across the United States. The crackdown reportedly led to the seizure of up to 10,000 units of crypto mining hardware . But what prompted such drastic action? Here’s a breakdown of the likely reasons behind the seizures: FCC Regulations: The FCC is responsible for regulating interstate and international communications. It’s plausible that the seized Bitcoin miners were flagged for potential violations of FCC regulations. This could range from issues with equipment certification to concerns about electromagnetic interference. National Security Concerns: While less explicitly stated, national security concerns often play a role in government actions, especially concerning technology imports. There might have been worries about the origin or functionality of these specific units, prompting a closer inspection. Trade Policy and Tariffs: The timing of the seizures coincided with ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. While not directly confirmed, trade policy considerations could have indirectly influenced the scrutiny applied to these imports. Compliance Checks: Routine customs checks can sometimes uncover discrepancies or issues with imported goods. It’s possible that these seizures were part of a broader effort to ensure compliance with import regulations. Release of Seized Bitcoin Miners: A Turning Point? The recent news of the U.S. government releasing some of these seized Bitcoin miners marks a significant development. While details remain somewhat sparse regarding the exact number of units being released or the specific reasons for this change of course, it signals a potential shift in approach. What could be behind this release? Resolution of Regulatory Issues: It’s possible that the companies importing these miners have successfully addressed the FCC’s concerns. This could involve providing necessary certifications, demonstrating compliance, or reaching agreements on specific issues. Re-evaluation of Seizure Justification: Perhaps upon further review, the government agencies involved reassessed the initial grounds for seizure and concluded that releasing some or all of the units was appropriate. Economic Considerations: Prolonged detention of goods can have economic implications for businesses and supply chains. Releasing the miners could be a pragmatic decision to mitigate potential economic disruptions. Diplomatic Factors: International relations and diplomatic considerations might also play a role in such decisions, although this is more speculative without further information. Impact on Crypto Mining Hardware and the Market The release of US government Bitcoin miners, even if it’s a partial release, could have several implications for the cryptocurrency market and the crypto mining hardware industry: Increased Hashrate Potential: These released miners, once operational, will contribute to the overall Bitcoin network hashrate. This could lead to increased network security and potentially faster transaction processing times, although the impact of a few thousand miners on the massive Bitcoin network might be incremental. Boost for Mining Companies: For the companies that own these miners, their release represents a significant win. It allows them to deploy previously stranded assets and resume or expand their mining operations. This can directly impact their profitability and operational capacity. Market Sentiment: The news could be interpreted as a positive signal for the crypto industry. It might suggest a more nuanced or even softening stance from the U.S. government towards crypto mining, although this interpretation needs to be approached cautiously. Supply Chain Dynamics: The episode highlights the complexities of international trade and regulatory compliance for the Bitcoin regulations and crypto mining sector. It underscores the importance of navigating these regulations effectively to avoid disruptions. Navigating Bitcoin Regulations: Actionable Insights This situation provides valuable lessons for businesses operating in the cryptocurrency mining space, particularly concerning international trade and regulatory compliance. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Regulatory Compliance: Thoroughly understand and adhere to all relevant regulations, especially those pertaining to import/export, communications equipment, and technology standards in your target markets. Due Diligence in Supply Chains: Conduct rigorous due diligence on your supply chains, especially when sourcing equipment from overseas. Ensure that suppliers and manufacturers comply with all applicable regulations. Maintain Open Communication with Authorities: Establish and maintain open lines of communication with relevant regulatory bodies. Proactive engagement can help address potential issues before they escalate into seizures or other disruptions. Seek Expert Legal Counsel: Engage legal experts specializing in international trade, customs law, and cryptocurrency regulations. Professional guidance is crucial for navigating the complex legal landscape. Diversify Operational Locations: Consider diversifying your mining operations geographically to mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions in specific jurisdictions. In conclusion, the release of some seized Bitcoin miners by the U.S. government is a noteworthy development in the ongoing interaction between cryptocurrency and regulatory bodies. While the full implications are still unfolding, it serves as a reminder of the dynamic and evolving nature of the crypto landscape. Staying informed, proactive, and compliant is paramount for navigating this exciting yet complex industry.

41212530,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137377,1741225495,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding Crucial SEC Crypto Task Force Discussions on Crypto Regulation with WisdomTree,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-task-force-wisdomtree/,"In a significant move signaling proactive engagement in the evolving digital asset landscape, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Crypto Task Force convened a meeting with representatives from WisdomTree Digital Management and its affiliates on March 5. This crucial discussion, as detailed in the SEC’s official meeting log, centered on navigating the complex terrain of crypto regulation . For those invested in the future of cryptocurrency and digital assets, understanding these regulatory developments is paramount. Let’s delve into what this meeting signifies and what aspects of crypto regulation were brought to the table. Why is the SEC Crypto Task Force Meeting with WisdomTree Important for Crypto Regulation? The fact that the SEC Crypto Task Force is actively engaging with key players like WisdomTree underscores the agency’s commitment to establishing a clear regulatory framework for the burgeoning crypto industry. WisdomTree, a prominent asset manager, has been increasingly involved in the digital asset space, particularly with its interest in exchange-traded products (ETPs) for cryptocurrencies. This meeting is not just a procedural formality; it’s a vital dialogue to shape the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. Here’s why this interaction matters: Proactive Regulatory Approach: The SEC’s Crypto Task Force proactively seeking discussions demonstrates a move towards informed regulation rather than reactive enforcement. This is a positive sign for the industry, suggesting a collaborative approach to understanding and addressing the nuances of crypto assets. Industry Input: WisdomTree’s participation allows the SEC to gain direct insights from industry experts actively working within the crypto space. This real-world perspective is invaluable for crafting effective and practical regulations. Focus on Key Issues: The meeting agenda itself highlights the SEC’s priorities in crypto regulation , including operational aspects of tokenized funds, in-kind transactions for digital asset ETPs, and the application of broker-dealer net capital rules to crypto assets. These are critical areas that need clarity for the crypto market to mature and attract broader institutional adoption. Unpacking the Agenda: What Aspects of Crypto Regulation Were Discussed? The meeting agenda provides a window into the specific regulatory challenges and considerations currently at the forefront of the SEC’s attention regarding crypto regulation . Let’s break down each key point: 1. Operational Aspects of Tokenized Funds Tokenized funds represent a novel approach to investment vehicles, leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalize ownership and enhance accessibility. However, their operational mechanics raise several regulatory questions: Custody and Security: How are tokenized funds securely custodied? What measures are in place to protect investors from theft or loss of digital assets? Valuation and Transparency: How are these funds valued, and how is transparency maintained for investors, especially given the volatility of underlying crypto assets? Compliance with Existing Fund Regulations: Do existing investment fund regulations adequately cover tokenized funds, or are new rules needed? Discussions on these operational aspects are crucial for ensuring investor protection and market integrity within the evolving landscape of tokenized investments. 2. In-Kind Transactions for Digital Asset ETPs In-kind transactions, where investors can create or redeem ETP shares using the underlying assets (in this case, digital assets) rather than cash, are a significant feature of many commodity and now potentially crypto ETPs. However, for digital asset ETFs , this raises unique questions: Market Manipulation Concerns: Could in-kind transactions in the volatile crypto market be more susceptible to manipulation? Valuation and Liquidity of Underlying Assets: How are the digital assets used in in-kind transactions valued, and is there sufficient liquidity in the underlying crypto markets to support these transactions without market disruption? Tax Implications: What are the tax implications of in-kind transactions involving cryptocurrencies for both ETP providers and investors? Addressing these complexities is essential for the SEC to confidently approve and oversee digital asset ETFs that utilize in-kind transaction mechanisms. 3. Application of Broker-Dealer Net Capital Rules to Crypto Assets Broker-dealer net capital rules are designed to ensure that financial firms maintain sufficient liquid assets to cover their liabilities and protect customer funds. Applying these rules to firms dealing with crypto assets presents new challenges: Valuation of Crypto Assets for Net Capital Calculation: How should volatile crypto assets be valued when calculating a broker-dealer’s net capital? Should haircuts (reductions in value) be applied, and if so, at what rate? Custody and Control of Crypto Assets: How does the custody and control of crypto assets by broker-dealers impact net capital requirements? Are existing custody solutions sufficient for regulatory purposes? Operational Risks Specific to Crypto: Do the unique operational risks associated with crypto, such as cybersecurity threats and private key management, necessitate adjustments to net capital rules? Clear guidelines on applying broker-dealer net capital rules to crypto assets are vital for fostering a secure and stable market environment, especially as institutional involvement in crypto increases. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation and Digital Asset ETFs? The meeting between the SEC Crypto Task Force and WisdomTree is a strong indicator that regulatory dialogue is actively underway. It suggests that the SEC is taking a measured and informed approach to crafting crypto regulation , engaging with industry participants to understand the nuances and challenges. This is particularly encouraging for the prospects of digital asset ETFs in the U.S. As the SEC grapples with the complexities of tokenized funds, in-kind transactions, and broker-dealer rules in the context of crypto, these discussions pave the way for: Clearer Regulatory Guidelines: Industry stakeholders can anticipate more specific and tailored regulations for crypto assets, reducing uncertainty and fostering innovation. Potential for Digital Asset ETF Approval: Addressing the regulatory hurdles around operational aspects, in-kind transactions, and net capital rules is crucial for the eventual approval of spot digital asset ETFs in the U.S., which many believe will unlock significant institutional capital for the crypto market. Increased Market Confidence: Proactive engagement from regulators and a clear regulatory framework can boost investor confidence in the crypto market, leading to greater participation and maturity. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Crypto Regulation The SEC Crypto Task Force ‘s meeting with WisdomTree is more than just a procedural step; it’s a crucial dialogue that underscores the ongoing evolution of crypto regulation . By addressing critical issues such as tokenized funds, in-kind transactions, and broker-dealer rules, the SEC is actively working towards a regulatory framework that can accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets while safeguarding investors and maintaining market integrity. For participants in the crypto space, these developments are vital to watch, as they will significantly shape the future trajectory of the industry and the accessibility of digital asset ETFs and other crypto investment products. The engagement signals a move towards a more defined and navigable regulatory environment, which is ultimately beneficial for the long-term growth and stability of the cryptocurrency market.

Notably, cryptocurrency miners are high-powered computers that compete to solve tricky math problems. This process helps maintain the blockchain, the tech behind digital currencies, and miners are rewarded with new cryptocurrency. “Thousands of mining units have been released,” said Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, a cryptocurrency equipment broker. Notably, at one point, up to 10,000 units were stuck at various U.S. ports. He also mentioned that some officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seemed to be against bitcoin mining and made life difficult for the industry. According to Blockspace, U.S. Customs and the Federal Communications Commission began seizing certain bitcoin mining equipment late last year. Notably, some of the machines might have been held back because they contained chips from Sophgo, a Chinese chip company that is restricted from trade. The release of an unspecified amount of cryptocurrency mining equipment is happening during a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, particularly due to the ongoing trade war and security concerns that have been raised by U.S. authorities. These concerns have been present since the later months of the Biden administration. Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor Technology, noted that while some of the seized shipments are now being returned, the majority of them remain held. Both Vera and Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, shared that authorities had cited concerns about radio frequency emissions from the mining machines, which they dismissed, suggesting that the machines’ emissions were not a real issue. This situation is part of a broader context of the U.S. government’s scrutiny of Chinese-made technology, especially in sectors like telecommunications and computing. The U.S. has expressed security worries about foreign-made equipment, particularly from Chinese companies, fearing that they could be used for espionage or other malicious activities. As a result, the government has been imposing restrictions on certain tech imports, and these concerns have extended to cryptocurrency mining equipment as well.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 01:45:14

One crucial tool investors use to gauge market sentiment is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Recently, this index showed a slight uptick, offering a glimmer of hope amidst persistent uncertainty. But what does this rise really mean, and why is the market still gripped by ‘Extreme Fear’? Let’s dive deep into the latest readings and understand the undercurrents shaping the crypto landscape. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of Alternative.me, is designed to measure the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’, suggesting investors are overly worried and potentially leading to undervaluation of assets. Conversely, a score of 100 signals ‘Extreme Greed’, hinting at a possible market bubble due to irrational exuberance. As of March 6th, the index stands at 25. While this is a five-point increase from the previous day, it firmly remains within the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This indicates that despite some positive shifts, a significant portion of the market remains cautious and apprehensive. Decoding the Metrics: What Drives the Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a calculated metric that takes into account a blend of six different market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final index score, providing a holistic view of market sentiment. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. High volatility often correlates with fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current market momentum and trading volume against recent averages. Strong momentum can indicate growing greed, while weak momentum might suggest fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for hashtags related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Positive sentiment contributes to greed, while negative sentiment fuels fear. Surveys (15%): Conducts polls and surveys on crypto platforms to directly gauge investor sentiment. These surveys provide a direct pulse on whether investors are feeling fearful or greedy. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful times, as investors prefer the perceived stability of Bitcoin over altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Increased search interest can sometimes correlate with greed, while declining interest might suggest fear or apathy. Why Does Market Fear Persist Despite a Slight Index Rise? The recent five-point increase in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a positive signal, but it’s crucial to understand why ‘Extreme Fear’ still dominates. Several factors could be at play: Lingering Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions, continue to cast a shadow over all markets, including crypto. This macroeconomic uncertainty fuels investor anxiety. Recent Market Corrections: The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant corrections in recent months. These downturns can leave lasting psychological impacts, making investors hesitant to jump back in aggressively, even with slight positive indicators. Regulatory Scrutiny: Ongoing regulatory discussions and actions around the world can create uncertainty and fear within the crypto market. Unclear regulatory landscapes can make investors wary of potential risks. Bearish Market Sentiment: Prolonged periods of negative price action can create a self-reinforcing cycle of fear. Investors who have experienced losses may be more risk-averse and prone to selling during rallies, further dampening sentiment. Navigating Extreme Fear: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals ‘Extreme Fear’? Here are some actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Periods of extreme fear can be opportune times to employ a DCA strategy. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of price. This can help mitigate risk and potentially capitalize on lower prices over time. Due Diligence and Research: Fear can sometimes lead to panic selling and undervaluation of fundamentally strong projects. Use this time to conduct thorough research on cryptocurrencies you believe in. Identify projects with solid fundamentals, strong teams, and real-world use cases. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Adopting a long-term investment perspective can help you weather short-term fluctuations and avoid emotional decision-making driven by fear. Risk Management: ‘Extreme Fear’ periods highlight the importance of sound risk management. Ensure your portfolio is diversified, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Keep abreast of market developments and news, but be discerning about the information you consume. Avoid being swayed by fear-mongering headlines and focus on credible sources and fundamental analysis. The Path Ahead: Will Greed Return to the Crypto Market? The slight rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a sliver of optimism, suggesting that the extreme bearishness might be easing slightly. However, the market is still firmly in ‘Extreme Fear’. Whether and when we’ll see a shift towards greed depends on a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, technological advancements in the crypto space, and broader investor adoption. For now, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable reminder of the emotional currents driving the market. Understanding these emotions, and acting rationally rather than reacting emotionally, is key to navigating the exciting yet often turbulent world of cryptocurrency investment.

41212532,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137381,1741225550,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Exclusion: Cardano’s Hoskinson Snubbed from White House Crypto Summit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hoskinson-cardano-white-house-summit/,"In a rather shocking turn of events, Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, finds himself excluded from the upcoming White House Crypto Summit. This news, first reported by Unchained, raises eyebrows and sparks questions within the cryptocurrency community. Why would a prominent figure in the crypto space, especially one associated with a major blockchain like Cardano, be left out of such a crucial policy discussion? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential implications of this intriguing development. Charles Hoskinson Excluded: What Happened at the White House Crypto Summit? According to a White House source cited by Unchained, Charles Hoskinson did not receive an invitation to the highly anticipated White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 7th. This revelation is particularly noteworthy given Hoskinson’s significant role in the cryptocurrency industry as the co-founder of Cardano and his vocal advocacy for blockchain technology. The source stated plainly, “They are not involved in anything about trying to influence policy.” This blunt statement suggests a deliberate decision to exclude Hoskinson from the summit, raising questions about the criteria for invitation and the White House’s approach to engaging with the diverse crypto ecosystem. Here’s a quick rundown of what we know: The Exclusion: Charles Hoskinson, a key figure in Cardano and the broader crypto space, was not invited to the White House Crypto Summit. Source of the News: Unchained, citing a White House source, broke the story. Reason for Exclusion (Alleged): The White House source indicated that Hoskinson and potentially Cardano are not seen as relevant to policy influence. Summit Date: The White House Crypto Summit is scheduled for March 7th. The Cardano Paradox: Trump’s Crypto Reserve Claim vs. Summit Snub Adding another layer of intrigue to this situation is a past statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Trump had previously mentioned Cardano’s native token, ADA , as a potential component of a crypto reserve. This public acknowledgement from a prominent political figure seemed to indicate a level of recognition, if not endorsement, of Cardano and ADA within certain political circles. However, Hoskinson’s exclusion from the White House Crypto Summit appears to directly contradict this notion. This discrepancy begs the question: Is there a disconnect between different parts of the U.S. political landscape regarding cryptocurrency? Or does this exclusion signal a shift in perspective, downplaying the significance of Cardano and ADA in the broader crypto policy discussion? Crypto Policy and the Missing Voice: What Does Hoskinson’s Absence Mean? The White House Crypto Summit is intended to be a forum for discussing and shaping crypto policy in the United States. The exclusion of Charles Hoskinson, a figure with years of experience in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, raises concerns about the comprehensiveness and inclusivity of these policy discussions. Hoskinson has been a vocal advocate for sensible crypto regulation and has often engaged in public discourse on the future of blockchain technology. His absence could mean a missed opportunity to incorporate diverse perspectives and expertise into the policymaking process. Potential Implications of Hoskinson’s Exclusion on Crypto Policy Discussions: Limited Perspective: Excluding key figures may lead to a narrower range of viewpoints being considered during policy formulation. Missed Expertise: Hoskinson’s deep understanding of blockchain technology and its potential applications could have been valuable for policymakers. Industry Perception: The exclusion might be perceived negatively by some within the crypto industry, potentially signaling a less inclusive approach to crypto regulation. Focus on Specific Agendas: The summit’s agenda might be skewed towards certain narratives or interests if diverse voices are not represented. White House Crypto Summit: Who’s In and What’s on the Agenda? While Charles Hoskinson’s absence is notable, it’s important to consider the broader context of the White House Crypto Summit . Although details about the specific agenda and list of attendees are still emerging, such summits typically aim to bring together government officials, industry leaders, and experts to discuss the current state of the cryptocurrency landscape and the path forward for regulation. The focus is often on topics such as consumer protection, financial stability, national security, and innovation within the digital asset space. It remains to be seen who *is* included in the summit and what specific issues will be prioritized. However, the exclusion of a prominent figure like Hoskinson does prompt questions about the White House’s priorities and its understanding of the diverse and decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency industry. Cardano’s Future Unaffected? Navigating the Regulatory Landscape Despite Charles Hoskinson’s exclusion from the White House event, Cardano continues to be a significant player in the blockchain space. The project boasts a robust community, ongoing development, and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). While policy discussions at summits like the White House Crypto Summit can influence the regulatory landscape, the fundamental technology and utility of Cardano are independent of these political dynamics. Cardano’s Strengths and Resilience: Technological Innovation: Cardano is known for its peer-reviewed research and focus on secure and scalable blockchain solutions. Strong Community: Cardano has a large and active global community of developers and users. Decentralization: As a decentralized blockchain, Cardano’s operations are not controlled by any single entity or government. Growing Ecosystem: The Cardano ecosystem is expanding with new dApps and projects being launched regularly. Ultimately, while Hoskinson’s exclusion from the summit is a noteworthy development, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency industry is dynamic and multifaceted. The success and adoption of projects like Cardano will likely be determined by a range of factors, including technological advancements, community engagement, and real-world utility, in addition to navigating the evolving regulatory environment. Conclusion: An Intriguing Snub and its Ripple Effects The exclusion of Charles Hoskinson from the White House Crypto Summit is undoubtedly an intriguing development that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community. Whether it’s a deliberate snub, a policy oversight, or a reflection of evolving political dynamics, the absence of a prominent voice like Hoskinson’s from a key policy discussion is certainly noteworthy. It raises important questions about inclusivity, perspective, and the future direction of crypto regulation in the United States. As the White House Crypto Summit unfolds, the industry will be watching closely to see what policies are discussed and whose voices are ultimately heard.

The platform at Mikybull Crypto detected historical similar patterns from when Ethereum broke out in February 2024 shortly before the 300% price jump occurred. A substantial number of investors currently embrace Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its ongoing second presale phase because of its decentralized lending platform. Despite Ethereum’s previous price swings from $1,400 to $80 levels before reaching $4,800 in 2021 only to drop 80% below its peak, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts notice through its structured tokenomics system along with strong presale performance which has surpassed $2.1 million at $0.015 per token. Ethereum’s Volatile Ascent The fundamental technology of Ethereum demonstrates the ongoing battle between recent bullish traits and its previous substantial weaknesses. The asset price maintains its position around $3,200 while experts predict that breaking through this threshold would drive it to reach $5,600. Mikybull Crypto’s analysts discovered identical market trends before an enormous price increase in February 2024. The potential conditions indicate Ethereum can raise its value to $15,000 by 2025. The periodic market volatility of Ethereum has produced multiple booms and busts which make investors anxious about future fluctuations. This latest rally highlights a potential problem because the preceding 16% monthly drop reveals how cryptocurrency markets face sudden downturns which demand investment in modern innovative stable assets. Mutuum Finance’s Calculated Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has adopted a DeFi protocol design to unite lending features with overtly managed token demand while offering its services to capital markets. From Phase 2 of MUTM’s presale investors have acquired 4000 addresses while Phase 2 tokens sell for $0.015 and Phase 3 will be priced at $0.02. The first participants who invest will receive a 300% return when MUTM lists at $0.06 but projection models extend even beyond that timeframe. Experts indicate that platform revenue passes through a buy-and-distribute mechanism which acquires MUTM tokens before distributing them among stakers for continued market demand. The model hardened by overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer features establishes the main attraction of the system. Presale Surge and Tokenomics The protocol succeeded in rapidly attracting investors during its presale phase because of growing market confidence. Phase 2 started at $0.015 entry point which enabled the project to reach $2.1 million in funding while Phase 1 experienced a rapid sellout. Starting at launch price Tokenomics ensures a 4x increase but the analysis after listing reveals potential for the token to reach $2.40 during 2025 which represents a 15900% upside versus present value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) implements mtTokens to create value through accumulating interest since these tokens provide liquidity between different platforms. Users can earn more valuable mtETH tokens by putting their ETH into deposits which users can then freely trade due to their growing worth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents particular methods to counteract crypto volatility even though Ethereum’s technological indicators forecast market appreciation. The lending system at Mutuum Finance depends on overcollateralized loans that require borrowers to pledge assets worth more than the loan amount while working with adjustable interest rates to protect lenders while giving borrowers flexibility. The presale utility attracts participants through a $100,000 giveaway scheme that distributes $10,000 each to 10 investors. The price movement of MUTM depends entirely on user adoption and revenue-based buy pressure rather than market sentiments like Ethereum faces. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes beyond speculative hype to show significant practical project achievements. The presales activity at high velocity and 3900 individual holders prove that the project possesses real market demand which is uncommon for new projects. MUTM token buyers should act swiftly given that future price increases combined with upcoming exchange listings make purchasing tokens for $0.015 more challenging than ever. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers an appealing investment option to those investors looking for controlled entry points coupled with systemic demand creation since Ethereum maintains unquestionable potential. Crypto markets function by supporting stories where Ethereum’s comeback headlines compete against Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which brings forth an investable narrative with extensive risks. The presale results combined with utility-based structure and deflationary token operations of MUTM distinguish itself from Ethereum by relying on market-wide trends. The Phase 2 launch of MUTM allows users to find stability in DeFi’s upcoming advancement that rewards investors through controlled growth instead of uncertain market swings. As Ethereum eyes $7,200, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly charts a course toward redefining value itself.

Interestingly, a crypto analyst on TradingView has highlighted this price support as a make-or-break level for PEPE, suggesting that a breakout above this zone could spark a 400% rally toward $0.0001. This outlook comes after a particularly challenging week for the entire crypto market, during which PEPE extended its losses and dropped to its lowest price point in months. This Level To Trigger 400% Move For PEPE Technical analysis shows that PEPE’s upward trajectory hinges on a bounce at support around $0.00000650. This interesting analysis was highlighted by a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform using the PEPE weekly candlestick timeframe chart. Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise This support level comes into play in light of PEPE’s extended decline since the beginning of the year. Interestingly, technical analysis shows that the decline looks like a repeating pattern of the meme coin’s price action in 2024. The ongoing correction stems from PEPE’s peak price of $0.00002803 in December 2024, which the analyst termed the third drive. Notably, earlier first and second drives in 2024 were also each accompanied by a correction phase after rallies. Interestingly, the meme coin has shown signs of life in the past 24 hours with a push above this support level and climbing into the $0.000007 range. However, the uptrend could not be defined yet, and the crypto analyst noted that any uptrend will depend on how PEPE reacts with a crucial resistance zone between $0.00001150 and $0.00001200. This level has previously acted as support but has now turned into resistance. Therefore, a weekly close above this zone would confirm a bullish breakout and a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. Price Targets If The Meme Coin Breaks Above Resistance A break above $0.00001200 would cement a breakout with more momentum for PEPE. Such a breakout would mark the first bullish catalyst in a while, confirm momentum, and lead to increased buy-side pressure with an aggressive upward move. From here, the next resistance levels are projected to be around $0.00001700 to $0.00002200. A move to $0.00002200 will most likely cascade into more momentum above its current all-time high of $0.00002803. Related Reading: PEPE Flashes Reversal Signal To Recoup The 800 EMA, What This Means For Price The analyst further predicted a price target of $0.0001, provided the bullish momentum sustains itself. However, failure to close above the key resistance level at $0.00001200 could result in a continued downtrend, with PEPE possibly retesting lower support zones around $0.00000650 to $0.00000550. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.000007239, up by 4.4% in the past 24 hours. PEPE’s ability to sustain such an upward trajectory would depend on broader market conditions for Bitcoin and other large market cap cryptocurrencies.

Excitement is building as Grayscale moves forward with its application for a dedicated Cardano ETF under the ticker “GADA” on NYSE Arca. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) is flashing bullish signals, with analysts predicting a potential 16% increase as buying activity picks up. While these established projects aim for new highs, Web3Bay is making headlines for its mission to reshape digital asset trading. With tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) becoming more common and NFTs maturing beyond collectibles, Web3Bay is stepping up to create a next-generation marketplace. This platform aims to connect digital creators, buyers, and asset owners in a seamless ecosystem that could challenge OpenSea’s dominance. Web3Bay: The Future of Digital Asset Trading in 2025 Web3Bay is setting its sights on becoming the go-to marketplace for digital assets, much like Amazon has for e-commerce. By creating a direct and transparent marketplace, it brings together creators, investors, and collectors in one space. With RWAs gaining mainstream traction and NFTs evolving into more functional assets, Web3Bay is building a framework that supports secure and efficient trading. One of Web3Bay’s key strengths is its ability to support NFT applications beyond art and collectibles. The platform is structured to handle digital tickets, memberships, and virtual assets, tapping into the growing demand for real-world applications of blockchain technology. As physical assets like real estate and luxury goods get tokenized, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a hub where buyers and sellers can interact without unnecessary intermediaries. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale is in its 5th stage, with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524. The project has already raised $1.6 million, showing strong backing from early adopters. Upcoming integrations, including PayPal support, signal a push toward mainstream adoption, making this a prime time for investors to get involved before the platform scales. Could a Cardano ETF Take ADA to the Next Level? The anticipation around a potential Cardano ETF is growing as Grayscale files for a dedicated investment product under the ticker “GADA.” If approved, this move would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to ADA without directly managing crypto assets. The fund’s structure includes Coinbase Custody Trust Company as custodian and BNY Mellon as administrator, adding credibility to the proposal. Following the ETF announcement, ADA jumped by 14.38%, hitting $0.8051. Looking ahead, CoinCodex predicts that ADA could climb to $1.900281 in 2025. The community is closely watching the SEC’s decision, as an approval could attract fresh capital and further boost adoption. Will XLM Hit $0.4292? Analysts Weigh In Crypto analyst Ali Martinez sees a potential 16% surge in XLM’s price, pointing to an inverted head and shoulders pattern forming on Stellar’s 4-hour chart. This pattern often signals a reversal from a downward trend, suggesting that a breakout may be on the horizon. Currently, XLM is trading around $0.32, with a key resistance level at $0.37. If this level is breached, the price could rise toward $0.4292, as projected. Despite a 26.6% decline over the last month, Stellar’s network activity is showing strong recovery signals. The number of active addresses has hit a record 9 million, while over $32.54 million worth of XLM has been withdrawn from exchanges, indicating accumulation by long-term holders. Open Interest (OI) has also risen by 3.82%, showing that traders are positioning themselves for a potential breakout. Wrapping Up A potential Cardano ETF could give ADA the push it needs to break through key resistance levels, while Stellar’s technical patterns suggest a possible rally to $0.4292. Both projects offer compelling reasons to watch closely, but Web3Bay is presenting a different kind of opportunity. With its focus on RWAs, NFTs, and a seamless marketplace model, Web3Bay is aiming to redefine digital asset trading. As it continues its presale, currently in Stage 5 with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524, early investors could find themselves well-positioned as the platform gains traction.

As reported by Reuters on Mar. 6, the move, which grants a one-month exemption for U.S. automakers, eased concerns that the trade war could damage domestic manufacturing and weighed on the dollar, fueling demand for risk assets like crypto. The decision came after Trump met with executives from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Investors see the delay as an indication that tariffs may not cause as much economic disruption as anticipated. According to the price tracker on crypto.news, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is currently trading at $91,651, up 5% over the last 24 hours. The broader crypto market also advanced, gaining 2% amid improved risk sentiment. Although it is still in the “Extreme Fear” zone, the Fear and Greed Index increased 5 points to 25, indicating that investors are still being cautious. Crypto-related stocks also saw significant gains, with Coinbase (COIN) rising 4% and MicroStrategy (MSTR) jumping 12%%. At the same time, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell to its lowest level since November, historically a bullish signal for Bitcoin.

As confidence in XRP wavers, Web3Bay continues to gain traction, raising over $1.6 million in its presale as investors seek assets with stronger long-term potential. With XRP slipping and Web3Bay gaining momentum, many are asking: Could Web3Bay be the more reliable choice amid crypto market fluctuations? XRP’s $350 Million Decline Sparks Investor Concerns XRP has been hit hard, shedding more than 7% of its value as it struggles to hold key support levels. This steep sell-off comes as part of a larger crypto downturn, with Bitcoin dipping below $90,000 and Ethereum struggling to maintain its $2,500 support. Market uncertainty has been compounded by the recent collapse of the LIBRA project and the $1.6 billion Bybit hack, creating widespread caution among investors. Data from on-chain analytics shows that XRP’s market cap suffered a $350 million reduction, leaving traders on edge. Analysts warn that if XRP fails to break back above its resistance zone, the asset could face more downside pressure, potentially testing the $1.80 range in the near future. Web3Bay’s $1.6 Million Presale Success Defies Market Trends While XRP battles volatility, Web3Bay continues to capture attention with its impressive presale momentum. Investors looking for stable, high-growth opportunities are turning to Web3Bay, which has now surpassed $1.6 million in funding, demonstrating strong demand for projects with practical applications. Web3Bay is not just another token; it is designed as a decentralized e-commerce solution aimed at reshaping online transactions. By cutting out middlemen, lowering transaction fees, and giving users full control over purchases, Web3Bay presents a clear use case that sets it apart from speculative assets. Unlike XRP, which is heavily influenced by regulatory uncertainties and shifting market sentiment, Web3Bay operates on a model that directly ties its value to real-world adoption. This has made it one of the fastest-growing crypto presales of 2025, with over 390 million tokens already sold. Web3Bay vs. XRP—Which Crypto Holds Greater Potential? One of the key concerns for XRP holders is its struggle to maintain consistent momentum. Despite occasional price spikes, XRP remains highly dependent on external factors such as institutional interest and regulatory decisions. Web3Bay, on the other hand, offers a more structured investment opportunity. Unlike XRP, which relies on market speculation, Web3Bay’s value is driven by adoption in the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. The project’s presale structure also provides a predictable growth path, ensuring that early investors benefit from progressive price increases. Currently, 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.004562, and investors who secure their holdings now stand to benefit significantly. With projections indicating potential returns exceeding 4,200%, Web3Bay presents an alternative that combines utility with high-growth potential. Final Thoughts—Which Crypto Stands Out? As XRP faces a steep decline and overall market volatility remains high, investors are seeking safer and more rewarding opportunities. Web3Bay has positioned itself as a leading option, proving that projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications continue to attract smart investors, even in uncertain times. While XRP may regain its footing, its unpredictable nature makes it a riskier bet compared to Web3Bay’s structured growth model. With $1.6 million already raised and investor interest continuing to rise, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the top crypto opportunities of 2025. With the next presale price increase approaching, the question remains: Will you secure your Web3Bay tokens now or miss out on what could be one of the biggest opportunities in the market?

Gox Moves $1 Billion in Bitcoin Amid Market Turmoil and New Tariffs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mt. Gox, the bankrupt crypto exchange, has started moving Bitcoin again. As per a latest update from Arkham Intelligence, on March 6, 12,000 BTC, worth over $1 billion, was transferred from its wallet (1PuQB), with a transaction fee was just $1.64. At the same time another 166.5 BTC, worth around $15 million, was sent to Mt. Gox’s cold wallet (1Jbez). The remaining Bitcoin was moved to an unknown wallet (1Mo1n), which now holds 11,834 BTC. ARKHAM ALERT: MT GOX MOVING $1B $BTC pic.twitter.com/VpIkHdJQkl — Arkham (@arkham) March 6, 2025 Mt. Gox-linked accounts now hold 36,080 BTC, worth around $3.26 billion, according to Arkham data. This is the first major Bitcoin move from Mt. Gox wallets in a month. The last transfer was only 4 BTC between cold wallets. It’s unclear what the recent transaction was for. In December, Mt. Gox moved about 1,620 BTC through unknown wallets, just two weeks after transferring over 24,000 BTC. The Bitcoin move happened during a week of market ups and downs, caused by new trade tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump, which began on March 4. These tariffs shook high-risk assets like crypto. Bitcoin’s price fluctuated a lot, going from a high of $94,770 on March 3, to a low of $82,681 on March 4. By March 5, Bitcoin had bounced back to over $90,000. New Repayment Deadline Mt. Gox, founded in 2010, quickly grew to become the largest bitcoin exchange by 2013, handling 70% of global bitcoin trades. However, in early 2014, it stopped withdrawals and trading. The platform shut down soon after, and the company filed for bankruptcy, losing over 800,000 BTC. Thousands of creditors are still waiting for their bitcoin to be returned. In October 2024, Mt. Gox announced a new repayment deadline of October 31, 2025.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ARKM|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 03:02:20

The battle between traditional government-issued currencies and cryptocurrency reshapes the financial ecosystem. This is forcing individuals, businesses, and policymakers to rethink the very nature of money itself. While fiat currencies have ruled for centuries under government control, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are challenging this monopoly, presenting a borderless, censorship-resistant alternative. But are cryptocurrencies the future of finance, or do they remain a speculative asset vulnerable to volatility and regulatory crackdowns? This article breaks down the core differences between crypto and fiat, looking at their impact on economic stability, inflation, security, and global adoption. Origin and Control: Who’s in Charge? The key difference between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies is who controls them. Fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR), are government-issued and centrally regulated. Their supply is controlled through monetary policies, such as interest rate adjustments and money printing. Fiat currencies also have unlimited supplies, as governments can print more m… The post Cryptocurrency vs. Government Currency: What’s the Difference? appeared first on Coin Edition .",Learn|News|Cryptocurrency 101,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-03-06 03:26:18

XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has formed a bullish cup-and-handle price action pattern in the four-hour timeframe and is on the verge of a breakout. Amid ongoing price fluctuations, the price has reached the neckline of the pattern. Based on recent price action and historical trends, if the asset breaks out of the pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $2.55 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 12% to reach the $2.83 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View However, the neckline of the pattern coincides with the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in the same timeframe, which also acts as a resistance level. Current Price Momentum XRP is currently trading near $2.52, having registered a modest gain of 1.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 45%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. $13 Million Worth of XRP Inflow The potential reason behind XRP’s struggle to gain momentum is the ongoing inflow from the exchanges. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , investors and long-term holders have potentially offloaded nearly $13 million worth of XRP tokens onto exchanges. This substantial outflow onto exchanges is currently causing prices to struggle, as it has the potential to create selling pressure and drive downside momentum. XRP’s Major Liquidation Levels At press time, traders betting on the long side are currently dominating, while those betting on the short side appear exhausted. Traders are over-leveraged at $2.40, having built $57 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $2.55 is an over-leveraged level where traders have built $8.50 million worth of short positions.

The coin is now inching closer to the $2 mark, recovering from a major drop from its all-time high of $3. Currently, Pi Coin is trading between $1.70 and $1.95, sparking hope among investors for a potential rebound to its peak value. The broader cryptocurrency market remains volatile, with major coins like Bitcoin influencing the price of Pi Coin. Despite this, Pi Coin has established itself as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, even without being listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. The immediate support level for Pi Coin is at $1.60. If selling pressure continues, this level could be tested once again, following recent market trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below 50, signaling weak bullish momentum. Pi Network’s Growing Presence and Potential Analyst Kim Wong said that Pi Network stands out among crypto projects for its aim to build a functional digital economy, allowing Pi coins to be used in real-world transactions, such as purchasing goods and services, and powering decentralized applications (dApps).

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,350 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh upward move above the $2,220 support zone. The price is trading above $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key rising channel forming with support at $2,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,275 and $2,350 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Eyes A Comeback Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $2,350 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $2,220 and $2,250 support levels. A low was formed at $2,003 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,150 and $2,200 resistance levels. It even tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a key rising channel forming with support at $2,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,275 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,340 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,340 resistance might send the price toward the $2,420 resistance. An upside break above the $2,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,500 resistance zone or even $2,550 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,275 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,240 level. The first major support sits near the $2,220 zone. A clear move below the $2,130 support might push the price toward the $2,080 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,050 support level in the near term.

In a recent presentation, Pal walked through a range of macroeconomic indicators, historical price behaviors, and liquidity metrics that he says paint a compelling picture for an extended uptrend in digital assets. Bitcoin Bull Market Depends On M2 At the heart of Pal’s thesis lies the notion of Global M2 money supply, a metric tracking the total liquidity in circulation worldwide. Pal observed that Bitcoin, along with other risk-on assets, tends to correlate closely with changes in Global M2. “If this is the case, then M2 is going to keep going up all f***ing year. If that is the case, then crypto and risk assets like tech will do well all year.” By comparing current liquidity trends to those seen in 2017—when the dollar weakened considerably and equity markets soared in US President Donald Trump’s first term—Pal argues that the macro backdrop appears similarly poised for expansion. According to him, if major economies continue easing, it may drive the next phase of explosive crypto growth. Related Reading: Inverse Head And Shoulders Breakout Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Headed To $300,000 Pal’s thesis revolves around the impact of global liquidity, particularly the role of Global M2 money supply as a leading indicator for Bitcoin and risk assets. He presented a correlation between Global M2 growth and crypto market performance, stating: “If this is the case, then M2 is going to keep going up all f***ing year. If that is the case, then crypto and risk assets like tech will do well all year.” His analysis draws parallels to 2017, when Trump’s fiscal policies and monetary easing led to a prolonged period of dollar weakness, which fueled the crypto cycle. Similar conditions are unfolding now, with expectations of rate cuts and stimulus measures. A crucial factor in Pal’s extended bull market thesis is the business cycle, which he tracks through the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Index. Historically, an ISM reading above 50 signals economic expansion, which correlates with Bitcoin’s price surges. He noted: “Bitcoin goes up as the ISM goes up If the ISM gets up to its normal cycle peak of somewhere between 56 and 65, that will give us the magnitude of the rise in Bitcoin.” Pal suggested that if ISM continues its upward trajectory, Bitcoin’s price could exceed $300,000 or higher. However, he refrained from making precise forecasts, emphasizing that probabilities, not certainties, drive market analysis. Addressing the altcoin market, Pal maintained that Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) remain key components of his portfolio. Despite Solana’s recent drawdown of over 53%, he dismissed fears of a long-term decline: “Solana has overshot versus global M2 […]Solana should outperform Bitcoin for the rest of the cycle and Ethereum too, with Sui outperforming Solana.” His broader view on altcoins is based on risk appetite shifts as financial conditions ease. Historically, altcoins outperform Bitcoin in the latter half of the cycle when investors seek higher-beta opportunities. Pal criticized the notion that there will be no altcoin season in this cycle, stating, “That’s all f****ing nonsense.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s ‘KISS Of Death’? Arthur Hayes Warns Of Recession Before Surge Pal emphasized that large pullbacks are a feature, not a bug of crypto bull markets. He detailed past corrections, pointing out that the current cycle has seen seven 20%+ corrections while maintaining a 600% gain from the lows. He warned traders against leverage and panic selling, reinforcing his “Don’t F* This Up**” thesis: “To make the money, to unf*** your future, you’re going to have to learn to deal with volatility.” He compared the current correction to 2017, which saw multiple 30-40% pullbacks before peaking. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates that the market is the second most oversold in this cycle, suggesting a potential recovery in the coming months. Extending The Cycle To 2026 One of Pal’s most striking assertions is that the current cycle could extend into 2026 rather than peaking in 2025, as many analysts have projected. His reasoning is based on the prolonged period of economic stagnation before growth acceleration. He stated: “The business cycle is taking a long time below 50. It’s starting to expand now. That has probably extended the cycle into 2026.” While he clarified that this is not a prediction but a working hypothesis, the implications could be significant. A longer cycle would allow for higher valuations, a sustained investment influx, and a gradual rather than explosive blow-off top. Pal reiterated that the crypto market follows a predictable pattern, with a year-long “banana zone” of exponential growth. He noted that the current correction phase aligns with past cycles and should lead to a renewed rally by April-May. “We are now in correction phase one […] Then as we go into March, April, May, we start accelerating up again into the next phase of the banana zone.” However, he warned that investors should expect another major correction before the final market top, cautioning against overleveraging and late-cycle exuberance. Summarizing his outlook, Pal urged investors to maintain perspective and resist emotional trading. He emphasized the importance of long-term vision, proper portfolio construction, and patience: “You guys need patience more than anything else and need to understand markets […] Our futures are resting on the same thing.” At press time, BTC traded at $88,617.

The upcoming High Roller Mode will introduce crypto wagering with $CHILL, raising the stakes for both casual players and high-level competitors. SOL Arena integrates the dynamic, community-driven Solana ecosystem directly into the game, where memecoin projects, NFT communities, and token holders unite under shared teams. “Our vision is to merge casual gaming with degenerate memecoin activity and crypto network effects,” said James Au , CEO and Game Director of Chillchat, “to deliver an exciting new player experience that redefines the thrill of ‘winning’.” What’s Next? Token Launch and Mobile Play Following the Challengers NFT mint in February 2025 , SOL Arena’s next significant milestone is the launch of its ecosystem token, $CHILL, at the end of March.

In the first weeks of President Trump’s second administration, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, headed by the staunch Trump supporter and tech-billionaire Elon Musk, has uncovered a plethora of government misspending. Taking inspiration from President Trump’s money-saving agenda, Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, has filed a request to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to submit the total number of American tax dollars spent on crypto enforcement actions over the past four years. Coinbase Issues Public Record Request A La Doge The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by tech wizard Elon Musk, has made a clear impression on the crypto industry. After damning reports of government misspending came to light thanks to Mr Musk’s determination and grit to dismantle corruption in the US government, many others are now also questioning whether misspending could have occurred in other branches of government. Coinbase can now breathe a sigh of relief after the SEC dropped its latest enforcement case against the exchange. But no, says Coinbase: there's no time to relax. The exchange wants the SEC to offer a report detailing every dollar and resource it has devoted to enforcing and investigating the broader crypto industry in recent years. The exchange has taken the step to receive the information from the agency by filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request , aimed at getting hold of the SEC’s financials concerning enforcement actions against crypto firms. Detailed Request Coinbase’s request seeks clarification on the expenses the SEC incurred from April 17, 2021, to January 20, 2025, linked to investigations into crypto activities. Coinbase’s request is comprehensive and seeks to include various aspects surrounding the SEC’s actions, including: The number of investigations launched against crypto firms; Number of employees involved in the enforcement actions; Additional detail on third-party contractors engaged in enforcements and investigations; Total and complete financial expenditures on these actions. Paul Grewal took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to speak further about these actions. In a thread, Grewal posted: We know the previous @SECgov ’s regulation-by-enforcement approach cost Americans innovation, global leadership, and jobs, but how much did it cost in taxpayer dollars? Today @Coinbase submitted a FOIA request asking the SEC to explain how much its war on crypto cost taxpayers.… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 3, 2025 Adding; “What do we hope to find out? How many investigations and enforcement actions were brought – and how much they cost; how many employees worked on these investigations/enforcement actions – and how much they cost; how many third-party contractors were used in these investigations/enforcement actions – and how much they cost.” Adding; “We also want to know more about the previous SEC’s infamous “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit” within the Enforcement Division – what was their budget, how many employees worked on it, how much did those employee hours cost?” Concluding with the following statement: “We’ll never stop fighting for government transparency on behalf of our customers and this industry. It may take time to get the full picture, but I think we’ve shown that we will do what it take for as long as it takes. You can read our FOIA request here.""

This first-of-its-kind event is expected to play a crucial role in the future of U.S. crypto policy, possibly launching a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Several key figures in the industry, including members of former President Donald Trump’s crypto task force, are expected to attend. However, as the guest list has started to take shape, one notable name is missing: Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson. According to Unchained, a White House source confirmed that Hoskinson was not invited to the summit, nor has Cardano been involved in any policy discussions or meetings with the administration. “They are running around town trying to push their own sort of narrative. They are not involved in anything about trying to influence policy and they are not invited to Friday’s summit,” the White House source told Unchained. Hoskinson’s absence is particularly surprising given recent comments from President Trump. On Sunday, Trump mentioned that Cardano’s ADA, would be part of a crypto reserve, which led many to expect Hoskinson’s attendance at the event. Confirmed Guests for the Summit Despite the exclusion of Hoskinson, several high-profile crypto industry leaders will be in attendance. The confirmed guest list includes: Brad Garlinghouse – CEO of Ripple Michael Saylor – Founder of MicroStrategy David Bailey – CEO of Bitcoin Magazine Matt Huang – Co-founder of Paradigm JP Richardson – CEO of Exodus Kyle Samani – Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital Zach Witkoff – Co-founder of World Liberty Financial Sergey Nazarov – Co-founder of Chainlink Brian Armstrong – CEO of Coinbase Vlad Tenev – CEO of Robinhood Arjun Sethi – CEO of Kraken Kris Marszalek – CEO of Crypto.com Hoskinson had previously hinted that he might attend a fundraising dinner for the pro-crypto PAC MAGA Inc., but the White House confirmed that he was not invited to that event either. Key Focus of the Summit The summit is set to run from 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET on March 7 and will be led by David Sacks, President Trump’s appointed AI and crypto czar. One of the main points of discussion will be the handling of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated in a recent interview that Bitcoin would be treated differently than other altcoins, as it is a significant part of President Trump’s crypto strategy.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-06 04:04:17

The price is now rising and might clear the $2.550 resistance zone. XRP price started a decent upward move from the $2.20 support zone. The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.480 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it clears the $2.550 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.80 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.60 and $2.50 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $2.25. Finally, the bulls appeared near the $2.20 support zone. A base is forming and the price is now recovering losses above $2.30. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.00 swing high to the $2.211 low.

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level. The next resistance is $2.70 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.00 swing high to the $2.211 low. A clear move above the $2.70 resistance might send the price toward the $2.80 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.880 resistance or even $2.920 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.480 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.40 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.40 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.320 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone.

The price of Cardano has soared by more than 40% from last week and analysts think ADA is not done yet . RTX has entered the PayFi market as a stealthy competitor against established altcoins like Stellar and Ripple while offering promising profit potential. Let us examine Cardano price current growth trend alongside Remittix’s discreet market rise in 2025. Current Cardano price Data Points Toward Positive Outlook; ADA Will Surpass The $2 mark. Cardano has taken the spotlight following President Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement. Cardano experienced an 80% price increase within two hours when it joined BTC, ETH, XRP and SOL on the exchange platforms which caused widespread market interest.. The Cardano price currently maintains a price at $1 while its market capitalization has reached $36.16 billion with $4.8 billion in daily trading volume. ADA has risen to $1 from its previous position at $0.64 thus becoming the reserve’s most successful cryptocurrency with strong recovery. Many analysts predict a 200% price increase for Cardano while forecasting it will reach $2.2 by mid-2025 and $3 by year end. The reserve introduces a pioneering approach that might prompt worldwide acceptance of its model. The announcement’s pro-crypto vibe has fueled this Cardano price upward rally. Cardano’s price strength shines with a circulating supply of 35.94 billion ADA. Public discussions link Cardano’s current market rise above the other reserve coins to its sustainable blockchain technology and smart contract capabilities. Market experts warn that the $2 billion FTX unlock process may yet harm price gains but the Cardano price outlook stays optimistic at this time. Remittix Is The Low Profile Potential PayFi Powerhouse Of 2025 The rising popularity of Cardano does not overshadow Remittix (RTX) as it develops its distinct market position. Remittix presale initiated at $0.0694 successfully attracted almost $13.5 million while attracting more than 30,000 holders who have purchased over 515 million tokens which increased 362% from its initial price of $0.015. Remittix stands apart from ordinary altcoins because it leads the PayFi movement. Users will be able to send cryptocurrency which automatically transforms into national currencies available in more than 30 different countries at affordable rates. The platform serves as a financial bridge for freelancers and families who want to avoid bank expenses while aiming at the $190 trillion global remittance sector. Cardano’s $30+ billion cap towers higher than RTX’s current presale numbers, but this just means Remittix’s room for growth is way higher and price changes will feel more agile and earn bigger yields. Remittix operates through practical methods while Cardano relies on reserve-driven boosts for its operations. Remittix provides an innovative solution that connects cryptocurrency transactions to traditional cash flow while delivering a new approach. Looking Forward; Why Remittix Will Soar Past $0.5 Soon What’s Remittix’s deal? Money transfer process is straightforward because cryptocurrency converts instantly into traditional money without bank delays. Cross-border workers along with families who need to transfer funds overseas benefit from Remittix by saving their wallet funds from unnecessary fees. The steady climb of Remittix price from its current position under 10 cents to reach $0.5 offers investors a more dependable investment opportunity than Cardano price gains. The market scarcity of RTX tokens may increase their value because demand continues to grow. Jump aboard RTX presale right now before the opportunity runs away.

Dogecoin, Cardano & XYZVerse Surge as Key Indicator Flashes Bullish",https://nulltx.com/1-target-in-sight-dogecoin-cardano-xyzverse-surge-as-key-indicator-flashes-bullish/,"Could Dogecoin, Cardano, and XYZVerse be on the brink of a major breakout? These digital assets have experienced a significant surge, boosted by a crucial market signal pointing toward bullish momentum. With prices climbing and key thresholds in sight, the stage is set for potential landmark achievements. What implications might this have for the broader market? XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin’s Wild Ride: From Meme to Crypto Sensation Dogecoin began in 2013 as a joke. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it used the Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin was designed to be plentiful, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. At first, it was just a “memecoin.” But in 2021, its value skyrocketed. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, reaching a market value over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media and support from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s rise showed the power of community and how the internet can influence finance. Dogecoin’s technology is simple. It doesn’t have features like smart contracts. But its strength is in its community and widespread appeal. In the current market, some investors still find Dogecoin attractive because of its active fanbase. However, its unlimited supply means it may not hold value as well as coins with a fixed supply, like Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies offer more advanced technology and real-world uses. But if the social media buzz continues, Dogecoin could stay strong. Its story reminds us that in crypto, fun and community can drive value as much as technology. Cardano’s ADA: The Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrency Changing the Game Cardano is a rising star in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible and sustainable blockchain designed for smart contracts. Developers can build apps, create crypto tokens, and design games on it. Its coin, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake ADA on the network. Cardano stands out because it’s eco-friendly. It uses Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake system that saves energy compared to traditional methods. Cardano’s innovation lies in its two-layer system: one for transactions, one for smart contracts. This design could allow it to process up to a million transactions per second. Since March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market, ADA looks attractive due to its scalability and green approach. As concerns about energy use in crypto grow, Cardano’s solution is timely. While Ethereum has recently shifted to proof-of-stake, Cardano’s layered architecture and early adoption of these principles make it stand out, making ADA a promising option. Conclusion The bull run of 2025 boosts DOGE and ADA, but XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans in crypto.

Sui (SUI) Primed for Rebound Despite Recent Dips Sui is currently priced between $2.66 and $3.59, facing a dip but holding on. The price has dropped over the past month and week, but a six-month rise of nearly 200% shows resilience. The RSI suggests it’s undervalued, presenting a potential for growth. The current nearest resistance lies just under $4, and if Sui breaks this, it might aim for $4.91. With improving technical indicators, a rebound could drive a price increase of over 30% from current levels. Support holds at $2.13 to protect further dips. While recent trends show a fall, signs of a possible altcoin season bring hope for Sui’s rise. Mantle Set to Soar or Stumble: Crypto’s Underdog Tale Mantle (MNT) is dancing between $0.68 and $0.90, showing some mixed signals. The MACD is in the red, implying caution. But, the RSI at 46.46 suggests it’s nearing a potential bounce. For now, the price looks pressured, having dropped more than 10% in a week. In the next move, breaking the $1.02 resistance could trigger a rally, possibly taking it up near the $1.24 mark, a 38% leap from current levels. However, slipping past the $0.58 support might spell more trouble. Momentum indicators show sideways movement. It’s a waiting game for now, and crypto enthusiasts are eager to see where this coin goes next. Conclusion While SUI and MNT show limited short-term potential amid market pressures, Catzilla presents itself as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility in governance, incentives, and staking, Catzilla unites enthusiasts to dismantle toxic systems.

Two standout projects have recently emerged for those looking to dive into this vibrant sector: Arctic Pablo Coin and Pudgy Penguins. Each offers distinct features and potential benefits for investors seeking the top meme coins to invest in this week. Arctic Pablo Coin: Embarking on a Frosty Financial Expedition Imagine traversing icy tundras, uncovering mystical secrets hidden beneath snow-covered lands. That’s the story of Arctic Pablo ($APC), a meme coin designed to turn myths into money. As Pablo travels through legendary locations, each presale phase offers a piece of this adventurous narrative, transforming every coin into more than just currency—it’s a ticket to a mythical journey. Arctic Pablo’s presale is ingeniously structured around Pablo’s expedition, with each phase representing a new location on his map. Currently, the presale has reached ChillVille, the 13th phase, with tokens priced at $0.000070. Early investors have a golden opportunity, as the launch price is set at $0.008, offering a staggering potential return on investment (ROI) of over 11,285.71% from this stage to the listing price. For instance, a $1,000 investment now would yield approximately 14,281,270 APCs, which could be worth $114,250.16 upon launch. Arctic Pablo employs a deflationary token burn mechanism to enhance scarcity and value. Unsold tokens are permanently eliminated weekly during the presale, and any remaining tokens post-presale will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment. This strategy aims to boost investor value and ensure long-term sustainability. Additionally, Arctic Pablo offers a staking program with an attractive 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Investors can stake their APC tokens and watch their investments grow, with all staked coins vested for two months from the launch date. This initiative rewards holders and encourages long-term commitment to the project. Arctic Pablo places a strong emphasis on community involvement. The project offers referral incentives, allowing participants to earn rewards by inviting others to join the journey. This approach fosters a collaborative environment and accelerates the project’s growth by leveraging the power of community networks. It is one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week. Pudgy Penguins: From NFTs to Meme Coin Stardom Pudgy Penguins began as a collection of 8,888 unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain in August 2021. The project quickly gained traction, becoming a cultural icon within the crypto community. In April 2022, Pudgy Penguins underwent acquisition by Luca Schnetzler for a sum of 750 ETH, equivalent to $2.5 million at the time. Building on its NFT success, Pudgy Penguins introduced its official coin, PENGU. This move allowed the ever-expanding Pudgy Penguin fanbase and the hundreds of millions of people outside of crypto to join “The Huddle.” PENGU is a symbol for community, memes, and good vibes. As of March 5, 2025, PENGU is trading at approximately $0.006743, with a 24-hour trading volume of $104,977,998.07. The token reached an all-time high of $0.06845 on December 17, 2024, and has since experienced a decline of about 90.4%. Despite this, the community remains bullish, with 89% expressing positive sentiment towards PENGU. Conclusion: Seizing the Meme Coin Moment Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin and Pudgy Penguins stand out as top meme coins to invest in this week. Arctic Pablo offers a unique adventure-driven narrative, structured presale phases with escalating prices, a deflationary token burn mechanism, and a lucrative staking program with 66% APY.

It forms a bullish pattern on the 4-hour chart, but there’s no assurance if it will come into play. Altcoins are back in a recovery mode after witnessing a serious downfall after opening short this week. However, Link remains bearish on the daily chart but has managed to stay above $13 over the past week. This price level is now considered as support. The recovery came after witnessing a dramatic sell-off from $17.5 two days ago. The bulls intercepted the drops yesterday and pushed back. They are now taking charge on the day. Though the pressure is not strong yet to consider a buy. A push above the previous weekly high should set the stage for retracement before resuming bearish. On the 4-hour chart, Link signals a potential bullish move with a double-bottom formation, but it is not certain if it will play out. A break above its neckline should validate a temporary shift while the buyers regroup. Losing the current holding support could invalidate the bullish move, hence advancing drops to a new multi-month low. Technically, the price has reached an oversold region on the daily chart. We can expect a small recovery while the trend remains bearish. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The main resistance level to watch for now is $17.5. If the price breaks higher, $19.8 is the next resistance to keep in mind, followed by $22.3. For pullback, there’s close support at $15.4. A break below the holding $13.1 support could slip the price to $11. If this level fails to produce a bounce, it may navigate $10 for support.

ETH experienced a rollercoaster performance earlier this week before rebounding with a 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This recovery follows a broader market correction that initially led to fear among investors. While Ethereum’s performance remains closely linked to Bitcoin’s price action, recent on-chain data suggests that ETH may enter a renewed accumulation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly RSI Drops To Lowest Level Since May 2022 – More Selling Pressure Ahead? MVRV Ratio and Institutional Accumulation Trends A post uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform by a contributor known as Mac has particularly pointed out Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which suggests the asset is currently undervalued. The latest data indicates that large-scale investors are increasing their ETH holdings, signaling potential support at key price levels. According to Mac, these accumulation patterns could influence Ethereum’s trajectory in the coming weeks. Mac revealed that the MVRV ratio, a key on-chain metric used to assess whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued, has fallen below 1 for Ethereum. Historically, such levels indicate an undervalued zone, meaning that Ethereum is trading close to the average purchase price of all holders, including institutional investors. ETH MVRV: Reaching a Highly Undervalued Zone “When MVRV falls below 1, it signals entry into an undervalued zone in the cycle, indicating an opportunity to buy at a level close to the average purchase price of all holders (including whale investors).” – By @MAC_D46035 pic.twitter.com/urj348TZng — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 5, 2025 The analyst also mentioned that in past market cycles, when Ethereum’s MVRV dropped below 1, it was followed by notable price recoveries. Additionally, there has been a surge in the number of ETH accumulation addresses—wallets that receive ETH but have never withdrawn. This suggests that large investors and institutions are strategically increasing their holdings, particularly at the current price range of $2,200–$2,300, where the realized price for whale investors is concentrated. This level is expected to act as a strong support zone, reinforcing the possibility of sustained accumulation. Market Conditions and Long-Term Ethereum Outlook Beyond accumulation trends, macroeconomic factors continue to play a role in shaping Ethereum’s price movements. Mac noted that liquidity policies in the US, particularly the Trump administration’s trade and monetary policies, have so far influenced risk asset performance, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Below Parallel Channel – Is ETH Collapsing To $1,250? Stricter monetary policies and inflation concerns could contribute to “sharp price drops.” Despite this possibility, Mac concluded, noting: However, Ethereum still maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is a proven network with thousands of mature DeFi projects. As such, institutional investors are likely to accumulate more in this undervalued zone. Therefore, from a long-term perspective, the outlook for Ethereum remains positive.

With president Donald Trump’s administration changing regulatory attitudes, a new SEC crypto task force in place, Coinbase is mapping out its execution strategy. Alesia Haas, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, confirmed the decision at the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference on Wednesday, saying Coinbase had originally wanted to go public with a security token. “We tried to go public with a security token. We tried to go public on our own products. And we could not, and we ran into brick walls,” said Alesia. “The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shut down those plans.” The SEC’s legal battle with Coinbase ended in a major court victory for the company last month. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong addressed this during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, saying, “We fully won that case. It was dismissed with prejudice. We did not pay a single dollar in settlement. We did not change a single aspect of our business.” So this victory cleared the way for Coinbase to pursue security tokens again. The company believes the current Congress is the most pro-crypto ever, with Trump pushing to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Brian said, “We have the House, the Senate, and the Executive all fully excited and aligned on this.” A key part of Coinbase’s regulatory focus is stablecoin legislation. Brian explained, “Creating stablecoin regulation will be a huge unlock for a digitized dollar.” Coinbase is also pushing for clear market structure laws to define which crypto assets count as commodities, securities, or payment stablecoins. In the earnings call, Brian described this as “key to understanding who is regulating you.” Payments are another major growth area. Brian told Coinbase shareholders that: “The majority of all payments are going to be happening on stablecoins eventually.” He pointed to the speed, low fees, and global reach of stablecoin transactions, adding, “Sending USDC on Base takes less than one second and costs less than one cent.” Coinbase’s revenue strategy and market expansion Brian laid out Coinbase’s 2025 priorities: driving revenue, expanding crypto utility, and scaling its infrastructure. The company’s trading, staking, and stablecoin businesses each pulled in over $700 million in 2024, and it is adding new features to grow those numbers in 2025. Coinbase is also expanding derivative trading and plans to support millions of tokens by integrating decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Brian said, “We’re adding best-in-class derivative trading support for customers that are power users or sensitive on fees.” Another important business area is Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), which Brian compared to Amazon Web Services (AWS). “This is what Amazon did with AWS, allowing our infrastructure to be utilized by third-party companies,” Brian said. He believes this could become a major revenue stream as more businesses integrate crypto APIs for custody, trading, staking, and payments. The company’s subscription service, Coinbase One, now has 600,000 paying subscribers. Brian described it as “Amazon Prime for crypto”, saying, “It creates a sticky customer. Once they become a Coinbase One member, they do more trading volume with us.” The service offers zero-fee trading, improved rewards, and premium support, which Coinbase says will help lock in users. Alesia jumped in to explain that international expansion as another revenue driver. Just last December, Coinbase secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider license in Argentina and the UK and is working on a MiCA license in Europe. Brian pointed out that Coinbase now has a repeatable playbook for entering new markets. “Every market we entered two years ago—Brazil, Canada, Australia, Singapore—has already become profitable.” Coinbase’s next steps and future priorities With a war chest of $9 billion, Coinbase is looking at acquisitions too. Alesia described the company as “the most acquisitive in crypto” and said it evaluates deals based on customer growth, new licenses, and talent acquisition. “We have always had an appetite for M&A. And it’s in support of our product road map and is in support of: Can we add customers? Can we add assets? Can we add products? Can we add licenses? Can we add talent? And so the tuck-ins that you mentioned, we’re really pleased to find opportunities to add talent that can accelerate our product roadmap,” Alesia said. Coinbase is also strengthening its policy efforts. The company’s StandWithCrypto.org now has 2 million voters advocating for pro-crypto candidates, with a goal of 4 million by midterm elections in America next year. Brian said, “We’re going to continue to donate to Fairshake, the Super PAC that had excellent results in the last election.” Looking ahead, Brian said the biggest challenge is focus. “We have too many opportunities in front of us to pursue simultaneously.” Alesia agreed, saying, “We need to make sure we are marching towards our biggest priorities and not getting distracted.” Brian then told shareholders, “And so we try not to get caught up in the hype, but we also try not to get caught up in any despair when it happens in crypto. And right now, I’d say we’re more in like danger of being in hype. It’s a very positive moment. And so we’re just being very deliberate about how we grow this business, how we allocate capital to the next year.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $635 resistance. BNB price is moving higher above the $585 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $595 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $600 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $588 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Surge After forming a base above the $550 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $565 and $570 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $588 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $637 swing high to the $548 low. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $600 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. However, the bears seem to be active near the $605 and $606 levels. The price is now trading above $600 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $606 level. The next resistance sits near the $616 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $637 swing high to the $548 low. A clear move above the $616 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $635. A close above the $634 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $665 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $606 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $600 level. The next major support is near the $595 level. The main support sits at $588. If there is a downside break below the $588 support, the price could drop toward the $570 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.

Forget waiting for Bitcoin to double in five years. The real game is in fast-moving, community-driven tokens with explosive potential. Enter BTFD Coin, Gigachad, and Ponke—three meme coins you need to have on your radar right now. BTFD Coin’s presale is in full swing, with the Bulls stampeding toward the finish line. Over $6.26 million has already been raised, with Stage 14 nearly sold out. That means two things: 1) You need to move FAST, and 2) There’s still time to double your tokens using the LAUNCH100 bonus code . But don’t blink, or you might miss it. It’s time to break down why this meme coin (and its wild Bulls Squad) is leading the pack, and why Gigachad and Ponke are also worth a serious look. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad’s Charge Toward Crypto Glory You know what they say—Buy The Dip. That’s exactly what BTFD Coin is all about: taking advantage of opportunities when others hesitate. And right now? This is one of those moments. Stage 14 of the presale is almost sold out, and once it hits the exchanges, analysts predict an opening price of $0.0006, with moonshot potential to $0.006—that’s a jaw-dropping 3650% ROI if you get in now at $0.00016. The Bulls Squad: Your Crypto Hype Team Picture this: You’ve got $3,000 sitting in your wallet, wondering where to go. Enter the Bulls Squad—a team of four mascots designed to hype up the BTFD ecosystem. Baby Bull is all about growth, stacking your early investment into serious gains. Raging Bull rides the market waves with power moves. Nerdy Bull breaks down the data so you don’t have to, and Peoples Bull? He’s the ultimate community leader, keeping the Bulls united. Now, do some math (don’t worry, Nerdy Bull’s got you covered). $3,000 at today’s presale price ($0.00016) gets you 18.75 million BTFD tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that stash turns into $11,250. If it rockets to $0.006? You’re looking at $112,500. Not bad for a meme coin backed by a rock-solid community and an insane 100% bonus using the LAUNCH100 code. BTFD’s Secret Weapon: Staking & Play-to-Earn BTFD has an actual ecosystem that rewards investors at every corner. Staking rewards? 90% APY . A Play-to-Earn game? Yep, and it feeds right back into the BTFD economy. Plus, in a bearish market, securing a low-entry price during presale is a genius move. This presale is closing fast. Don’t sleep on this opportunity—BUY NOW. Gigachad: The Alpha Energy of Crypto If you’ve spent any time online, you know the Gigachad meme—the epitome of confidence and dominance. That’s exactly what the Gigachad crypto project is all about. Trading at $0.018203 with a market cap of over $169 million, Gigachad has carved out a space for itself with a meme-backed identity that screams power. With a maximum supply of 10 billion tokens and only 9.3 billion in circulation, scarcity could drive the price higher. The last 24 hours have been a bit red, but if you’re a true Gigachad, you know that dips are where the magic happens. If you’re looking for the best cryptos for beginners with established credibility, high liquidity, and a devoted following, Gigachad is a strong bet. Ponke: The Meme Coin with the Tightest Community Community is everything in meme coin culture, and Ponke has it locked down. With a market cap of $65 million and a circulating supply of 555.5 million tokens, this one is all about holding strong and growing together. Ponke’s price is sitting at $0.117658, and with a 24-hour trading volume of over $8 million, it’s clear the market is watching. This token is driven by a dedicated army of holders who believe in the long-term value of the Ponke ecosystem. If you’re after a meme coin that thrives on trust, stability, and long-term momentum, Ponke could be your pick. Claiming the BTFD Coin 100% Bonus: Here’s How Visit the presale page .

The cycle repeats itself, time and time again, with a level of predictability that borders on comforting. A meme coin takes off, a new wave of speculation follows, and the game resets. Now, we find ourselves at the start of another cycle. Doge Uprising ($DUP) is surging as its presale gains momentum, while Pudgy Penguins and Peanut the Squirrel steady themselves and try to stop the bleeding from last week. Which of these projects can turn speculative enthusiasm into something more substantial? Doge Uprising ($DUP): The Rising Power If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you know that meme coins are about more than just memes. The most successful projects tap into something deeper, something that extends beyond speculative trading and into the psychology of belonging. Doge Uprising understands this. Presale buyers are moving in quickly, and the demand is heating up as prices rise in each stage. Then there’s the 30% staking rewards, making $DUP not just a meme coin but an ecosystem that rewards long-term holders. A dystopian narrative that keeps engagement levels high—because storytelling, as much as tokenomics, drives the best crypto plays. A great meme coin needs to create its own gravity, a reason for people to stay. Doge Uprising is proving that it understands this game better than most. Pudgy Penguins: The Blue-Chip Meme Project That Refuses to Die There was a time when Pudgy Penguins NFTs were the underdog, the long shot, the unexpected breakout. Now, though, the brand is established, and the Pudgy narrative remains one of resilience rather than meteoric rise. It certainly needs its resilience this week after an 18% drop, which compounds its 88% fall from a peak of $0.05738. Pudgy Penguins’ belligerent holders hope and pray that it won’t fade away anytime soon. Regardless, the real high-reward plays aren’t found in established projects, no matter how they’re faring—they’re found in projects on the rise. Peanut the Squirrel: A Wild Card in the Meme Market Every meme coin needs a gimmick. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) has one, and it’s exactly what you’d expect. The narrative here is simple: Squirrels hoard nuts, traders hoard tokens. It’s the kind of self-aware absurdity that crypto traders eat up. And to be fair, PNUT has a shot at becoming a sleeper hit. Compared to all the red seen across the market this week, PNUT has flown back up almost 20%. It’s small-cap and under the radar, which means the room for growth is substantial. It plays into the accumulation meme—perfect for a market addicted to narratives. But it lacks the structured mechanics of Doge Uprising, meaning its success is purely hype-dependent. Why Doge Uprising Has the Edge in 2025 The difference between a coin that pumps and a coin that lasts is utility. That’s where Doge Uprising pulls ahead. $DUP offers staking rewards, something neither Pudgy Penguins nor Peanut the Squirrel provides. $DUP has a structured presale, meaning early buyers aren’t left to battle whales post-launch. The crypto market moves fast, and new meme coins rise overnight. But Doge Uprising is making all the right moves at the right time, and that could make all the difference. Can Memes Make 100x Dreams?

The payments firm recently announced the National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA), a nonprofit aimed at educating the public about digital assets, with Ripple contributing $50 million in funding. Meanwhile, comments from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, reaffirming the company’s right to sell XRP for operational purposes have sparked debate among investors. Ripple’s XRP Sales Spark Investor Concerns Amid CTO’s Blunt Remarks Ripple Labs’ right to sell XRP tokens for operational capital has become a heated topic after the company’s chief technology officer (CTO), David Schwartz, confirmed that the company is not obligated to act in investors’ interests. His remarks, coupled with recent discoveries of massive XRP reserves linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, have stirred uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. The debate was ignited when Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, raised concerns about Ripple’s freedom to offload XRP tokens without obligation to token holders. In a March 5 post on X, Rochard wrote, “XRP isn’t a security because Ripple doesn’t actually owe you ‘utility’ or anything else.” “They are free to dump on you and you have no right to do anything about it other than join them in dumping XRP,” he warned, adding that investors should recognize they are “not investing in Ripple,” but rather receiving tokens “created out of thin air” with no guaranteed value. Rather than refuting Rochard’s claims, Ripple CTO David Schwartz—known by the online alias “JoelKatz”—surprised many by agreeing with the sentiment. He affirmed that Ripple has no obligation to XRP holders beyond its own business goals. “100% correct. IMO, Ripple can, will, and should act in its own interest,” Schwartz wrote. “You should not expect Ripple to act in your interest to the detriment of its own interest or those of its shareholders.” The blunt acknowledgment from a top executive has unsettled some investors, who fear that Ripple’s continued sales of XRP could exert downward pressure on the token’s price. Historically, large XRP sales by Ripple have sparked price declines, as increased token supply dilutes demand. Investor anxiety escalated further after blockchain investigator ZachXBT disclosed a previously dormant XRP wallet valued at over $7 billion. The massive holdings, potentially linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, have raised questions about the long-term intentions of early XRP stakeholders. “With the announcement of the US Crypto Reserve, here’s your reminder that XRP addresses activated by Chris Larsen still hold 2.7B+ XRP ($7.18B), and these addresses tied to him transferred $109M+ worth of XRP to exchanges in January 2025,” ZachXBT revealed in a March 3 Telegram post . While some XRP supporters believe Larsen may no longer have access to these funds—since most of the wallets have been inactive for over six years—others worry about the potential market impact if such a vast amount of XRP is sold. XRP’s Short-Lived Rally Amid Trump’s Crypto Reserve Proposal Despite the concerns surrounding Ripple’s XRP holdings, the token recently saw a price surge following news that US President Donald Trump had directed his Working Group on Digital Assets to include XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) in a proposed US strategic crypto reserve, alongside Bitcoin. The announcement triggered a temporary rally in the altcoin market, with XRP climbing to a high of $2.99 on March 2. However, the enthusiasm quickly faded, with the token retreating to $2.50 at the time of writing. Market analysts remain cautious about the sustainability of the rally, citing the need for congressional approval before any US government crypto reserve can be established. Aurelie Barthere, a principal research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, noted that the process could be prolonged and complex. “I think constituting a reserve by buying new tokens is a complex process that will need Congress’s vote, so it will take time. I would be a bit wary of the sustainability of today’s move,” Barthere said. As Ripple continues to assert its right to sell XRP for operational purposes, investor sentiment appears divided. On one hand, Ripple’s ability to generate liquidity through token sales helps sustain its operations and fund ecosystem developments. On the other, persistent sell pressure from Ripple and early stakeholders risks undermining long-term investor confidence in XRP. With regulatory scrutiny still looming over Ripple’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and questions surrounding the company’s influence over XRP’s supply, traders remain wary of future volatility. As the debate unfolds, the key takeaway from Schwartz’s comments is clear: Ripple will always act in its own interest. Whether that aligns with the interests of XRP holders is another matter entirely. Ripple Launches National Cryptocurrency Association With $50M Grant to Promote Crypto Education In related news, Ripple Labs has announced its involvement in launching a new nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public about cryptocurrency’s role in empowering individuals and businesses. The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) aims to provide accessible information on crypto adoption and ensure Americans stay informed about developments in the sector. The announcement, made on March 5 via X by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, revealed that he will serve as president of the nonprofit while continuing his legal duties at Ripple. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse further disclosed that the blockchain payments firm would fund the NCA with an initial $50-million grant to support its educational initiatives. According to the NCA’s official website, the organization has been established to help Americans understand cryptocurrency by sharing real-world adoption stories. While the group did not explicitly state any plans to directly engage in politics, it emphasized the importance of keeping the public informed about upcoming changes in the crypto industry. Despite these claims, Ripple has recently become increasingly active in political contributions, particularly in the United States. The company contributed $45 million to Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC) focused on influencing voter sentiment in the 2024 election cycle. Alderoty also personally donated $300,000 to a committee backing Donald Trump, further fueling speculation about Ripple’s political involvement. Additionally, both Alderoty and Garlinghouse met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January and later attended his inauguration events in Washington, DC, as official guests. The NCA is registered as a 501(c)(4) organization, a classification under US law that allows unlimited corporate and personal donations while remaining exempt from donor disclosure requirements. These types of organizations are often used for lobbying, issue advocacy, and political engagement, raising questions about whether the NCA could eventually take on a more political role in the crypto industry. The timing of the NCA’s launch coincides with major developments in the US regulatory landscape regarding cryptocurrency firms. Under Trump’s administration, the SEC has ended several high-profile enforcement actions, including lawsuits against Coinbase, Cumberland DRW, and Consensys. However, Ripple remains in legal limbo as the SEC continues to pursue its appeal in a $125-million judgment against the firm. While many crypto-related cases have been dropped, Ripple’s legal battle remains unresolved, making its recent political engagements and the formation of the NCA even more significant. XRP’s Role in the National Crypto Stockpile Proposal As Ripple navigates its ongoing legal battle, its ties to the Trump administration continue to deepen. CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed his attendance at a March 7 crypto summit at the White House, where discussions on the future of digital assets will take place. Perhaps most notably, Trump announced that XRP would be one of five cryptocurrencies included in the proposed “national crypto stockpile.” While the proposal has drawn enthusiasm from XRP supporters, many legal experts question its feasibility and legality. Critics argue that Congress would need to approve any such reserve, and government involvement in selecting specific cryptocurrencies could raise concerns over favoritism and regulatory overreach. Ripple’s moves in the political and regulatory spheres suggest a shift from being a blockchain payments firm to a major crypto policy influencer. Through the National Cryptocurrency Association, the company is positioning itself as an advocate for crypto education and regulatory clarity in the US. With a $50-million funding boost, the NCA has the potential to become a significant voice in shaping public perception and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency. However, its political undertones, ties to Trump, and Ripple’s ongoing SEC battle ensure that the organization’s true intentions will remain a topic of intense debate in the months ahead. As Ripple continues to assert its influence over crypto policy and regulation, the impact of the NCA and its broader implications for the future of digital assets in the US will be closely watched.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-06 05:30:00

Most new cryptocurrency users adopt centralized exchanges for coin storage, and their reasons are understandable. For instance, crypto exchanges are most users’ gateway into the crypto industry. They serve purposes like providing options to buy and trade cryptos easily. However, it is crucial to understand the inherent risks of leaving one’s crypto assets on such exchanges. Why Users Choose Centralized Exchanges Apart from buying and trading cryptos, most centralized exchanges provide extended services that benefit crypto users. Staking, lending, margin trading, and consistent liquidity represent some features that attract crypto users to centralized exchanges. Such users store their assets in custodial wallets on the exchanges to make it easy for them to carry out their activities.

Trump’s Reserve Plans On Sunday, President Trump shared some plans for the reserve on social media. He revealed that the reserve would include alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, SOL, and ADA. Trump later clarified that BTC and ETH, being valuable, would be the main focus of the Reserve.

In parallel, a heated debate over crypto regulation and national security unfolded in Congress, with Representative Sean Casten warning of crypto’s role in illicit finance, while Representative Warren Davidson pushed back by arguing for financial privacy. US Sanctions Darknet Marketplace Operator The United States imposed sanctions on Behrouz Parsarad, which is an Iran-based operator of the now-defunct darknet marketplace Nemesis, along with his cryptocurrency addresses, which recently benefited from Bitcoin price fluctuations. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on March 4 that Parsarad established Nemesis in 2021, and used it as a platform to facilitate the sale of drugs, false identification documents, hacking resources, and other illicit services catering to cybercriminals. (Source: US Department of The Treasury ) With the sanctions in place, US citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with Parsarad or any companies where he has more than a 50% stake. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the sanctioned assets include 44 Bitcoin and five Monero addresses that received more than $850,000 between July of 2022 and March of 2024. The total volume of cryptocurrency handled by Parsarad is estimated to exceed $1.6 million, largely due to price appreciation over time. The majority of Parsarad’s crypto transactions were tied to Nemesis, but he also sent over $12,000 to various darknet marketplaces like ASAP Market, Incognito Market, and Next Generation. His activities also showed indirect exposure to cryptocurrency mixers, which is a method often used to obscure the origin of illicit funds. OFAC revealed that before a joint US, German, and Lithuanian law enforcement operation shut down Nemesis and seized its servers in March 2024, the marketplace grew to host 30,000 active users and 1,000 vendors. The platform had built-in money laundering features that allowed criminals to conduct transactions with relative anonymity. (Source: Chainalysis ) In addition to providing a hub for cybercriminals, Parsarad was actively involved in laundering virtual currencies for narcotics traffickers and other illicit actors operating on Nemesis, according to OFAC. Authorities estimate that he amassed millions of dollars throughout the marketplace’s existence. Despite law enforcement actions, he reportedly continued efforts to re-establish his operations. While Western law enforcement agencies have cracked down on darknet marketplaces, the ecosystem is still highly active. TRM Labs’ 2025 Crypto Crime Report estimates that darknet markets generated more than $1.7 billion in revenue in 2024. This was only a slight increase from the previous year. Russian-language darknet marketplaces continue to dominate, benefiting from limited enforcement action by Russian authorities, while Western darknet markets face growing instability. The start of 2024 saw multiple high-profile exit scams , including the sudden disappearances of Bohemia Market and Cannabia Market in January, which Dutch authorities later linked to an ongoing investigation. In March, Incognito Market also collapsed under suspicious circumstances, with its administrator ”Pharoah” allegedly attempting to extort users before shutting down the platform. Despite the enforcement efforts and operational disruptions in Western markets, darknet marketplaces are very resilient, with new actors constantly trying to fill the void left by shuttered platforms. US Customs Releases Seized Bitcoin Miners US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reportedly began releasing Chinese-made crypto mining equipment after months of detainment at various ports of entry. According to Taras Kulyk, CEO of Synteq Digital, thousands of mining units have been released after the seizure of up to 10,000 units. Kulyk suggested that some CBP officials were intentionally creating obstacles for the Bitcoin mining sector. Ethan Vera , chief operating officer at Luxor Technology, confirmed that while some shipments were being released, the majority remained held. The delays primarily affected Bitmain Antminer application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and were reportedly linked to a US Department of Commerce investigation into Bitmain-related chip designer Sophgo. The investigation began in October when chips ordered by Sophgo in Taiwan were found in a Huawei AI processor. Huawei has been under US sanctions since 2019, though Sophgo denied having any business ties with the Chinese tech giant. Despite these issues, ASICs from other Chinese manufacturers were not affected by CBP’s actions. Some companies faced financial strain because of the prolonged detainment. One firm even reported in November that it accumulated over $200,000 in holding fees for 200 ASICs that are still awaiting release. The CBP’s actions were reportedly carried out at the request of the US Federal Communications Commission Agency, which only added another layer of regulatory scrutiny to the situation. (Source: Blockspace ) The release of the miners is happening during the Trump administration’s ongoing trade policies, including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. The administration's trade measures with Canada and Mexico are also proceeding as planned. Given that China supplies 98% of the chips used in crypto mining, the disruption in shipments posed very major concerns for the industry. Bitmain, which is the largest manufacturer of these chips, has since expanded its production into the US to mitigate future delivery issues, with hopes of strengthening partnerships in the sector. The United States still plays a dominant role in global Bitcoin mining operations, with almost 38% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate originating from the country. Additionally, four of the most valuable Bitcoin mining firms—MARA Holdings, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, and Riot Platforms—are based in the US. US Lawmakers Clash Over Crypto and National Security In the middle of these sanctions developments, US Representative Sean Casten expressed his concerns that crypto-friendly regulations pose a national security threat. Casten made this statement during a March 5 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee , while debating the “Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act of 2025.” He accused President Donald Trump and Elon Musk of weakening anti-money laundering laws and financial surveillance measures. He also argued that the proposed crypto regulations will make it nearly impossible to trace the origins of funds being transferred, and claimed that all ransomware attacks in the United States are funded by cryptocurrency . Casten even criticized his colleagues for advocating policies that will reduce oversight and make illicit financial activities easier to conduct. Representative Casten His comments drew a lot of criticism from pro-crypto Representative Warren Davidson, who pushed back against Casten’s stance. Davidson accused Casten of advocating for a surveillance state and argued that the US should not follow China’s example in regulating financial transactions. He urged lawmakers to uphold constitutional principles rather than expand government control over financial activities. The debate over financial surveillance happened during broader concerns about government overreach and digital privacy. In April of 2024, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden warned that the agency was on the verge of expanding its control over the internet. He pointed to changes in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the ambiguous definition of “electronic communications surveillance provider,” which he argued could compel people working with service providers to act as government surveillance agents. Snowden has long been critical of centralized digital systems and in November 2024, he called for decentralization as a safeguard against the dangers of concentrated digital power, including artificial intelligence. David Holtzman , a former military intelligence officer and chief strategy officer at Naoris, echoed Snowden’s warnings in December 2024. Holtzman argued that AI-driven surveillance poses an unprecedented threat to privacy and human freedom, and stated that decentralization is the only effective countermeasure against the rise of authoritarian digital control.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-06 05:36:19

However, it looks poised for a retracement but is yet to chart gains today. Doge went through a serious breakdown last week and charted a double-digit loss. It later managed to round up the week on a strong note after a bounce back from a low of $0.183. The primary meme coin encountered resistance and crossed into the new week bearish. It lost momentum but later reestablished support above the recent low due to a rejection. This led to a bounce and is now looking poised for a buy following a notable increase in the last 24 hours. A retracement movement is slowly underway. However, Doge’s bearish swing is still intact on the daily chart following a lower low and lower high movement from its peak level of $0.49. The potential retracement movement should bring a slight relief. Failure to push higher could bring another impulsive movement in the form of a lower low. This could lead to an extension of the bearish swing, which might cause another serious bleeding in the mid-term. While the bulls are yet to gain control of this market, the price must climb back above the previous monthly high before considering a shift in the trend. Having lost 52% in 90 days, Doge is currently indecisive. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview There has been little-to-no movement since the start of today. A surge from the current trading level could bring a retest at $0.24. Higher levels for a retracement are $0.305 and $0.4. Towards the downside, the $0.183 level is providing support. A crack from there may cause another roller coaster to $0.16 and maybe $0.13. Key Resistance Levels: $0.24, $0.305, $0.4 Key Support Levels: $0.183, $0.16, $0.13 Spot Price: $0.2 Trend: Bearish Volatility:Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On Mar. 2, Trump directed the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to create a reserve comprising key cryptocurrencies. While initial reports highlighted assets like Ripple ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ), Trump later clarified that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum would be central to the initiative. The move has sparked controversy, with some claiming that the reserve may increase the value of assets owned by Trump and his associates. According to reports, Trump and his cronies own more than 60% of WLFI, which raises questions regarding a potential conflict of interest. However, The Trump Organization claims that the president has distanced himself from commercial activities and has denied any misconduct. His children, a separate ethics attorney, and an outside investment firm currently supervise WLFI’s management. Despite these assurances, watchdog groups remain skeptical, pointing to past instances where Trump’s business and political interests appeared intertwined.

Now, imagine there’s a new highway built just for you—no traffic, no delays, just smooth sailing. That’s Avalanche (AVAX) in the world of crypto. It’s designed to be faster, cheaper, and more scalable than many of its competitors, including Ethereum. But does it live up to the hype? Let’s dive into everything you need to know about Avalanche. What is Avalanche? Avalanche is a blockchain platform that’s designed for speed, low transaction fees, and scalability. Think of it as Ethereum’s faster, younger cousin. It allows developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and even launch their own blockchains (subnets) while keeping everything running smoothly. It was built to solve some of the biggest problems in crypto: slow transaction speeds, high fees, and network congestion. Ethereum, for example, sometimes struggles with high fees and slow transactions during peak times. Avalanche aims to fix that by offering near-instant finality and extremely low costs. At its core, Avalanche has its own cryptocurrency called AVAX. It’s used for staking, paying fees, and securing the network. But the real magic of Avalanche lies in its unique structure. Unlike traditional blockchains, Avalanche operates on three different blockchains, each with a specific purpose. We’ll get into how that works in a bit. History of Avalanche Avalanche was created by Ava Labs, a company founded by Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell University professor and blockchain expert. The project started in 2018, and by 2020, it officially launched. Here’s a quick timeline: 2018 – The Avalanche consensus mechanism was first introduced by a team of researchers. 2019 – Ava Labs raised funding and started working on the network. 2020 – Avalanche launched its mainnet, making it publicly available. 2021 – Avalanche gained massive traction, with AVAX’s price skyrocketing and partnerships forming. Since then, it has become one of the top blockchains, attracting developers, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts. History of Avalanche 2018 – The Avalanche consensus mechanism was first introduced. 2019 – Ava Labs raised funding and started working. 2020 – Avalanche launched its mainnet. 2021 – Avalanche gained massive traction. How Does Avalanche Work? Unlike traditional blockchains, Avalanche doesn’t rely on a single chain. Instead, it uses three different chains to improve efficiency: X-Chain (Exchange Chain) – This handles asset creation and transfers, similar to how Bitcoin is used for transactions. C-Chain (Contract Chain) – This is where smart contracts are executed, making it compatible with Ethereum’s DApps. P-Chain (Platform Chain) – This manages validators and helps create custom subnets (individual blockchains). Why does this matter? Because by splitting tasks between these chains, Avalanche avoids congestion, making transactions super fast and cheap. For example, Ethereum processes around 15 transactions per second (TPS). Avalanche? It can handle over 4,500 TPS. That’s a game-changer. Advantages of Avalanche Avalanche has some major advantages that make it stand out: Speed – Transactions settle in less than two seconds. No more waiting for minutes or even hours. Low Fees – Compared to Ethereum’s sometimes ridiculous gas fees, Avalanche keeps costs low. Scalability – The network doesn’t slow down even when usage increases. Ethereum Compatibility – Developers can easily move their projects from Ethereum to Avalanche. Security – Avalanche’s unique consensus mechanism makes it more resistant to attacks. Eco-Friendly – Unlike Bitcoin, which uses proof-of-work (PoW), Avalanche uses proof-of-stake (PoS), which is much more energy-efficient. Disadvantages of Avalanche Competition – Ethereum, Solana, and others are also working on scalability solutions. Centralization Concerns – Some critics argue that a small number of validators control most of the AVAX supply. Adoption – While growing, it still needs more developers and projects to truly compete with Ethereum. Is Avalanche a Good Investment? This is the big question: should you invest in AVAX? Like any crypto, AVAX has had its ups and downs. It saw huge gains in 2021, reaching an all-time high of around $146. However, it also faced major corrections. Here’s why some investors are bullish: Strong technology – Avalanche’s speed and low fees make it attractive for DApps. Growing ecosystem – More projects are launching on Avalanche. Institutional interest – Big players are taking notice. But there are risks too: Crypto volatility – Prices can swing wildly. Regulatory uncertainty – Governments may crack down on crypto. Competition – Ethereum and others aren’t standing still. If you believe in Avalanche’s long-term potential, it could be a solid investment. But always do your research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Is Avalanche a Good Investment? Here’s why some investors are bullish: Strong technology Growing ecosystem Institutional interest But there are risks too: Crypto volatility Regulatory uncertainty Competition The Future of Avalanche Avalanche has a bright future, but it won’t be an easy ride. Here’s what could happen next: More Adoption – If more developers and institutions join, Avalanche could challenge Ethereum. Better Upgrades – Avalanche continues to improve its scalability and security. Stronger Partnerships – More collaborations could boost its ecosystem. Price Growth? – If demand increases, AVAX could see price appreciation. Of course, nothing is guaranteed in crypto. Avalanche has potential, but it also faces challenges. Final Thoughts Avalanche is like the high-speed train of the crypto world. It’s fast, efficient, and designed to handle huge amounts of traffic without slowing down. If you’re into crypto, it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on. Will it replace Ethereum? Maybe not. But will it play a major role in the future of blockchain? Very likely. So, whether you’re an investor, developer, or just curious about crypto, Avalanche is one name you should know. FAQs What is Avalanche (AVAX) and how does it work? Avalanche is a fast, low-cost blockchain using three chains (X-Chain, C-Chain, P-Chain) to improve scalability and efficiency. How is Avalanche different from Ethereum? Avalanche is faster (4,500 TPS vs. Ethereum’s 15 TPS), has lower fees, and supports subnets for custom blockchains. Is AVAX a good investment? AVAX has strong tech, growing adoption, and institutional interest but faces risks like volatility and competition. What is the future of Avalanche?

He said that the NWF’s savings level did not allow considering risky investments such as crypto, which he said were ‘too volatile’. The deputy Finance Minister confirmed that the NWF would maintain its current regulatory structure, which included 60% yuan and 40% gold. Kolychev also added that he had not heard of any discussions about creating a strategic crypto reserve in Russia. He emphasized the importance to Russia–from the point of view of sovereign budget reserves–that the assets invested in these reserves could be sold very ‘quickly and without a large price revaluation.’ Russia to retain investment strategy for the National Welfare Fund Vladimir Korechev, 🇷🇺 Deputy Minister of Finance, told the media on March 4 that the Ministry does not consider or intend to use crypto as an investment tool for the national welfare fund, because of volatility. The main reserves are still RMB and gold — David Lee (@DavidLe76335983) March 5, 2025 Kolychev revealed that the Russian Finance Ministry had no immediate plans to buy or hold any crypto assets as part of the NWF’s investments but has claimed that this could change if a key condition is met. He said that it was premature to talk about the possibility of including crypto assets, which he considered to be too volatile and risky. The deputy minister explained that the NWF’s liquid funds should be topped up to 7-10% of Russia’s GDP before Moscow considers buying ‘riskier’ assets like crypto. After that, investing NWF funds in less liquid and more profitable assets would be possible. However, Kolychev also pointed out that Russia was ‘still far’ from reaching its desired levels of diversified reserve portfolios, which was why Moscow only bought gold and yuan reserves for the time being. He maintained that he had not caught wind of any discussions about creating a Russian crypto reserve, similar to what President Trump’s administration had conceived in the United States. “When we get there, we will be able to think about different assets, including crypto. However, for now, the volatility signs are not favorable.” – Vladimir Kolychev President Trump signed an executive order in February ordering the creation of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) within the next year, hinting that it could potentially buy TikTok. Trump told reporters that the U.S. was ‘going to create a lot of wealth for fund’ although the executive order’s text was sparse on details, simply directing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to submit a plan for ‘such a fund within 90 days’, including recommendations on funding mechanisms, investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model. Russia remains skeptical about a strategic crypto reserve According to Kolychev, the Russian Central Bank will make the final decisions on including crypto in the NWF reserve. However, the Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina is reportedly a known crypto-skeptic who has attempted several times to orchestrate a total China-style ban on crypto in Russia. The Russian government ruled out the possibility of a strategic crypto reserve back in December 2024, noting that it would take a cautious stance and wait for other nations to take the lead in buying Bitcoin (crypto). Anton Siluanov, the Russian Finance Minister, stated that the country would be ‘better off keeping its powder dry.’ Siluanov told a Financial University student audience that ‘the issue of creating a crypto reserve could be considered in the future’ but added that the matter was not currently ‘on the table’. He pointed out that Russia did not take those kinds of risks despite the Americans talking about building a national Bitcoin reserve now. VanEck analysts estimated that the U.S. could cut its debt by 35% by 2049 if Washington starts buying Bitcoin. U.S. lawmakers have already ‘set the stage’ for the SBR by crafting bills that would prepare the legal framework for such a state and/or federal investment. Russian lawmakers have also reportedly urged their government to act fast to keep up with Washington. However, Siluanov said that ‘maybe someday’ the Russian government ‘will come around to the idea.’ Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?
