Binance Has Just Received A Massive Litecoin Inflow According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large move has been spotted on the Litecoin network during the last 24 hours. The transfer in question involved the shifting of 500,000 LTC across the network. At the time that the chain executed the transaction, this stack was worth around $51.3 million. Given the large scale associated with the move, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for it. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop: $75,500? Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level Whales are the largest of investors on the network, who can carry some degree of influence in the market due to their ability to make large transactions like this latest one. As such, the behavior of these humongous holders can often be worth keeping an eye on, as even if it may not always end up impacting the LTC price, it can still tell us about what the sentiment is like among this important cohort. Generally, though, it can be hard to say for certain what the whales are doing from their transaction activity alone, considering the anonymous nature of the blockchain. Nonetheless, sometimes, one of the wallets involved in the transaction can be connected to a central entity, which can provide room for speculation. The latest Litecoin move is fortunately of this type. Here are the details of the addresses involved in the transfer: As is visible above, the whale made the Litecoin transaction from a few unknown wallets. Such addresses are those that aren’t known to be affiliated with any centralized platform, so they can be assumed to be personal, self-custodial wallets of the investor. The destination of the transaction was a wallet attached to Binance, an exchange. Moves of this type, where coins go from personal addresses to the custody of an exchange, are known as exchange inflows.

As such, exchange inflows can sometimes have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. It’s unknown, though, whether the whale truly intended to sell with the latest exchange inflow or not. In the scenario that the investor did plan for it, then it could spell trouble for Litecoin, considering the scale of the move and the fact that its price has already registered a considerable drawdown during the past week. LTC Price Litecoin has recently plummeted alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency sector, which has brought its price down to $104.

Amid this, Dogecoin (DOGE), the world’s largest and most popular meme coin, is catching the attention of crypto analysts and experts. Experts’ Bullish Views on DOGE Meme Coin Recently, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) with a bold prediction. The expert expressed a bullish outlook, noting that DOGE has maintained its position within an ascending parallel channel. Based on historical price momentum, if the meme coin holds above the $0.16 level, there is still hope that it could reach $2.74 or even $6.24 in the coming days. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1897396450528809329 Current Price Momentum Today, March 6, 2025, the overall crypto market sentiment appears bullish, with major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experiencing impressive gains of 3.25%, 2.80%, and 2.15%, respectively. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action and Upcoming Levels Amid this bullish momentum, DOGE has gained 3.29% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.204. However, despite the ongoing price recovery, the meme coin’s trading volume has dropped by 45%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Source: Trading View Besides all this, Coinpedia’s technical analysis suggests that DOGE appears bullish but is currently facing modest resistance near the $0.205 level. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the meme coin breaches this resistance and closes a daily candle above $0.21, it could soar by 18% to reach $0.245 in the coming days. Besides this bullish outlook, another factor supporting it is the current retest of a crucial support level. During the recent price drop, the meme coin found crucial support at $0.18 and is now moving upward. The daily chart shows that this support level has a history of triggering bullish price reversals.",Price Analysis|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 23:01:49

According to Robinhood, the ETH layer-2 Arbitrum ( ARB ) is now available to be bought, sold, and traded over the trading platform. google336x280] News of the addition sent ARB rallying from a price of $0.374 on March 4th to $0.421 a day later. It has since stabilized and is trading for $0.419 at time of writing, a 14.5% gain during the last 24 hours. ARB joins Robinhood’s suite of crypto products, which includes Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum, Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), popular memecoins such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Pepe ( PEPE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and dozens of others. Last month, it was Robinhood reported that it saw a staggering 8x increase in crypto trading revenue in Q4 of 2024, putting pressure on Coinbase, its competitor and the largest crypto exchange platform in the US. According to the Robinhood’s investment report, the company saw a 200% year-over-year increase in transaction-based revenues, most of which can be attributed to crypto. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its investigation into Robinhood without levying any enforcement actions against the firm. As stated by Dan Gallagher, the Robinhood’s chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, at the time, “We applaud the staff’s decision to close this investigation with no action. Let me be crystal clear – this investigation never should have been opened. Robinhood Crypto always has and will always respect federal securities laws and never allowed transactions in securities. As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed.

""Look at this mining. More and more people are turning to me. If it is profitable for us, let's do it. We have excess electricity. Let them make this cryptocurrency and so on,"" Lukashenko told Alexei Kushnarenko, the nation's new minister of energy, according to Belarusian media outlet Belta . The news comes as the U.S. government is studying the possibility of creating a national strategic crypto reserve that could include cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), ripple (XRP) and cardano (ADA). Lukashenko mentioned the White House's interest in crypto. ""You see the path the world is going. And especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep [a crypto] reserve,"" he said. ""Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves,"" Lukashenko said . Belarus wouldn't be the first nation to mine cryptocurrencies.

Remittix Dominates 2025 Best Crypto Presales,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/can-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-make-the-us-crypto-reserve-remittix-dominates-2025-best-crypto-presales,"The Dogecoin price took an instant 15% jump on Sunday following Trump's announcement a few hours earlier. This quick reaction has fueled reactions to a potential inclusion of Dogecoin in the federal crypto reserve. However, while this reaction was impressive, the Dogecoin price is not the only asset that responded positively to this announcement. So, is the Dogecoin surge simply FOMO from investors? Can Dogecoin and other meme assets like Shiba Inu join the US crypto reserve? There are hundreds of questions about the Trump announcements, but let's keep it to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu with this article. However, if you're looking for a top investment choice this year, the Remittix presale offers an option you can take advantage of. But first, let's talk about DOGE and SHIB in the crypto reserve. What Does The Dogecoin Price Brief Response Mean In The Long-Term Projection? Dogecoin remains one of the top choices when talking about the crypto meme coin market. The market cap continues to keep it at the top as the largest meme coin in the world with a cap of about $29B, standing more than a distant second, Shiba Inu. However, many factors have been acting against the Dogecoin price since the beginning of the year, with the sudden influx of new meme coins being a significant concern. This has caused a sudden shift of attention to newer meme coins with options to make a new favorite out of the hundreds of new meme coins that joined in January. The Dogecoin price downtrend in the last few weeks has caused panic, which has made many investors liquidate their positions. However, the recent surge, although brief, has fueled what looks like a return to optimism. While speculations abound about the possibility of Dogecoin joining the crypto reserve as a meme coin option, this is not immediate. The recent surge could only lead to further selling. Where Is Shiba Inu's Place In The Future Of Meme Coins? To briefly touch on Shiba Inu, its addition to the crypto reserve looks highly unlikely. This is because, unlike Dogecoin, which got most of its influence from the contribution of key figures like Elon Musk, Shiba Inu does not have such a strong backing. However, although the Shiba Inu coin is the number two meme coin in the world, recent additions like the Trump coin have posed a big risk to its influence. Hence, adding a second meme coin to the crypto reserve might not help the Shiba Inu coin. With the recent news of a 99% drop in shibarium trading activity, the sun might already be setting on Shiba Inu's dominance. Here Is Why Remittix Could Be The Primary Talk In Crypto This Year Undeniably, the crypto market is already making its way into mainstream finance. Countries such as El Salvador, Japan, and the US are already taking a strong position with cryptocurrency, and it is only a matter of time before it becomes a global currency. However, solutions around its payment integration and remittance are still in their early phases. The Remittix approach to crypto payment allows users to freely send money to different corners of the world, which is delivered directly into the receiver's account. This solution takes the best parts of the traditional banking system, creating ease with FIAT, and mixes them with the decentralization and security of the blockchain. The word in town is that Remittix is the future of crypto payment, as it delivers payment faster and at a lower fee. The ongoing Remittix token presale has become the center of all discussions this year, with over 5x in returns over the last few weeks. But there is more to come with this new token , as experts believe the launch could even bring more growth of over 50x this year, breaking all presale records. Now is a good time to take advantage of this new token, which is still in an ongoing presale round. Check the links below for information on how to buy.

Spotlight on Chainlink (LINK) and Litecoin (LTC) as potential risers. This article dives into insights from experts. Are these coins set for a bullish trend? Readers will discover whether these digital assets are primed for significant growth and what factors could drive their success. Chainlink's Price Journey: Short-Term Dips and Long-Term Growth Chainlink saw a sharp decline of 26.89% over the last month, marking recent market volatility. Over the past six months, however, it surged 49.04%, showing strong long-term growth. The performance changes signal fluctuating investor sentiment and shifting market dynamics. Price trends have adjusted significantly over different durations. Currently, Chainlink trades between 10.20 and 22.70 dollars. Resistance appears near 30.59 dollars and higher at 43.10 dollars, while support holds around 5.58 dollars. Market signals hint at a slight bearish tilt with momentum indicators below neutral. Traders can explore buying opportunities near support levels or await a breakout above resistance for short-term plays. Litecoin Market Pulse: Short-term Dip Amid Strong Long-Term Rally Last month saw Litecoin fall by nearly 6%, alongside a weekly drop exceeding 10%. Despite this short-term weakness, the coin's performance over the past six months reveals a remarkable 55% gain, highlighting a strong long-term recovery. This contrast between immediate declines and extended resilience suggests that the overall upward trend remains intact, even as recent fluctuations create challenges for short-term traders. Currently, Litecoin trades between $92.68 and $151.78, with key resistance at $175.54 and a higher barrier at $234.65. The nearest support stands at $57.33. Bears currently dominate the market with negative momentum and oscillator readings. However, the RSI at 38.20 indicates a possibility for a bounce. Traders may want to monitor these levels for potential signs of a reversal or further breakdown. Conclusion Experts believe that LINK and LTC show potential for growth this month. Both coins have unique features that make them attractive to investors. LINK benefits from its role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data. LTC offers faster transaction times and lower fees. Market conditions and investor interest will play crucial roles in their performance. Watching key indicators can provide insights into their future movements. High trading volumes and positive market sentiments could drive prices up. Overall, LINK and LTC may experience significant activity and potential price increases this month. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg , this omission indicates that crypto is not a personal priority for Trump. “If it was a personal priority, then it would have been in the speech,” Seiberg wrote in a note on Wednesday. Trump sidelines crypto in speech, signaling political strategy or low priority The exclusion particularly stood out since Trump had referenced crypto in prior speeches and on social media just days before the Congress address, according to Seiberg. He views the exclusion as “more substantive” than Trump’s silence on other topics like housing and banking, given that the president does have a crypto strategy. Seiberg highlighted a political rationale for Trump’s omission of crypto in the speech, noting that congressional Republicans seek Democratic support for stablecoin legislation in the coming months. Trump’s involvement could complicate that effort. However, he also proposed a more nuanced reason — Trump does not view crypto as a central issue in his broader political agenda. “Trump talks up crypto when he is before crypto investors. Yet we continue to believe this is not a personal priority,” Seiberg said. Generally, Trump’s speech was “long on showmanship and short on substance for even a Donald Trump address,” according to Seiberg. “As many commentators noted last night, the address more resembled a campaign rally speech than a State of the Union speech.” The White House is set to hold its first Crypto Summit on Friday, led by Trump’s crypto czar, David Sacks. Industry leaders such as Michael Saylor and Brian Armstrong are expected to attend, with reports suggesting the event may reveal details about a U.S. crypto reserve. Crypto prices rally after Trump backs five coins for ‘Crypto reserve The president’s address, spanning a record 99 minutes, served as a defiant sales pitch for the policies Trump championed during his campaign and doubled down on in his first weeks back in office. He vowed to continue enacting sweeping changes to rescue the nation from what he described as his predecessor’s destruction and missteps. Throughout the speech, he rarely addressed the American people directly, who are grappling with recent upheavals, while repeatedly taking jabs at the Democratic lawmakers seated before him. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the Democratic response after Trump’s speech, said, “America wants change, but there’s a responsible way to make change and a reckless way, and we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy.” Though Trump did not mention cryptocurrency in his Congressional speech on Tuesday night, he recently revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he says he’d like to be included in a new strategic reserve to make the US “the Crypto Capital of the World. “ The market prices of the five coins he named – Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano – swiftly jumped after the announcement. During Trump’s presidential campaign, he aggressively courted the crypto community. The previous US president, Joe Biden, had overseen a crypto crackdown due to fraud and money laundering concerns.

Speaking in parliament on the 4th of March, she noted that the regulation of cryptocurrency is complicated due to its anonymous features and is advantageous to criminals. “Our advice to the public is to stay away from cryptocurrencies. The risk of getting burned is high, and if you become a victim of a scam, the chances of getting any of your money back are slim,” said Sun Xueling. Singaporeans suffered 1.1 billion yuan losses from scams last year, 70% more than in the same period last year. Such frauds included those involving cryptocurrency and contributed to a quarter of the losses incurred. With the increased use of cryptocurrencies, criminals are now using it to compel victims to withdraw their money into digital money so that it can hardly be traced. Cybercriminals and phishing attacks have also led to the loss of money from users’ digital wallets. Though the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates local crypto operations under the Payment Services Act, most exchanges and wallets are outside its jurisdiction. Sun remarked that even professional investors have fallen to the tricks of these fraudsters. Calls for tougher fraud penalties The question as to whether penalties for fraud should be more severe was also discussed. Jurong GRC MP Dr Tan Yew Meng opined that Singapore has overly lenient laws at present. While moneylenders who handle $10,000 worth of illicit money face caning, fraudsters who steal much larger sums can go scot-free. He even advocated for compulsory caning in cases where the fraud offence is considered severe. His statements demonstrate a rising concern that regulators have voiced in recent years about the rising number of crypto scams. Sun reported that at present, the government is examining the legislative measures against fraud and increasing some of the offences that can attract caning. She mentioned that more than 80% of the victims of the scam willingly transferred the money to the fraudster through impersonation, pretence of authority or fake promises of financial gains. To reduce this threat, the Singapore government has recently passed the Anti-Fraud Protection Bill. The law, however, allows authorities to block the assets of such victims in case they do not heed the threats. It is anticipated that this should be implemented this year. However, to date, there has not been a policy amendment with regard to some of these concerns. But it should be noted that according to local media reports, new regulations might be introduced soon. However, despite the fraud cases, cryptocurrency use is rising in Singapore. Singapore’s central bank doubled the number of licenses in the market in 2024 to improve stability.

Qubetics ($TICS) aims to do just that, offering solutions to real-world problems that previous platforms have struggled to address. Its innovative features and practical applications position it as a strong contender for those seeking the best crypto for quick profit.​ Meanwhile, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) has introduced the ASI-1 Mini, a Web3-native large language model designed to support complex agentic workflows. This development opens new avenues for the Web3 community to invest in, train, and own advanced AI models. In this article, we will delve into how Qubetics ($TICS) addresses real-life challenges unmet by its predecessors, positioning itself to meet the future demands of blockchain and digital finance.​ Qubetics: Pioneering Practical Blockchain Solutions Qubetics is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to tackle real-world issues through its comprehensive ecosystem. One of its standout features is the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which simplifies blockchain development for businesses, professionals, and individuals. This user-friendly platform enables seamless creation of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and other blockchain-based solutions.​ The QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for those looking to develop blockchain solutions without extensive coding knowledge. It offers a drag-and-drop interface, pre-built templates, and real-time testing environments, making blockchain development accessible to a broader audience. For instance, a small business can create a supply chain management system using QubeQode, ensuring transparency and efficiency without the need for a dedicated development team. Similarly, artists can tokenize their work, creating unique digital assets and opening new revenue streams. These practical applications demonstrate how Qubetics is poised to become the best crypto for quick profit.​ Qubetics is in its 24th crypto presale stage, having raised over $14.6 million from more than 22,200 token holders, with over 495 Million $TICS tokens sold. The current price per $TICS token is $0.0976, with projections suggesting a potential increase to $0.25 by the end of the presale. This growth trajectory indicates a significant return on investment for early participants, further solidifying Qubetics’ position as a top choice for those seeking quick profits in the crypto market. ​ If you invest $1,000 in $TICS at its current price of $0.0976 per token, you would receive approximately 10,245 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, your investment will grow to $2,561, yielding a 156% ROI. Should the price hit $1 after the presale, your holdings would be worth $10,240, reflecting a 924% ROI. If $TICS surges to $5, your investment would skyrocket to $51,200, achieving a 5,019% ROI. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance: Merging AI and Blockchain The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) represents a collaboration between leading blockchain-AI projects: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. This alliance aims to advance decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and, ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The recent introduction of the ASI-1 Mini, a Web3-native large language model, marks a significant milestone in this endeavor.​ The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token has faced a challenging market environment, with reports labeling it among the worst-performing altcoins of the year. Previously known as Fetch.ai (FET), ASI had shown an 8% gain as of mid-February, trading at $0.755, but recent trends indicate a decline. On the technology front, the introduction of ASI-1 Mini has provided Web3 users with new opportunities to invest in and train advanced AI models. Meanwhile, industry leaders such as Sam Altman continue to explore the potential of artificial superintelligence to surpass human capabilities across multiple domains, further shaping discussions around its future. SUI: Navigating Market Volatility SUI has recently experienced significant market fluctuations. Over the past 24 hours, its price plummeted by approximately 21%, reaching around $2.34. This sharp decline aligns with a broader market downturn, with the CoinDesk 20 Index down by 3.9%. Additionally, SUI has seen outflows exceeding $600 million from its ecosystem, contributing to a 17% price drop. Technical analyses suggest potential further declines, possibly towards the $1 mark, if key support levels fail.​ SUI unlocked approximately 40.63 million tokens, accounting for 1.28% of its current circulation and valued at around $117 million. Such token unlocks can increase supply and exert downward pressure on prices. Despite recent challenges, some analysts remain optimistic. Predictions suggest that SUI could reach a $10 billion market cap, driven by institutional adoption and ecosystem expansion. However, these forecasts are speculative and subject to market conditions. Participants are advised to exercise caution, monitor market trends, and consider both technical analyses and fundamental developments when evaluating SUI’s potential.​ Conclusion: Seizing Opportunities in Emerging Cryptos Qubetics stands out as a promising platform addressing real-world challenges with practical blockchain solutions. Its innovative features, such as the QubeQode IDE, make it accessible to a wide range of users, from businesses to individual creators. The ongoing presale and projected growth present a compelling opportunity for those seeking the best crypto for quick profit .

Speaking at an American Bar Association event in Miami today, SEC acting enforcement director Antonia Apps and CFTC enforcement director Brian Young noted that enforcement will remain a priority even amid broader policy changes. “You can expect to see some changes depending on priorities and different policies that we may pursue,” Apps said, “but we will move forward with the core enforcement agenda that we have always moved forward with.” The statements come at a time when both regulatory agencies are undergoing significant transformations under Republican leadership. Since late January, the SEC has been reviewing its cryptocurrency enforcement policies, while the CFTC has been restructuring its enforcement division. Related News: Analytics Company Shares 7 ""Most Negative"" Altcoins According to Funding Rates The comments were made at a government enforcement conference focused on white-collar crime, where Justice Department officials reportedly withdrew from speaking because of ongoing changes and turmoil within the Justice Department. Both Apps and Young voiced strong support for enforcement personnel, who are facing mass layoffs and budget cuts as the administration, along with special adviser Elon Musk, seeks to reshape the federal workforce. “In addition to doing a great job, the CFTC enforcement staff are genuinely good people,” Young said. “I think the taxpayers should be indebted to them for what they do for us every day.” Young also noted that the agency prioritizes cases that have a strong likelihood of returning funds to victims of fraud or market manipulation. One of the most notable policy changes came at the SEC, which has paused or dropped active litigation and investigations related to cryptocurrencies. When asked about the future of crypto enforcement, Apps reiterated that the agency will continue to pursue cases involving fraud and clear regulatory jurisdiction. “We're not walking away,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The ministry said the National Welfare Fund (NWF)’s level of liquid funds should be topped up to reach a level equivalent to 7-10% of Russia’s GDP before Moscow considers buying “riskier” assets like crypto. Russian Crypto Reserve: Could Moscow Start Buying BTC? Per the Russian media outlets Interfax and RBC , the claims came from the Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev, who claimed that the ministry “is not currently considering” buying or holding crypto in the NWF “due to its high volatility.” Vladimir Kolychev, the Russian Deputy Finance Minister. (Source: Katerina Vorontsova/YouTube/Screenshot) When questioned on the matter, Kolychev said that the ministry would “not” make changes in the structure of the NWF’s investments. He said that the fund would continue to focus exclusively on gold and Chinese yuan holdings. Media outlets say that 60% of the fund is made up of yuan, with the remaining 40% in gold reserves. Gold bars embossed with a stamp that reads “Russia.” (Source: Kapital Strany/YouTube/Screenshot) However, Kolychev said it would be “possible to consider riskier assets” when the NWF reaches Moscow’s 7%-10% target. “When we get there, we will be able to think about different assets, including crypto. However, for now, the volatility signs are not favorable.” Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev Kolychev added that Russia is still “far” from reaching its desired levels of reserves. And that is why Moscow will only countenance buying gold and yuan reserves for the time being. We Need Liquidity, Says Deputy Finance Chief The Deputy Finance Minister said the fund’s assets “must be liquid and not subject to sharp revaluations.” He added: “When we sell our reserves, the sales should not result in us receiving 50 kopeks for each ruble we invested, instead of a ruble for each ruble’s worth of our assets.” The comments come just months after Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told university students who asked him about creating a Russian crypto reserve that the Treasury needed to “earn less, but keep its powder dry.” Trump pivots to the war in Ukraine and his talks with Russia. Trump says he has gotten “strong signals” from Russia that Moscow is ready for peace. “Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” Trump asks. Latest updates: https://t.co/vDJlBJzZHe pic.twitter.com/kVlCxo25W9 — Bloomberg (@business) March 5, 2025 Central Bank’s Final Say Kolychev concluded by saying that he was not party to any “discussions about creating a cryptocurrency reserve in Russia” similar to Washington’s own strategic crypto reserve fund. He claimed that final decisions on such matters would be taken by the Russian Central Bank. As previously reported, the Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina is a known crypto-skeptic . Nabiullina has tried on multiple occasions to orchestrate a total, China-style ban on crypto in Russia.

A recent post by cryptocurrency researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) emphasized how this system was implemented to eliminate uncertainty about XRP’s future supply and prevent concerns over centralized control. The discussion, accompanied by a highlighted excerpt from Ripple’s 2017 announcement, has reignited conversations about how XRP’s escrow functions and its broader implications. “Ripple’s Escrow Safeguards XRP’s Price” Ripple’s escrow system was designed to eliminate uncertainty about XRP’s future supply. By locking up a significant portion of XRP, Ripple ensured the market wouldn’t be concerned about centralized control over its distribution. … pic.twitter.com/5fk9ZjQjkG — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) March 3, 2025 The Purpose of Ripple’s Escrow According to Ripple’s 2017 statement, the company locked 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow system, releasing a maximum of 1 billion XRP per month over 55 months. As Ripple stated, the purpose, was “to remove uncertainty around XRP’s future supply” and ensure that a large quantity would not enter the market at once, preventing drastic price fluctuations. This strategy was designed to establish predictability in XRP’s distribution and counter fears of market oversupply. XRP Allocation from Escrow SMQKE’s post reiterated that the primary use of released XRP is “to incentivize market makers for XRP-based currency exchanges and for sales to institutional investors—not retail.” This aligns with Ripple’s original announcement, which stated that XRP would facilitate liquidity by offering “tighter spreads between currency pairs” and would also be sold to institutional investors. Unused XRP at the end of each month is returned to escrow, extending the timeline for its eventual release. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The post directly counters claims that Ripple’s escrow is a means to dump XRP on retail investors. SMQKE argued that if Ripple were indiscriminately “dumping” XRP from escrow, its price would be significantly lower. The structured and controlled release mechanism prevents sudden supply shocks that could negatively impact XRP’s market performance. Speculation on XRP’s Role in Broader Economic Strategy An X user, Wolfemother, commented on the post, speculating on a potential future use case for Ripple’s escrowed XRP . They proposed that it could be utilized as part of a “government’s strategic crypto reserve,” suggesting that the total escrowed XRP—amounting to 37 billion—could reach a value of $1,000 per XRP, equating to $37 trillion, roughly aligning with the U.S. national debt. While speculative, such theories reflect ongoing discussions about the long-term implications of Ripple’s escrow model and whether XRP could help global financial structures. As discussions continue, the system remains a key component of XRP’s market structure, negating the claims of indiscriminate token sales while also fueling broader speculation about its role in the financial ecosystem.

As 2025 unfolds, selecting the right assets could make a significant difference in building a profitable portfolio. While established tokens maintain their dominance, newer projects are introducing compelling solutions that could shape the future of blockchain technology. This guide highlights some of the most promising cryptos for 2025. Each has been analyzed based on recent developments, current performance, and long-term growth potential. From decentralized e-commerce platforms to blockchain protocols advancing decentralization, these are the projects to keep an eye on. 1. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is revolutionizing online shopping by creating a direct marketplace between buyers and sellers using blockchain technology. By removing intermediaries, the platform reduces transaction costs and enhances user privacy. Its presale has gained significant attention, with the 3BAY token currently priced at $0.00524 in its 5th stage, raising over $1.54 million. Analysts anticipate a launch price of $0.1959, potentially offering early investors a 4,200% return. The roadmap for 2025 outlines several key milestones, including full decentralization by Q4 and the introduction of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to involve the community in decision-making. Plans to integrate PayPal and other payment systems are also in motion. With its blend of practical application and strong demand, Web3Bay presents an opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential in the crypto market. 2. Near Protocol: Advancing Blockchain Accessibility Near Protocol (NEAR) continues to innovate, becoming the first non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain to integrate with MetaMask. This connection, facilitated through the NEAR Snap feature, enables seamless account creation and transactions within MetaMask, making blockchain interactions more user-friendly. Currently trading at $3.29 after a slight 2.37% decline, Near Protocol remains focused on scalability and ease of use. With growing adoption in decentralized applications (dApps) and enhanced interoperability, NEAR has the potential to solidify its place among the most promising projects for 2025. 3. Pi Coin: A Community-Powered Ecosystem Pi Coin (PI) has gained attention for its mobile-first mining approach, allowing users to participate in blockchain activities through their smartphones. With a community of over 35 million, Pi Network has generated widespread discussion, particularly following recent speculation about a possible Binance listing. In a community vote on Binance Square, 86.2% of participants supported the listing of PI, although Binance has stated that this is not yet confirmed. Despite its strong user base, potential investors should be mindful of ongoing concerns regarding the project’s legitimacy. Chinese authorities have issued warnings about possible risks related to data privacy. Those considering Pi Coin should thoroughly research before making investment decisions. 4. Hyperliquid: Innovating Decentralized Trading Hyperliquid (HYPE) is gaining traction in decentralized finance (DeFi) with its perpetual trading platform. Recent upgrades include AI-driven trading tools and zero-slippage order execution, improving efficiency and user experience. Over the past month, HYPE has risen by 23%, fueled by increasing trading volumes and platform enhancements. To further strengthen its position, the Hyperliquid Foundation is addressing transparency concerns regarding validator operations. With advanced trading features and a focus on improving accessibility, Hyperliquid is well-positioned for continued growth in 2025. 5. Chainlink: Leading Cross-Chain Data Integration Chainlink (LINK) remains a key player in the blockchain ecosystem, offering critical services for connecting smart contracts with real-world data. Its oracles facilitate seamless data transfers, supporting numerous decentralized applications. Recent updates have focused on expanding staking options and increasing institutional adoption. Although LINK’s price has seen an 18% drop, now sitting at $16.43, its fundamental technology remains strong. With continued developments and integrations, Chainlink presents a viable option for those seeking stability and innovation in their crypto portfolio. Final Thoughts Choosing the right cryptocurrencies involves weighing potential growth against associated risks. Web3Bay offers a fresh approach to e-commerce, while Near Protocol’s technological improvements make blockchain interactions more accessible. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s trading advancements and Chainlink’s role in data connectivity highlight the broad range of opportunities available. Investors should stay informed and track emerging trends to make strategic decisions. Whether looking for high-growth opportunities or established stability, these projects represent some of the most promising options for 2025.

Plus, Insights on DOGE Price Rally & ADA Price Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/achievement-unlocked-inter-milan-boosts-blockdags-presale-to-200m-plus-insights-on-doge-price-rally-ada-price-surge/,"The crypto market is delivering a new kind of excitement, and traders are all in. The Dogecoin price rally is causing a stir on the charts, while the latest Cardano (ADA) price surge is fueling discussions about whether it will break through key resistance. Also, the buzz about ETF approvals and mainstream interest keeps expectations high for both currencies. BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves on social media, partly due to its collaboration with Inter Milan, which has proven to be a catalyst for its presale success. The initiative has amassed over $200 million, selling 18.7 billion coins. BlockDAG’s social media presence has swelled to about 226,000 followers, positioning it as today’s top bullish crypto. Dogecoin Price Rally Gains Momentum Amid ETF Speculation DOGE has reached $0.2793 as the Dogecoin price rally draws more eyes, with its trading volume up by 38.41% at $2.34 billion. Analysts predict that surpassing the 0.618 Fibonacci level might send Dogecoin to a possible high of $2.30. A significant driver of the Dogecoin price rally is the short squeeze that wiped out over 28 million DOGE from short positions, causing a sharp price increase. The SEC’s nod to Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF proposal also boosts the sentiment. Analysts suggest this might open doors for broader market participation, potentially stabilizing DOGE in the long run. Cardano (ADA) Price Surge Encounters Resistance at $0.98 The Cardano (ADA) price surge has injected optimism among ADA supporters, with analysts suggesting it could hit $1.35 if it overcomes existing barriers. Currently, ADA is priced around $0.7719, with a slight 3% dip over the past day but showing promise for a recovery. A strong upward Cardano (ADA) price surge could emerge if ADA can rise above $0.9837, seen by analysts as a crucial milestone. If this is achieved, ADA could potentially climb to $1.16 and further to $1.35. The growing interest from the market has seen ADA attract $4.4 million in the past month while Bitcoin and Ethereum faced significant withdrawals. The anticipation of a Cardano ETF continues to bolster ADA’s longer-term prospects. BlockDAG’s Partnership with Inter Milan Catalyzes Presale Success BlockDAG is swiftly gaining attention in the cryptocurrency sphere, greatly aided by its partnership with Inter Milan . This collaboration is not merely about brand visibility; it’s about introducing BlockDAG to millions of soccer enthusiasts, effectively narrowing the divide between cryptocurrency and popular culture. This increased visibility is enhancing BlockDAG’s credibility and accelerating its presale activities. BlockDAG’s success is evident in the numbers, with the presale amassing a staggering $200 million and distributing over 18.7 billion coins. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, early participants have reaped a 2,380% ROI—a commendable achievement for a project still in the presale stage. This partnership has also significantly expanded BlockDAG’s social media presence, with notable increases across platforms like Telegram (71.7K), X (108.1K), Discord (20.7K), and Instagram (25.4K). Analysts are optimistic that this increased exposure will hasten the growth of BlockDAG’s ecosystem and cement its future prospects. The combination of widespread visibility and robust community engagement distinguishes BlockDAG as it continues to grow its network. Some analysts even suggest that the presale might eventually exceed $600 million due to the soaring demand for BlockDAG. Both retail and more organized interest are on the rise, indicating that BlockDAG is more than just another coin; it’s becoming a significant movement. Final Say The cryptocurrency market is ripe with new possibilities, with Dogecoin’s price rally and the anticipation of an ETF driving sustained trader interest, while Cardano’s price surge and increased attention are fueling discussions on ADA’s potential to overcome significant resistance levels. Amidst this, BlockDAG is carving out a notable niche for itself with the help of its Inter Milan partnership, which is greatly advancing its crypto presale and bolstering its social media footprint. Having already secured over $200 million, BlockDAG is reinforcing its status as a top bullish crypto. The community is keenly watching their BDAG holdings appreciate as the project captures the attention of a growing audience.

41209217,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=687702,1741219246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41209217.jpeg,Trump advisers start mapping out a plan for a national crypto reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-advisers-start-mapping-out-a-plan-for-a-national-crypto-reserve/,"President Donald Trump’s administration has officially started executing plans for its federal crypto strategic reserve, and step one is figuring out exactly how much crypto the US government already owns, according to a report from the Journal. A month into a six-month planning phase, Trump’s interagency working group is reportedly doing a full audit of existing crypto holdings, which include assets seized from criminals. Trump first floated the idea of a government-backed crypto stockpile last summer during his campaign, and in January, he signed an executive order to begin laying the foundation. Bo Hines, executive director of the working group, confirmed the process was underway, saying , “The first thing we have to do is get an accounting of what the government has. We’ll provide more insight as that continues.” Trump is expected to give a speech about the initiative on Friday at a White House industry summit, where more details will probably come. White House team counts up government-owned crypto The Justice Department and US Marshals Service oversee billions of dollars in confiscated Bitcoin and other crypto assets, mostly taken from criminals. According to the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, $18 billion worth of Bitcoin is sitting in government-controlled wallets, though accounting issues have made it unclear how much is actually secured. As part of the new plan, officials are now tallying up these holdings to determine whether they will become part of the official crypto reserve. What’s still unclear is whether the administration will also buy new crypto for the reserve. If they do, Congress might need to approve large acquisitions. There’s also the question of who exactly will oversee the stockpile—whether the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, or a newly created agency. Right now, no federal entity is set up to manage a crypto reserve of this scale. Trump’s push for a government crypto reserve has divided analysts and investors alike. Supporters say it could legitimize digital assets and integrate them into the country’s financial system. Crypto advocates have poured millions into Trump’s campaign and inauguration in efforts to make the reserve a reality. But critics argue that crypto isn’t comparable to gold or oil, which are two assets commonly stockpiled by governments. Gene Hoffman, CEO of blockchain firm Chia Network, doesn’t think the US should be making these calls yet. “The United States government shouldn’t be making this call yet,” he said . Others warn that the extreme volatility of crypto could turn a government reserve into a financial disaster if prices crash. Timothy Massad, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, believes Trump’s plan could be more about paying back campaign supporters than actual financial strategy. “It concerns me that it is a payback for their support of Trump and the Republican Party,” Massad said. Meanwhile, Bitcoin momentarily surged 10% after Trump’s announcement, proving just how much influence he has over the market. Financial advisers in the UK and US are reporting a spike in clients asking about crypto investments. Why people are concerned about Trump’s crypto plans One of the biggest issues with a government-controlled crypto reserve is security. Crypto is a prime target for hackers, and federal agencies haven’t always been great at keeping track of what they already have. The US Marshals Service has struggled to manage seized crypto, and with $18 billion in Bitcoin alone, the potential for mismanagement is quite high. Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital warned that security needs to be a top priority. He recommended keeping assets stored in cold wallets with private keys only accessible under strict controls. “There will need to be some careful consideration about how the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are held and how they are held securely,” McCauley said. Cryptos are difficult to safeguard because they are targeted by sophisticated hackers, putting a premium on cybersecurity measures for crypto exchanges and custodians that hold assets. Bybit, one of the world’s biggest exchanges, recently saw the hacker group Lazarus stole over $1.4 billion in Ethereum from its cold wallets. “Criminals have stolen tokens worth $1.5 billion from the crypto exchange Bybit, prompting a rush of customers demanding their funds back,” Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said. He compared it to the final chaotic hours of FTX, where mass withdrawals led to a complete collapse. “Although Bybit claims to be stable, the developments evoke memories of the chaotic final hours of the now-defunct FTX exchange.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

More and more people are approaching me. If it’s profitable for us, let’s do it. We have excess electricity. Let them produce this cryptocurrency and so on,” Lukashenko told Alexei Kushnarenko, Belarus’s newly appointed energy minister, as reported by local media outlet Belta. Belarus considers crypto mining amid rising global interest in digital reserves This President of Belarus suggestion emerges as the U.S. government is studying the possibility of creating a national strategic crypto reserve that could include assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Lukashenko acknowledged the White House’s growing interest in digital assets, stating, “You see the direction the world is taking, especially the largest economy. They announced yesterday that they will maintain a crypto reserve.” “Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves,” Lukashenko said . Belarus wouldn’t be the first nation to mine digital assets. The Kingdom of Bhutan, with its abundance of hydropower, already has more than 100 megawatts (MW) of operational bitcoin mining infrastructure and is set to get another 500MW worth of power online. The country currently holds $950 million in Bitcoin, according to Arkham Intelligence. El Salvador on the other hand uses geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin, though in smaller quantities. Trump pushes crypto strategy forward with first-ever summit Even with the Trump administration’s promises and enthusiasm, the industry has been left disappointed by meme coin scandals and a lack of concrete government action—aside from the dismissal of a few SEC cases and the release of a somewhat ambiguous Executive Order on January 23. That disappointment, however, just got a temporary lift. Two days ago, the White House announced it would hold its first-ever crypto summit this Friday, chaired by White House A.I. & Crypto Czar David Sacks and overseen by Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reports that the roundtable, scheduled from 6:30 pm to 10:30 pm UTC, is expected to include more than 25 participants, including members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets. As of Wednesday morning, Terrett reported that 11 crypto executives and two White House representatives had confirmed their attendance. However, it seems Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson is not invited to the Summit on Friday, according to a White House source familiar with the guest list. In fact, neither Hoskinson nor any representatives for Cardano have been invited to meet with the president since the inauguration. Many in the community had also taken X posts from Hoskinson in February to mean he would attend a fundraising dinner for pro-crypto PAC MAGA Inc. this past Saturday. As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, excitement is building within the crypto community. This marks progress toward the Executive Order’s goals of bolstering U.S. leadership in digital assets and financial technology while safeguarding economic freedom. However, for a president who closely ties stock market performance to his success, the summit’s announcement alone likely fell short. That may explain why Trump took it a step further, unveiling the first five tokens set to be included in a future crypto reserve: Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, Ripple, and Solana. Trump’s social media posts offer little additional detail on the planned “reserve,” as he referred to it in his Sunday posts. However, the choice of the word “reserve” appears to signal a shift from the administration’s stance in January’s Executive Order. The term “reserve” suggests that the government will proactively purchase more assets. In contrast, the intention stated in January’s executive order to “evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile” would be more about holding onto the $19.1 billion in crypto, 97.9% of which is in Bitcoin, that it already has from seizures across dozens of tokens.

Describing this disparity as “value asymmetry,” the report points out that Solana’s DeFi sector is growing faster and generating more revenue than Ethereum’s, but its tokens remain relatively undervalued. “Solana DeFi valuation multiples are trading lower than their Ethereum counterparts on average despite their significantly higher growth profiles, highlighting a distinct valuation asymmetry,” the report said. Franklin Templeton conducted an analysis comparing five leading Ethereum-based DeFi projects (LDO, AAVE, ENA, MKR, and UNI) to five of Solana’s top-performing protocols (JTO, JUP, KMNO, MNDE, and RAY). The findings showed that Solana projects experienced a staggering 2,400% median growth in fees year-over-year and a median valuation multiple of 9x. In contrast, Ethereum projects saw a more modest growth of 150% and a multiple of 18x. Related News: Analytics Company Shares 7 ""Most Negative"" Altcoins According to Funding Rates This valuation disparity follows a period of rapid expansion for Solana. The network’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have witnessed a surge in trading activity, led primarily by memecoin investors. In January 2025, Solana’s DEXs recorded higher trading volumes than the entire Ethereum ecosystem combined. “DeFi may be entering an era of Solana Virtual Machine dominance, moving away from the historical reign of EVM-based DeFi,” the report said. However, Franklin Templeton clarified that this does not indicate Ethereum’s decline. Instead, the firm noted that the increased activity on Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solutions indicates the strategic evolution of the network. “The shift of activity to layer-2 blockchains is evidence that the Ethereum scaling approach is advancing incrementally,” the report said. Despite the current undervaluation of Solana-based DeFi assets, Franklin Templeton predicted that this disparity may not last forever. “As Solana continues to demonstrate its resilience as a decentralized computing platform, the market may soon price blue-chip, cornerstone Solana DeFi protocols in line with comparable Ethereum protocols,” the report concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Needless to say, the Pepe coin’s speculative mania might not be over despite a downturn of over 35% in the last 30 days. However, Rollblock’s presale is changing the GambleFi sector, raising over $10.8 million in a move that makes RBLK a compelling alternative to speculative meme coins. Analysts already forecast a 100x uptick on launch for RBLK. Pepe’s market performance and risks PEPE’s meme coin hype has persisted since its launch, as the coin surged from a market cap of about $517 million to above $11 billion. Those who bought into Pepe even as early as January 2024 have managed to accumulate a 10x gain. However, past performance is never a guarantee of future results in the world of meme coins. Pepe coin’s recent dips have sparked a wave of uncertainty among holders. Traders who once saw Pepe coin as an easy path to quick profits are starting to exit their positions.

Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, boldly claims a looming debt crisis and calls it a “potential heart attack.” In a statement, Dalio argued that once we reach a point in the cycle where one borrows more money to service debt and bond holders say that it’s risky, it becomes a “debt debt spiral.” Dalio compares the current debt crisis to a heart attack waiting to happen if authorities fail to provide interventions. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Won’t Stop At $150K’ This Year, Research Firm Chief Says Understanding The Current US Debt Issue Dalio’s insights on the current economic landscape and the country’s looming debt crisis come as the crypto market cap drops to $2.76 trillion in one day. During the market shakeoff this week, the overall crypto market cap dropped by 8%, with Ethereum and Bitcoin leading the losers with 11% and 8%, respectively. The US is currently facing a growing debt and excessive budget deficits. According to recent data, the country’s national debt is now $33.6 trillion, with a massive deficit of $1.7 trillion in 2023, equal to 5.8% of the total GDP. Researchers are also warning about the increasing cost of servicing the debt, hitting $879 billion in 2023, comparable to the size of the country’s budget for national defense. Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences. pic.twitter.com/MbBpHO76mN — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) February 6, 2018 Dalio Says Alternative Stores Of Value Can Help In an interview on the Odds Lots podcast, Dalio offered insights on how the general public responds to an economic crisis. He mentioned that in times of economic uncertainties, many investors are looking at alternative stores of value. Dalio asks: What’s an alternative to money with a stable supply? He mentioned the growing role of Bitcoin and digital assets as leverage against inflation. “Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences.” he added. Dalio’s insights followed US President Trump’s announcement on the proposed US strategic reserve, which includes top coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, and Cardano. Trump’s statement was followed by a spike in crypto prices, with Bitcoin surging to over $90k after revisiting $80k. While Bitcoin’s price surged for the day, its dominance dipped from 55.4% to 50%, reflecting the shift in capital to altcoins. Historically, a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance catalyzes an altcoin run, which now excites many on social media. Is Bitcoin The Answer? Although Ray Dalio didn’t categorically mention Bitcoin as the “potential savior”, his recent statements suggest a favorable view on the premier digital asset. Due to its decentralization, Dalio highlighted the asset’s potential as a hedge against economic uncertainties.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,000 followers on the social media platform X that the XRP against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC) pair is flashing a bearish divergence on the weekly chart. Traders keep a close eye on coins flashing a bearish divergence as the signal suggests the token is losing bullish momentum and may be ready to enter a downtrend. Bluntz also notes that XRP appears to be in the midst of an ABC correction against the US dollar. “Looks increasingly like that was a complacency shoulder B wave on XRP in my opinion. If BTC and SOL taught me anything the last month, do not fade the weekly bear divs.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that an asset tends to go through an ABC pullback after completing a five-wave rally. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will fall to the $1 area to complete the ABC correction. At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.46. In January, when BTC was trading above $100,000, Bluntz said that Bitcoin appears to have completed a five-wave rally and that a market top may be in. He later updated his outlook and said that Bitcoin was flashing a bearish divergence on the monthly timeframe. Last month, he told his followers that SOL looked weak after losing the $220 level while showing a bearish divergence on the two-week chart. At time of writing, BTC is trading for $87,421 and SOL is worth $144.78.
