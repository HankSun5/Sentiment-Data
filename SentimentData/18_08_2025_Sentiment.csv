Prices are swinging with market shifts, regulations are becoming clearer, and new opportunities are opening across networks. Among the digital assets gaining attention, there are a few that stand out with both strong fundamentals and explosive potential. BlockDAG, XRP, Cardano, and Solana are proving to be the top picks that could deliver big gains this year. Each of them has clear reasons why traders and long-term holders are paying close attention. From presale hype to technical momentum and real-world adoption, these projects bring both growth and credibility. Let’s break down why these names are leading the list of crypto to buy in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Power and Growth Momentum BlockDAG has quickly become one of the most talked-about names in crypto thanks to its mix of high adoption and an innovative architecture. It combines DAG technology with Proof-of-Work security, offering both speed and decentralization. On top of this, BlockDAG is fully EVM-compatible, meaning developers can bring Ethereum-based projects onto its network without hurdles. Adoption has been huge already, with over 2.5 million mobile users on its X1 miner app and more than 19,000 ASIC miners distributed worldwide, creating one of the most inclusive ecosystems in crypto. The presale has crossed $376 million and is currently in Batch 29 with BDAG priced at $0.0276. Early buyers have already seen over 2,600% paper gains, and with speculation suggesting a post-listing target of $1, the upside could be around 36× from today’s levels. This makes BlockDAG one of the most rewarding crypto to buy in 2025, as it blends short-term presale excitement with long-term network growth. Adding to the momentum, BlockDAG has rolled out a 200 ETH competition worth about $1 million, designed to fuel further community engagement and reward buyers who increase their holdings. The combination of adoption, presale success, and community-driven incentives is why investors are looking at BlockDAG as more than just another presale—it’s being seen as one of the most strategic crypto to buy in 2025. 2. XRP: Institutional Adoption Driving Price Stability XRP is trading near $3.11, with intraday highs of $3.15 and lows around $3.01, showing resilience while other large caps remain volatile. Despite sharp swings earlier in August, XRP has bounced back with gains of 1.44% recently, highlighting renewed confidence. Whale accumulation has been building, with holdings on exchanges falling to monthly lows, showing reduced selling pressure. If XRP manages to break resistance at $3.34, analysts expect a move toward $3.66 in the short term. What’s driving this interest is both technical strength and adoption. Over 6,500 U.S. pharmacies are now using XRP Ledger infrastructure for payments thanks to Wellgistics Health and RxERP, giving XRP another real-world utility case beyond cross-border finance. Institutional investors are also backing the asset, and the network’s strong liquidity ensures smoother trading. With these catalysts, XRP stands out as a credible crypto to buy in 2025, especially for those looking for both use case adoption and price growth. 3. Cardano: ETF Buzz and Whale Accumulation Cardano has been on a strong rally, currently holding around $0.90 after testing highs of $0.97. Over the last week, ADA surged more than 33%, breaking resistance levels and creating new optimism. Trading volumes are up by 45%, with whales moving over 200 million ADA into private wallets, signaling long-term confidence. This price action has been reinforced by strong ecosystem activity, with over 2,000 projects building on Cardano and daily transaction activity crossing 2.6 million. What has really boosted sentiment is the push for a Cardano spot ETF, with growing speculation that approval odds are high this year. Combined with whale accumulation and technical signals like golden cross patterns, ADA is now viewed as a serious crypto to buy in 2025. Forecasts suggest ADA could push toward $1.20–$1.50 soon, with more aggressive scenarios placing it at $3 if momentum continues. With growing DeFi TVL at $349 million and consistent developer activity, Cardano is well-positioned to compete for market share. 4. Solana: ETF Milestones and DeFi Growth Solana is trading near $187.93, with support around $186 and resistance levels tested up to $206. After recent volatility linked to inflation data, SOL has regained momentum and remains one of the strongest large-cap performers in 2025. A major development is the SEC’s acknowledgment of Invesco Galaxy’s Solana spot ETF filing, with a final decision pushed to October 16, 2025. With approval odds sitting above 90%, this milestone could bring a surge in institutional inflows, pushing SOL prices further toward the $220–$300 range. Ecosystem growth is another big driver. Solana’s DeFi TVL rose 30% in Q2 to $8.6 billion, and projects like Kamino, Jito, Marinade, and Jupiter are pulling large amounts of SOL out of circulation through staking and liquidity protocols. Daily fee payers average nearly 4 million, and infrastructure partners like MetaMask and Chainlink have expanded Solana support. With institutional interest and strong network fundamentals, Solana continues to be a high-potential crypto to buy in 2025 for those seeking growth beyond Ethereum. Final Thoughts The search for the best crypto to buy in 2025 has led investors to four strong contenders: BlockDAG, XRP, Cardano, and Solana. BlockDAG stands out with its record-breaking presale, 200 ETH competition, and hybrid DAG-PoW design that combines efficiency with decentralization. XRP continues to deliver value through growing institutional adoption and strong utility in real-world payments. Cardano is gaining momentum with ETF speculation, whale activity, and consistent ecosystem growth. Solana remains a powerhouse with expanding DeFi projects and the upcoming ETF decision expected to drive institutional inflows. Together, these projects offer both immediate opportunities and long-term potential, making them key picks for anyone serious about positioning in crypto to buy in 2025.

In just weeks, the project has raised an eye-watering $6 million, now in Stage 17 at $0.00998 per token. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, early investors are staring at a projected 3,423% ROI. But the story doesn’t end there. Across the broader market, altcoins like Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and VeChain (VET) are flashing bullish setups and expanding their ecosystems, drawing in both retail traders and institutional players. While these networks push for price breakouts, Cold Wallet’s utility-driven presale model could give it a launch-day edge few can match. Here’s how each contender stacks up and why timing your entry could make all the difference. Cold Wallet: Utility-Driven Growth Meets Presale Hype Cold Wallet (CWT) isn’t just running a presale; it’s building a wallet revolution. Having already raised $6 million, the project’s Stage 17 pricing sits at $0.00998 per token, with launch locked in at $0.3517. That’s a potential 3,423% ROI for those who secure tokens before the final stages close. What makes it a contender for the best crypto presale is pure utility. Instead of charging users for gas, swaps, and transfers, Cold Wallet rewards them in CWT, turning crypto’s most dreaded fees into income. And with its $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, it has inherited a user base of over 2 million before even hitting the market. With competitors like MetaMask and Trust Wallet facing UI complaints, Cold Wallet’s streamlined, cashback-powered approach could capture significant market share fast. Each stage pushes token prices higher, meaning hesitation now could cut deep into potential returns. Stellar: Technical Breakouts Meet Network Expansion Stellar (XLM) has been on a tear, breaking out of both a falling wedge and a descending channel. Prices have surged from $0.25 to $0.40 before consolidating near $0.44. Analysts suggest that a confirmed breakout above $0.47 could send XLM toward $0.6374 in the coming weeks. Beyond the charts, Stellar is quietly building a network advantage. Its ecosystem now boasts nearly 10 million accounts, adding 5,000–6,000 addresses daily. Historically, such steady adoption precedes major price surges. While it’s not the best crypto presale candidate, its combination of strong fundamentals and bullish technicals makes it one to watch. Hedera: Whale Accumulation and Institutional Buzz Hedera (HBAR) recently rallied 3.26% to $0.27, breaking past the $0.2635 resistance level. With an RSI of 58.9 and moving averages supporting an uptrend, analysts see short-term potential toward $0.2856 and a longer-term range between $1.50 and $2.00. What’s fueling this momentum? Whale accumulation is strong, TVL on Hedera’s network is climbing, and Elliott Wave patterns point to sustained bullishness. Adding to the excitement, Grayscale’s ETF filing that includes HBAR could spark institutional inflows. While not competing in the best crypto presale arena, Hedera’s mix of technical strength and growing adoption signals it could be gearing up for a multi-phase rally. VeChain: Bullish Cup-and-Handle Formation VeChain (VET) is flashing a classic cup-and-handle pattern, testing resistance at $0.043 after a 5.2% daily gain. A breakout here could push prices toward $0.050 and then $0.055. Recent price action shows resilience, rebounding from $0.022 to over $0.0255 before grinding higher. While VET hasn’t been making major partnership headlines in the past week, its enterprise blockchain focus and proven use cases continue to attract long-term investors. The technicals suggest momentum is building, and while it’s not the best crypto presale, its pattern points toward potential multi-month highs if buying pressure sustains. Best Cryptos To Watch From explosive presales to technical breakouts, 2025 is shaping up as a defining year for altcoins. Stellar’s expanding network, Hedera’s whale-backed momentum, and VeChain’s bullish chart all make strong cases for accumulation. But Cold Wallet’s presale narrative is in a different league. By merging real-world utility with a lucrative cashback model and backing it with a $270 million acquisition, CWT offers both an active user base and a huge upside gap before launch. With $6 million already raised and prices set to climb with every stage, the current entry point could be the most profitable window left. If you’re scanning the market for the best crypto presale, Cold Wallet’s blend of growth, adoption, and ROI potential puts it squarely at the top of the list, but as with any opportunity in crypto, timing is everything.

With capital rotating across the market, attention has now turned to heavyweights drawing institutional attention and newer projects gaining grassroots excitement. From Ethereum’s ETF-driven rally to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s viral rise, these tokens are standing out as the best altcoins to buy now. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Narrative Power Meets Market Timing MAGACOIN Finance joins Ethereum, Cardano, and Kaspa on the list of best altcoins to buy in 2025, thanks to strong tokenomics and growth potential. While the big names may have the institutional attention, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly appealing to retail investors. With capital rotating from large-cap to smaller projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s branding is drawing the attention of analysts and investors in the crypto market. In particular, the project’s combination of early momentum and right timing has positioned it as a high-reward opportunity. Analysts following the project say MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the kind of speculative upside many traders are chasing in 2025. With time, forecasts indicate MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform established names like Ethereum, Cardano and Kaspa. 2. Ethereum (ETH) — ETF Demand Fuels Supply Crunch Ethereum has largely benefited from the influx of institutional investors into the crypto market. The token’s price has also risen on the back of newly approved spot ETFs which have since drawn billions into the crypto market. With rising interest from institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity, a tightening supply, and driving demand, analysts predict Ethereum still has room to grow. Likewise. the recent Pectra upgrade boosted scalability and staking, keeping Ethereum strong in DeFi. Some analysts now see ETH climbing toward $7,500 by year-end, making it one of the best altcoins to buy for long-term holders. 3. Cardano (ADA) — Whale Accumulation Strengthens Breakout In August, Cardano finally broke a five-month downtrend and reached the $1 mark again. ADA’s expanding ecosystem—especially zero-knowledge smart contracts and a $71M development fund—provides real utility. If ADA clears $1.50 resistance, targets of $2.00–$2.40 come into play. For investors looking for steady growth with improving fundamentals, Cardano remains a compelling altcoin to buy now. 4. Kaspa (KAS) — Quiet Builder With Big Upgrades Kaspa looks ready for a breakout. The upcoming DagKnight upgrade and new ZK bridge are getting attention for making the network faster and more secure. With a market cap under $3 billion, it’s still small next to ETH or ADA. Even so, analysts believe it could grow quickly if these upgrades deliver. Kaspa earns its spot on the best altcoins for 2025 list thanks to both its tech progress and an active community backing it. 5. Avalanche (AVAX)—Institutional Partnerships Drive Confidence Avalanche is building strength as a key blockchain for DeFi and gaming. Developer activity stays high, with new subnets and enterprise integrations driving growth. AVAX may retest $33 soon, with some targets pointing to $50 by year-end. Institutions are showing interest, and regulators appear supportive. That mix makes Avalanche one of the best altcoins to buy right now. Final Take The market has a mix of fundamental and narrative-driven plays, from big players like Ethereum to up-and-coming players like Kaspa and MAGACOIN. As money moves into altcoins, these five stand out as the best altcoins to buy right now. They offer a mix of stability and potential for growth.

Families keep cash in the bank, and even leaders like Xi Jinping or Donald Trump would struggle to change that. Even after the recent rebound, China’s main stock indexes are only back to where they were after the crash a decade ago according to Bloomberg . In that time, $10,000 in the S&P 500 grew to over $30,000, while the same in the CSI 300 is only about $13,000. Analysts point to structural origins. About 35 years ago, the exchanges were built mainly to raise money for state projects, not to reward investors. That focus led to too many share sales and bad post-IPO behavior, problems that still weigh on a market worth about $11 trillion . Policymakers are increasingly pressed to overhaul the setup. To hit a 5% growth goal amid an escalating tariff spat with the U.S., Xi is leaning on consumption, even as Beijing relies on equity financing to bankroll strategic tech companies whose earnings are far from assured . Recent gains have shown clear limits. The CSI 300 has risen under 7% this year, even with AI enthusiasm, trailing indexes in the U.S. and Europe. Coupled with a murky outlook, that helps sustain a 35% household saving rate. Veteran investors warn newcomers off the rally Chen Long, an asset-management professional, has turned to Xiaohongshu to flag risks to newcomers. “Many ordinary people come in thinking they could make money, but the majority of them end up poorer,” said Chen, who has invested since 2014. He added “State-owned companies primarily answer to the government rather than shareholders, while many private entrepreneurs have little regard for small investors.” Senior officials have increasingly acknowledged equities’ importance for household wealth, amid a property downturn and an uneven safety net that heightens caution. The Communist Party’s Politburo vowed in December to “stabilize housing and stock markets,” an unusual nod to equities at that level. In July, it called for “increasing the attractiveness and inclusiveness of domestic capital markets.” Economists see rebound as the only quick fix Still, confidence is hard to restore quickly. “Except for a stock market rebound,” said Hao Hong, chief investment officer at Lotus Asset Management Ltd. “This is a topic that we economists have been discussing in the closed door meetings in Beijing.’’ Today’s troubles trace back decades. “The exchanges are motivated to fulfill the government’s call for increasing companies’ financing,” said Lian Ping, chairman of the China Chief Economist Forum. “But when it comes to protecting investors’ interests, there are few who are motivated to do it.” An IPO surge made China the top listing market in 2022, yet scant shareholder safeguards and loose enforcement have produced price collapses and removals, retail investors dub it “stepping on a land mine.” For example, Beijing Zuojiang Technology, listed in 2019, said in 2023 that a product was modeled on Nvidia’s BlueField-2 DPU. In January the following year it warned it faced delisting amid a disclosure probe, and it was later removed from the Shenzhen exchange. The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. Since then, officials have tried to narrow the pipeline: tougher screening of weak applicants, stronger fraud enforcement, curbs on follow-on issuance and blockholder sell-downs, and pressure for higher payouts. It’s starting to have an effect. Last year’s IPO tally dropped to about a third of 2023’s. Firms in Shanghai and Shenzhen paid 2.4 trillion yuan ($334 billion) in cash dividends for 2024, up 9% from a year earlier, according to state media. “The regulations and overall requirements after IPO have become stricter, in terms of reliability, transparency, or information disclosure,” said Ding Wenjie, investment strategist at China Asset Management Co.

This development raises significant questions about network safety and the future of decentralized assets. According to reports, the decision came from a community poll initiated by Qubic founder Sergey Ivancheglo. Dogecoin emerged as the overwhelming choice, garnering over 300 votes and surpassing other contenders like Kaspa (KAS) and Zcash (ZEC) combined. This move follows Qubic’s earlier claim of achieving 51% control over Monero’s hashrate, indicating a serious approach to their stated objectives. Understanding the Threat: What is a 51% Attack Crypto ? A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group gains control of more than half of a blockchain network’s total computing power, or ‘hashrate’. This dominance allows them to manipulate the network in several ways, posing a severe threat to its integrity. Double Spending: Attackers can reverse transactions, effectively spending the same cryptocurrency twice. Blocking Transactions: They can prevent legitimate transactions from being confirmed. Preventing Mining: Attackers can halt other miners from adding new blocks to the chain. Such an event highlights a critical blockchain vulnerability , demonstrating how a concentrated power can undermine the very principles of decentralization and trust. The Vote’s Impact: What Does This Mean for Dogecoin Security ? The Qubic community’s explicit targeting of Dogecoin puts its network security directly in the spotlight. Dogecoin, a popular meme coin, relies on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, making it theoretically susceptible to a 51% attack if an entity accumulates enough mining power. While Dogecoin has a large and active community, the threat of a coordinated attack from a project like Qubic, which claims prior success against Monero, cannot be ignored. A successful attack could severely impact Dogecoin’s reputation, price, and overall usability. Investors and users of DOGE are now more vigilant, watching how this situation unfolds and what countermeasures, if any, the Dogecoin community or developers might implement. Broader Implications: Addressing Cryptocurrency Threats This situation with Qubic and Dogecoin is not an isolated incident. It serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing cryptocurrency threats that exist in the digital asset space. While blockchains are designed to be secure, their security often depends on the distribution of hashrate and the economic incentives of miners. Events like these underscore the importance of: Decentralization: A truly decentralized network with a wide distribution of mining power is more resilient. Community Vigilance: Active communities can help identify and respond to potential threats. Developer Innovation: Continuous efforts to enhance network security and introduce robust protocols are essential. The crypto world must continually adapt and strengthen its defenses against malicious actors seeking to exploit network weaknesses. Safeguarding Your Assets Against a Potential Qubic 51% Attack While the immediate impact of Qubic’s declaration on Dogecoin remains to be seen, it’s a good time for all crypto users to review their security practices. Staying informed about potential vulnerabilities and understanding the risks associated with different cryptocurrencies is crucial. For those holding Dogecoin or other PoW assets, monitoring network activity and official announcements from development teams is advisable.

The South Korean media outlet Newsis reported that tax delinquents in the city have been “lining their pockets with cryptoassets.” Jeju Crypto Crackdown on Tax Evaders Jeju City authorities announced on August 16 that tax officials have completed a “comprehensive investigation.” Tax officials wanted to determine if 2,962 individuals in the city had crypto holdings. South Korean law allows national and local tax bodies to require domestic crypto exchanges to hand over data on customers they suspect of tax evasion. The individuals in question all owed the city more than 1 million won (over $719) in unpaid tax levies and fines. Jeju City Hall. (Source: Jjw [CC BY-SA 4.0]) In total, the individuals’ outstanding tax bills amounted to 19.7 billion won ($14,171,845) in arrears. The investigation saw tax officials comb through data handed over by the country’s four biggest crypto exchanges: Bithumb, Dunamu’s Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit. The number of households in Korea living in rented homes is nearing 10 million, with more than half concentrated in the greater Seoul area. Seoul is the only one of the country’s 17 major regions in which more than half of all households don't own a home. https://t.co/xdxcxUcyd9 — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 17, 2025 City Starts Seizing Coins The investigators confirmed that 49 of the individuals held coins in crypto wallets on the exchanges. The total value of this crypto was 230 million won ($165,458), the city added. The city has since used its power to designated the exchanges as third-party debtors and has “begun procedures to freeze and seize their assets.” Jeju officials are likely to then present the individuals with an ultimatum, telling them that if they do not immediately settle their bills, the city will move to liquidate the coins. The authorities also revealed that they used AI-powered tools to help them identify tax evaders and “hidden” cryptoassets. Jeju City’s tax chief Hwang Tae-hoon said: “We will continue to bolster our response to tax evasion to uncover hidden assets like crypto. We will do our best to track down assets belonging to high-value tax delinquents. We will use AI-based information analysis. This will help us boost tax revenues and foster a culture of honest tax payment.” A similar drive in Seoul’s affluent Gangnam District has seen tax officials recoup over $144,000 so far this year.

On one hand, the Spot Ethereum ETFs that had driven billions in inflows have just recorded their first daily outflow in over a week. On the other hand, order-book data shows a towering sell wall at $4,800 that could be described as Ethereum’s “final boss,” the level that could unlock a parabolic run if broken. Related Reading: XRP Chatter Reaches Ride-Share Drivers — Small Survey Shows Mixed Results ETF Inflows Break: Sentiment Cooling Down? The optimism around Ethereum’s rally cooled just as the week came to a close. Notably, US-based Spot ETH ETFs reported net outflows of $59.34 million on August 15, effectively ending an eight-day streak that had added $3.7 billion in inflows. The reversal came just as Ethereum failed to clear $4,788, a level within 3% of its all-time high of $4,878, before slipping back to about $4,450. Although BlackRock’s ETHA stood out with $338.09 million in daily inflows, Grayscale’s ETHE and Fidelity’s FETH registered notable withdrawals of $101.74 million and $272.23 million. Total Ethereum Spot ETF Net Inflow: SoSoValue Speaking of Ethereum failing to clear $4,788, on-chain data shows a huge cluster of liquidity around this level. Particularly, Merlijn The Trader described the $4,800 as the “final boss” for ETH, pointing to billions in sell orders stacked at that level on Binance’s ETH/USDT pair. A liquidity heatmap shows a massive concentration of asks in this zone. According to the analyst, breaking above this level could unleash open skies for Ethereum. As long as this level is filled with more asks, there’s a possibility of it acting as a resistance for any upward move. However, clearing this fortress with enough buy volume would not just be a technical breakout but a psychological one, with the potential to push its price to new all-time highs. Image From X: Merlijn The Trader Bearish Retracement Scenario Although the liquidity narrative is currently leaning more towards a bullish breakout than bearish, another analysis from TradingView paints a more cautious picture. The analysis, which is based on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart, also identifies the $4,700 to $4,800 region as a supply-heavy resistance where Ethereum has already shown signs of exhaustion after an aggressive rally from early August. However, multiple technical alignments, such as Break of Structure signals, fair value gaps (FVG), and Fibonacci retracements, show that Ethereum may be due for a retracement. The trade plan outlined anticipates an entry around $4,440, with a stop loss above $4,790 and a downside target of $3,375 at a strong support area. This would imply a corrective move of over 20% if the bearish projection plays out.

This renewed attention follows fresh predictions from widely followed crypto analyst Albie, who has unveiled his outlook for the second quarter of 2026. He forecast XRP at $4 between April and June of that year. XRP’s Potential Climb to $4 With XRP currently trading near $3.14, the token would need to rally by 27.38% to reach the projected target. Such an advance would lift its market capitalization to about $237.67 billion, assuming the circulating supply remains fixed at 59.41 billion tokens. Albie did not elaborate on the specific catalysts that could propel XRP or other assets to these levels. Nevertheless, his tweet has added fuel to the ongoing discussion about where the market is headed once the current consolidation phase concludes. 2026* — Albie (@linkchainlink) August 12, 2025 Ambitious Market-Wide Forecasts XRP was not the only token in Albie’s crosshairs. His predictions also set bold price targets for several top cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin at $280,000, Ethereum at $7,500, Solana at $700, Dogecoin at $0.69, and Chainlink at $420 by the second quarter of 2026. The figures reflect his conviction in the continuation of bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. Anticipation of the Next Bull Leg The timeline for these forecasts falls just after the 2025 bull run, which many analysts believe has more room to unfold. While the market has cooled in recent weeks, with price action showing fewer sharp moves, investor confidence remains high. Traders anticipate Bitcoin, XRP, and other top assets will continue their upward trend, potentially maintaining momentum into 2026. It is unclear whether Albie envisions this growth happening in one uninterrupted surge, as his commentary was limited to numerical targets without a breakdown of the driving forces. The $4 Milestone in Community Focus Albie’s outlook echoes a broader sentiment within the XRP community. CryptoBull has suggested the asset could hit $4 as early as early August, while DustyBC Crypto argued that $2 might be the last buying opportunity, suggesting the price was firmly on a path toward higher levels. Meanwhile, Zach Rector also projected XRP would achieve the $4 mark before year-end, reinforcing the widespread conviction among community analysts that this milestone is within sight. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Hurdles and Catalysts Despite the optimism, XRP has remained anchored around the $3 region for several weeks, unable to decisively break through its long-standing all-time high of $3.84, set in January 2018. Still, recent developments have improved sentiment. The conclusion of Ripple’s drawn-out legal battle with the SEC, coupled with growing speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF, has fueled belief that the token could soon achieve new heights. Albie’s bold projection of $4 by Q2 2026 has injected renewed excitement into the XRP community. For many, this target represents not only a technical milestone but also a symbolic achievement that validates years of persistence. Whether XRP can overcome its resistance and deliver on these predictions remains to be seen. The outlook underscores the optimism surrounding the token’s future as the market prepares for the next phase of the bull run.

Recent data reveals a significant uptick in Bitcoin mining profitability . For those invested in the digital asset space, this development signals a positive shift. Understanding the forces behind this increase offers crucial insights into the evolving landscape of crypto mining and the broader digital asset market . What Drove the Surge in Bitcoin Mining Profitability? A recent research note from Jefferies, highlighted by CoinDesk, confirms that Bitcoin’s (BTC) mining profitability climbed a solid 2% in July. This positive movement didn’t happen in a vacuum. Several key factors contributed to this welcome boost for miners. Bitcoin Price Gains: The price of Bitcoin itself saw a healthy 7% increase during July. A higher Bitcoin price directly translates to more revenue for miners, making their operations more lucrative. Network Hashrate Advance: The Bitcoin network hashrate also grew by 5%. While a rising hashrate typically increases competition, the significant price gain seemingly offset this, allowing profitability to rise. These combined dynamics created a favorable environment, allowing miners to see improved returns despite ongoing challenges. How Does Bitcoin Price Impact Crypto Mining Operations? The direct correlation between Bitcoin price and crypto mining success is undeniable. When Bitcoin’s value rises, the fiat equivalent of the rewards miners earn for validating transactions also increases. This directly enhances their revenue streams, improving their financial health. Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen noted that Bitcoin’s recent price gains are particularly beneficial for entities like Galaxy Digital’s digital assets unit. Stronger prices provide a much-needed boost, potentially leading to increased investment and expansion within the mining sector. The Challenge of a Growing Network Hashrate While rising prices are a boon, miners consistently face the challenge of a growing network hashrate . Hashrate represents the total computational power being used to mine Bitcoin. As more miners join the network or existing miners deploy more powerful equipment, the hashrate increases. This makes it harder for individual miners to find blocks and earn rewards. Despite the July profitability increase, the underlying struggle with a growing hashrate persists. Miners must continually upgrade their equipment and optimize their operations to remain competitive. This ongoing arms race demands significant capital expenditure and efficient energy management. What Does This Mean for the Digital Asset Market? The positive trend in Bitcoin mining profitability offers a hopeful signal for the broader digital asset market . Increased profitability can lead to: Miner Stability: Healthier miners are less likely to sell off their Bitcoin holdings en masse, contributing to market stability. Infrastructure Investment: Improved profits can fund further investment in mining infrastructure, promoting network security and decentralization. Investor Confidence: A robust mining sector often reflects underlying strength in Bitcoin, which can boost overall investor confidence in cryptocurrencies. These factors collectively paint a more optimistic picture for the future trajectory of Bitcoin and the wider crypto ecosystem. July’s rise in Bitcoin mining profitability underscores the dynamic interplay between Bitcoin’s price and the network’s operational metrics. While challenges like increasing hashrate remain, the recent gains provide a strong indicator of resilience and potential growth within the crypto mining sector. This positive trend is a crucial development for everyone tracking the health of the digital asset market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Bitcoin mining profitability? Bitcoin mining profitability refers to the net earnings a Bitcoin miner makes after deducting operational costs (like electricity and hardware) from the value of the Bitcoin rewards received. 2. How does Bitcoin price affect miners? A higher Bitcoin price directly increases the fiat value of the Bitcoin rewards miners earn, thus boosting their revenue and overall profitability. 3. What is network hashrate? Network hashrate is the total combined computational power being used by all miners to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin blockchain. A higher hashrate indicates more competition among miners. 4. Why is a growing hashrate a challenge for miners? As the network hashrate grows, the difficulty of mining increases. This means individual miners have a smaller chance of solving a block and earning rewards, requiring them to invest in more powerful and efficient hardware to stay competitive. 5. What impact does mining profitability have on the broader crypto market? Increased mining profitability can lead to greater stability in the Bitcoin market, encourage further investment in mining infrastructure, and generally boost investor confidence in Bitcoin and the wider digital asset market.

This significant report highlights a surprising reality: despite the growing presence of cryptocurrencies in the market, institutional crypto adoption remains remarkably low among professional fund managers. This finding certainly gives us pause to consider the current investment landscape. What Did the BofA Survey Reveal About Fund Managers’ Crypto Stance? A recent August survey conducted by Bank of America provided clear insights into how institutional fund managers view the volatile crypto market. The results, as reported by BeInCrypto, were quite stark. An overwhelming 97% of the surveyed managers indicated they are actively staying out of cryptocurrencies. This statistic alone paints a vivid picture of the prevailing sentiment. For the small fraction of managers who do engage with digital assets, their average cryptocurrency allocation within portfolios was notably minimal. On average, only 3.2% of their total portfolio was dedicated to cryptocurrencies. This indicates a highly conservative approach, even among those willing to dip their toes into the crypto waters. In contrast to their crypto aversion, the same BofA survey findings showed a clear preference for traditional assets. A net 14% of managers reported holding more stocks than their benchmarks. This was a significant jump from just 2% a month prior, signaling a shift towards more established equity markets. The survey included responses from 211 professional fund managers, making its insights quite robust. Why Are Fund Managers Avoiding Cryptocurrency Investment? The reasons behind this widespread avoidance among fund managers crypto are multifaceted. Institutional investors typically prioritize stability, liquidity, and regulatory clarity. Cryptocurrencies, while offering potential for high returns, also come with significant volatility and a still-evolving regulatory environment across different jurisdictions. Consider these key factors: Volatility Concerns: Digital assets are known for their rapid price swings, which can be challenging for large institutional portfolios focused on long-term, stable returns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of a comprehensive, globally unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies creates legal and compliance risks for traditional financial institutions. Custody and Security: Securely holding and managing large sums of digital assets presents unique operational challenges that differ greatly from traditional securities. Lack of Established Track Record: Compared to centuries-old asset classes like stocks and bonds, cryptocurrencies are relatively new, lacking the extensive historical performance data that institutional investors often rely upon. Is Low Cryptocurrency Allocation a Sign of Future Trends? The current low cryptocurrency allocation by institutional players raises an important question: does this trend indicate a long-term hesitance, or is it merely a temporary pause? While the survey highlights present caution, the digital asset space continues to evolve rapidly. New regulations, improved infrastructure, and greater market maturity could eventually sway institutional sentiment. However, for now, the data suggests that most large-scale investors are not yet convinced that cryptocurrencies fit comfortably into their risk-managed portfolios. This does not necessarily mean they dismiss crypto entirely, but rather that their current investment strategies do not favor significant exposure. Navigating the Current Investment Landscape The insights from the BofA survey provide valuable context for understanding the broader investment landscape. It underscores that while retail interest in crypto may be high, the pace of institutional crypto adoption is considerably slower. Fund managers are currently directing capital towards what they perceive as safer, more predictable assets, such as equities. This preference for traditional markets reflects a prevailing risk-off sentiment among these professional investors. They are prioritizing assets with established regulatory frameworks and clearer risk-reward profiles. The journey for digital assets to become a mainstream institutional asset class clearly has more ground to cover. In conclusion, the Bank of America survey offers a crucial snapshot of institutional investor sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies. The overwhelming majority of fund managers crypto portfolios remain untouched by digital assets, favoring traditional stocks instead. This cautious approach is driven by concerns over volatility, regulation, and a preference for established markets. While the future of institutional crypto adoption may hold changes, the present reality is one of significant restraint and careful observation from the big players in finance. This “wait and see” approach from institutional investors could shape market dynamics for some time to come, influencing liquidity and price stability in the crypto space. It also highlights the ongoing need for clearer regulatory guidelines and more robust institutional-grade infrastructure to truly unlock broader adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the main finding of the BofA survey regarding crypto? The Bank of America’s August survey revealed that a significant 97% of institutional fund managers are currently avoiding cryptocurrencies in their portfolios. Q2: Why are institutional investors hesitant about cryptocurrency allocation? Institutional investors often prioritize stability, regulatory clarity, and liquidity. Cryptocurrencies present challenges due to their high volatility, evolving regulatory landscape, and unique custody requirements. Q3: Does this survey indicate a permanent trend for institutional crypto adoption? While the survey highlights current caution, it does not necessarily indicate a permanent trend. The digital asset space is rapidly evolving, and future regulatory developments or market maturity could lead to increased institutional crypto adoption. Q4: What was the average cryptocurrency allocation for the few managers who do invest? Among the small percentage of fund managers who do invest in cryptocurrencies, the average portfolio allocation was only 3.2%, indicating a very conservative approach. Share Your Thoughts!

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Leverage in crypto markets is surging back to bull-market levels, even as last Thursday’s pullback reminded traders how quickly overextended bets can unwind. Galaxy Research’s Q2 State of Crypto Leverage shows crypto-collateralized loans expanded 27% last quarter to $53.1 billion, the highest since early 2022, powered by record demand in DeFi lending and a renewed appetite for risk. That backdrop set the stage for last week’s shakeout. Bitcoin’s retreat from $124,000 to as low as $118,000 triggered more than $1 billion in liquidations across crypto derivatives, the largest long wipeout since early August. Analysts framed it as healthy profit-taking rather than the start of a reversal, but it underscored how fragile the market becomes when leverage builds this quickly. Galaxy's analysts argue that stress points are already visible. In July, a wave of withdrawals on Aave pushed ETH borrowing rates above Ethereum’s staking yields , breaking the economics of the popular “looping” trade where staked ETH is used as collateral to borrow more ETH. The unwinding triggered a rush to exit staking positions, sending Ethereum’s Beacon Chain exit queue to a record 13 days. Galaxy has also flagged that borrowing costs for USDC in the over-the-counter market have been climbing since July, even as on-chain lending rates remain flat. The spread between the two has widened to its highest level since late 2024. That disconnect suggests demand for dollars off-chain is outpacing liquidity onchain, creating a mismatch that could amplify volatility if conditions tighten further. With institutional demand and ETF inflows still supporting the bullish backdrop, strategists remain constructive on crypto. But between ballooning loan volumes, concentration of lending power, DeFi liquidity crunches, and a widening gap between on-chain and off-chain dollar markets, the system is showing more points of stress, Galaxy writes. Thursday’s $1B flush was a warning that the return of leverage is cutting both ways. Market Movers BTC: Volatility has plunged across markets ahead of Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, with traders betting on September rate cuts, but some warn complacency could mask risks as BTC trades at $118,061.51, up 0.44%. ETH: A record $3.8B in Ether is queued for unstaking with a 15-day wait, adding potential profit-taking pressure even as ETF and treasury demand surges, with ETH trading at $4,524.10, up 2.13%. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,332.95, down 0.11%, as hotter U.S. inflation data cut Fed rate-cut bets and left XAU/USD consolidating above key $3,310 support ahead of Powell’s Jackson Hole speech.

The initial coin offering (ICO) raised slightly more than $18 million by selling Ethereum at about $0.31. You could have obtained roughly 3,225 ETH for $1,000 without anyone claiming you were a genius because most people hardly understood what it was. By 2025, ETH is trading close to $4,617, with a market value of about $557 billion. Today, that $1,000 would be worth just under $15 million. This type of return characterizes a whole investing career, but it also highlights a fact: Ethereum is no longer a sly outsider. It’s a blue-chip. It is l ess likely to result in another thousand-fold leap, but it is also safer. Some traders view this as an opportunity to balance smaller, high-upside wagers with the consistent power of Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently one of the most well-known names in that discussion. Ethereum’s transition from startup to market leader The 2015 launch, DeFi’s breakthrough in 2020, and the NFT boom in 2021 are just a few of the pivotal moments in ETH’s history. Every wave attracted new users, developers, and capital. Ethereum now has an even stronger basis for decentralized applications thanks to network upgrades that have reduced fees and accelerated transactions. It is now a standard component of trading portfolios as a result. But fireworks are rarely produced by fixtures. The market’s next 10x move will most likely originate from somewhere else, most likely from a project that is still too small for most people to pay much attention to. According to projections from several market models, if macro tailwinds and on-chain growth align during the upcoming cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE may generate an 84x return on investment. Early presale rounds of the project sold out quickly, and on-chain data indicates that transaction activity and wallet growth are increasing steadily. Its growing utility ecosystem and scarcity-based entry model are cited by analysts as the main factors attracting the interest of seasoned investors. This goes beyond simply chasing hype. Similar setups have produced explosive gains in previous cycles, such as Shiba Inu’s viral ascent and Solana’s run from single digits to triple digits. Although there is no guarantee of the pattern, the structure is well-known enough to draw attention. The significance of the mix ETH provides stability. It is well-established, liquid, and well-established in the market. However, it won’t double in a day. The combination of both projects can cover both extremes for investors who are aware of position sizing: the potential asymmetry of an early-stage breakout and the dependability of Ethereum. The conclusion You would now be looking at millions if you had invested $1,000 in Ethereum’s initial coin offering. Although they are uncommon, those plays haven’t completely vanished. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most watched new altcoins in 2025, with an 84x forecast and favorable macro and on-chain fundamentals. Some believe that the best way to handle the upcoming market cycle is to own both the potential rocket and the established giant.

Low cap coins often fly under the radar, giving early buyers a shot at high growth before the wider market catches on. The trick is spotting projects that have strong fundamentals, clear market demand, and an engaged community before they hit the mainstream. Right now, a few names are standing out for their potential in 2025. One is a presale giant with a unique tech model and massive fundraising numbers. Others are established but still undervalued players with real-world use cases and bullish technical setups. Whether you’re hunting for short-term gains or longer-term plays, these picks are worth a close look. Here’s a breakdown of four cryptos you should have on your radar. 1. BlockDAG – The Presale Leader with U.S. Exchange Ambitions BlockDAG is gaining massive traction as one of the most talked-about picks in the best low cap crypto category for 2025. Its hybrid Layer-1 model blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with Proof-of-Work consensus and full EVM compatibility, delivering fast transactions, strong security, and the flexibility to run smart contracts. This technical foundation positions BlockDAG to compete with, and potentially outperform, many established Layer-1 networks. The presale results alone have drawn global attention. More than $376 million has been raised so far, with over 25 billion BDAG tokens sold across 29 batches. Early Batch 1 buyers are already seeing around 2,660% gains, while current batch participants are looking at a potential 81% jump at the planned $0.05 listing price. With price targets suggesting a climb to $1 after major listings, the upside could be substantial for early holders. Community growth is another key driver. The X1 Mobile Miner app already has 2.5 million users, over 4,500 developers are working on 300+ dApps, and more than 200,000 holders have joined before launch. With 20 exchange listings already confirmed, including MEXC and BitMart, the focus now is on securing Coinbase and Gemini. If those U.S. listings happen, the combination of legitimacy, liquidity, and visibility could make BlockDAG the breakout success story of 2025, and the strongest contender for best low cap crypto this year. 2. Litecoin (LTC) – Payment Adoption Driving Bullish Setup Litecoin might not be new, but at its current valuation, it’s still considered by many as a best low cap crypto contender. Priced around $128.85, it’s showing signs of strength after breaking out of a long three-year consolidation phase. The next key level is $135, a resistance point that hasn’t been breached since early 2022. Analysts say that clearing it could pave the way for a run toward $200 and beyond. Part of Litecoin’s renewed momentum comes from increased real-world usage. It’s now the second-most used crypto for payments on CoinGate, with roughly 14.5% of transactions. The market sentiment is bullish, with price forecasts for August targeting around $134.67 and potential upside toward $220–$240 by year-end. Some analysts even see long-term targets above $1,000, citing whale accumulation and stronger adoption trends. With its established brand, low fees, and growing role in the payments sector, Litecoin offers a mix of stability and upside potential, making it a solid low cap play for investors looking beyond just new presale tokens. 3. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – Steady Range with Upside Potential Bitcoin Cash is trading around $609.33, holding steady within its August forecast range of roughly $599 to $629. While BCH may not dominate headlines, it remains a reliable option for those focused on utility and long-term value. Its core advantage is speed and low transaction costs, making it a practical payment solution in an expanding crypto economy. Recent price action has shown stability, suggesting the market is consolidating before a potential move. Technical analysts note that breaking through the $650 resistance could open the path toward $700 in the short term. This positions BCH as a coin with room for healthy growth if overall market sentiment improves. With an established infrastructure, active community, and continued relevance as a peer-to-peer payment method, BCH fits well in a balanced best low cap crypto portfolio. It offers a mix of security and upside, appealing to both cautious investors and those looking for steady appreciation. 4. Monero (XMR) – Privacy Coin with a Unique Position Monero is currently trading near $258.41, with intraday ranges recently between $249.88 and $258.97. Despite a ~23% dip over the past month, it’s still one of the top-performing coins of the first half of 2025, boasting a 62% net price growth from January to June. That track record alone keeps it relevant in the best low cap crypto conversation. However, XMR is facing both opportunity and risk. On the positive side, demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies remains strong, particularly among users who value confidentiality in transactions. On the downside, there was a recent claim by Qubic of controlling a majority of Monero’s hashrate, a potential 51% attack scenario that has raised security concerns. Forecasts for August put XMR between $241.78 and $290.42, suggesting upside potential of around 9–13% from current levels if sentiment holds. For investors comfortable with the privacy coin sector and its regulatory challenges, Monero remains a distinct and potentially rewarding low cap option. Final Take The low cap sector is where some of the biggest gains in crypto history have been made, but it’s also where risk and reward sit side by side. BlockDAG’s presale performance, massive community, and major exchange ambitions make it stand out as the top candidate for explosive growth in 2025. Its combination of tech innovation and market momentum puts it at the front of the best low cap crypto list. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash bring proven utility and growing adoption, while still offering price points that leave room for meaningful upside. Monero, despite some network risks, holds a unique position as the leading privacy coin with a strong historical performance record. Balancing new opportunities like BlockDAG with established yet undervalued assets like LTC, BCH, and XMR could be the strategy that turns this year’s portfolio into a long-term win. The key is acting before these coins hit their next major price milestones.

After falling from $4,770 to $4,520, ETH now sits just 3% away from its record peak of $4,891. Analyst Ted believes this is only the beginning, arguing that everything which pushed Bitcoin higher is now happening with Ethereum. His bold claim? $10K ETH isn’t a fantasy — it’s a conservative call. With Ethereum price near ATH, attention is shifting across the altcoin market. Investors are searching for the best altcoin to buy now, weighing Solana, NEAR, and emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential big winners in the next cycle. Ethereum Price Near ATH: Why Traders Are Bullish Ethereum is stealing headlines again. The strong rebound has fueled speculation that it could lead the next surge. Ted noted that Bitcoin doubled its 2021 high, and Ethereum could follow a similar path. If ETH pushes beyond its ATH and heads toward $10K, it will reshape how investors view altcoins. Ethereum analysis by Ted This environment creates rotation opportunities. Historically, when ETH rallies, capital flows into other tokens. That’s why investors are analyzing Solana price prediction 2025 and NEAR Protocol price prediction 2025 as possible ways to capture gains outside Ethereum. The hunt for the best crypto to buy now is intensifying, and that’s opening the door for rising challengers. MAGACOIN FINANCE Outperform: The 150x Hook One name being whispered more often is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Ethereum price near ATH, traders are rotating funds into tokens they believe can multiply faster. The growing view is that MAGACOIN FINANCE outperform scenarios could define 2025. The story is simple: while Solana and NEAR attract attention with their forecasts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the wild card. Analysts suggest it could pump 150x in the next bull cycle, making it a contender for the best altcoin to buy now. The rotation from majors like Ethereum into smaller-cap projects is what gives MAGACOIN its explosive potential. Final Thought: Will MAGACOIN Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now? The debate for 2025 often centers on two themes — Solana price prediction 2025 and NEAR Protocol price prediction 2025. Solana’s speed and ecosystem strength make it a high-beta play, while NEAR’s developer growth adds steady traction. Both could benefit heavily from Ethereum’s run. Yet, while 80% of investor focus is on these larger projects, the other 20% is shifting to new contenders. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. With bold projections, it’s entering the conversation as the best crypto to buy now for risk-tolerant investors.

50256036,558469,1755475233,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50256036.jpeg,Ethereum Outflows Top $888-M As Binance And Coinbase Balances Shrink,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-outflows-top-888m-binance-coinbase-shrink/,"Ethereum (ETH) trades above the $4,400 price mark following a rather eventful market week. Although CoinMarketCap data reports the altcoin notched up a net weekly gain of 4.21%, a sharp 7.14% pullback toward the end of the week has dampened sentiment, introducing a more cautious undertone. With ETH now consolidating in a sideways range, crypto analyst Amr Taha has outlined both short and long-term market outlooks, drawing on recent exchange flows and futures market activity. Bearish Funding Rates Vs. Bullish On-Chain Flows: Ethereum At A Crossroads In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, Taha provides valuable insight into the price trajectory of Ethereum as both futures market positioning and exchange balances are undergoing significant changes. In studying recent developments in the derivative markets, the crypto expert observes a 29% decline in Open Interest over the past two days, following a drop in ETH prices from above $4,700 to below $4,400, which suggests that traders are rapidly closing or liquidating positions amid market turbulence. Adding to the bearish atmosphere, perpetual futures funding rates turned negative across major exchanges. Negative funding rates occur when short positions dominate, meaning traders are paying to maintain bearish bets. While this reflects prevailing pessimism, Amr Taha states that history shows that such extremes often coincide with oversold conditions and can precede a rebound if other bullish catalysts emerge. Amid this derivative market situation, spot market data paints a different picture. In recent days, Taha explains that 200,000 ETH, worth approximately $888 million, were withdrawn from major centralized exchanges. Coinbase saw an outflow of 128,000 ETH, while Binance recorded 72,000 ETH leaving its platform. Generally, large-scale exchange withdrawals are often interpreted as a bullish signal. When investors remove funds from trading platforms, they typically move them into cold storage wallets for multiple reasons, such as long-term holding or staking, which signals confidence in future price appreciation. There are also instances where institutions move their assets off exchanges to perform over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. This dual narrative, i.e., bearish derivatives activity and bullish spot outflows, highlights Ethereum’s complex short-term outlook. On one hand, negative funding rates and collapsing open interest indicate traders are cautious, expecting further downside in the near term. On the other hand, shrinking exchange balances reduce immediate selling pressure, creating conditions that could support a strong price floor. Interestingly, Amr Taha also notes that similar waves of ETH withdrawals from exchanges have preceded notable rallies, as reduced exchange liquidity tightens supply, indicating potential for a long-term price rally. ETH Price Overview At press time, Ethereum trades at $4,446, reflecting a 0.19% gain in the past day. Notably, investors’ attention remains heavily on the 4,400 support level in the coming sessions.

These essential platforms, which seamlessly connect traditional fiat currency with the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, are rapidly becoming prime targets for strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This shift signifies their evolution from mere transactional gateways to foundational pillars of the new digital economy. Why Are Crypto On- and Off-Ramps Suddenly So Appealing for M&A? Historically, these firms primarily served as straightforward conduits, channeling user deposits onto various crypto exchanges. However, their scope has expanded dramatically, driven largely by the exponential stablecoin growth we’ve witnessed. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, have introduced a much-needed element of predictability into the often-volatile crypto market. This inherent stability makes stablecoins incredibly versatile. They are no longer just tools for speculative trading; they are becoming fundamental for everyday financial activities. Think of them as digital cash, enabling a broader range of practical applications for individuals and businesses alike. Consequently, on- and off-ramps have evolved into sophisticated digital asset payment platforms . They now facilitate critical functions such as cross-border remittances, allowing individuals to send money globally with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Furthermore, they are enabling streamlined business-to-business (B2B) transactions, reducing friction and costs for enterprises operating across borders. This expanded utility makes them indispensable infrastructure in the burgeoning digital economy, naturally attracting significant M&A interest. Stablecoin Growth: Fueling the Next Wave of Cryptocurrency Conversions The impressive trajectory of stablecoin growth is undeniably reshaping how we think about money and transactions. As more and more individuals and enterprises recognize the value of stablecoins for practical applications, the demand for reliable and efficient cryptocurrency conversions has skyrocketed. These on- and off-ramp services are the crucial bridge enabling this transition. Consider the global remittance market: traditional methods often involve high fees and lengthy processing times. Stablecoins, facilitated by robust on- and off-ramps, offer a compelling alternative with significantly lower costs and near-instantaneous transfers. For businesses, the ability to conduct B2B transactions using stablecoins means faster settlement, greater transparency, and reduced foreign exchange risks, bypassing the complexities of traditional banking systems. Juan Lopez, managing partner at VanEck Ventures, recently emphasized this pivotal shift. He pointed out that these firms are no longer merely about facilitating deposits into exchanges. Instead, they have become vital digital asset payment platforms , offering seamless, cost-effective solutions for a truly global audience. Their operational sophistication and expanded service offerings are making them increasingly valuable. The Strategic Edge: How M&A in Crypto Accelerates Market Entry The surge in M&A in crypto , particularly targeting established on- and off-ramp providers, is underpinned by a compelling strategic advantage: existing regulatory licenses. In the highly regulated financial sector, obtaining the necessary licenses for money transmission, digital asset services, or other financial operations can be an arduous and time-consuming process. Navigating the complex web of global financial regulations often requires years of dedicated effort, significant legal expenses, and stringent compliance frameworks. By acquiring a company that already possesses these critical licenses, buyers can effectively bypass these extensive regulatory hurdles. This accelerates their market entry and operational reach into new jurisdictions. This “buy versus build” strategy offers substantial benefits in terms of both time and cost savings. It empowers acquiring companies to rapidly scale their operations, integrate new technologies, and immediately tap into the escalating demand for seamless cryptocurrency conversions . This approach significantly enhances their competitive positioning within the rapidly evolving digital finance sector, making these acquisitions incredibly attractive. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Finance? The heightened M&A activity around crypto on- and off-ramps signals a broader maturation of the digital asset ecosystem. It indicates a move beyond speculative trading towards practical, real-world utility. As these platforms become more integrated into global financial infrastructure, we can anticipate several key developments: Increased Accessibility: Easier and more reliable ways for individuals and businesses to move between fiat and crypto will accelerate mainstream adoption. Enhanced Innovation: Acquired entities often benefit from greater resources, leading to improved technology, security, and user experience. Regulatory Clarity: The involvement of larger, more established players through M&A may also encourage further regulatory clarity and acceptance for digital assets. This trend underscores the growing recognition that seamless fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat pathways are indispensable for the widespread adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets. The future of finance is increasingly digital, and these essential gateways are paving the way. The dynamic intersection of significant stablecoin growth and the critical need for robust, licensed financial infrastructure is propelling crypto on- and off-ramps into the spotlight as highly sought-after M&A targets. These companies are transforming from simple entry points for crypto exchanges into indispensable hubs for global digital asset payments . Their existing licenses offer a crucial shortcut for businesses aiming to expand their footprint in the burgeoning crypto economy, promising continued strategic acquisitions and innovation in this exciting and evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto on- and off-ramps? A1: Crypto on- and off-ramps are services or platforms that enable users to convert traditional fiat currency (like USD or EUR) into cryptocurrencies and vice versa. They act as essential bridges between the traditional financial system and the digital asset ecosystem. Q2: How does stablecoin growth influence M&A interest in these platforms? A2: Stablecoin growth makes on- and off-ramps more attractive because stablecoins are increasingly used for practical applications like remittances and B2B payments, not just trading. This expands the market for these platforms, making them valuable acquisition targets. Q3: What benefits do acquiring companies gain by targeting on- and off-ramp firms? A3: A primary benefit is acquiring existing regulatory licenses, which significantly reduces the time and cost associated with entering new markets. It allows for faster expansion and operational scaling in the digital asset space. Q4: Are there any challenges or risks associated with this M&A trend? A4: While beneficial, challenges can include navigating complex regulatory environments post-acquisition, integrating disparate technologies, and ensuring compliance across various jurisdictions. Due diligence is crucial to mitigate these risks. Q5: What does this M&A activity signify for the future of digital finance? A5: This trend signals a maturation of the digital asset market, moving beyond speculation towards real-world utility. It suggests increased mainstream adoption, enhanced financial infrastructure, and potentially greater regulatory clarity as larger players enter the space.

Is an exciting altcoin rally on the horizon? Recent analyses suggest that a significant move in the cryptocurrency market could be triggered by economic developments in China. Specifically, if China’s central bank decides to roll out a new economic stimulus package, we might see a substantial boost for digital assets. This potential shift in global liquidity is a crucial factor for investors to watch. Why China’s Economic Stimulus Matters for the Cryptocurrency Market China holds a powerful position in the global economy, accounting for nearly 20% of the world’s GDP. This means its monetary policy decisions have a profound impact on global liquidity. When the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) injects more money into its economy, this liquidity often spills over into various financial sectors worldwide, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market . Historically, increased liquidity tends to favor risk assets . Cryptocurrencies, known for their volatility and growth potential, fall squarely into this category. A boost from Beijing could therefore send ripples through the crypto space, potentially pushing prices toward new highs. Understanding this connection is key for anyone tracking market movements. Understanding the Potential Altcoin Rally The term ‘ altcoin rally ‘ refers to a period where cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin experience significant price increases. When a major economy like China introduces stimulus, it often leads to a search for higher returns. Traditional investments might offer limited growth, making riskier, high-reward assets like altcoins more attractive to investors. This increased interest and capital inflow can create a powerful upward momentum for altcoins. Unlike Bitcoin, which often acts as a store of value, many altcoins are tied to specific projects, technologies, or decentralized applications, making them more sensitive to broader market sentiment and liquidity surges. Therefore, a China-led liquidity boost could be particularly beneficial for these digital assets. Recent Economic Data Driving Stimulus Speculation Speculation about a potential China economic stimulus package has been building due to recent weak economic data from July. These figures paint a picture of an economy facing headwinds: Retail sales slipped 0.1% from the previous month, indicating weaker consumer spending. Industrial output growth increased by only 0.4%, suggesting a slowdown in manufacturing. Unemployment ticked up to 5.2%, raising concerns about the labor market. Bloomberg Economics analysts, as cited by Cointelegraph, suggest that the People’s Bank of China might introduce measures as early as September. Such proactive steps are often taken to counter economic slowdowns and reignite growth, which could inadvertently fuel the next altcoin rally . Navigating the Cryptocurrency Market Ahead For investors, monitoring these macroeconomic signals is crucial. A significant injection of global liquidity could act as a potent catalyst for the crypto space. However, it’s also important to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile. While a stimulus package could create opportunities, market conditions can change rapidly. Consider diversifying your portfolio and staying informed about global economic policies. As risk assets , cryptocurrencies are sensitive to shifts in investor sentiment and broader economic trends. Staying updated on China’s policy announcements and their potential ripple effects will be vital for navigating the upcoming months. In conclusion, the prospect of a China economic stimulus package presents a compelling scenario for the cryptocurrency market . A potential surge in global liquidity could pave the way for a significant altcoin rally , driving risk assets to new heights. While speculation is high, the economic indicators suggest that policymakers in Beijing are likely considering measures that could have far-reaching effects on digital currencies. Investors should remain vigilant and prepared for potential market shifts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an altcoin rally? An altcoin rally is a period of significant price increases for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, often driven by increased investor interest and capital inflow into the broader crypto market. Q2: How does China’s economic stimulus affect global liquidity? When China’s central bank introduces economic stimulus, it injects more money into its economy. This increased capital can then flow into international markets, boosting global liquidity and making more funds available for investment in various asset classes. Q3: Why are cryptocurrencies considered risk assets? Cryptocurrencies are classified as risk assets due to their inherent volatility, speculative nature, and sensitivity to market sentiment. While they offer high potential returns, they also carry higher risks compared to more traditional, stable investments. Q4: What recent economic data suggests China might implement stimulus? Weak July data, including a slip in retail sales, modest industrial output growth, and an uptick in unemployment, has fueled speculation that China’s central bank may introduce economic stimulus measures soon. Q5: When might China’s central bank introduce stimulus measures? According to Bloomberg Economics analysts, the People’s Bank of China could introduce new economic measures as early as September, aiming to counter recent economic slowdowns.

As of August 18, the index stands at 60, a slight decrease from the previous day’s 64. This continued positioning offers valuable insight into current crypto market sentiment , indicating that investors, on average, remain optimistic about cryptocurrency prospects even with minor fluctuations. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to gauge the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. Developed by Alternative.me, it ranges from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). A higher number suggests that investors are becoming overly enthusiastic, potentially leading to a market correction, while a lower number indicates widespread fear, which could signal a buying opportunity. Understanding this index helps participants assess whether the market is experiencing irrational exuberance or undue panic. It acts as a counter-indicator for some, suggesting that when others are greedy, it might be time to be cautious, and when others are fearful, it could be a moment for opportunity. Why Does the Market Stay in the ‘Greed’ Zone? Despite a four-point drop, the index remaining at 60 firmly places it within the ‘Greed’ territory. This suggests that while there might have been some profit-taking or minor concerns, the overall investor confidence has not significantly wavered. Factors contributing to sustained greed in crypto often include stable prices, positive news developments, or increasing institutional adoption. The ‘Greed’ zone implies that market participants are generally confident and willing to invest, which can sustain upward price movements. However, it also serves as a reminder to exercise caution, as excessive greed can sometimes precede market corrections. Key Factors Influencing Crypto Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a single number; it’s a composite of six crucial market factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum with average values over 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market often indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the sentiment of various cryptocurrency-related hashtags on social media, particularly Twitter. Increased positive sentiment suggests greed. Surveys (15%): Polls are conducted weekly to gather direct investor opinions. (Note: Currently paused, as per the original content). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often suggests fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, seen as a safer haven. A decreasing dominance can imply greed, as altcoins gain traction. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to Bitcoin on Google. A surge in “Bitcoin price manipulation” searches, for instance, might indicate fear. These diverse inputs allow the index to paint a nuanced picture of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond simple price action. Navigating Market Volatility and Investor Behavior Understanding the components of the index is crucial for navigating periods of market volatility . When the index is high, it’s a signal to perhaps re-evaluate your portfolio and consider taking some profits, or at least setting stop-losses. Conversely, when the index plunges into “Extreme Fear,” it could present a strategic buying opportunity for long-term investors, as assets might be undervalued due to panic selling. For example, a sudden increase in Bitcoin dominance coupled with a falling index might indicate a flight to safety. Monitoring these individual factors, rather than just the overall score, can provide deeper insights into underlying market dynamics and help investors make more informed decisions. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Crypto Landscape The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as an essential barometer for understanding the collective psyche of the crypto market. While it currently signals ‘Greed’, it’s vital for investors to remember that sentiment can shift rapidly. By paying attention to the various contributing factors like market volatility and Bitcoin dominance , and not solely relying on the overall score, you can better prepare for potential changes and make more strategic investment choices. Staying informed about broader crypto market sentiment empowers you to navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A1: It’s a tool that measures current crypto market sentiment, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), helping investors gauge market emotions. Q2: What does a score of 60 mean on the index? A2: A score of 60 indicates that the market is in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggesting that investors are generally optimistic and confident about cryptocurrency prices. Q3: What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A3: The index considers volatility, market momentum/volume, social media sentiment, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. Q4: How can investors use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A4: Investors can use it as a counter-indicator; high greed might suggest caution, while extreme fear could signal potential buying opportunities. Q5: Why are surveys currently paused in the index calculation?

We’ve seen a significant development in the CME Bitcoin futures market, as contracts opened today with a notable gap upwards. According to TradingView data, Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) commenced trading at $117,995, marking a $385 increase from their previous close of $117,610 on the four-hour chart. This upward jump immediately grabbed the attention of traders and analysts alike, sparking discussions about what this “gap” signifies for the broader Bitcoin futures market and the future of crypto futures trading . It highlights the unique interplay between traditional financial structures and the always-on nature of digital assets. What Exactly is This CME Gap in the Bitcoin Futures Market? When we talk about a “gap” in financial markets, especially within the context of the CME gap , it refers to a situation where the opening price of an asset is significantly different from its previous closing price. For CME Bitcoin futures , these gaps typically occur over the weekend. While traditional markets like stocks close for the weekend, the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7. When the CME reopens on Sunday evening (US time), if Bitcoin’s price has moved substantially during the weekend, a gap appears between Friday’s closing price and Sunday’s opening price. This particular gap, opening $385 higher, suggests strong positive sentiment building over the weekend for Bitcoin. It underscores the continuous nature of crypto price discovery versus the structured trading hours of regulated derivatives markets like the CME. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in digital asset derivatives . Why Does the CME Gap Matter for Crypto Futures Trading? The concept of a “CME gap” is more than just a curiosity; it often carries predictive weight for many traders in the Bitcoin futures market . Historically, there’s a common belief that CME gaps tend to “fill” over time. This means the price will eventually move back to cover the gap, either by rising to fill a downward gap or falling to fill an upward gap. While not a guaranteed rule, this observation influences many crypto futures trading strategies. For instance, an upward gap like the one we’ve just seen might lead some traders to anticipate a potential price correction downwards to “fill” that $385 difference. Conversely, others might view it as a sign of underlying strength, indicating sustained bullish momentum. The significance lies in how market participants interpret and react to these gaps, often leading to increased volatility as positions are adjusted. Monitoring these gaps can offer valuable insights into market psychology and potential short-term price movements. Navigating Digital Asset Derivatives: What’s Next? The opening of CME Bitcoin futures with this gap underscores the growing maturity and institutional interest in digital asset derivatives . These regulated products offer traditional investors a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the underlying asset. The liquidity and transparency offered by exchanges like CME attract a different class of participants compared to spot markets or unregulated crypto exchanges. For those engaging in crypto futures trading , monitoring the CME gap provides an additional layer of market insight. It’s one piece of the puzzle in a complex market. Traders often combine this analysis with other technical indicators, fundamental news, and broader market sentiment to form a comprehensive strategy. Key Considerations for Traders: Volatility: Gaps can lead to increased short-term volatility as the market attempts to “resolve” them. Sentiment Indicator: A significant gap can reflect strong market sentiment that developed outside regular trading hours. Strategy Adjustment: Some traders specifically build strategies around the premise of gaps filling, either long-term or short-term. The latest $385 higher opening for CME Bitcoin futures is a clear signal of active price discovery occurring even when traditional markets are closed. It reminds us of the unique characteristics of the Bitcoin futures market and the dynamic nature of crypto futures trading . Whether this gap fills quickly or signals further upward momentum, it’s a noteworthy event for anyone observing the evolving landscape of digital asset derivatives . This development emphasizes the importance of staying informed about all aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, from spot prices to sophisticated futures contracts. As the market continues to mature, understanding these nuances becomes increasingly vital for making informed trading decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a CME Bitcoin futures gap? A1: A CME Bitcoin futures gap occurs when the opening price of the futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is significantly different from its previous closing price. This typically happens over the weekend because the CME closes, but the underlying Bitcoin market trades 24/7. Q2: Why is the CME gap considered important by traders? A2: Many traders in the Bitcoin futures market observe CME gaps because of a historical tendency for these gaps to “fill,” meaning the price eventually revisits the gap level. While not a guaranteed rule, it influences trading strategies and can signal underlying market sentiment. Q3: Does an upward CME gap, like the recent one, always mean a price correction? A3: Not necessarily. While some traders anticipate a “fill” downwards, an upward gap can also signify strong bullish momentum for crypto futures trading . It’s one data point among many that traders use to assess market direction. Q4: How do CME Bitcoin futures differ from spot Bitcoin trading? A4: CME Bitcoin futures are regulated financial contracts that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s future price without owning the actual cryptocurrency. Spot trading involves buying or selling Bitcoin directly for immediate delivery. Futures offer leverage and different risk profiles, falling under digital asset derivatives . Q5: Where can I find data on CME Bitcoin futures gaps? A5: You can find data on CME Bitcoin futures , including price gaps, on various financial charting platforms like TradingView, which was cited in this article, or directly from the CME Group’s website.

The digital asset is currently signaling a strong Ethereum bullish outlook , primarily driven by a significant tightening of its available supply. This fascinating market dynamic, highlighted by experts like XWIN Research Japan, a CryptoQuant contributor, suggests ETH could be entering a robust growth phase. Understanding these shifts is key for anyone interested in the future of digital finance. What’s Fueling the Ethereum Bullish Outlook ? The core of this optimism stems from a dramatic reduction in ETH held on cryptocurrency exchanges. Since late July, exchange balances have plummeted, with daily withdrawals frequently exceeding 100,000 ETH. This consistent outflow indicates that more investors are moving their Ethereum off exchanges, often into cold storage or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, reducing the immediate selling pressure. One notable example of this trend was the withdrawal of 92,899 ETH, valued at approximately $412 million, from Kraken over just four days. Such large movements highlight a strategic shift by holders who anticipate future price appreciation rather than short-term trading. The Impact of ETH Supply Squeeze When the supply of an asset available for trading on exchanges decreases significantly, it creates what is known as a supply squeeze. This phenomenon typically precedes upward price movements, especially when demand remains constant or increases. With only 18.4 million ETH currently left on exchanges, analysts are increasingly warning that liquidity is drying up. Reduced Selling Pressure: Less ETH on exchanges means fewer tokens are immediately available for sale, which can limit downward price volatility. Increased Scarcity: As the circulating supply on exchanges diminishes, the perception of scarcity grows, potentially driving up demand. Foundation for Growth: A tight supply forms a strong foundation for future price increases, even with moderate demand. Surging Spot ETH ETFs and Institutional Interest A major catalyst for the current positive sentiment is the remarkable performance of U.S. spot ETH ETFs. These investment vehicles have recently posted record weekly inflows totaling $2.85 billion. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF alone led the charge with an impressive $2.32 billion in inflows, showcasing immense investor confidence. Beyond ETFs, we are also seeing companies directly adding Ethereum to their corporate treasuries. Firms like SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine have acquired hundreds of thousands of ETH, signaling a growing trend of corporate adoption. This rising institutional interest validates Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class. Navigating the Ethereum Price Landscape While the long-term trend appears undeniably bullish due to the tightening supply and surging demand, it is always prudent to consider short-term market dynamics. Price pullbacks are a natural part of any market cycle, even within a strong uptrend. These temporary dips can offer new entry points for investors who missed earlier opportunities. However, the overarching narrative remains clear: the fundamental forces of supply and demand are aligning to support a continued upward trajectory for Ethereum. The decreasing availability of ETH on exchanges, coupled with relentless institutional and ETF demand, paints a compelling picture for its future price action. What Does This Mean for Institutional Ethereum Demand ? The confluence of a shrinking supply and robust ETF inflows signifies a maturing market where institutional players are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Ethereum. This growing institutional Ethereum demand is not just a fleeting trend; it reflects a deeper understanding of Ethereum’s utility, its role in the decentralized economy, and its potential as a store of value. As more institutions seek exposure to digital assets, Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem and deflationary mechanisms (post-merge), becomes an increasingly attractive option. This sustained demand from large-scale investors will likely continue to absorb available supply, further strengthening the bullish case for ETH. In conclusion, Ethereum is positioned for significant growth. The dramatic reduction in exchange supply, combined with unprecedented institutional and ETF inflows, creates a powerful bullish feedback loop. While market volatility is always a factor, the underlying fundamentals suggest a strong and sustainable upward trend for Ethereum. Investors and enthusiasts alike are watching closely as ETH solidifies its position as a cornerstone of the digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is driving the current Ethereum bullish outlook? The current Ethereum bullish outlook is primarily driven by a significant reduction in ETH supply on exchanges, coupled with record inflows into U.S. spot ETH ETFs and increasing institutional adoption. How do spot ETH ETFs impact Ethereum’s price? Spot ETH ETFs allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. Their record inflows signify strong institutional demand, which absorbs available supply and can drive up the Ethereum price. What is an ETH supply squeeze? An ETH supply squeeze occurs when the amount of Ethereum available on cryptocurrency exchanges for trading significantly decreases. This scarcity, combined with sustained demand, typically leads to upward price pressure. Is Ethereum a good long-term investment? Based on the current supply tightening, rising institutional interest, and the growing utility of its network, many analysts view Ethereum as a strong candidate for long-term investment, despite potential short-term price fluctuations. What is institutional Ethereum demand? Institutional Ethereum demand refers to the increasing interest and investment from large financial entities, corporations, and funds into Ethereum, often through vehicles like spot ETFs or direct treasury allocations, signaling growing mainstream acceptance.

Cuts to steel, aluminum, and auto duties, announced months ago, remain unfulfilled, leaving European, Asian, and UK firms struggling under US trade restrictions. British PM Keir Starmer at a Jaguar Land Rover plant in May, at that time, welcomed the “world-leading” agreement with US President Donald Trump. The deal would eliminate US tariffs on British steel, he said. And yet, three months later, nothing has changed. That duty remains 25% for UK steel. UK Steel’s director of trade and economic policy, Peter Brennan, said orders from the US had “fallen off a cliff.” He claims that some firms will not outlast this crisis. On the other hand, a rival producer is even more negative and claims could be forced out of business without assistance before the end of the year. The delay stems from US “melt and pour” rules, which only allow tariff cuts on steel produced entirely within the UK. Since Tata Steel UK shut down its blast furnaces last year, the company cannot meet this requirement until new electric arc facilities are operational in 2027. London has been pushing Washington to grant waivers, but progress on those talks has been slow. Tim Rutter of Tata Steel said it was not due to a lack of effort from the UK government but because US departments were overwhelmed. He noted that although billions in potential opportunities for British exporters were at stake, they remained unrealized. London officials maintained that they were working to finalize the deal as quickly as possible, but industry voices warned that the ongoing delays risked deterring unilateral action. EU and others demand swift tariff relief The EU is stuck in a very similar bind. Deal or no deal: Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission President, shook Trump’s hand on a 15% tariff cap in Scotland last July, and Brussels recognised that the cap would shrink cars too. Yet the reality looks different. However, US tariffs of 50% on EU steel and 25% on autos remain. German carmakers are sounding alarms. So far, the agreement has brought no clarity or relief to the German car makers, said Hildegard Müller, president of Germany’s auto trade body VDA. It’s costing them, she said, billions. Japan and Korea signed with Washington in July. Auto tariffs will be reduced to 15% , and steel duties will be cut, it was said. Cars get different treatment, with a 25% auto tariff still hitting Japanese and Korean automakers. Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said: “We’re still seeing an impact; the bleeding has not stopped. Freed said he believes one Japanese automaker is taking the hit to nearly ¥100 million ($680,000) per hour due to the tariff weight. South Korea is among those pushing for relief. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that Hyundai and Kia could incur up to $5 billion in additional expenses this year. The squeeze on margins and weakening global demand have also made the 15% tariff bite. US hints at more tariffs to come, Canada imposes D.C. tariffs Instead of easing duties, Washington has been trending in the opposite direction; rather than lifting duties, the latest moves slap additional tariffs on Chinese imports. The move came just weeks after Washington expanded the list of tariffs to nearly 300 new steel and aluminum product codes, covering 50% US tariffs, on August 15. That expansion took effect immediately. The shake-up has angered partners who are hoping for concessions. EU officials have blamed disagreements over digital trade rules for a hold-up in the promised joint statement with Washington. Those countries, Japan and South Korea, have been waiting for executive orders to seal the tariff relief. Critics have begun to question Washington’s commitment. Cecilia Malmström, the EU’s former trade commissioner, said that permanent delays must be avoided to prevent the process from becoming endless negotiations and excessive filibustering.

This week brings a significant event for several digital assets: their token unlocks. Understanding these events is crucial for every investor. This week’s token unlock schedule is set to release over $99 million worth of tokens into the market, with a particularly notable ZRO unlock valued at $55.02 million. According to data from Tokenomist, these planned releases can significantly influence market dynamics. As supply increases, investors often watch closely for potential price shifts and changes in market sentiment. Let’s delve into the details of these upcoming crypto unlocks and assess their potential market impact . What Does This Week’s Token Unlock Schedule Mean? Token unlocks are pre-scheduled events where previously restricted cryptocurrencies become available for trading. Projects often lock up a portion of their tokens for founders, early investors, or team members to prevent immediate sell-offs and ensure long-term commitment. However, when these tokens unlock, they add to the circulating supply. This increase in available tokens can sometimes lead to selling pressure, especially if early investors decide to take profits. Therefore, monitoring the token unlock schedule is a key aspect of understanding a project’s tokenomics and predicting potential price movements. Key Crypto Unlocks to Watch This Week Several projects have significant unlocks planned, contributing to the overall supply increase. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the major events: PIXEL: On August 19 at 10:00 UTC, 91.18 million tokens (worth $3.18 million) will unlock, representing 4.54% of the circulating supply. This unlock could introduce fresh liquidity for PIXEL holders. ZRO: The most substantial event is the ZRO unlock , occurring on August 20 at 11:00 UTC. A massive 25.71 million ZRO tokens, valued at $55.02 million, will become available. This represents 8.53% of the current circulating supply, making it a critical point for ZRO’s short-term price action. KAITO: Also on August 20, at 12:00 UTC, 23.35 million KAITO tokens (worth $25.92 million) will unlock. This release accounts for 10.87% of its circulating supply, which is a notable percentage. AVAIL: Scheduled for August 23 at 08:00 UTC, 220 million AVAIL tokens (worth $3.99 million) will unlock. This is 7.67% of its circulating supply. SOON: On August 23 at 08:30 UTC, 41.88 million SOON tokens (worth $11.77 million) will unlock, comprising 13.04% of its circulating supply. This is the largest percentage unlock among the listed tokens. Understanding the Potential Market Impact and Tokenomics The release of a large number of tokens can create selling pressure, especially if recipients decide to sell for profit. This increased supply, without a corresponding increase in demand, typically leads to price depreciation. The significant ZRO unlock , for instance, represents a considerable influx of tokens. However, the actual market impact depends on several factors. These include the overall market sentiment, the project’s fundamentals, and the intentions of the token holders. Some holders might retain their tokens, while others might sell, influencing price volatility. For projects with strong fundamentals and ongoing development, the long-term impact might be minimal as new demand absorbs the increased supply. Conversely, projects with weaker fundamentals could see more pronounced negative effects. Navigating Token Unlocks: Actionable Insights As an investor, staying informed about these events is key. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate upcoming crypto unlocks : Monitor Supply Changes: Keep an eye on the circulating supply of tokens you hold or plan to invest in. Tools like Tokenomist provide valuable data. Assess Project Fundamentals: A strong project with clear utility and ongoing development is often better equipped to handle large unlocks without significant price drops. Understand Holder Behavior: Research who holds the locked tokens. Are they venture capitalists, team members, or early community members? Their typical behavior can offer clues. Consider Risk Management: If you anticipate volatility, adjust your position size or set stop-loss orders. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on unlock news. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term price fluctuations due to unlocks and the project’s long-term potential. A temporary dip might present a buying opportunity for long-term holders. The upcoming token unlock schedule , particularly the substantial ZRO unlock , highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market. While these events can introduce volatility, understanding their mechanics and potential market impact allows investors to make more informed decisions. By paying attention to tokenomics and project fundamentals, you can better navigate these significant supply changes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a token unlock? A: A token unlock is a pre-scheduled event where a previously restricted portion of a cryptocurrency’s total supply becomes available for circulation and trading. These tokens are typically held by project founders, early investors, or team members under a vesting schedule. Q2: Why do token unlocks happen? A: Token unlocks are part of a project’s tokenomics design. They help manage the initial distribution of tokens, incentivize long-term commitment from stakeholders, and gradually release tokens into the market over time to prevent sudden supply shocks. Q3: How does a token unlock affect the price of a cryptocurrency? A: When tokens unlock, the circulating supply increases. If there isn’t a corresponding increase in demand, this can lead to selling pressure and potentially a price decrease. However, the actual impact depends on market sentiment, the project’s fundamentals, and the intentions of the token holders. Q4: What is the significance of the ZRO unlock this week? A: The ZRO unlock this week is significant due to its substantial value of $55.02 million and its representation of 8.53% of the circulating supply. This large influx of tokens makes it a key event to watch for potential short-term price volatility for ZRO. Q5: Where can I track upcoming token unlock schedules? A: Several platforms provide data on token unlock schedules. Reputable crypto data aggregators and specialized services like Tokenomist (as cited in this article) often track and publish these schedules, offering valuable insights for investors.

This significant on-chain transfer has quickly captured the attention of market watchers and on-chain analysts alike, sparking discussions across the crypto community. What’s Happening with Pump.fun and the PUMP Token? According to on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, a Pump.fun token distribution address transferred 2.5 billion PUMP token , valued at an impressive $9.19 million, to the OKX exchange . This movement occurred just a few hours ago, making it fresh news with potential ripple effects across the broader crypto market . For those unfamiliar, Pump.fun is a platform that allows users to create and launch tokens without needing initial liquidity. This unique model has seen rapid adoption, leading to a surge in new meme coins and experimental projects.

When a large volume of tokens moves from a project’s distribution address to a centralized exchange like OKX, it often signals several possibilities. These movements are closely watched because they can precede significant market events. Here are some potential implications: Increased Liquidity: Transferring tokens to an exchange can prepare for enhanced trading liquidity, making it easier for users to buy and sell. Potential Listing: Such a large deposit might precede an official listing on the OKX exchange , which could expose the PUMP token to a much wider audience and potentially drive its price.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile crypto market . Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market: What Should You Do? In a rapidly evolving space like cryptocurrency, staying informed is key.

Meanwhile, Monero (XMR) price analysis reveals deep network concerns after a 51% mining control claim, sending it down over 15% in a week. Both highlight how momentum and risk shape the current market narrative. In the top crypto for 2025 analysis, however, Cold Wallet (CWT) commands a different conversation. With $6 million raised, 2 million active users migrated, and Stage 17 pricing at $0.00998, far below its next batch price, it is entering the market with a live, revenue-generating product. In an environment where speed, adoption, and infrastructure matter, Cold Wallet is positioned to outperform competitors from day one. Cardano Targets $1.50 as ETF Buzz and Bullish Charts Heat Up Cardano (ADA) has climbed nearly 16% in recent sessions, trading between $0.88 and $0.98, as technical indicators and ETF speculation fuel optimism. Price action is approaching the key $0.94 neckline, part of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. A breakout above this level could open the path toward $1.20, with some analysts eyeing $1.50 as the next major target. Momentum is supported by Grayscale’s creation of a Delaware trust for ADA, sparking talk of a potential spot ETF that could draw institutional demand. On-chain data reinforces the bullish case, ADA’s MVRV Z-score of 0.445 signals profit without extreme overvaluation, while short liquidations of over $832,000 in a single day suggest bearish traders are exiting. With supply tightening and sentiment improving, ADA’s setup points toward further gains if resistance breaks, making it a key watch in the coming weeks. Monero Price Sinks After 51% Mining Control Shake-Up Monero (XMR) has dropped over 6% in a day and nearly 15% in a week after Qubic claimed control of more than half of its mining power. The development sparked fears of a 51% attack, which could allow transaction censorship or block manipulation. Qubic’s claim coincided with a six-block chain reorganization and 60 orphaned blocks, indicating network disruption. While Qubic calls the move an economic experiment rather than an attack, its control has shaken confidence in Monero’s decentralization model. The network’s RandomX algorithm was designed to prevent such dominance, yet the event shows mid-tier proof-of-work coins remain vulnerable. Analysts note that sustaining majority control could be costly, but even short-term dominance risks damaging trust. With Monero trading near $252, technical signals point to oversold conditions, leaving the market watching whether recovery is possible or if deeper losses are ahead. Cold Wallet’s $0.00998 Stage 17 Price Marks a Rare Presale Execution Play Cold Wallet’s presale momentum shows what the market values most: execution. Securing $6 million in just weeks reflects deep buy-side conviction, backed by a fully operational product. The seamless migration of over 2 million active Plus Wallet users ensures adoption from day one, removing the post-launch lag that slows most projects. Stage 17 pricing at $0.00998 offers a steep advantage over the next batch price of $0.3517, translating to a built-in upside potential exceeding 3,400% before the first exchange listing. The wallet’s cashback and fee refund system is already functional, embedding recurring value directly into user transactions. With development funded, infrastructure in place, and a large user base already secured, expansion efforts can begin immediately after listing. The gap between current presale pricing and market valuation could close quickly once trading starts, as liquidity meets proven utility. In the self-custody space, a launch with this level of readiness and scale is rare, positioning Cold Wallet to set a new benchmark for presale-to-market execution. This is not about speculative promises; it’s a live system prepared to compete from day one, giving early participants a structurally advantaged entry point. Why Cold Wallet Could Be 2025’s First Breakout Winner The current top crypto for 2025 analysis shows three distinct paths. The Cardano (ADA) price pattern has strong upside potential but still relies on ETF speculation and technical confirmation. The Monero (XMR) price analysis warns of structural vulnerabilities that can impact trust and long-term adoption. Cold Wallet, by contrast, has already solved the adoption gap, 2 million users onboarded before launch, while securing $6 million in presale funding. Its Stage 17 price of $0.00998 offers over 3,400% upside to the next batch price, creating a structurally rare entry point. The product is live, its cashback and fee refund system is operational, and its infrastructure is market-ready. This mix of execution, scale, and undervaluation gives Cold Wallet the clearest advantage heading into 2025, making it the standout in any objective top crypto for 2025 analysis.

The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric, recently registered 48. This figure signals a clear shift: we are currently in Bitcoin Season . Understanding this dynamic is essential for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Let’s explore what this means for your portfolio and the broader crypto market trends . What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), offers a snapshot of the market’s pulse. It helps investors gauge whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. This index specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing purely on the performance of the top 100 coins listed on CMC over the past 90 days. It provides a clear indicator of prevailing market sentiments. Here’s how the index works: If 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, it’s an Altcoin Season . The index would be high, typically above 75. Conversely, if 25% or fewer altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This is reflected by a lower index score, usually below 25. Scores between 25 and 75 suggest a neutral or mixed market, where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin have a clear, sustained dominance. Why Are We Experiencing Bitcoin Season? With the Altcoin Season Index currently at 48, it indicates that fewer than 75% but more than 25% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. While not a definitive “deep” Bitcoin Season (which would be below 25), this score still means Bitcoin is currently the stronger performer relative to most altcoins. This period often sees Bitcoin capturing a larger share of the total crypto market capitalization, sometimes referred to as Bitcoin dominance. During a Bitcoin Season , investors often consolidate their positions into Bitcoin. They view it as a safer or more stable asset during periods of uncertainty. Bitcoin also acts as a primary driver of market rallies. This can lead to a divergence in altcoin performance , where many smaller coins struggle to gain traction, while Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory or holds its value more effectively. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends Understanding the current crypto market trends is crucial for making informed decisions. When Bitcoin leads the charge, it often acts as the market’s bellwether. Its price movements tend to influence the broader market, even if altcoins don’t always follow proportionally. For instance, a strong Bitcoin rally might eventually pull some altcoins up, but often with a delay or with less significant gains compared to Bitcoin itself. What should you consider during such a period? Risk Assessment: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, carry higher risk during Bitcoin Season. Their volatility can be amplified. Portfolio Rebalancing: Some investors choose to increase their Bitcoin holdings to capitalize on its dominance or to reduce exposure to more volatile altcoins. Research Deeply: While overall altcoin performance might be subdued, specific projects with strong fundamentals, active development, or unique use cases might still buck the trend. Always do your own research (DYOR). What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Cycles? The cryptocurrency market operates in distinct cryptocurrency cycles . Periods of Bitcoin dominance often precede or follow periods of altcoin exuberance. It’s not uncommon for Bitcoin to rally first, drawing new capital into the market, which then eventually trickles down into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. The current index reading suggests we are still awaiting that significant “trickle down” effect for a broad altcoin rally. Keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index will provide ongoing insights into these cycles. As market conditions evolve, this index can shift rapidly, signaling potential changes in investment opportunities. Be prepared to adapt your strategy as these cycles unfold. Staying agile is key to long-term success in the crypto space. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index at 48 clearly indicates that Bitcoin is leading the charge in the crypto market. While altcoin performance is generally subdued, this period offers unique insights into market dynamics. Staying informed about these crucial crypto market trends empowers you to make strategic decisions, whether you’re consolidating into Bitcoin or carefully selecting promising altcoins for the next cycle. The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and understanding its rhythm is key to success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks the performance of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over the past 90 days to determine if the market is in “Altcoin Season” or “Bitcoin Season.” Q2: How is Bitcoin Season defined by the index? A2: Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically below 25 during this period. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 48 mean? A3: An index of 48 signifies that the market is currently in Bitcoin Season, as fewer than 75% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, though it’s not a deep Bitcoin Season. Q4: How can I use the Altcoin Season Index in my investing strategy? A4: The index helps you understand prevailing crypto market trends. During Bitcoin Season, consider rebalancing your portfolio towards Bitcoin or focusing on fundamentally strong altcoins. During Altcoin Season, broader altcoin exposure might be more beneficial. Q5: Does the index include stablecoins? A5: No, the Altcoin Season Index specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clearer picture of speculative altcoin performance against Bitcoin.

Both have compelling stories, yet neither is matching the rapid traction BlockDAG (BDAG) is generating before its market debut. BlockDAG has already secured $376 million in its presale and is focused on delivering functional products alongside a clear long-term vision. Its hybrid blockchain and DAG technology, the educational BlockDAG Academy, and the live demonstration of its X1 and X10 miners have positioned it as far more than just another presale token. Stellar Targets $1 Breakout as Momentum Builds Stellar (XLM) has been climbing steadily after defending support at the 0.618 Fibonacci level near $0.20. Analysts, including Crypto Patel, suggest that clearing resistance at $0.58 could open the path toward the $1 mark. Now trading at $0.4542, Stellar maintains strong liquidity with a market cap above $14 billion and daily volume exceeding $500 million. With the RSI at 62.09 and price holding above the Bollinger Bands’ basis line at $0.4230, the $0.50 to $0.52 zone will be the key battleground for its next breakout attempt. Bittensor Strengthens Position in AI-Powered Crypto Bittensor (TAO) has secured a spot as a leading decentralized marketplace for AI models and services. This focus has fueled projections for a move toward $779 in 2025 and a potential climb to $5,915.54 by 2030. Currently priced at $379.95, TAO continues to attract institutional attention, with Nasdaq-listed Synaptogenix and Oblong purchasing over $17 million worth since June 2025. The December 2025 halving, which will cut daily emissions from 7,200 to 3,600 TAO, may further tighten supply, setting the stage for upward pressure if AI adoption accelerates. BlockDAG’s $376M Growth Backed by Technology, Education, and Live Mining While Stellar and Bittensor work toward ambitious price milestones, BlockDAG is executing a strategy built on delivering functional products before its exchange listing. Its progress is driven by three core strengths: its hybrid blockchain and DAG architecture, the educational BlockDAG Academy, and the proven capabilities of its X1 and X10 mining devices. The hybrid blockchain and DAG structure offers scalability between 2,000 and 15,000 transactions per second while maintaining full EVM compatibility. This design supports smart contracts, decentralized applications, and cross-chain interoperability, giving developers the tools to deploy quickly in a high-speed and secure environment. BlockDAG Academy serves as more than a learning hub. Structured in three tiers, it provides an onboarding pathway from beginner to advanced blockchain concepts, with each level offering verifiable on-chain credentials through the BlockDAG Explorer. This approach cultivates a knowledgeable and engaged community that can actively contribute to the network’s growth. The July 23 live demo of the X1 mobile mining app and X10 hardware miner reinforced the project’s readiness. The X1 already serves over 2.5 million users, while the X10 produces up to 200 BDAG daily at the projected $0.05 listing price. With $376 million raised and Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, BlockDAG has positioned itself as one of the most compelling crypto opportunities right now. Key Points Stellar’s momentum supports bullish breakout predictions, and Bittensor’s expanding AI-driven ecosystem continues to strengthen its long-term trend. Both remain influential in their respective spaces, yet BlockDAG’s $376 million presale, proven infrastructure, and commitment to community growth place it on a higher tier. By delivering a functional hybrid blockchain and DAG network, educating users through the BlockDAG Academy, and proving its mining technology before listing, BlockDAG offers clear evidence of capability. With its price still below the projected launch value, it provides a rare opportunity rooted in adoption and execution rather than speculation.

The presale has already raised millions, attracting inflows not just from meme coin enthusiasts but also from Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin holders looking for high-upside opportunities. In a market now worth over $4.2 trillion, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about early-stage investments in August 2025. Community Power Meets Security Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has passed multiple blockchain audits, a milestone that has boosted trust among investors. This security-first approach has reassured crypto investors looking for a safer entry into speculative plays that tend to generate substantial returns in the market. At the same time, its community engagement has been fierce and has drawn significant trust within the market. Analyst ROI Projections for This Crypto Presale Market analysts consistently frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the best crypto presales with a real breakout potential. Most of these forecasts center around 20x–35x ROI for early participants, but bullish projections stretch toward 50x and even 60x if exchange listings and market sentiment align. In fact, speculative reports go further, suggesting that in a blowout bull market MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver gains as high as 13,600% (136x). However, these outcomes are far from guaranteed. Nevertheless, they highlight the asymmetry between potential risk and potential reward. How does MAGACOIN FINANCE stack up against established giants like Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX)? Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi and NFTs, with institutions steadily accumulating, but its market size makes 60x gains nearly impossible. Avalanche, with its scalable design and growing developer base, remains a strong long-term pick, yet analysts agree its growth curve will be steadier and less explosive. This leaves the political-themed MAGACOIN FINANCE project as the speculative high-upside contender, offering returns ETH and AVAX can’t realistically match. Of course, the trade-off is significantly higher risk—making it a play for bold investors with an appetite for volatility. The Bigger Picture What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is how it blends meme coin energy with structural legitimacy. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu proved the viral power of memes, but lacked early audits or clear tokenomics. By combining cultural momentum with audited security and exchange-readiness, MAGACOIN FINANCE positions itself as a hybrid: fun, viral, but also built to last. With its presale offering a 50% EXTRA token allocation, the clock is ticking for early adopters in the industry. So, if the projected crypto exchange listings land and the bullish crypto market cycle continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE could emerge as one of 2025’s defining altcoin stories that would lead to significant gains for investors. Final Word So, as the crypto market reaches new highs of more than $4 trillion, the contrast is clear for discerning investors. Ethereum and Avalanche remain foundational blue chips for storied investors seeking stability, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto presale that will skyrocket in this cycle. Whether it delivers 20x, 60x, or more, it has already cemented its reputation as the crypto presale to watch in 2025.

However, this positive momentum was short-lived, as the premier cryptocurrency crashed from the unprecedented high of $124,000 down to around $118,000. The Bitcoin price has struggled to reignite this bullish run over the weekend, hovering in and around the $118,00 level for the majority of Saturday, August 16. The latest on-chain data suggests that this price sluggishness might persist over the next few weeks. Bitcoin Netflow On Binance Turns Positive As Selling Pressure Persists In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, pseudonymous on-chain analyst BorisVest revealed that the Bitcoin price could experience selling pressure over the next one to two weeks. This projection is based on the flow of coins on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day CDD Down: Market Absorbs LTH Selling Without Breaking Support The relevant indicators here include the Bitcoin Netflow and Exchange Reserve metrics, both of which measure the amount of coins that enter or leave a cryptocurrency exchange. According to data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin netflow has turned positive while outflows have reduced on the Binance exchange. BorisVest mentioned that this trend suggests that Bitcoin is in a distribution phase, especially on Binance, leading to the current high volatility in the market. The analyst explained that this might have played a role in the short-lived momentum faced by the Bitcoin price during its last run-up to the all-time high. BorisVest noted that the exchange reserves on Binance continued to rise as the Bitcoin price soared to a new all-time high, indicating that investors sent their coins to the exchange to be sold for profit. “The missing component was buyers; once price reached the peak and demand kicked in, selling pressure accelerated,” the on-chain analyst added. Furthermore, BorisVest highlighted that the Perpetual-Spot Price Gap showed the presence of aggressive buyers, creating an ideal environment for distribution. According to the online pundit, Binance whales took the opportunity to sell, with buyers in position. BorisVest mentioned that Binance’s significant trading volume plays a crucial role in why and how the exchange’s activity influences the crypto market. Hence, Binance whales offloading as new buyers enter tends to put substantial selling pressure on the Bitcoin price. The on-chain concluded that while the broader upward trend remains in play, the Bitcoin price is likely to continue to experience selling pressure over the next one to two weeks. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $117,490, reflecting an almost 1% price jump in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Institutions Buying The Bitcoin Dip?

Recent crypto analysis points to a critical junction for the leading digital asset, particularly concerning a key Bitcoin support level. This isn’t just a random number; it’s a price point carrying significant weight for the entire BTC market , potentially dictating its immediate future trajectory. Why is $118K a Crucial Bitcoin Support Level? According to analyst Crazzyblockk from CryptoQuant, the $118,000 mark is a pivotal area. He highlighted this in a recent post, emphasizing its profound importance. This specific level represents the average entry price for a substantial cohort of investors who purchased Bitcoin over the past month. This metric, derived from on-chain data, offers a unique insight into the market’s underlying structure. These investors collectively hold approximately 1.69 million BTC, a significant portion of the circulating supply. Their collective average entry price at $118,000 transforms this figure into a psychological and technical barrier. A sustained fall below this point could trigger widespread selling, as these recent buyers might look to minimize potential losses, creating a domino effect. Understanding the Investor Sentiment Behind This BTC Market Mark When a large segment of investors buys at a particular price, that level often functions as strong support. It clearly indicates where many market participants perceive Bitcoin price to offer genuine value. Therefore, the $118,000 level is not merely a technical indicator; it powerfully reflects a collective investor sentiment . If the price drops below this average entry point, it means these recent buyers are effectively “underwater,” facing unrealized losses. This situation frequently leads to increased selling pressure, as investors might panic, face margin calls, or be compelled to liquidate their positions to prevent further erosion of capital. Conversely, if Bitcoin successfully defends this crucial Bitcoin support , it could instill renewed confidence across the market, signaling a potential rebound and attracting fresh buying interest. Navigating Potential Bitcoin Price Scenarios What could happen if Bitcoin approaches or breaches this critical support? The market currently faces two primary, distinct scenarios, each with significant implications for the broader crypto landscape: Scenario 1: Bitcoin Holds Strong. If BTC successfully maintains its position above the $118,000 mark, it would demonstrate significant resilience. This defense could lead to renewed buying interest, potentially propelling the Bitcoin price upwards as market confidence returns and fear subsides. This scenario suggests a stabilization. Scenario 2: A Drop Below. Analyst Crazzyblockk issued a clear warning that a sustained break below $118,000 could expose the market to further declines. This event might usher in a deeper correction, potentially testing lower support zones and extending the current market downturn. Investors should therefore prepare for increased volatility and potential downside if this level fails. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Analysis For anyone actively involved in the crypto space, understanding and monitoring these critical levels is absolutely vital for making informed decisions. This particular Bitcoin support level offers a clear and immediate reference point for assessing market health. Monitor Closely: Keep a keen eye on Bitcoin’s price action specifically around the $118,000 mark. Real-time data and alerts can be invaluable. Assess Risk: Proactively consider how a potential break of this support could impact your existing portfolio. Diversification across various assets and sectors remains a cornerstone of robust risk management. Stay Informed: Continuously follow reliable crypto analysis from reputable experts and utilize on-chain data tools to gauge prevailing market sentiment and evolving technical indicators. The BTC market is inherently dynamic, and staying updated with the latest insights is crucial for navigating its complexities. The $118,000 level for Bitcoin is far more than just a numerical value; it is a significant battleground for investor sentiment and a critical determinant of Bitcoin’s immediate price direction. As meticulously highlighted by analyst Crazzyblockk, its ability to hold this crucial Bitcoin support will profoundly influence whether the market experiences a much-needed rebound or a more extended and deeper correction. Staying vigilant, understanding the profound implications of this level, and adapting your strategy accordingly is paramount for all participants in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin support level? A Bitcoin support level is a price point where buying interest is strong enough to prevent the price from falling further. It often indicates where a significant number of investors are willing to buy, creating a floor for the price. Why is $118,000 considered a crucial support level for Bitcoin? Analyst Crazzyblockk identified $118,000 as crucial because it represents the average entry price for a large group of investors who recently bought approximately 1.69 million BTC. This makes it a significant psychological and technical barrier. What are the potential implications if Bitcoin drops below $118,000? A sustained drop below this level could lead to increased selling pressure as recent buyers face losses, potentially triggering further declines and a deeper market correction. How can investors use this information for their crypto analysis? Investors should closely monitor Bitcoin’s price action around $118,000, assess their risk exposure, and stay informed through reliable crypto analysis. This level can act as a key indicator for future price movements. If you found this analysis on Bitcoin’s crucial support insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

According to property website Rightmove, average asking prices dropped by 1.3% in August to £368,740. The decline follows steeper falls in June and July, marking the sharpest three-month downturn in years. More than one in three properties on the market have had their prices reduced since first being listed, reflecting a shift in supply and demand as more homes compete for fewer buyers. Analysts say the housing market is undergoing a correction, unwinding last year’s momentum from stamp duty reforms and fading optimism about interest rates. Buyers benefit from high choice and falling rates The shift has meanwhile presented a rare opportunity for buyers. Housing supply rose nearly 10% compared to a year ago and is the highest in nearly a decade. This equates to greater selection and smaller negotiating strength for buyers. Although values have decreased, the cars are still selling shockingly well.—This is a strong showing. It was the best month for sales in five years, with agreed deals 8% higher than a year ago. That makes July the busiest month since the post-COVID bounce-back in 2020. Borrowing costs are also easing. Two-year fixed mortgages on average have fallen from 5.17% earlier this year to about 4.5% After three cuts in the Bank of England Base Rate in 2025, lenders have been reducing their rates to be competitive. Nonetheless, analysts caution against aggressive easing moves as the central bank starts to address inflation pressures that have broadened the economy. Sellers compete hard to close deals The market has been tougher for sellers. Compared to the recent past, though, there are a lot more homes around, meaning buyers have a much larger smorgasbord of choice, forcing prices down. Failing to price a property at its true value will only deter buyers who can easily scroll to the next house available. The extent of this can be seen using the data from Rightmove. Those homes that DO get buyer attention in 79 days on average are priced competitively right from the start, and sellers are walking away with about 94% of their list price. By comparison, homes that need to be lowered are staying on the market as long as 99 days (almost three months). This large spread reinforces the need for sellers to position their homes properly in the beginning and not chase the market downward afterward. More sellers, faced with fierce competition, agree to reduce their asking prices earlier in the selling process. A growing chorus of agents is cautioning sellers not to aim too high, but instead list homes at “attractive” prices that may generate fast attention and potential offers. Those figures mark a departure from recent years for sellers, who had the luxury to hold out for higher offers while a rapid turnaround in the market. Rightmove, meanwhile, reduced its forecast for the market as a whole in the future. It is expected to see a smaller 2% increase in UK house prices by 2025, falling from forecasts of 4%. The revision indicates a combination of substantial supply, more cautious buyers, and only limited relief to mortgage costs. The consensus among industry experts is that buyers are now fully in the driver’s seat. A bit more product for sale may serve to the advantage of buyers as interest rates slowly descend into affordability again, allowing buyers time to haggle. Though the market is quite competitive, sellers can make a deal with careful pricing and a good presentation. Colleen Babcock of Rightmove said: “Buyers have the upper hand in this high-supply market, so a tempting price is vital to agree a sale.

Doubts Grow as DeFi Crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Steals the Show,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/will-dogecoin-doge-price-hit-1-doubts-grow-as-defi-crypto-mutuum-finance-mutm-steals-the-show/,"As Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to sustain momentum amid a volatile market, a new DeFi coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is rapidly drawing investor attention and challenging the status quo. Mutuum Finance token price at presale phase 6 is $0.035. It will increase by 14.29% to $0.04 during presale stage 7. Early investors will get at least 400% returns when the token goes live. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $14.5 million and attracted over 15300 investors. Mutuum Finance’s surge in visibility is making investors question over whether Dogecoin (DOGE) can keep pace with next-generation blockchain ecosystems. Mutuum Finance is quietly positioning itself to steal the spotlight entirely. Dogecoin’s $1 Ambition: Momentum Meets Uncertainty Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at around $0.252, buoyed by recent bullish momentum such as a golden cross on the daily chart, an indicator that historically precedes strong rallies. Analysts see technical catalysts potentially setting the stage for a 300% move toward the $1 milestone in the medium term. That said, models remain mixed: while some analysts predict modest upside to $0.35 this week, others suggest that a leap to $1 could be a stretch without sustained volume and broader market support. Amid this speculative landscape, emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance are increasingly capturing investor attention in parallel discussions. Mutuum Finance Presale Thrives, Achieves 95.00 Trust Score in Audit Mutuum Finance is demonstrating its potential in the DeFi ecosystem. The project has a 95.0/100 trust score that has been verified and audited by Certik. It is offering a secure environment to perform DeFi transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is combining advanced lending functionality with the security of a future-looking environment that boasts a clear DeFi focus. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing an Ethereum, overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin. It will give long-term liquidity, trust, and stability to any form of clients. Mutuum Finance Presale Kicks Off Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is picking up the pace with its presale phases shutting in a sprint. The project is already in phase 6 at $0.035. Its next phase price will be 14.29% higher at $0.04. Interest in investment is growing with the project having raised over $14.5 million and already having more than 15300 token holders. Boosting DeFi Security with Giveaway and $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently announced a $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky winners will be given $10,000 MUTM tokens. The team also initiated a top 50 token holder leaderboard that will be rewarded bonus tokens by position. As another step towards the safety of its platform, Mutuum Finance also introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. It will be paying and rewarding each bug at four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The Next Generation of DeFi Lending MUTM offers the users a safe and efficient double lending channel. Peer-to-Contract model smart contracts enable lending without middlemen. Smart contracts are designed to migrate so that they can obtain high interest. Peer-to-Peer infrastructure allows for the elimination of the middlemen and gives lenders and borrowers direct access to one another. Dogecoin’s $1 goal remains uncertain, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging ahead with stronger short-term potential. Now in stage 6 at $0.035, the price will rise 14.29% to $0.04 in stage 7. With over $14.5M raised from 15300+ investors, a 95.0 CertiK trust score, USD-pegged stablecoin plans, dual lending models, and a $100K giveaway, MUTM offers early buyers a chance at 400%+ returns post-launch. Momentum is building quickly, making this a prime entry before the next price jump.

This move comes in response to the ongoing 51% attack against the Monero blockchain, an open-source protocol and privacy-focused network. For context, a 51% attack refers to a situation where a group of miners gains more than 50% of a blockchain’s mining hash rate. On Tuesday, August 12, Qubic, a project led by IOTA co-founder Sergey Ivancheglo, claimed that it has seized control of the majority of the Monero blockchain’s hash rate. According to the Qubic mining pool, the 51% attack was executed using a useful proof-of-work (uPoW or UPoW) mechanism. As reported on Bitcoinist , the Qubic team is taking half the mining profits in XMR, converting them into USDT to buy QUBIC tokens, and then sending them to a burn address. Why Did Kraken Suspend Monero Deposits On Its Platform? In an August 15 update on its website, Kraken announced that it is temporarily stopping the deposit of Monero tokens on its trading platform after detecting that a single mining pool has taken control of more than half of the blockchain’s total hashing power. The cryptocurrency exchange said: This concentration of mining power poses a potential risk to network integrity. We are actively monitoring the situation and will resume deposits once we determine it is safe to do so. Trading and withdrawals for XMR remain fully operational. Following the release of Qubic’s claim, emerging reports on social media platform X revealed that there indeed was a six-block reorganization on the Monero blockchain, suggesting that the team does control a large enough portion of the hash rate. As Kraken mentioned, it is worth noting that Qubic’s seizure and control of the majority of Monero’s total hashing power could be significantly detrimental to the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. As it stands—with Qubic controlling 51% of the hash rate , the network is at risk of transaction censoring, double spends, and blocks reorganization, undermining the blockchain’s integrity. XMR Price Overview The reaction of the XMR price to these claims of a 51% attack on the Monero blockchain has been fairly measured. While the altcoin did lose more than 10% of its value immediately the news broke out and a further 5% in the subsequent days, the Monero token seems to be recovering well. As of this writing, the Monero token is valued at around $265, reflecting a nearly 12% jump in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, CoinGecko data shows that the altcoin is down by only 4% on the weekly timeframe.",Crypto News|Kraken|Monero. 51% Attack|Qubic|XMR,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XMR|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-18 01:30:43

This BTC price drop has captured the attention of traders and investors alike, prompting discussions about the broader cryptocurrency market trends and what might be next for digital assets. What’s Behind This Sudden BTC Price Drop ? According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin’s value currently sits at $116,818.04 on the Binance USDT market. This movement is a clear reflection of the inherent crypto volatility that characterizes digital assets. While specific triggers for this particular dip are often complex and multifaceted, several factors typically contribute to such price fluctuations: Market Sentiment: General investor mood, influenced by news, regulations, or even social media trends, can quickly shift prices. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic data, inflation concerns, or interest rate changes often impact risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors choose to sell their holdings to realize profits, leading to downward pressure. Liquidation Events: Large sell-offs, particularly from leveraged positions, can cascade and accelerate price declines. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market . Navigating Crypto Volatility : What Should Investors Consider? When facing a sudden dip in Bitcoin price , it is natural to feel a sense of concern or uncertainty. However, experienced participants in the cryptocurrency market understand that price fluctuations are a common occurrence. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate such periods: Stay Informed: Always keep an eye on reliable news sources and market analysis to understand the broader context. Avoid Panic Selling: Hasty decisions, driven by fear, often lead to avoidable losses. Consider your long-term investment strategy. Reassess Your Strategy: Use dips as an opportunity to review your portfolio and ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Consider Diversification: Spreading your investments across different assets can help mitigate risks associated with single-asset volatility. Patience and a clear understanding of your investment objectives are key during periods of heightened crypto volatility . Is This a Buying Opportunity for Bitcoin Trading ? For some, a significant BTC price drop can signal a potential buying opportunity, often referred to as ‘buying the dip.’ This approach is popular among those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory and view temporary declines as chances to acquire assets at a lower cost. However, it is absolutely crucial to approach this strategy with caution and thorough due diligence. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on speculation. Understand the fundamental value propositions of Bitcoin. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The cryptocurrency market remains highly unpredictable. Market Analysis: Look beyond the immediate price. Consider trading volumes, market depth, and overall sentiment before making a move in Bitcoin trading . While the prospect of buying low is appealing, the market can always go lower. Informed decisions are paramount. The Future of Bitcoin Price Movements The recent fall in Bitcoin price below $117,000 is a potent reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market . While a BTC price drop can be unsettling, it also presents unique challenges and opportunities for those prepared to navigate crypto volatility with a well-informed strategy.

As the market continues to evolve, staying updated and adaptable will be crucial for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $117,000?

Supported by institutional capital and embraced in Web3 ecosystems, they have established themselves as the foundational networks for smart contracts, dApps and DeFi. But in 2025, momentum is shifting. MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing a surge of retail and mid-scale investor interest, as the altcoin gains momentum. According to an expert, this altcoin could even rise faster than ETH and AVAX. Ethereum’s Steady Climb Continues Ethereum (ETH) continues to benefit from ETF tailwinds and increased regulatory clarity. With prices hovering near $4,700, investors are eyeing a break above $4,800, which could trigger rallies to $5,500 and beyond. ETH’s institutional backing remains unmatched, and the GENIUS Act, which supports DeFi and stablecoin innovation, could open the floodgates for even broader use cases. But for many retail traders, Ethereum’s large market cap and slower growth percentages are becoming less appealing compared to high-upside newcomers. Avalanche Sees Uptick Amid Real-World Adoption Avalanche (AVAX) trades in the $24 – $25 range, posting weekly gains as corporate adoption and real-world use rise. According to price models, we can anticipate a bullish trajectory towards the $33 level in the near term. Longer-term forecasts aim for a $50 target. Although Avalanche continues to show strength through infrastructure upgrades, developer traction, and ecosystem expansion, the price action continues to trail smaller-cap plays. More and more traders are splitting their capital, keeping some in safer assets such as AVAX and getting a feel for high-risk, high-reward tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin That Could Outrun Ethereum and AVAX Experts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could grow 20x faster than Ethereum and AVAX, thanks to lean tokenomics and surging demand , as capital rotation shifts toward high-upside altcoins ahead of the next market cycle. While Ethereum continues to dominate institutional flows and AVAX expands its DeFi footprint, analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum through accelerating whale accumulation, a scarcity-driven supply model, and increasing visibility. Positioned as an early-stage contender, it is emerging as a standout choice for investors seeking asymmetric growth opportunities in 2025. Final Word: A New Growth Leader May Be Emerging After Ethereum and AVAX, other narratives that are quick and fast-moving have taken over the limelight in the altcoin space. MAGACOIN FINANCE incorporates low supply, user-friendly, and memeable digital assets into its unique proposition. Investors may be gearing up for significant profits, as early signals and predictions suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE presents the best opportunity in the current cycle.

Analysts say the dramatic cuts have sparked debate about Tesla’s standing in Europe. Drivers can now lease a Tesla Model 3 for just £252 per month, down from £600–£700 last year. The larger Model Y has also seen steep reductions, with monthly costs dropping from about £700 to between £377 and £400. According to The Times, automakers offer leasing firms discounts of up to 40%, provided the cars are sold within three months. Those savings are being passed directly to motorists through lower payments. Tesla sales plunge 60% in UK Tesla’s practical problem of overcrowded stockyards and excess supply justifies the price reductions. The US carmaker is running out of space to park all the unsold cars in Britain. To keep cars moving, dealers and leasing firms have been pushed to swallow more stock, slashing full price discounts heavily. One of the most dramatic has been in the UK, where company sales have gone off a cliff. Revealed in fresh data published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the company only registered 987 new cars in July 2025. The year before, it sold 2,462 units. Thus, the year-on-year decrease is 60%. The broader car market has been pressured, too, though not quite as badly. Across the board, total UK registrations dipped by around 5% last month. Tesla’s fall does not simply reflect weaker consumer spending — it is about brand-specific issues causing the automaker to fall behind. Several factors, according to industry analysts, have contributed to the decline. After years of rapid growth, the EV maker is now seeing waning demand for its core models—the Model 3 and Model Y. With the market flooded by new crossovers and SUVs, many potential Tesla buyers are turning to alternatives that offer lower prices, longer range, or more modern designs. On the other hand, Tesla is also dealing with an increase in inventories. Vehicles reportedly are piling up in lots, driving the firm and its lessors to slash prices to make room on property. Leasing firms are being offered discounts as high as 40%, a move that some analysts caution may damage the brand’s premium status. It has also taken on the brewing European battle. Chinese competitor BYD has also announced a charge with its bargain-priced EVs like the Atto 3 and Seal, as German marques such as Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz continue to bolster their electric ranges. Tesla, meanwhile, is set to deliver its 200 mph models to Europe in 2022, priced to attract EV enthusiasts who have long anticipated the arrival of one of the world’s most influential charging network providers. UK EV market rises as Tesla loses ground to budget-friendly BYD models These struggles may have tarnished some of Tesla’s lustre, but the UK electric vehicle (EV) market is standing firm and girding its loins in preparation for exponential growth in Britain. As a result, it now expects the BEEV portion of new car registrations in 2025 to be 23.8%, slightly higher than its previous 23.5% forecast for the same year. However, even as the EV segment grows, Tesla is losing share against competitors. UK BYD Car Sales Surge For July meant BYD registered about 3,184 vehicles — more than three times the number that Tesla was thought to have registered in the same month. The increase in BYD also reflects a new landscape in buyer choices for more budget-friendly models. The company says that aggressive pricing on Atto 3 and Seal models gives cautious buyers alternatives to Tesla. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Recently, a striking event caught the attention of the market: a massive LINK accumulation by a few key players. Over just 24 hours, four distinct whale addresses made a substantial move, acquiring 580,995 LINK tokens, valued at an impressive $13.86 million. This strategic maneuver, first highlighted by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, raises important questions about market sentiment and future price trajectories for Chainlink. What is Behind This Crucial LINK Accumulation? When large holders, often referred to as “whales,” make such significant purchases, it often indicates strong conviction in an asset’s future performance. This particular LINK accumulation suggests that these four entities believe Chainlink (LINK) is currently undervalued or poised for an upward trend. They are effectively “buying the dip” or positioning themselves for anticipated growth. Their actions reflect a deep analysis of market conditions, project fundamentals, or perhaps even insider knowledge, although the latter is speculative. Such a concentrated buying spree can create positive sentiment, potentially encouraging other investors to consider increasing their Chainlink holdings. This is a classic example of confident crypto investment behavior. Who Are These Powerful Chainlink Whales? While the exact identities of these four addresses remain anonymous, their actions speak volumes. Chainlink whales are typically individuals or institutions holding vast amounts of Chainlink. Their trades, especially large ones, can significantly influence market prices due to their sheer volume. For Chainlink, these whales represent a substantial portion of the network’s liquidity and potentially its future direction. Their decision to engage in such a large-scale purchase underscores a belief in Chainlink’s long-term utility and its role as a decentralized oracle network vital for the broader Web3 ecosystem. Observing these Chainlink whales provides valuable insights into market conviction. Significant Capital: They possess the financial muscle to move markets. Market Influence: Their trades can trigger ripple effects, both positive and negative. Strategic Vision: Whales often have a longer-term investment horizon, looking beyond daily fluctuations. Impact on LINK Price: What Could Happen Next? The immediate effect of a large LINK accumulation can be an increase in demand, which, if sustained, can lead to a rise in the LINK price . When millions of dollars worth of tokens are bought from the open market, it reduces the available supply, pushing prices higher if buying pressure continues. However, it is crucial to remember that whale activity is just one factor among many influencing cryptocurrency prices. Other elements include: Overall market sentiment (Bitcoin’s performance, macroeconomic factors). Chainlink network developments and partnerships. Regulatory news. Broader crypto adoption trends. Investors often watch whale movements closely as an indicator of smart money flow, but it’s not a guarantee of future price action. Always conduct your own research regarding potential LINK price movements. Understanding Savvy Crypto Investment Strategies This event offers a glimpse into high-level crypto investment strategies. Whales often employ sophisticated techniques, including: Deep Fundamental Analysis: Thoroughly researching a project’s technology, team, and use case. Technical Analysis: Studying price charts and patterns to identify optimal entry and exit points. On-Chain Metrics: Utilizing data from the blockchain itself to gauge network health and activity. Such a significant acquisition is rarely impulsive. It is likely the result of careful planning and a strong conviction in Chainlink’s role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader blockchain landscape. This demonstrates a strategic approach to crypto investment . Navigating Valuable On-Chain Data for Insights The ability to track such large transactions comes from analyzing on-chain data . Public blockchains like Ethereum, where LINK tokens reside, record every transaction, making it transparent. Analysts like @ai_9684xtpa use specialized tools to sift through this vast amount of data, identify large transfers, and categorize addresses (e.g., as “whales” or exchange wallets). This transparency is a unique feature of the crypto market, providing insights into market participants’ behavior that are often opaque in traditional finance. Understanding how to interpret this on-chain data can offer a significant edge for investors looking to make informed decisions. In conclusion, the substantial LINK accumulation by four whale addresses in a single day is a noteworthy event that signals strong confidence in Chainlink’s future. While whale movements can influence market sentiment and potentially the LINK price , they are part of a larger, complex ecosystem. For investors, observing such strategic moves, combined with thorough research and understanding of on-chain data, can provide valuable perspectives on the evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Chainlink (LINK)? A1: Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts on the blockchain. It enables smart contracts to securely interact with off-chain data feeds, web APIs, and traditional bank payments. Q2: What does “LINK accumulation” mean? A2: “LINK accumulation” refers to the process where individuals or entities, especially large holders (whales), buy and hold a significant amount of LINK tokens, typically over a period, indicating a belief in its future value. Q3: Why do crypto whales accumulate large amounts of tokens? A3: Crypto whales accumulate large amounts of tokens because they often have strong conviction in a project’s long-term potential, anticipate future price increases, or aim to influence market liquidity and sentiment. They may also be strategically positioning themselves for specific market events. Q4: How does whale activity affect the LINK price? A4: Significant whale activity, such as a large LINK accumulation, can increase demand and reduce available supply, potentially leading to an upward movement in the LINK price. Conversely, large selling by whales can depress prices. However, whale actions are just one of many factors influencing market prices. Q5: What is on-chain data and why is it important? A5: On-chain data refers to all the information recorded on a public blockchain, including transactions, addresses, and smart contract interactions. It’s important because it offers transparency into market activity, allowing analysts to track large movements, identify trends, and gain insights into market participants’ behavior.

According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is now trading around $115,991.8 on platforms like Binance USDT. This sudden dip has certainly captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting many to question the immediate future of the BTC market . What factors are at play here, and what does this mean for your digital assets? What Triggered This Urgent Bitcoin Price Drop? The recent descent of Bitcoin’s value below $116,000 was swift, leaving many wondering about the underlying causes. While the exact catalysts for such rapid movements in the BTC market are often multifaceted, several factors typically contribute to significant shifts. Profit-Taking: After periods of upward movement, some investors might decide to secure their gains, leading to sell-offs.

This event underscores the inherent crypto price volatility that seasoned investors understand well. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the ever-changing landscape of digital currencies. Navigating the Current BTC Market: Your Essential Bitcoin Analysis When faced with a sudden Bitcoin price drop , it is natural to feel a degree of apprehension. However, panic selling rarely proves to be a wise strategy. Instead, a calm and informed approach, backed by solid Bitcoin analysis , can help you make better decisions. Consider these actionable insights: Review Your Investment Horizon: Are you a short-term trader or a long-term holder? Your strategy should align with your investment goals. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio can also mitigate risks during volatile periods.

The recent Bitcoin price drop serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the BTC market . While such movements can be unsettling, they are also a normal part of the cryptocurrency landscape. Staying informed, conducting your own diligent Bitcoin analysis , and adhering to a well-thought-out investment strategy are paramount.

In a recent event that sent ripples through the digital asset space, a staggering $126 million worth of cryptocurrency liquidations occurred within a single hour across major exchanges. This sudden downturn highlights the inherent risks associated with crypto futures and the power of market movements. What Exactly Are Cryptocurrency Liquidations? When we talk about cryptocurrency liquidations , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s initial margin is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Essentially, if a trader’s position moves against them significantly, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for both the trader and the platform. These events are a common, albeit often dramatic, part of the futures trading landscape. They are particularly pronounced in volatile markets like cryptocurrency, where prices can swing wildly in short periods. The Role of Leverage Trading and Market Volatility The primary catalyst for large-scale liquidations is often leverage trading . Traders use leverage to amplify their potential returns by borrowing funds to open larger positions than their capital would normally allow. While this can magnify profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of significant losses. When the market experiences sudden market volatility , as seen with the recent $126 million wipeout, positions with high leverage are the first to be affected. A small price movement in the wrong direction can quickly deplete a trader’s margin, triggering a liquidation. In the past 24 hours alone, an astonishing $348 million worth of futures were liquidated, underscoring this ongoing challenge. Who Is Affected by These Massive Liquidations? Massive cryptocurrency liquidations primarily impact individual traders who use high leverage. However, their effects can extend beyond the immediate participants. Large liquidation cascades can add selling pressure to the market, potentially accelerating price declines and contributing to broader market volatility . This creates a challenging environment where even those not directly engaged in leverage trading can feel the ripple effects through general market sentiment and price action. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. Navigating the Risks: Essential Risk Management Strategies Given the inherent risks of futures trading and the potential for rapid cryptocurrency liquidations , adopting robust risk management strategies is paramount. Here are some actionable insights for traders: Avoid Excessive Leverage: While tempting, high leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Consider using lower leverage ratios, especially if you are new to futures trading or during periods of high market uncertainty. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting potential losses and preventing liquidation. This is a fundamental tool for managing risk. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into a single leveraged position. Diversification can help mitigate the impact of adverse price movements in one asset. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, sentiment, and technical indicators. Being aware of potential catalysts for market volatility can help you make timely decisions. Understand Margin Requirements: Always know your exchange’s margin requirements and maintain sufficient funds to avoid unexpected liquidations. The recent wave of cryptocurrency liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the double-edged sword of leverage trading . While it offers the potential for significant gains, it also carries substantial risks. By understanding how crypto futures operate and implementing sound risk management practices, traders can navigate these turbulent waters more effectively and protect their capital. The crypto market will continue to experience periods of high market volatility . Therefore, a disciplined approach and a clear understanding of your risk tolerance are essential for long-term success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a cryptocurrency liquidation? A cryptocurrency liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. Q2: Why do cryptocurrency liquidations happen? Liquidations primarily happen due to high leverage trading combined with significant market volatility . When the market moves against a highly leveraged position, the trader’s collateral becomes insufficient, triggering the liquidation. Q3: How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining adequate margin, and practicing sound risk management strategies. Q4: Do liquidations affect the broader crypto market? Yes, large-scale liquidations can contribute to increased selling pressure and amplify price declines, thereby impacting overall market sentiment and contributing to further market volatility . Q5: What are crypto futures? Crypto futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. They often involve leverage, which can magnify both profits and losses. Did you find this article insightful?

The 2017 rally was much greater than the 2021 rally, which was suppressed by the Ripple lawsuit at the time. As such, the 2021 RSI pattern was much less pronounced, but it followed the same sequence nonetheless. The current setup, which is marked as Cycle 3 in the chart below, has already seen the pump and correction phases completed. What remains, according to the analyst, is the third stage. This is the push to an RSI blow-off top that could send the price of XRP into new territories. Egrag Crypto predicted three possible targets of 80, 87, and an ambitious 97 for XRP’s monthly RSI peak in the current cycle. These numbers are derived from the RSI trajectory observed in the last two cycles and projected onto today’s XRP RSI conditions. Image From X: Egrag Crypto What Does This Mean For XRP’s Price? If XRP’s monthly RSI reaches levels such as 80, 87, or even 97, it would be one of the strongest overbought signals in the asset’s history. The last time XRP’s monthly RSI crossed above 90 was during the 2017 bull run, which saw XRP’s price explode from less than $0.1 to its then all-time high of $3.40.

For XRP, such elevated RSI readings would likely coincide with new all-time highs that mirror those seen in the 2017 bull run. Realistically, this could see the XRP price break above its newly established all-time high of $3.65 and into $4, $5, and beyond into double digits. XRP RSI reaching above 90 could also serve as a warning that the price may already be at a new multi-year top. At the time of writing, the monthly XRP RSI was at a 73 reading. XRP was trading at $3.12.

Recently, a solo Bitcoin miner defied the odds, successfully mining a full Bitcoin block and securing a substantial reward. This incredible feat occurred on August 17th, when the anonymous solo Bitcoin miner confirmed block 910,440 at approximately 10:19 UTC. This monumental effort yielded a remarkable 3.1 BTC, valued at an astounding $370,000 at the time. Data from blockchain explorer Mempool verified this rare event, sparking discussions across the crypto community and showcasing the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency mining . What Does it Take to Be a Solo Bitcoin Miner? Mining Bitcoin, especially as a solo endeavor, requires significant computational power and an immense amount of luck. Miners compete globally to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to find the solution gets to add a new block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and earns the associated block reward . For an individual to achieve this without the collective power of a large mining pool is exceptionally rare, akin to winning a major lottery. High Hash Rate: A solo miner needs a substantial amount of hashing power, which is the speed at which a mining machine operates, to even have a slim chance against the global competition. Specialized Hardware: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners are essential for efficient Bitcoin mining . These machines are purpose-built for this highly specialized task. Luck Factor: Even with powerful hardware, the probability of a single miner discovering a block before thousands of others in pools is astronomically low. This success story serves as a powerful reminder that while immensely difficult, individual triumph in cryptocurrency mining is still theoretically possible within the decentralized network. Understanding the Block Reward and Bitcoin Halving The current Bitcoin block reward is 3.125 BTC, following the halving event in April 2024. This solo miner’s payout reflects this new, reduced reward. Previously, the reward was 6.25 BTC. The halving mechanism is a programmed event that cuts the reward approximately every four years. This process is designed to control Bitcoin’s supply and ensure its scarcity, making each block reward even more valuable over time. How rare is this achievement? Consider that the global Bitcoin network’s total hash rate is immense. A solo Bitcoin miner typically contributes a minuscule fraction of this power. Their success highlights the truly decentralized nature of Bitcoin, where even small participants have a theoretical chance, however slim. It’s a testament to the network’s robust design that such an event can occur, reinforcing the system’s integrity. Is Solo Bitcoin Mining a Viable Path for Everyone? While inspiring, attempting solo Bitcoin mining is generally not recommended for the average enthusiast due to the overwhelming odds and significant costs involved. The barriers to entry are substantial for individuals looking to compete against well-funded operations. High Equipment Costs: Purchasing powerful ASIC miners can run into thousands of dollars, representing a significant upfront investment. Electricity Consumption: These machines consume vast amounts of electricity, leading to very high operational costs that can quickly outweigh potential earnings. Low Probability of Success: Without joining a mining pool, the chances of earning a block reward are exceedingly low for most individuals, making it an economically unfeasible venture for many. Most miners opt to join mining pools, which combine their hash rate to increase their collective chance of solving a block. The pool then distributes the digital currency reward proportionally to each participant’s contribution, offering a more consistent, albeit smaller, income stream. The Impact and Future Outlook for Digital Currency Mining This particular solo Bitcoin miner ‘s success story has resonated widely, bringing attention to the unique and often challenging aspects of cryptocurrency mining . It underscores the allure of a potentially life-changing payout, even as the barriers to entry for solo mining remain incredibly high. For the broader digital currency ecosystem, such events reinforce the network’s resilience and its commitment to a decentralized structure, where anyone with the right equipment and immense luck can contribute and be rewarded. The future of Bitcoin mining continues to evolve. As the network’s hash rate grows and halvings further reduce the block reward, efficiency and scale become increasingly important. However, the dream of a solo miner striking it rich persists, fueled by remarkable stories like this one. It’s a powerful narrative in the ongoing journey of decentralized finance and the enduring appeal of the digital currency landscape. Summary: A Rare Triumph in Bitcoin Mining The recent success of a solo Bitcoin miner securing a 3.1 BTC block reward is a truly remarkable event. It highlights the incredible potential, albeit rare, for individual achievement within the vast and competitive world of cryptocurrency mining . While the odds remain stacked against solo miners, this story serves as a compelling reminder of Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and the enduring possibility of striking gold in the digital currency realm. It’s a testament to luck, persistence, and the raw power of the Bitcoin network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a solo Bitcoin miner? A solo Bitcoin miner is an individual or entity that attempts to mine Bitcoin blocks independently, without joining a mining pool. They compete directly against the entire global network. 2. How much was the block reward this solo miner received? The solo miner received 3.1 BTC, which was valued at approximately $370,000 at the time of the discovery. 3. Why is solo Bitcoin mining so rare? Solo Bitcoin mining is rare because the network’s total hashing power is immense. An individual miner’s contribution is typically a tiny fraction of the global hash rate, making the probability of solving a block independently extremely low. 4. What is a Bitcoin halving? A Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that occurs approximately every four years, cutting the reward for mining new blocks by half. This mechanism controls the supply of new Bitcoin entering circulation. 5. Should I try solo Bitcoin mining? For most individuals, solo Bitcoin mining is not recommended due to the high costs of specialized hardware, significant electricity consumption, and the extremely low probability of earning a block reward. Joining a mining pool is generally a more practical approach for those interested in cryptocurrency mining. Did this incredible solo mining story inspire you?

However, the broader altcoin market has struggled to sustain momentum due to Bitcoin’s choppy price action, pressured by ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. Even so, fresh market data indicate traders are gradually shifting their focus away from Bitcoin and toward alternative cryptocurrencies, raising expectations that altcoins could drive the next leg of the crypto bull market. Crypto Sentiment Shifts: Altcoins Lead In Liquidations, Overtake BTC An altseason is defined as a period in the crypto bull run where altcoins generally outperform Bitcoin. It is typically marked by a decline in BTC Dominance as investors rotate capital from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies that promise higher profit returns during this period. Over the last two months, signals of an impending altcoin dominance for the current bull market continue to pile up. In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, CEO & Founder of Alphractal, Joas Wedson, reports another omen in that altcoin liquidations are now higher than those of Bitcoin . From January to December 2024, the majority of cumulative liquidations on Binance came from Bitcoin positions, significantly outpacing those of all other cryptocurrencies. This trend painted a clear picture, i.e., Bitcoin was the primary focus for leveraged traders. However, since the start of 2025, the tides have turned. The BTC vs. Altcoin Cumulative Liquidation Delta, a key metric tracking the liquidation disparity between Bitcoin and altcoins, has been falling steadily throughout 2025. This decline indicates that altcoin liquidations are catching up and now surpassing those of BTC. In the second half of 2025, this shift has become more pronounced, suggesting that traders are now more active and more vulnerable in altcoin markets than ever before. Wedson explains the bullish implications of this development for an altseason, stating that traders are now increasing speculations on altcoins more than Bitcoin. This suggests a significant change in market behavior as Ethereum , XRP, and other alternative cryptocurrencies are increasingly being viewed as higher-risk, higher-reward vehicles, even as Bitcoin remains the dominant store of value in the crypto space. Crypto Market Overview: Altseason Remains On Hold At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is now valued at $3.93 trillion following a 0.22% gain in the past day. Altcoins currently account for 40.4% of this value with a collective market cap of $1.59 trillion. Meanwhile, the CoinMarketCap’s Altseason Index currently reads 46, suggesting that while altcoins are gaining ground, market conditions have yet to fully align with a classic “altseason” scenario.",Altcoins|altcoins|altseason|bitcoin|Bitcoin dominance|CryptoQuant|Joao Wedson,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-18 03:00:17
50262660,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78978,1755486019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Top Altcoins to Buy in 2025: XRP, ADA, HBAR & MAGACOIN FINANCE Highlighted for Massive Gains",https://timestabloid.com/top-altcoins-to-buy-in-2025-xrp-ada-hbar-magacoin/,"The 2025 bull cycle is shaping up to be one of the most pivotal years for altcoin investors. Analysts are pointing to a handful of projects that combine strong fundamentals with market-ready narratives. XRP, ADA, HBAR, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as the top altcoins to buy in 2025, each offering different levels of growth, risk, and upside. Among these, experts increasingly tip MAGACOIN FINANCE as the most undervalued presale investment, with the potential for outsized returns compared to its more established peers. XRP (Ripple): A Payment Giant with Fresh Momentum Ripple’s XRP remains a cornerstone of the altcoin market, particularly for institutional investors seeking exposure to blockchain-powered payments. Despite regulatory turbulence in recent years, experts note that XRP’s fundamentals are strengthening as the long-disputed SEC lawsuit is now in the past. Outside of this, Ripple’s focus on cross-border settlements and banking partnerships continues to set it apart and provides a formidable backdrop for XRP growth. So, if the current rate of global adoption accelerates, XRP could remain one of the most resilient altcoins for long-term investors. Market analysts forecast that XRP could trade between $2.32 and $5.53 by the end of 2025, with bullish scenarios pushing even higher if adoption scales. ADA (Cardano): Steady Growth Through Real-World Utility Cardano has built its reputation on methodical development and an academic approach to blockchain innovation that distinguishes it from rivals. While some traders criticize ADA’s slower pace compared to these rivals, analysts stress that 2025 could reward its steady, fundamentals-driven strategy that introduced a slew of updates to the network. Experts also point to Cardano’s push into real-world financial applications, particularly in emerging markets, as a sign that its long-term potential extends beyond speculative hype. So, ADA price predictions place it between $0.721 and $1.26 throughout the year, with an average hovering close to $0.96–$1.36. Though the projections are less explosive than meme-driven coins, ADA’s value lies in network upgrades, developer growth, and expanding DeFi ecosystems on its chain. Essentially, ADA remains a solid option for investors seeking stability alongside meaningful upside. HBAR (Hedera Hashgraph): Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Adoption Hedera Hashgraph is carving out a unique niche in the blockchain sector by targeting enterprise-level adoption, something that its rivals are paying little-to-no attention to. Unlike many altcoins driven purely by speculation, HBAR is backed by partnerships with major corporations and a governance model that emphasizes the asset’s transparency and security. Industry experts have forecasted that HBAR’s price could range from $0.28–$0.36 on average, with the possibility of climbing toward $0.54 if the level of enterprise adoption accelerates. Moreover, market analysts also cite Hedera’s consensus technology, enterprise-grade security, and real-world applications as its key differentiators. With major companies already experimenting with Hedera for supply chain, tokenization, and data solutions, HBAR is well positioned to benefit if blockchain adoption continues to expand in corporate and government sectors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Undervalued Crypto Presale Turning Heads MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention because of its explosive growth potential, which could be mindblowing for even the most storied investor. Due to this, analysts are tipping it as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025, thanks to whale accumulation, presale momentum, and its combination of meme energy with DeFi utility. Industry experts have forecasted that MAGACOIN FINANCE could generate a 30x return (3,000%) or even an aggressive scenario of 100x–375,000% from presale pricing, with some models projecting it could reach $1 by the end of 2025. Moreover, what sets MAGACOIN apart is its audit-backed legitimacy, verified by Hashex, and its community-first structure with no VC allocations. Already, whale wallets from Solana, SHIB, and Dogecoin have begun rotating capital into the project, signaling strong confidence. Notably, The presale itself has been boosted by a limited-time 50% bonus, accelerating adoption and drawing thousands of new holders. Moreover, market analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to the early breakout days of DOGE and SHIB which gave substantial returns for early buyers. However, they note that MAGACOIN has a stronger foundation due to its real DeFi utility, robust audits, and the potential to sustain growth across multiple market cycles. That combination has led many experts to declare it the most undervalued presale investment of 2025. Final Takeaway XRP, ADA, and HBAR are excellent picks for investors seeking proven, established projects with clear adoption paths. But for those willing to embrace higher risk for the chance of higher reward, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top altcoin to buy right now.

Many tokens still rely on promises, yet some projects are already proving their worth. Ethereum’s growth depends on institutional demand, and Tron highlights strong network performance, but Cold Wallet provides something more immediate. Its platform is active, users are already receiving USDT payouts, and the $CWT token creates a sustainable reward cycle. Instead of speculation, it delivers tangible results today. For investors evaluating the best crypto right now, Cold Wallet demonstrates that practical utility can outshine untested expectations. Cold Wallet Presale: A Practical Entry Into Self-Custodial Finance The Cold Wallet presale is not just another fundraising event, it represents an actual entry point into a working, user-first ecosystem centered on ownership, rewards, and real-world utility. Having already surpassed $6 million in contributions, the project separates itself from speculative launches that exist only on whitepapers. Cold Wallet is live today, with users already receiving USDT payouts through swaps and referrals, and the $CWT token at the core of its operation. Joining the presale offers far more than discounted tokens. Holders unlock cashback benefits on gas fees, swaps, and on/off-ramp transactions, with premium tiers providing up to 100% cashback. There are no complex staking requirements or lockups, simply holding CWT activates rewards automatically. In addition, investors gain influence through governance rights, DAO voting, and priority access to upcoming features, allowing them to shape the platform’s future. At the current stage 17 price of $0.00998, CWT stands positioned for significant appreciation, with a confirmed launch price of $0.3517. Across its 150 presale stages, prices continue to rise incrementally, making earlier entry far more cost-efficient. Unlike many presales, however, this one is tied to an active product already delivering value. For those seeking the best crypto right now, Cold Wallet provides a rare combination of presale accessibility and functional utility. Buying CWT is not simply a speculative move; it’s participation in a self-custodial financial framework that prioritizes rewarding its community from the very start. Tron Price Performance Mirrors Expanding Utility Tron’s growth is anchored in measurable network activity, making TRX price movement more than a speculative trend. Long-term holders have seen returns exceeding 150%, with the token trading near $0.135, one of its strongest levels in years. This rise directly corresponds to Tron’s proven utility, supported by over 11 billion transactions and billions in USDT settlements processed through its blockchain. What makes this momentum different is that it stems from consistent function rather than hype. Tron powers stablecoin transfers at scale, records millions of transactions daily, and maintains high on-chain engagement, all contributing to organic demand for TRX. This steady flow of activity keeps the token relevant and ensures its velocity remains strong. For those considering the best crypto right now, Tron demonstrates how a token can sustain value through genuine adoption. Its performance highlights a model where utility translates into consistent upward pressure. Ethereum Price Outlook Driven by Utility and Institutional Confidence Ethereum’s momentum continues to gain strength through real adoption and rising institutional involvement. Analysts place the Ethereum price prediction in the $10,000 to $15,000 range, supported by its unmatched presence in tokenization and on-chain activity. Currently, more than 55% of all real-world asset tokenization is built on Ethereum, making its infrastructure a leading choice for decentralized finance and digital asset management. Institutional behavior is also shaping ETH’s future. Notable acquisitions, including a purchase exceeding 1.2 million ETH, are removing supply from circulation while signaling long-term conviction in the network’s value. Unlike tokens that move on speculation, Ethereum’s demand stems from established functions, smart contracts, asset tokenization, and value storage. For investors seeking the best crypto right now, Ethereum provides a blend of utility and credibility. Its proven ecosystem, combined with institutional trust, positions it as a core driver of the next stage of blockchain adoption. Cold Wallet Proves Value Through Action, Not Promises When comparing projects, the difference often lies between potential and delivery. Ethereum highlights long-term growth through institutional adoption, and Tron demonstrates steady demand through daily transactions. Cold Wallet, however, separates itself by offering a live system where users already earn USDT rewards. Its presale extends beyond discounted tokens, it provides direct entry into self-custodial finance powered by the $CWT token. For investors searching for the best crypto right now, Cold Wallet shows why action matters more than speculation. It rewards usage today, proving its value ahead of others still building toward their promises.

Early demand usually mirrors future market reception, making it a strong signal for those who want the best crypto for beginners. Recognising this pattern early can help buyers secure a position before prices climb further. BlockDAG is giving off that exact signal. With more than $375 million raised, batch 29 priced at $0.0276, and a return of 2,660% since batch 1, the BlockDAG’s momentum suggests a powerful showing when the mainnet launches. Presale Demand as a Predictor of Market Strength The crypto market has shown many times that strong presales foreshadow success. They reveal investor confidence, community interest, and belief in the project’s value. For beginners searching for the best crypto, this helps cut through the noise by showing where early capital is flowing before public trading starts. BlockDAG stands out with over 25.2 billion coins sold, a figure that reflects accelerating demand. This kind of traction doesn’t happen by luck. It shows careful planning, working fundamentals, and clear faith in the roadmap. Lessons from Past Presale Success Stories Examples are easy to find. Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano all built strong momentum in their presales before posting big gains post-launch. Early buyers who read the signals made huge returns. The link is clear: a strong presale boosts liquidity, speeds up development, and builds hype before the listing. For those considering the best crypto for beginners, these examples highlight that presale results are not just noise. They reflect market psychology and adoption. BlockDAG, with over $375 million raised, is now among the most successful presales in years, putting it in league with projects that later became leaders. Why BlockDAG’s Stats Are Crucial for Mainnet Launch Presales do more than raise money; they offer insight into what might follow. BlockDAG’s figures tell a strong story: batch 29 coins are $0.0276, a 2,660% ROI from batch 1, and over 25.2 billion coins already sold. These results point to built-up demand that could spill into the mainnet. For anyone seeking the best crypto for beginners, this creates a clear setup. Strong presale adoption usually leads to heavy trading volume and fast price growth once listed, and BlockDAG’s path seems to be following that trend. Last Say A presale’s success is more than just fundraising—it predicts how a project could perform at launch. Looking at history, early demand often aligns with strong post-launch activity. For beginners exploring options, tracking this signal can improve decision-making. BlockDAG’s record-setting presale, steep ROI growth, and billions of coins sold suggest it is on track for a strong mainnet debut.

One such event, the crypto perpetual futures liquidation , plays a crucial role in shaping market movements, especially for leveraged traders. Over the last 24 hours, we witnessed substantial liquidations across major digital assets. This breakdown helps us understand the underlying dynamics and what these figures truly mean for participants in the volatile world of crypto. What is Perpetual Futures Liquidation and Why Does It Matter? In essence, perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because their margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. It’s a critical risk management tool for exchanges, preventing traders from incurring negative balances and ensuring market stability. For traders, however, it represents a significant loss of capital. When the market moves sharply against a highly leveraged position, these liquidations can cascade. This creates further selling pressure, potentially accelerating price declines. Understanding these events is vital for anyone engaging with derivatives in the crypto space. Ethereum Liquidation: A Deep Dive into Long Positions Ethereum (ETH) experienced the largest share of recent liquidations. Over the past 24 hours, ETH saw a staggering $140.45 million in liquidations . A significant portion of these were long positions, accounting for 61.23%. What does this mean? Traders who bet on ETH’s price increasing, often using high leverage, faced forced closures as the price moved unfavorably. This suggests a notable downward price action or consolidation that caught many bullish traders off guard. Such a substantial Ethereum liquidation figure highlights the inherent risks of leveraged trading, even for a major asset like ETH. Bitcoin Liquidation: The King’s Exposure to Volatility Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, was not immune to the market’s recent movements. We observed $77.18 million in Bitcoin liquidation over the same 24-hour period. Strikingly, an overwhelming 89.55% of these were long positions. This high percentage indicates that the vast majority of liquidated BTC traders were expecting price appreciation. When Bitcoin experiences a sudden dip or fails to sustain an upward trend, these long positions become vulnerable. The sheer volume of long liquidations in BTC underscores how quickly market sentiment can shift and impact even the most established digital assets. Beyond BTC and ETH: Solana and Broader Crypto Liquidations While Ethereum and Bitcoin dominated the liquidation figures, other altcoins also felt the pressure. Solana (SOL), for instance, recorded $18.37 million in liquidations , with long positions making up 70.54%. These figures across multiple assets paint a clear picture: the market experienced a period where upward momentum failed to materialize or reversed sharply. This led to widespread crypto liquidations , primarily affecting those with bullish bets. It serves as a potent reminder of the importance of robust risk management and avoiding excessive leverage in such a volatile environment. Navigating Future Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Events For traders, these liquidation events offer crucial lessons. Firstly, leverage is a double-edged sword; it amplifies gains but also losses. Secondly, market sentiment can turn quickly, making stop-loss orders an indispensable tool. Finally, understanding the broader market trends and not relying solely on short-term price movements can help mitigate risks associated with perpetual futures liquidation . The recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation figures for ETH, BTC, and SOL provides a stark look into the risks of leveraged trading. While these events can be painful for individual traders, they are a natural, albeit dramatic, part of the derivatives market. They serve to rebalance the market and underscore the need for disciplined trading strategies. Always remember that knowledge and caution are your best allies in the thrilling world of cryptocurrency trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a crypto perpetual futures liquidation? It’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance drops below a required level, typically due to adverse price movements. Why did long positions dominate the recent liquidations? Long positions were primarily liquidated because the market experienced a downward price movement or failed to sustain an uptrend, catching traders who were betting on price increases off guard. How can traders avoid being liquidated in perpetual futures? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting effective stop-loss orders, monitoring their margin levels closely, and having a clear risk management strategy. Do perpetual futures liquidations impact spot market prices? Yes, significant liquidations can create cascading selling pressure, which can lead to further price declines in both the futures and spot markets as positions are closed. What is the difference between perpetual futures and traditional futures? Perpetual futures do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they meet margin requirements, unlike traditional futures which have a set settlement date.

A significant player, Metaplanet, a publicly traded Japanese company , recently made headlines with its substantial Bitcoin investment . This bold move signals a growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , particularly within Asia’s financial landscape. The company officially announced on X that it has significantly increased its BTC holdings , reinforcing its commitment to a Bitcoin-first treasury strategy. This development is not just a minor update; it’s a clear indicator of evolving financial paradigms and a testament to Bitcoin’s rising prominence. What’s Fueling Metaplanet’s Strategic Bitcoin Investment? Metaplanet has consistently built its Bitcoin reserves, effectively positioning itself as a leading advocate for digital assets in the corporate sector. Their latest acquisition adds another 775 BTC to their impressive portfolio. Consequently, this brings their total Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings to an astounding 18,888 BTC. This figure positions them as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally, excluding those based in the United States. Such a substantial accumulation underscores a deliberate strategic shift towards embracing sound money principles. The company’s proactive decision to embrace Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset stems from several key factors: Inflation Hedging: Bitcoin frequently acts as a robust hedge against currency devaluation, offering a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Long-Term Value Proposition: Many forward-thinking corporations now view Bitcoin as a premier long-term store of value, anticipating significant future appreciation. Transparency and Security: The inherently transparent and secure nature of the Bitcoin blockchain appeals immensely to progressive companies seeking reliable asset management. Moreover, this aggressive accumulation strategy by a prominent Japanese company Bitcoin proponent like Metaplanet emphatically highlights a profound belief in Bitcoin’s future potential. It also provides a compelling, actionable example for other corporations actively considering similar strategic moves. How Does This Acquisition Impact Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Globally? Metaplanet’s consistent and public announcements regarding its escalating BTC holdings establish a significant precedent. Their transparent actions demonstrate a viable, proven path for other publicly traded companies to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets. This level of transparency, furthermore, actively builds confidence within the broader cryptocurrency market. We are increasingly observing a discernible ripple effect across the global financial landscape: Increased institutional interest and due diligence in Bitcoin and other emerging digital assets. Greater scrutiny and re-evaluation of conventional treasury management practices. A potential, transformative shift in how corporations perceive, manage, and optimize their capital. Furthermore, this bold move by a leading Japanese company Bitcoin investor could actively encourage much-needed regulatory clarity within the region. As more established entities confidently adopt Bitcoin, governments may feel compelled to provide clearer, more supportive guidelines, thereby fostering a more stable and predictable environment for digital asset growth and innovation. What Are the Key Challenges and Opportunities for Substantial BTC Holdings? While the opportunities presented by substantial Bitcoin investment are vast, certain challenges undeniably exist for companies engaging in such significant allocations. Price volatility, for instance, remains a primary concern for many. However, companies like Metaplanet appear to be adopting a robust long-term view, which effectively mitigates the impact of short-term market fluctuations. Conversely, the opportunities are compelling: Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin offers a truly non-correlated asset class, providing invaluable diversification benefits to traditional investment portfolios. Innovation and Brand Perception: Companies confidently embracing Bitcoin are often perceived as innovative and forward-thinking, which can attract new talent, investors, and a modern customer base. Global Reach and Accessibility: Bitcoin’s inherently global and permissionless nature facilitates seamless international transactions and broader market access. It is, therefore, absolutely crucial for any company considering similar levels of corporate Bitcoin adoption to conduct thorough due diligence. This vital process includes a comprehensive understanding of the evolving regulatory landscape, potential tax implications, and the robust operational security measures required to manage substantial Metaplanet Bitcoin -like reserves effectively and securely. The Future of Bitcoin Investment: Ushering in a New Era? Metaplanet’s latest acquisition powerfully reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is rapidly maturing as a legitimate institutional asset. The sheer scale of their BTC holdings , now standing at an impressive 18,888 BTC, firmly positions them as a significant, influential player in the global digital asset space. This unwavering, ongoing commitment from a prominent Japanese company Bitcoin proponent strongly suggests a broader, accelerating acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate, powerful financial instruments. This escalating trend could foreseeably lead to several transformative outcomes: A growing number of companies strategically allocating a portion of their corporate treasury to Bitcoin. Increased development and availability of institutional-grade Bitcoin products and specialized services. A gradual, yet profound, shift in global financial infrastructure towards embracing digital assets as foundational components. Ultimately, Metaplanet’s actions are not merely about acquiring Bitcoin; they are fundamentally about embracing and championing a new financial paradigm. Their consistent, visionary approach to corporate Bitcoin adoption serves as a powerful testament to the digital asset’s enduring appeal, inherent resilience, and immense future potential. It’s an exceptionally exciting time to observe how this trend unfolds, as more companies potentially follow in Metaplanet’s pioneering footsteps, shaping the future of finance. In conclusion, Metaplanet’s continuous and strategic accumulation of Bitcoin unmistakably underscores a significant shift in corporate treasury management. Their impressive 18,888 BTC holdings highlight a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a robust long-term asset and a crucial hedge against economic uncertainties. This bold move by a leading Japanese company sets a powerful precedent for global corporate Bitcoin adoption, paving the way for a more digitally integrated and resilient financial future.

Recently, Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a massive movement of 300,000,000 USDT from an unidentified wallet directly to the OKX exchange . This single transaction, valued at approximately $300 million, represents a truly large crypto transaction and immediately caught the attention of traders and analysts alike. When a crypto whale makes such a significant move, it often signals potential shifts in the market, prompting everyone to watch closely for its market impact . What Does a Large Crypto Transaction Mean for the Market? A transaction of this magnitude is not an everyday occurrence in the digital asset space. When a substantial amount of stablecoin like USDT moves to an exchange, it typically indicates one of several things. Understanding these possibilities is crucial for anticipating future market dynamics. Potential Selling Pressure: The most common interpretation is that the funds are being prepared for sale. This could introduce selling pressure if the whale decides to convert USDT into other cryptocurrencies or fiat. Accumulation for Trading: Conversely, the whale might be positioning funds to buy into dips or execute large trades on the OKX exchange . This could potentially lead to increased liquidity or even upward price pressure for certain assets. Internal Transfers: It could also be an internal transfer between different wallets owned by the same entity, or part of an OTC (Over-The-Counter) deal. Such transfers usually have less direct immediate market impact . Who is Behind This Mysterious USDT Transfer ? The term “unknown wallet” sparks significant intrigue within the crypto community. In the often-opaque world of blockchain, these large, unidentified holders are commonly referred to as crypto whales . Their movements are closely monitored because their actions can significantly influence market sentiment and price action across various assets. While the identity remains hidden, speculation abounds regarding the entity behind this particular movement. It could be: An institutional investor rebalancing their portfolios. A high-net-worth individual preparing for a major trade. A major market maker adjusting their liquidity provisions. The exact purpose of this large crypto transaction remains a mystery, adding to the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency space. Analyzing the Potential Market Impact on OKX Exchange and Beyond The arrival of 300 million USDT on a major platform like OKX could have several implications. OKX is one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its extensive trading pairs and derivatives offerings. A sudden influx of such a large sum of stablecoins could: Increase Liquidity: More USDT on the exchange means more liquidity. This potentially facilitates larger trades without significant price slippage. Signal Volatility: Whales often move funds in anticipation of market volatility. They aim to capitalize on potential price swings. This specific USDT transfer might be a precursor to increased trading activity. Influence Trading Strategies: Other traders observe these significant movements. A crypto whale ‘s actions can trigger a chain reaction, as others try to front-run or follow their perceived strategy. The immediate effects are not always clear, but the potential for a ripple effect across the broader crypto market is undeniable. It underscores how closely linked these large movements are to overall market health. This substantial large crypto transaction serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the digital asset space. While the precise intentions behind this USDT transfer to OKX exchange are still unknown, the cryptocurrency community remains vigilant. Monitoring such significant movements provides valuable insights into potential market trends and the powerful influence of crypto whales . It underscores the importance of staying informed in this rapidly evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “crypto whale”? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to significantly influence its price if they choose to buy or sell. Q2: Why are large USDT transfers significant? Large USDT transfers are significant because USDT is a stablecoin often used to enter or exit positions in other cryptocurrencies. A large transfer to an exchange can signal an intent to buy or sell, potentially impacting market prices. Q3: Does this transaction guarantee a price drop? No, a large USDT transfer does not guarantee a price drop. While it could indicate an intent to sell, it might also be for buying other assets, internal transfers, or OTC deals that have less direct market impact. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions myself? Services like Whale Alert (mentioned in the article) and various blockchain explorers allow you to track large crypto transactions in real-time, providing transparency on significant movements. Q5: What is OKX exchange?

A significant update for Injective (INJ) holders has emerged from South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb, which recently announced a temporary suspension of INJ deposits and INJ withdrawals. This measure supports an upcoming network upgrade for the Injective blockchain, aiming to enhance its performance and security. Understanding the Injective (INJ) Suspension on Bithumb Bithumb, a prominent crypto exchange, made this announcement via its official website, detailing the specific timeline for the service interruption. Starting at 09:00 UTC on August 19 , users will temporarily be unable to move their Injective (INJ) tokens onto or off the platform. This suspension is not an isolated event but a common practice within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Exchanges often halt deposit and withdrawal services for specific tokens when their underlying blockchain networks undergo significant upgrades or maintenance. This proactive approach helps prevent potential issues like transaction loss or data inconsistencies that could arise during the upgrade process. What Does This Mean for Your INJ Deposits and INJ Withdrawals? For individuals holding Injective (INJ) on Bithumb, or those planning to interact with their INJ assets around the specified date, understanding the implications is crucial. The temporary halt directly impacts the ability to transfer tokens. Key aspects to note: Suspension Start: INJ deposits and withdrawals will cease at 09:00 UTC on August 19. Purpose: The suspension directly supports the Injective network’s upcoming upgrade. Trading: Typically, trading of the Injective (INJ) token on the exchange continues unaffected during such suspensions, though it’s always wise to verify Bithumb’s specific policy. Duration: The announcement specifies a temporary suspension, implying services will resume once the network upgrade is successfully completed and verified by the exchange. Users should plan any necessary transactions involving INJ deposits or INJ withdrawals well in advance of the announced time to avoid inconvenience. Why Do Crypto Exchanges Suspend INJ Transactions for Upgrades? You might wonder why a crypto exchange needs to suspend services for a network upgrade. The primary reason revolves around ensuring the integrity and security of user funds and the smooth operation of the exchange’s systems. Benefits of such suspensions include: Data Consistency: It prevents discrepancies that could arise from transactions occurring on an older version of the network while the new one is being implemented. Security: It mitigates risks of exploits or vulnerabilities that might appear during the transition phase of an upgrade. Seamless Transition: Exchanges can perform necessary backend adjustments, such as updating their wallet infrastructure to be compatible with the new network version, without live transactions interfering. While temporary inconvenience is a challenge, the long-term benefits of a more robust and efficient Injective network outweigh this short-term measure. These upgrades often bring enhancements in scalability, transaction speed, and new features to the Injective (INJ) ecosystem. Actionable Steps for Injective (INJ) Holders If you hold Injective (INJ) on Bithumb, or regularly use the platform for INJ transactions, here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw INJ, do so before 09:00 UTC on August 19. Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official announcements page or their social media channels for updates regarding the resumption of services. Understand the Upgrade: Learn about the specific enhancements the Injective network upgrade brings. This knowledge can help you understand the long-term value of your holdings. Alternative Platforms (Caution Advised): If urgent transfers are needed, consider if another exchange supports INJ and allows transfers during this period, but always proceed with extreme caution and verify legitimacy. This temporary pause for INJ deposits and INJ withdrawals is a testament to the dynamic nature of blockchain technology. Network upgrades are vital for progress, ensuring the underlying infrastructure remains cutting-edge and secure. In conclusion, Bithumb’s suspension of Injective (INJ) deposits and withdrawals is a standard, necessary procedure to support the Injective network’s upcoming upgrade. This proactive measure ensures the safety and integrity of your assets while paving the way for a more robust and efficient blockchain.

In a post on X, the analyst wrote, “After XRP breaks out of this cup, price will go straight to $7.20. Save this!” The comment reflects his interpretation of the current market structure for XRP , where he identifies a cup pattern on the daily timeframe as the foundation for this target. His view is that once the resistance at the rim of the formation is overcome, XRP’s price should advance directly to $7.20. After #XRP breaks out of this cup price will go straight to $7.20. Save this! pic.twitter.com/utbYmInIhe — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 16, 2025 Chart Pattern and Measurement The chart shared with the post is an XRP/USD daily chart with the formation of a rounded cup highlighted in green shading. The structure shows a gradual decline and recovery, with the rim drawn across the upper boundary. A label placed at the midpoint of the formation notes “111%,” suggesting that the depth of the cup equates to a percentage increase that forms the basis for the projected upside target. A vertical arrow is drawn above the rim, extending upward with the label “111% = $7.20.” This presentation makes clear that the measured move from the bottom of the cup to the rim is being applied again from the breakout level, producing the $7.20 target. The image is titled “XRP/USD 1-DAY,” confirming that the analysis is based on daily candlesticks.

This sudden wipeout sent ripples through the crypto futures market , highlighting the inherent risks of leveraged trading. Over the past 24 hours, the total figure swelled to an astonishing $469 million in liquidated positions. But what exactly does this mean for traders and the broader market? Understanding Crypto Futures Liquidations When we talk about crypto futures liquidations , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin, or collateral, has fallen below the required level to maintain the position. In simpler terms, if the market moves significantly against a highly leveraged trade, the exchange automatically closes it to prevent further losses for the trader and the platform. Leverage Trading Explained: Leverage trading allows traders to open positions much larger than their actual capital. For example, with 10x leverage, $100 can control $1,000 worth of crypto. Margin Calls: If the market moves unfavorably, the value of the leveraged position drops, and the margin held by the exchange might become insufficient. This triggers a margin call, and if not met, leads to liquidation. Why it Matters: Liquidations can amplify market moves, creating a cascade effect as more positions are closed. Why Such Sudden Crypto Market Volatility? The recent surge in liquidations points directly to significant crypto market volatility . Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously unpredictable, often experiencing rapid price swings due to various factors. These can include macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, large institutional trades, or even social media sentiment. When prices move sharply, especially downwards, traders using high leverage are the first to be affected. A sudden price dip can trigger a chain reaction: Initial price drop pushes some leveraged positions towards liquidation. These liquidations involve the exchange selling off assets, which adds selling pressure to the market. Increased selling pressure causes prices to drop further, leading to more liquidations. This cascading effect can accelerate a market downturn, turning a modest dip into a more significant price correction. Navigating Futures Trading Risks The substantial liquidations serve as a stark reminder of the significant futures trading risks involved, particularly in the highly dynamic derivative markets of crypto. While futures trading offers opportunities for substantial gains, it equally presents the potential for rapid and complete loss of capital. Understanding and managing these risks is paramount for any trader engaging with leverage. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Manage Your Leverage: Avoid excessively high leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading or if market conditions are highly volatile. Start small and understand the implications. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain unfavorable level. This helps limit potential losses and protects your capital from sudden market shifts. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into highly leveraged futures positions. Diversify across different assets and investment strategies to mitigate overall risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis. Informed decisions are crucial in volatile markets. Risk Management is Key: Only risk capital you can afford to lose. Treat futures trading with the seriousness it demands. The Broader Impact on Derivative Markets These large-scale liquidations, particularly in the derivative markets , can have a ripple effect beyond just the individual traders involved. They can influence overall market sentiment, leading to increased caution among investors and potentially impacting spot market prices. When such significant amounts are wiped out, it can signal a period of uncertainty, prompting some to reduce their exposure to riskier assets. For exchanges, while liquidations protect their solvency, frequent large-scale events can also impact user trust and trading volume if not managed transparently. Ultimately, these events underscore the evolving maturity and inherent challenges within the fast-paced crypto derivatives landscape. The recent wave of crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful cautionary tale. While the allure of amplified gains through leverage trading is strong, the dangers of rapid losses due to crypto market volatility and unmanaged futures trading risks are equally real. Traders must approach these complex instruments with a robust understanding of risk management, ensuring they are prepared for the unpredictable nature of the derivative markets . Staying informed, using appropriate tools like stop-loss orders, and maintaining a disciplined approach are vital for navigating these challenging waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto futures liquidation? A crypto futures liquidation is the automatic closure of a leveraged trading position by an exchange when a trader’s collateral (margin) falls below a certain threshold due to unfavorable market movements. Q2: Why do large-scale crypto futures liquidations happen? They primarily occur due to high market volatility, where sudden and significant price movements (especially downwards) against highly leveraged positions trigger a cascade of forced closures, often accelerating the price move. Q3: How does leverage trading contribute to liquidations? Leverage trading allows traders to control large positions with relatively small capital. While this amplifies potential gains, it also drastically amplifies losses, making positions more susceptible to liquidation with even minor market fluctuations. Q4: What are the risks associated with crypto futures trading? Key risks include potential for rapid and complete loss of capital, high volatility, cascading liquidations, and the complexities of managing leveraged positions in a 24/7 market. Q5: How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, implementing strict risk management strategies like stop-loss orders, not over-committing capital, and staying well-informed about market conditions. Q6: What is the difference between spot trading and futures trading? Spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery at the current market price. Futures trading, conversely, involves contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a future date, often using leverage, without owning the underlying asset directly.

He wrote, “Yield is here for XRP. Hugo Philion and Jesus Rodriguez break down how Flare Networks is bringing DeFi to tokens that didn’t have it in the past.” The tweet captions a podcast episode in which Hugo Philion, co-founder of Flare, and Jesus Rodriguez, co-founder of Sentora, discussed how Flare creates decentralized finance applications for XRP and other tokens that have not had access to such markets. Yield is here for $XRP . @HugoPhilion and & @jrdothoughts break down how @FlareNetworks is bringing DeFi to tokens that didn’t have it in the past. https://t.co/TuuBOwKlV2 — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) August 16, 2025 Philion explained that Flare operates as an independent layer-one blockchain, designed with integrated data protocols that provide decentralization at its core. According to him, these data protocols form the foundation for enabling DeFi functions for assets like XRP. He noted that XRP, despite its prominence in the digital asset market, has been largely overlooked in terms of DeFi integration. Flare aims to change this by providing an EVM-compatible environment where developers can build applications, thereby unlocking new financial use cases for XRP holders. Turning XRP into a Yield-Bearing Asset During the interview, Melker asked whether the introduction of XRP into DeFi primarily meant yield opportunities. Philion confirmed this, outlining use cases where XRP could be deployed in lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, or collateralized stablecoin systems. For example, XRP holders could use their assets as collateral to mint stablecoins, which could then be reinvested across DeFi platforms to generate returns. He emphasized that this approach allows XRP, which traditionally does not generate yield, to be transformed into a yield-bearing asset. Rodriguez expanded on this by discussing the role of Sentora’s product, Firelight, which is being developed on Flare. He described it as a structured platform for managing risk and optimizing strategies for institutional and retail participants. He explained that strategies could include supplying XRP, borrowing stablecoins, and deploying those assets in yield-generating opportunities. He stated that this system is designed to address risks such as liquidation and slippage, making it suitable for both institutions and sophisticated retail users. Institutional and Retail Access to DeFi Melker raised the question of whether Flare’s products are designed primarily for institutional investors. Philion responded that while institutions are an important focus, Flare also intends to provide access to retail holders, many of whom own significant amounts of XRP. He says that Flare’s emphasis on decentralization and neutral data sources makes it attractive to institutions, as the built-in Oracle systems reduce risks associated with centralized data providers. Rodriguez added that the concept of “institutional-grade” infrastructure should not exclude retail investors, as robust security and efficient execution are beneficial for all participants. Both guests agreed that the goal is to create systems that serve institutional requirements while also being accessible to the wider crypto community. Yield Projections and Non-Custodial Infrastructure In terms of yield, Rodriguez stated that initial estimates suggest XRP holders could earn between 4% and 7%, depending on market conditions and the strategies employed. He emphasized that these opportunities would be available through non-custodial protocols, meaning users maintain control over their assets unless they choose to interact through custodial platforms such as exchanges. Philion reinforced this point by highlighting Flare’s focus on non-custodial bridges, such as FXRP, which allow XRP to move onto the Flare blockchain without centralized intermediaries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Implications for DeFi The conversation concluded with a discussion of how the ecosystem around XRP and other non-yielding tokens could expand once DeFi opportunities become established. Philion said Flare is working to build a wide DeFi environment that includes lending, stablecoins, and decentralized exchanges. Rodriguez noted that one of the longer-term goals is to support innovative applications, such as DeFi insurance, which could offer additional ways for XRP to generate returns. Both emphasized that the collaboration between Flare and Sentora seeks to provide a sustainable framework for yield generation that can serve both retail and institutional participants. Melker’s tweet and the subsequent podcast highlight a notable development for XRP, as Flare Network moves to provide yield-generating opportunities to an asset that historically has not had access to decentralized finance. With non-custodial infrastructure, integrated data protocols, and partnerships focused on institutional-grade solutions, Flare positions itself to open a new chapter in the utility of XRP within the DeFi sector.

While Bitcoin and altcoins often chart their own course, the underlying currents of global macroeconomics, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events profoundly influence investor sentiment across all asset classes. Today, we turn our attention to the subdued performance of Asia FX and the US Dollar , as market participants grapple with the complex interplay of anticipated Fed Rate Cuts and simmering Geopolitical Tensions . For crypto investors, these shifts in the Global Economy can signal broader liquidity trends, risk appetite, and potential arbitrage opportunities. Asia FX’s Current Stance: Why the Subdued Performance? The landscape for Asia FX has been remarkably calm, perhaps too calm for some. This subdued behavior isn’t a sign of inherent stability, but rather a reflection of a market caught between conflicting forces. Many Asian currencies, from the Japanese Yen to the Korean Won and the Chinese Yuan, have shown limited directional conviction. This largely stems from a cautious approach by central banks in the region, often waiting for clearer signals from major economies, especially the United States. Several factors contribute to this cautious stance in Asia FX : Cautious Central Banks: Many Asian central banks are hesitant to make significant policy shifts. They often prefer to maintain competitive export positions or manage inflation carefully, avoiding moves that could destabilize their economies without clear global cues. Trade Dependencies: Asian economies are heavily reliant on global trade. This makes their currencies sensitive to shifts in global demand, supply chains, and the economic health of their major trading partners, particularly the United States and Europe. Capital Flows: Investor flows into and out of the region are heavily influenced by interest rate differentials and risk perceptions. Uncertainty about future global interest rates or increased Geopolitical Tensions can lead to capital flight, impacting local currencies. The lack of aggressive policy action or significant economic surprises in Asia has kept its currencies largely range-bound, waiting for a definitive catalyst from global events. The US Dollar’s Dilemma: Navigating Fed Expectations and Global Crosscurrents The US Dollar , the world’s primary reserve currency, finds itself in a peculiar state of flux. Despite persistent inflation concerns and a robust job market, the dollar has largely remained range-bound, oscillating as investors weigh various factors. The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, reflects this indecision. Its performance is intricately tied to market expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and the broader Global Economy . Key drivers influencing the US Dollar ‘s movements include: Economic Data: Stronger-than-expected US economic data, such as robust employment figures or higher inflation prints, often supports the dollar. This is because it suggests the Fed might keep interest rates higher for longer. Conversely, weaker data can pressure the dollar, increasing expectations for Fed Rate Cuts . Safe-Haven Demand: In times of heightened global uncertainty, whether economic or geopolitical, the dollar often benefits from its status as a safe-haven asset. It attracts capital flows from investors seeking stability amidst turmoil. Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between US interest rates and those in other major economies directly impacts the dollar’s attractiveness to yield-seeking investors. A widening positive differential typically strengthens the dollar, while a narrowing one can weaken it. The market’s continuous reassessment of these factors creates a dynamic environment for the US Dollar , making its short-term direction often difficult to predict. Fed Rate Cuts: The Central Bank’s Pivotal Role in Currency Dynamics Perhaps no single factor dominates currency market discourse more than the prospect of Fed Rate Cuts . After an aggressive tightening cycle aimed at combating inflation, the market is now fixated on when and how many times the Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark interest rate. This anticipation directly influences bond yields, which in turn affect the relative attractiveness of holding dollar-denominated assets versus those in other currencies, significantly impacting Asia FX and other global currencies. The implications of anticipated Fed Rate Cuts are far-reaching: Yield Compression: Lower US interest rates would reduce the yield advantage of US bonds and other interest-bearing assets. This could potentially make the dollar less appealing to international investors who seek higher returns, leading to capital outflows. Risk Appetite: Easier monetary policy by the Fed is often seen as supportive of riskier assets, such as equities and commodities. This environment could potentially divert capital away from the dollar into emerging market currencies or other higher-beta assets, including cryptocurrencies. Global Spillover: The Fed’s decisions have a significant spillover effect, influencing other central banks’ policy considerations. If the Fed cuts rates, it might create room for other central banks to ease their own policies, impacting global interest rate differentials and the broader Global Economy . The market’s expectations for these cuts often diverge from the Fed’s own projections, creating volatility. Investors are constantly analyzing economic data for clues on the Fed’s next move, with every piece of inflation or employment data scrutinized for its potential impact on the timing and pace of rate adjustments. Geopolitical Tensions: An Unpredictable Variable for Global Markets Beyond economic fundamentals, Geopolitical Tensions continue to cast a long shadow over currency markets. From ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to simmering disputes in the Indo-Pacific, these uncertainties introduce an unpredictable element into financial calculations. Such tensions can trigger sudden shifts in investor behavior, leading to flight-to-safety movements and impacting currencies like the US Dollar and regional currencies in Asia. The impact of Geopolitical Tensions includes: Safe-Haven Flows: Periods of heightened geopolitical risk often see investors flock to perceived safe havens. The US Dollar , Japanese Yen, and Swiss Franc typically benefit from this demand, attracting capital even if their own domestic economic situations are not stellar. Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts or political instability in key regions can disrupt critical supply chains. This can lead to inflationary pressures due to increased costs and shortages, impacting trade balances and, in turn, affecting currency valuations, especially for import-dependent nations. Energy Price Volatility: Many geopolitical hotspots are in energy-producing regions. Disruptions can cause oil and gas price spikes, which significantly impact import-dependent nations and their currencies. Higher energy costs can also feed into inflation, influencing central bank policy. These tensions introduce a layer of complexity that economic models alone cannot fully capture, making market reactions often swift and sharp. The Global Economy’s Interconnected Web: How Everything Links Together The currency market is a complex ecosystem where every major factor—from interest rate expectations to geopolitical developments—is interconnected, forming the intricate web of the Global Economy . The subdued nature of Asia FX and the indecision of the US Dollar are not isolated incidents; they are symptoms of a larger global economic narrative where all elements influence each other. Consider these critical interdependencies: Inflationary Pressures: Geopolitical events can fuel inflation through commodity price surges (e.g., oil). This, in turn, can force central banks (including the Fed) to maintain tighter monetary policies or delay Fed Rate Cuts , directly impacting interest rate expectations and currency strength. Growth Differentials: Varying growth prospects across regions, influenced by trade policies, domestic demand, and investment climates, directly affect currency strength. A stronger growth outlook typically attracts foreign investment, bolstering the local currency. This also influences the relative performance of Asia FX versus the US Dollar . Cross-Border Capital Flows: The global search for yield, combined with risk assessments, drives capital across borders. Expectations of Fed Rate Cuts can prompt investors to reallocate funds from the US into higher-yielding emerging markets or other asset classes, impacting their currencies and the overall health of the Global Economy . Understanding these relationships is crucial because a change in one area can trigger a cascade of effects across the entire financial system. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors in a Volatile Landscape Navigating this intricate landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space. The primary challenge is the sheer unpredictability. While economic data provides a roadmap, sudden geopolitical shocks or unexpected shifts in central bank rhetoric can quickly alter market dynamics, making it difficult to maintain consistent strategies. However, for the astute investor, opportunities abound: Diversification: Understanding currency movements allows for better portfolio diversification. By strategically allocating assets across different currencies or hedging against currency risk, investors can potentially mitigate losses in one area with gains in another. Strategic Entry/Exit: For crypto traders, recognizing periods of dollar strength or weakness can inform decisions on stablecoin holdings versus volatile digital assets. A strong dollar might encourage stablecoin accumulation, while a weakening dollar could favor riskier crypto assets. Arbitrage Potential: Discrepancies in currency valuations across different markets or between traditional and digital assets can create short-term arbitrage opportunities for sophisticated traders. Actionable Insights for Navigating Currency Markets For those looking to make informed decisions in these turbulent times, here are some actionable insights: Closely Monitor Central Bank Statements: Pay particular attention to the Federal Reserve’s communications, especially statements from the FOMC and speeches by key officials. Their forward guidance on inflation and growth will be critical in shaping expectations for Fed Rate Cuts and their impact on the US Dollar . Track Geopolitical Hotspots: Stay updated on major geopolitical developments. Events in critical regions can rapidly escalate and impact risk sentiment, leading to swift shifts in safe-haven demand for currencies like the US Dollar or sudden pressures on Asia FX . Analyze Economic Data Releases: Keep an eye on key economic indicators from major economies, including inflation reports, employment figures, and GDP growth. Strong or weak data can significantly influence currency valuations and expectations for monetary policy globally. Diversify Your Portfolio Strategically: Consider how currency movements might impact your overall investment portfolio. For crypto investors, this might mean assessing the strength of the dollar when considering converting between stablecoins and more volatile cryptocurrencies, or diversifying into foreign currency-denominated assets. Understand Intermarket Relationships: Recognize that currency markets do not operate in isolation. They are deeply intertwined with bond markets, commodity prices, and equity performance. A holistic view provides a clearer picture of the interconnectedness of the Global Economy . Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Global Finance The current state of Asia FX and the US Dollar reflects a market in cautious anticipation, caught between the powerful forces of monetary policy adjustments and escalating global uncertainties. The debate around Fed Rate Cuts remains central, dictating the flow of capital and the attractiveness of various assets. Simultaneously, the persistent threat of Geopolitical Tensions ensures that volatility remains an ever-present factor, capable of derailing even the most carefully laid plans. For investors navigating the intricate landscape of the Global Economy , vigilance and adaptability are key. Understanding these macro trends is not just for forex traders; it’s crucial for anyone seeking to preserve and grow wealth in an increasingly interconnected financial world, from traditional equities to the burgeoning crypto space. The future of currency markets, and indeed the broader financial system, will be shaped by how these powerful forces resolve themselves in the months ahead, demanding continuous attention and informed decision-making.

A Monday filing showed Metaplanet’s Bitcoin stash has climbed to about $2.18b, based on the prevailing exchange rate. This latest purchase extends a rapid run of acquisitions that have cemented the company’s place as Japan’s most prominent corporate Bitcoin holder. Metaplanet began its aggressive accumulation last year, casting itself as a local counterpart to US firms such as MicroStrategy that use Bitcoin as a treasury reserve. The company paid about 114.3b yen for the purchase, equal to $775m at today’s exchange rate of 147.37 yen to the dollar. Each Bitcoin cost the firm around $120k on average, although the asset was valued at about $115.6k when the disclosure was made. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 775 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 18,888 BTC* pic.twitter.com/2WI5ORPSTp — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) August 18, 2025 Successive BTC Purchases Add Pressure and Attention Ahead of Fed Policy Shift This latest move follows a series of weekly acquisitions that have captured market attention. The company acquired 463 BTC on Aug. 4 for about $53m and added 518 BTC on Aug. 12 for $61.4m. Metaplanet’s strategy mirrors that of other Bitcoin-heavy firms that see long-term upside in holding the asset on their balance sheets. Its consistent accumulation comes as the cryptocurrency market prepares for potential tailwinds, including expected interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in September. Observers Expect Ripple Effect in Asia as Metaplanet Ramps Up Bitcoin Reserve Analysts say the firm’s bold stance could influence other Asian corporates to explore Bitcoin as part of their treasuries, particularly as regulatory clarity improves. Japan has long been viewed as a pioneer in digital asset oversight, giving Metaplanet a favorable environment for its strategy. Metaplanet’s aggressive expansion has also drawn comparisons to MicroStrategy, which holds over 628,946 BTC. While Metaplanet’s stash remains smaller, its rapid accumulation highlights how non-US corporates are beginning to step onto the same path. The latest purchase cements Metaplanet’s position as one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries in Asia. Market participants will be watching closely to see whether its example sparks a broader wave of adoption among regional firms.

Q2 results showed strong top-line growth, but profitability concerns and thinning margins raise questions about CRCL's ability to scale efficiently. Short-term momentum remains intact, with a potential move to $165–170, but long-term investors need to see improved margins and diversified revenue. Circle's reliance on interest income, costly partnerships, and high expectations leaves little margin for error; volatility and sharp swings are likely. Elevator Thesis Circle Internet Group, Inc. (CRCL) stock has run red-hot over the past couple of months, after one of the most explosive IPO performances in recent memory. It's clearly the premier way to play digital dollars, but the stock's gotten incredibly overheated. Also, it's Q2 showing exposed tiger unit economics, with gross profits down, and a relatively inspiring margin guide. Throw in its reliance on interest income, and a slight shortfall in USDC-circulation expectations, and the ""scale effortlessly"" narrative gets a lot tougher. More importantly, with the stock trading at 90x earnings, a lot must go right; growing into those multiples is a tough ask, especially over the long run. That said, the near-term setup still has room to run, with shares holding the $150 mark, momentum stabilizing, and regulatory tailwinds igniting another sharp move higher. Over the short term, a decisive move towards 165-170 seems a reasonable magnet, with upside skewed by volatility. For those with a long-term investing mindset though, will need to see a lot more from Circle. Circle's Role in Crypto: Issuing the Digital Dollar Circle Internet CEO Jeremy Allaire (TheStreet.com) Circle is essentially the ""digital mint"" behind the popular USD Coin (USDC-USD), the second-largest cryptocurrency stablecoin after Tether (USDT-USD). It's already zoomed past the $60 billion mark in market cap, locking over 25% of the entire stablecoin market, second only to Tether. Simply put, the USDC is basically a digital dollar that's always worth $1. Think of it like an online casino chip pegged to real cash usable at every vendor that accepts crypto. Circle's primary role in all this is issuing and managing USDC (along with a smaller Euro Coin), holding equivalent real dollars in its reserve. Why is USDC a big deal? In the volatile crypto world, it's perhaps the closest thing to cash you can count on. Pegged to the dollar, USDC moves swiftly with virtually zero transaction costs. That ease and cost-effectiveness make it the go-to for traders and crypto businesses alike. How does Circle make money? To put it plainly, it earns interest on all those dollars sitting in its vaults. Like a traditional bank investing its deposits, Circle invests USDC reserves (primarily in short-term U.S. Treasuries) to pocket handsome interest income. In fact, that's Circle's lifeblood, where last year it effectively pocketed virtually the entirety of its $1.68 billion revenue from interest on USDC reserves. So Circle is effectively running a massive money-market crypto fund where potentially higher interest rates or more USDC in circulation result in greater profits. Moreover, since its public debut in June, Circle's arguably the hottest stock on the market. Priced at $31, Circle stock opened at $69 and then closed the show with a bang, with an $83 price tag, a jaw-dropping 168% pop from its offer price. Circle's IPO is perhaps the most explosive in recent memory, but that was just the beginning, as within a few short weeks, the stock racked up all-time highs near $300. A big part of that frenzy was about timing. Being behind USDC was one thing, but its IPO was backed by a wave of regulatory clarity. In Washington, both the STABLE Act and GENIUS Act gained bipartisan support, with the latter becoming law by Q2. Hence, with a robust federal framework for stablecoins, Circle and its peers got a giant green light for their business models. A Strong Start for the Crypto Stock, but Profitability Questions Linger Post-IPO USDC by Circle (Matcha Blog) Circle's Q2 earnings print was mostly strong on the top-line, but profitability concerns continue to weigh down its bull case. It posted $658 million in sales, a superb 53% bump from a year ago, while comfortably beating analyst estimates ($645 million). That growth was led by a gusher of interest income on USDC reserves, surging close to 50% as interest rates remained elevated and USDC circulation was mostly impressive. By the end of June, USDC supply hit $61.3 billion, up a powerful 90% YOY, showing healthier adoption across crypto platforms and institutional partners. Also, on an adjusted basis, Circle booked $126 million in EBITDA, up over 50% YOY, along with its adjusted EPS crushing expectations at $1.02 compared to the $0.29 expectation. Upbeat over Q2 results, CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized that USDC is moving beyond pure trading into broader financial use cases. Perhaps the biggest highlight was the launch of the Circle Payments Network (CPN) in May, targeting financial institutions. According to Circle's management, more than 100 banks and fintechs are in the pipeline already, underscoring incredible demand for USDC in revolitionizing cross-border transfers. Also, Circle expanded its partnerships with key players like Binance, OKX, FIS, and Fiserv, moves that give greater exposure to USDC across the globe. In addition to that, Circle's management unveiled a long-term bet in Project Arc, which is a robust new in-house blockchain network developed for high-speed stablecoin transactions. The long-term infrastructure bet could add new layers to Circle's growth story, helping it scale even quicker. Nevertheless, beneath the surface, Circle's profitability issues remain well and truly a concern, which complicates the bullish thesis. Though it posted a solid beat on the top-line, its GAAP loss of $4.48 per share blew past expectations in the wrong direction ,with analysts expecting a modest $0.34 profit. The culprit was a whopping $424 million in stock-based compensation linked to Circle's June IPO. Management chalked it up as essentially a one-time hit, but it did push losses to roughly $482 million. Strip that cost away ,and it makes the loss vanish, but it doesn't solve the bigger issue of company margins thinning out. In the previous quarter, Circle's cost of sales formed roughly 73% of total sales. However, that number has surged to over 138% in Q2, which highlights serious concerns over the company's dwindling unit economics. A big part of its weakening operational leverage is its dependency on interest income and costly channels that continue pushing distribution costs higher. Consequently, Circle guided to a 37% RLDC margin, down from 40% last quarter and 42% a year ago. The slide highlights a structural squeeze, where Circle's costly partnerships are cutting deep into its margins. Circle is dependent on partners like Coinbase to distribute USDC, but it also has to share its sales. Hence, it's giving into the fintech trap where third parties feed into margins. Moreover, USDC's core growth showed a slight wobble too. Though USDC circulation jumped 90% YOY, it did come shy of expectations by 1% . For a stock that's in hyper-growth mode, even a small miss can rattle confidence. In short, Q2 wasn't all rosy as the headline numbers suggested. Circle is growing, but not without its fair share of pains, which reminds investors of the perils in scaling in the fintech space. A Word on the Recent Share Offering Safe to say, Circle raised a few eyebrows this month, after announcing a 10 million share secondary offering, just a couple of months after a blockbuster IPO. Though the headline suggested a hefty capital infusion, the details apparently told a different story. Roughly eight million of those shares were being sold by insiders and early backers, with basically just two million new shares being issued by the company. In other words, most of the proceeds from the sale were going to existing stakeholders, not exactly Circle's balance sheet. Naturally, Circle talked about the move being a way to boost liquidity and allow long-time investors to diversify. Fair enough, and it's true that post-IPO selling isn't unusual. However, the timing and scale weren't subtle, considering the offering was priced at $130, a discount to the then-$150 stock price. Though it isn't inherently bearish, the secondary sale could potentially be perceived as the early backers viewing it as a smart time to lock in gains. Valuation Discussion Circle's stock has gone parabolic since its IPO, and many would argue that it's priced for perfection. Of late, though, we've seen the stock wobble, pulling back near the $150 mark. Despite the steep correction, Circle still commands a market cap near $34 billion, putting it in line with, or just behind, some of the biggest names in fintech. For context, the stock is trading at over 12 times forward sales, more than 280% higher than the sector median. On an earnings basis, that picture gets even murkier. Peer Valuation CRCL Stock (Seeking Alpha) Circle's current valuation makes even well-established fintech peers look a lot less cheap. On a non-GAAP basis, for instance, Circle commands a forward P/E multiple of 92.8x, which is more than double when compared to big fintech plays like Visa ( V ) at 30.3x and Coinbase ( COIN ) at 41.6x. PayPal ( PYPL ) is perhaps the most mature name of the group, and it's trading at a P/E multiple of just 13.3x FY1, highlighting just how stretched Circle's valuation is at this point. Moreover, even with generous EPS estimates over the next few years, Circle's forward P/E is still projected to hover near 50 . Taking this further, on an EV/EBITDA basis, Circle's forward multiple is 65.8x, blazing past Visa (23.9x) and Coinbase (27.1x). Perhaps the biggest name out of the lot in PayPal sits at a mere 9.6x. Naturally, the bulls are counting on Circle to capture the lion's share of the future of finance, leading to outsized growth for years. However, for that to happen, a lot has to go right, and any hiccup in growth, margins, or regulatory climate will weigh down its stock price and then some. On the flipside, its peers like Coinbase also trade at rich valuations, but also boast broader business and actual net profits in some quarters. On top of that, many liken Circle's potential to a Visa, where it's taking big cuts of a huge volume of digital dollar transactions globally. However, even when pitted against it, Circle's stock price looks dizzying. Nevertheless, we must understand that Circle is a momentum stock that could swing 20% to 30% on sentiment alone. At this point, especially following a sizeable recent dip, momentum indicators are starting to back a bounce. The relative strength index has stabilized in the low-40s, creating a small bullish divergence. Also, volume-wise, distribution pressures appear to be easing out, which may result in a move higher towards the $165 to $170 mark (near Circle's consensus Wall-Street target) in the near-term. Hence, at least in the short term, the stock's high-flyer status appears mostly intact, but it's a tall order nonetheless. Risks to the Thesis Circle stock is no stranger to sharp swings, and those with a stomach for such volatility will know that momentum stocks can shoot both ways. The crypto stock is still early in the piece of what could be an entirely new business category, with a massive long-term addressable market. Also, Circle stock trades with emotion, but it also delivers real sales and is building infrastructure that could potentially underpin the next wave of global finance. As USDC adoption continues to grow, every incremental dollar in circulation becomes a high-margin driver. Nevertheless, given the high expectations, Circle doesn't leave its investors with any margin for error. Even a slight revenue miss or regulatory hiccup could result in the stock going into free-fall. Hence, Circle stock's price action shows how sentiment can easily detach from fundamentals. Sharp drops trigger margin calls, stop-loss selling, and panic exits. For those with a long-term horizon, though, will want to size up their positions wisely and prepare mentally for likely haymakers along the way. Final Word on Circle Stock Circle is perhaps the best stablecoin play, but the stock is clearly overheated. Q2 showed cracks in its scale effortlessly story, and over the long-term that's a tall order at premium multiples. However, given the stock's volatility, a near term, setup showing a path towards the $165-170 mark. For those going long though, will want to see a lot more from Circle, in its ability to reduce distribution costs, build a healthier non-interest revenue mix, along with USDC growth.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-18 04:56:59

Rising transaction activity, expanding adoption, and new blockchain technology are pushing the market forward. The top trending crypto projects this year are gaining attention not from speculation alone but from measurable adoption, technical growth, and real-world application. Among the leading names, BlockDAG is drawing attention with a record-setting presale and advanced design. Binance Coin (BNB) continues to hold its position among exchange-linked assets with strong trading volumes. TRON (TRX) is posting steady quarterly strength, while Toncoin (TON) is preparing for a potential breakout supported by technical setups. These four projects show a mix of architecture, liquidity dominance, adoption growth, and technical positioning, placing them firmly in the conversation of top trending crypto in 2025. BlockDAG: Presale Growth and Expanding Ecosystem BlockDAG has become one of the most closely watched projects in the top trending crypto group for 2025. Now in Batch 29 of its presale at $0.0276, the project has raised more than $376 million while also selling 19,300 ASIC miners, highlighting strong infrastructure and network activity. Its hybrid approach of DAG combined with Proof-of-Work consensus allows for rapid transaction speeds while maintaining decentralization, offering a competitive edge over other Layer 1 designs. Some projections suggest BDAG could approach $1 post-listing, equating to a possible 36x return from current levels. Beyond the numbers, it already has over 2.5 million users on its X1 mobile mining app, more than 4,500 developers working on over 300 decentralized applications, and a growing base of over 200,000 holders. These adoption signals add to its credibility as a long-term player. With the presale past the halfway point toward its $600M target and prices rising each batch, current entry levels are becoming scarce. BlockDAG ’s mix of scale, adoption, and consistent sales record highlights why it remains a central project to watch in the top trending crypto space for this cycle. Binance Coin (BNB): Liquidity Signals and Price Levels Binance Coin has maintained its role as a top trending crypto by continuing to dominate the exchange-linked category. Trading near $841.45, BNB has advanced 2.9% in the past 24 hours and more than 9.5% across the week. Daily trading activity reached $3.49 billion, which is more than 50% higher than the day before and points to strong market participation. From a technical view, BNB is moving within the $792 to $827 range, with a breakout projection toward $861. With volume support remaining firm and Binance’s wide market presence, BNB retains stability while offering space for additional growth. TRON (TRX): Network Growth and Forward Projections TRON has reinforced its place in the top trending crypto group with a steady climb. Trading around $0.35, TRX gained between 2% and 8% over the past week and is supported by strong Q2 results. These include net income of $1.47 million and over 5 billion transactions processed during the period. With more use in decentralized exchanges and staking, TRON is tracking a possible move toward $0.45, with some long-term scenarios pointing to $1 if adoption continues. Robust earnings and expanding engagement give TRON momentum heading into 2025, keeping it positioned as a key name in the current cycle. Toncoin (TON): Price Compression Before Resistance Test Toncoin is moving into focus as a top trending crypto in 2025. Trading between $3.46 and $3.52, TON gained 1–3% in the past 24 hours and 7–10% across the week. Analysts are pointing to a consolidation pattern forming below the $3.77 resistance level. If TON clears that price point, projections extend toward $7.07, signaling potential gains of more than 100%. Market build-up and constructive technical patterns continue to support Toncoin’s chances of a breakout that could reset its trajectory in the near term. Summary Outlook The 2025 cycle is already highlighting the strength of top trending crypto projects. BlockDAG stands out with a presale above $376 million, an active ecosystem, and projections that point to possible 36x upside once listed. Binance Coin offers the consistency of a leading exchange asset, TRON combines adoption with earnings growth, and Toncoin is showing a chart structure that could trigger a major rally. Each project represents a different angle, from early-stage development to established leadership and technical breakout setups. Together, they outline how the top trending crypto landscape for 2025 is taking shape, with these names setting the pace for the months ahead.

Cardano’s ETF narrative and Dogecoin’s accumulation trends highlight how market interest can translate into growth, yet both rely heavily on timing the next rally. Cold Wallet sets itself apart by offering instant value through its live USDT cashback and referral rewards. With $6 million raised in presale and adoption gaining speed, it is increasingly seen as the next altcoin to explode, driven not by speculation, but by utility that pays from day one. Build Lasting Passive Income with Every Swap, Yours and Theirs Cold Wallet is changing expectations in crypto by creating a system where every transaction has the potential to generate passive income. Unlike traditional referral bonuses that end after the first payout, its design allows users to earn USDT cashback every time someone they referred makes a swap. Payments are automatic and credited once a $5 threshold is reached, no points, no delays, just real value delivered directly to users. This means a single invitation can become an ongoing income stream. As long as referred users remain active, rewards continue to flow. It’s a model that turns networks into assets, making participation itself a generator of returns. More importantly, this utility is already live, even before the $CWT token launches, proving Cold Wallet’s commitment to delivering function before hype. Momentum is also building around its presale. With over $6 million raised, stage 17 tokens are priced at $0.00998, while the confirmed listing price is $0.3517. That gap represents significant upside for early participants, returns amplified by a product that already rewards usage. For those seeking the next altcoin to explode, Cold Wallet offers more than price speculation. It combines sustainable utility with transparent mechanics, avoiding staking lockups or empty promises. Users earn from day one, building passive income through their own activity and the activity of others. This forward-looking model positions Cold Wallet as one of the best opportunities for long-term returns and real-world usability in the crypto market. Cardano Eyes Growth Beyond $1 as Momentum Builds Cardano has reignited market optimism after pushing past the $0.98 barrier, a level that had capped progress for weeks. This breakout, supported by rising trading volume and strong RSI signals, highlights genuine momentum rather than short-term speculation. Analysts suggest that if ADA can secure a close above $1, the door opens to test $1.05 and even higher levels in the near term. What’s fueling this surge is more than charts, Cardano’s growing visibility through ETF discussions has increased investor confidence, strengthening its long-term narrative. Unlike fleeting rallies, this momentum feels anchored by both technicals and sentiment. For investors seeking the next altcoin to explode, Cardano offers a mix of structure, adoption potential, and renewed excitement. Its ability to pair technical strength with institutional buzz positions ADA as a project with credible upside, especially for those watching how blockchain utility intersects with broader financial markets. Dogecoin Holds Steady, Awaiting Its Next Big Move Dogecoin continues to trade within a narrow range near $0.2240, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern that often precedes a breakout. Resistance lies at $0.2428 and $0.2469, while support levels hold around $0.2300 and $0.2263. This consolidation signals a balanced market, with neither buyers nor sellers yet in control. Volume has remained steady, indicating that traders are watching closely for confirmation before committing to larger positions. Unlike the wild volatility often tied to DOGE, this period reflects stability, a setup that could lead to a decisive move once one of the key levels breaks. While Dogecoin isn’t the next altcoin to explode at this exact moment, its history of sudden rallies showsthat the potential is always there. With growing mainstream recognition and steady community backing, any breakout could accelerate quickly, turning this quiet phase into the foundation for DOGE’s next big upward move. Where Utility Meets Earning Potential Price rallies may capture headlines, but lasting value is built on systems that reward genuine use. Cardano and Dogecoin show how momentum and visibility can drive gains, yet both remain tied to timing and outside factors. Cold Wallet, however, delivers ongoing rewards from the start, turning swaps and referrals into steady USDT income. Backed by strong presale traction and a live system already paying users, it offers a model where participation itself creates returns. For those seeking the next altcoin to explode, Cold Wallet makes a compelling case by blending utility with long-term earning potential.

Most assets depict weakness after relative stability over the weekend. This article evaluates Story (IP), which displays bearish sentiments, driven by the project’s leadership shakeup. Story remained on the investor radar over the weekend as its co-founder, Jason Zhao, revealed he is exiting his full-time role. He will now become a strategic advisor, ending his 3.5-year term as Story’s co-founder. Zhao took it to X to reflect on his journey as Story’s leader, calling it his most meaningful experience. He highlighted that Story started as a mere whiteboard sketch but grew into an ecosystem supporting intellectual properties (IPs) from recognized names like BTS and Balmain. Moreover, the project secured over $130 million from renowned funders like a16z (Andreessen Horowitz). Looking back, building Story has been the most meaningful experience of my life. What began as a whiteboard sketch when I was 22 turned into more than I could have imagined: a network supporting IPs from Balmain to BTS, with millions of transactions and $130M+ in backing from partners like a16z. Jason Zhao @jasonjzhao · Follow After 3.5 years building Story from scratch, I’m stepping out of my full-time role. I’ll stay closely involved as a strategic advisor.While incubating Poseidon, I rekindled my original passion from my DeepMind days: applying AI to frontier industries like science and space. 7:46 AM · Aug 16, 2025 947 Reply Copy link Read 292 replies Zhao dives deeper into AI Despite achieving key milestones, Zhao believes it is time to explore a new calling. He will prioritize developing the AI project Poseidon, which focuses on applying high-tech intelligence to leading industries like robotics, science, space exploration, and biopharma. Community reaction While Zhao maintained an optimistic tone in his farewell, enthusiasts weren’t forgiving. Most individuals expressed frustration across social media platforms. They criticized the co-founders’ timing. Zhao exited only weeks after Story’s TGE (token generation event). Many perceive this as a substantial red flag, speculating that the project lacked a comprehensive product roadmap to justify its enormous funding and market valuations. One X users highlighted Zhao’s betrayal, stating : I honestly don’t even care about the token gymnastics. You sold a dream to 100 young idealists who bet their careers on you during one of the hardest job markets in a generation. Then you completely bailed for greener pastures and the only narrative more oversold than your own. Absolutely crazy work. I hope this reputational damage follows you for the rest of your career. IP price outlook The native token hovers at $5.66 after a swift drop from an intraday high of $6.04. Chart by Coinmarketcap Negative sentiments (as the community reacts to Zhao’s departure) and broad market declines drive Story. IP will likely print more red candlesticks on its daily chart as selling momentum dominates the short-term outlook. Notably, most tokens plummet after leadership exit, especially when a key player exits. For instance, Shiba Inu lost more than 10% in January after Shytoshi Kusama stepped down as SHIB’s leader .

Almost all altcoins have followed suit, with ETH dumping to $4,300, while XRP is testing the crucial $3 resistance. Bitcoin dumped on Thursday and Friday then barely moved at all over the weekend. US futures markets just reopened for the week and now $BTC is selling off again. WHO IS DUMPING ON US? pic.twitter.com/8GQ0semVwP — Satoshi Stacker (@StackerSatoshi) August 18, 2025 The latest correction transpired as the US futures markets reopened, but also during the early Asian trading hours. Perhaps a large portion of this volatility can be attributed to the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war. As reported on Saturday morning, Trump and Putin failed to reach a conclusive deal on how the war should end. However, the US President said later on that there has been “big progress on Russia,” and advised people to stay tuned. On Sunday, the POTUS made another comment, saying that the ball is now in Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s court: “President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change.” Recall that the US President is set to meet with European leaders today, including Ukraine’s Zelenskyy. In terms of BTC price actions, the past several hours have been quite painful as the asset slumped by over three grand in a fall to an 11-day low of $115,000. It has managed to defend that level for now, but the move south has dragged most altcoins with it. ETH is down by 3%, XRP has slipped to $3, while SOL and DOGE have marked 4-5% daily declines. LINK is among the few exceptions, posting another daily jump of 5%. The total value of wrecked positions has risen to over $450 million, according to CoinGlass data. More than 115,000 traders have been wrecked daily, and longs as responsible for the lion’s share. Liquidation Heat Map.

His post mentions XRP as a payment method through platforms serving the region. This reflects the growing role of digital assets in real-world applications. The focus of the statement was on travel bookings and the direct availability of XRP as a payment option , without extending into broader commentary on its market impact. BREAKING: UAE travelers can now book flights using #XRP ! pic.twitter.com/R6UqStfN1o — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 16, 2025 Platforms Supporting Crypto Payments The images shared alongside the post compared several airlines and agencies operating in the UAE that accept cryptocurrency payments. The details show that integration is often provided through third-party payment processors. Emirates Airlines supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, CRO, USDT, USDC, and additional assets from 2026, facilitated through Crypto.com. Air Arabia lists AE Coin through Al Maryah Community Bank. Travala supports a wide range of assets, including BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, AVA, and more than 90 others, processed through Crypto.com and Binance Pay. Alternative Airlines explicitly lists XRP among supported assets along with BTC, ETH, LTC, ADA, DOGE, USDT, and over 100 more, with payments handled by Crypto.com, Triple-A, and xMoney. Destinia, meanwhile, accepts BTC, ETH, and USDT through BitPay. XRP’s appearance on the list is tied to Alternative Airlines, confirming a clear path for customers to use the asset when booking flights. Travala.com’s XRP Integration In an earlier development reported by Times Tabloid in May, Travala.com officially integrated XRP as a payment method for global users. Travala is a blockchain-based travel platform offering over three million travel products, including flights, hotels, and activities across over 230 countries. The integration was highlighted at the time by Edo Farina, who emphasized its importance for expanding the utility of digital assets in day-to-day payments. Travala already supports more than one hundred payment methods, covering both traditional and digital options, and the addition of XRP means customers can complete bookings directly using the asset. For UAE travelers using Travala, this option includes international and regional bookings. Significance for Travelers in the UAE For users in the UAE , the relevance of JackTheRippler’s post lies in the practical ability to book flights using XRP through platforms that provide crypto-friendly services. While major airlines like Emirates are working through specific payment partnerships with limited asset coverage, agencies such as Alternative Airlines and Travala.com include XRP within their supported range. In most cases, payment is routed through intermediaries like Crypto.com, Binance Pay, Triple-A, or xMoney, which handle settlement and conversion. This ensures that travelers who prefer to use XRP can access flights and related services, though availability depends on the platform chosen. JackTheRippler’s post underscores the growing utility of XRP in the travel sector, specifically for UAE-based travelers. With platforms such as Alternative Airlines and Travala.com enabling XRP payments, customers now have options to complete flight bookings using the asset.

This surge could trigger a broader crypto rally, significantly benefiting Layer 2 ecosystems. Among these, the new Layer Brett is generating massive buzz with its unique blend of meme culture and utility. With the presale now live, here’s why you should capitalize on this investment opportunity: LBRETT Might Kickstart DeFi’s Layer 2 Project Revolution What if the next big crypto trend wasn’t just a meme, but a serious piece of blockchain infrastructure? That’s the promise behind Layer Brett, which has captured massive attention in the crypto space. At its core, LBRETT is built on Ethereum Layer 2, offering fast transaction speeds, fees reduced to pennies, and the reliability of the Ethereum network’s security. Unlike most meme-based cryptos in the Web3 space today, LBRETT doesn’t just borrow hype from meme culture, it fuses it with real blockchain performance in a way the market hasn’t seen before. The appeal for early investors is obvious: a presale with low entry prices, staking rewards that some into the tens of thousands of percent, and no KYC barriers makes LBRETT both accessible and rewarding. Additionally, LBRETT’s ecosystem features a $1 million community giveaway aimed at driving adoption straight from the start. However, what truly makes LBRETT special is ambition. Rather than being just another meme coin, it has what it takes to rival against Layer 2 leaders like Arbitrum and Optimism. At the same time, it keeps a playful, community-driven vibe, something the crypto crowd loves. LBRETT’s incredible features like the staking pools, NFT tie-ins and gamified rewards, prove that the ecosystem is designed to keep people engaged long after the presale rush fades. The question is no longer whether LBRETT will attract attention; it already has, and it appears poised to rise to the top of the crypto charts soon. Is a $5000 Price Point A Valid Ethereum Price Prediction? While the start of 2025 was relatively quiet for Ethereum, the market has since shifted dramatically toward a bullish sentiment. Over the past week, ETH has climbed 7%, and it has soared an impressive 29.6% in the last 30 days. ETH continues to hold its status as the second-largest crypto by market cap, currently valued at around $565 billion. As a result, a lot of renowned crypto experts have been dropping optimistic Ethereum price prediction charts. For one, on August 12, crypto analyst, Ali Charts, made an X post stating that $5,210 and $6,946 are the next targets for ETH. Moreover, Wall Street’s interest in Ethereum has surged, driven by increased demand for spot ETFs, which has added additional fuel to its rally. Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s original founders, has once again crossed into billionaire territory on-chain. His wealth is climbing fast as ETH’s price races toward its old November 2021 peak of $4,891. At the moment, ETH looks ready to test major levels above $4,800, $5,000, and even possibly $6,000. If its momentum holds, Ethereum’s 2025 story is only getting started. Conclusion ETH’s push toward $5K could trigger the next major crypto rally, and Layer 2 ecosystems will benefit most. With speed, efficiency, and growing adoption, the stage is set for breakout projects to shine. LBRETT is at the forefront of this change, ready to capture attention and deliver serious upside.

According to data from CNBC , Dow Jones futures inched up by 57 points, or 0.13%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 ticked up 0.14% and 0.21%. Traders stayed cautious as everyone waited for the next Fed signal, but optimism about interest rate cuts still hung over the market like leftover smoke. Last week closed strong for the three major indexes. The Dow rose 1.7%, while the S&P 500 added 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite moved 0.8% higher. That makes it the second week in a row of gains for all three. The S&P and Nasdaq have now logged four out of five green weeks. But the real action came from small-cap stocks, which jumped over 3%, as bets intensified that the Federal Reserve will ease rates soon, despite inflation data trying to say otherwise.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 made a new all-time high at 43,683.56, and the Topix index gained 0.53%, helped by stronger tech sentiment. Meanwhile in South Korea, it was the opposite story. The Kospi dropped 1.25%, and the Kosdaq lost 1.52%, weighed down by investor fears over regional earnings and slowing demand from China. It’s in line with an earlier report by Cryptopolitan mentioning that South Koreans are ditching big tech stocks to move into Ethereum. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index nudged up 0.19%, and mainland China’s CSI 300 improved by 0.34%. The uptick followed new local data hinting at moderate momentum in industrial output. Over in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 briefly touched an intra-day high of 8,960 before cooling off, but still closed 0.14% higher. Elsewhere, Singapore reported a 4.6% drop in non-oil domestic exports for July, missing expectations of a 1.8% decline. The figures, released by Enterprise Singapore, followed a revised 12.9% gain in June, confirming that the country’s trade outlook remains unstable. European markets stayed mostly flat, with nearly every major index unchanged except for London’s FTSE, which dipped 0.42% to 9,138.9, and Italy’s FTSE MIB, which jumped 1.11%, opening at 42,653.97. The IBEX 35, DAX, CAC 40, and STOXX 600 all held their ground without any movement. Currency trading in the region showed the euro inching up to 1.171 against the dollar, and climbing 0.4% versus the yen, now at 172.56. Bond markets were quiet, but the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield slipped slightly to 4.306%, down 0.022 points, while Japanese government bonds showed mixed movement, with the 10-year yield ticking up 0.01 points to 1.575% and the 30-year hitting 3.119% after a 0.019-point rise. Gold tests resistance as traders eye Fed minutes On the metals front, gold tried climbing above $3,350 early Monday, after hitting an 11-day low of $3,325 last week. The bounce came as some traders hedged against rising global tension, but others warned that the metal could slip again if the U.S. dollar rebounds this week. With the Fed’s July meeting minutes and the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium just days away, from August 21 to 23, many are expecting a period of high volatility in both gold and fiat currency markets. The dollar traded flat in early Asia, but slightly recovered after last week’s decline. President Donald Trump is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a development that could move currency markets since it’ll stir up vira; headlines. Traders are also scaling back bets on a massive Fed cut. Last week, markets were pricing in a 98% chance of a 50-basis-point cut. That’s now down to 84%, with most expecting a modest quarter-point cut instead, thanks to stronger-than-expected wholesale and retail sales data. Against the euro, the greenback was barely changed at $1.1705. The British pound inched up 0.07% to $1.3557, while the dollar index edged up to 97.85, recouping a portion of last week’s 0.4% loss. The yen weakened slightly, with the dollar rising 0.11% to 147.34. That followed comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who called out the Bank of Japan as being “behind the curve.” The Japanese government brushed off Bessent’s remarks. The Australian dollar rose 0.1% to $0.65145, while the New Zealand dollar ticked up 0.15% to $0.5934, both rebounding from last week’s selloff where they each lost around 0.5%. Oil stayed soft. Brent crude futures dropped 6 cents to $65.79 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, added just 2 cents, trading at $62.82.

Japan’s stablecoin reform aims at streamlined international money transfers. Cryptocurrency tax and ETF proposals signal dynamic legal changes. Japan Approves First Yen-Pegged Stablecoin for National Rollout Japan’s Financial Services Agency is preparing to approve the country’s inaugural stablecoin, directly linked to the yen. The issuer, Tokyo-based fintech JPYC, will soon be registered officially as a licensed money transfer provider. This ground-breaking move not only aims to strengthen Japan’s fintech sector but could also revolutionize how cross-border transactions are settled, making them faster and more cost-efficient for businesses and individuals. According to local reports, the global stablecoin market is expected to surpass $250 billion by 2025, with most coins currently pegged to the US dollar. Japan now positions itself on the cutting edge by enabling new forms of digital payments, diversifying its participation in the international crypto ecosystem. Regulatory Reforms and Regional Stablecoin Growth Separately, South Korean tech giant Kakao is developing a won-pegged stablecoin via the Kaia blockchain, highlighting a regional trend toward national digital assets. Meanwhile, Japan’s financial regulator has proposed reforms to classify cryptocurrencies as financial products. Such changes could pave the way for crypto ETFs and a simplified 20% flat income tax for crypto earnings, making Japan a more enticing market for investors and innovators alike. These developments demonstrate Japan’s commitment to fostering digital innovation while maintaining regulatory oversight, positioning the country as a central hub in the rapidly expanding global stablecoin industry.

The warning comes amid a market-wide correction that has not spared XRP. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP stood tall at around $3.15 yesterday as the market was trading sideways. However, as the landscape changed earlier this morning, perhaps due to the latest Trump comments in regards to the war between Ukraine and Russia, Ripple’s token joined the rest of the market in a painful move south. In a matter of just a few hours, the asset dropped to an 11-day low of its own at $2.97 (on Bitstamp). Thus, it briefly slipped below the coveted $3.00 support level but has returned to just over it as of press time. According to Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst with over 150,000 followers on X, XRP has now moved further away from a critical resistance level. He believes $3.30 is pivotal in determining the asset’s future price behavior, and failure to reclaim it could result in a price drop to $2.6 or even $2. $XRP must reclaim $3.30 to avoid a drop to $2.60 or even $2. pic.twitter.com/1n4IYihaKq — Ali (@ali_charts) August 17, 2025 Previously, Martinez also outlined $2.81 as a key support level for XRP and stated that it needs to remain above this level to maintain its bull market structure. For now, Ripple’s token remains essentially in the middle between these two targets, but more volatility is expected today as the political leaders of several European nations, including Ukraine, will meet with Trump to discuss the potential end to the war against Russia.

Recently, Ethereum (ETH) experienced a noticeable dip from its weekend highs. However, not all players in this dynamic space felt the pinch equally. Major ETH holding giants, Bitmain and SharpLink Gaming, continue to demonstrate remarkable Ethereum profitability , showcasing their resilience in the face of market shifts. How Do Giants Maintain Ethereum Profitability During Dips? Even as Ethereum’s price fell around 9% from its peak, the financial positions of these prominent entities remained strong. Crypto analyst @_FORAB on X highlighted their impressive gains. At a price point of $4,331, Bitmain’s substantial ETH holdings reflected an unrealized gain of 13.8%, amounting to a staggering $679 million. This figure alone speaks volumes about their strategic positioning. Similarly, SharpLink Gaming recorded an even more impressive 22% gain, translating to $571 million in unrealized profit. These figures are not just numbers; they illustrate a significant advantage these companies hold. They underline how strategic long-term holding can lead to sustained Ethereum profitability , even when short-term market movements seem unfavorable. What Strategies Drive Their Ethereum Profitability? The ability of Bitmain and SharpLink Gaming to maintain such robust financial health despite market volatility isn’t accidental. It often stems from a combination of factors, including a long-term investment horizon and a favorable average cost basis. Unlike day traders who focus on quick gains, these giants likely accumulate assets over time, averaging out their purchase prices. Consider these key elements that contribute to their continued success: Long-Term Vision: They hold ETH not for daily fluctuations but for its long-term growth potential. This patience allows them to ride out temporary downturns. Strategic Accumulation: Buying during market dips can significantly lower their overall average cost, making subsequent price recoveries more impactful for their bottom line. Diversified Business Models: Bitmain, a leading manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware, and SharpLink Gaming, involved in sports betting and iGaming, have primary revenue streams that may cushion them against direct crypto market shocks, allowing them to hold their digital assets more confidently. These strategies help them secure and grow their Ethereum profitability . What Can Investors Learn from This Unwavering Ethereum Profitability? The consistent profitability of Bitmain and SharpLink Gaming offers valuable lessons for all types of investors, from beginners to seasoned market participants. It emphasizes that panic selling during a market correction might not always be the wisest move. Instead, a disciplined approach can yield significant returns over time. Here are some actionable insights: Patience is Key: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. A long-term perspective can help you avoid emotional decisions during price drops. Understand Your Holdings: Research the assets you invest in. Knowing their fundamentals helps you maintain conviction during turbulent times. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. This principle is fundamental to surviving market downturns and protecting your overall financial health. Ultimately, the success stories of Bitmain and SharpLink Gaming highlight that achieving and maintaining Ethereum profitability often comes down to strategic planning, a long-term outlook, and unwavering confidence in the asset’s potential. The resilience shown by these major ETH holders serves as a powerful reminder that even in a dynamic and sometimes unpredictable market, a well-thought-out investment strategy can lead to substantial and enduring gains. Their ability to remain in profit despite market shifts underscores the potential for sustained Ethereum profitability when coupled with foresight and a disciplined approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an unrealized gain in cryptocurrency? An unrealized gain is the profit an investor would make if they sold an asset at its current market price, but they have not yet sold it. It’s a theoretical profit until the asset is actually liquidated. Q2: How do large companies like Bitmain acquire so much Ethereum? Companies like Bitmain, a major player in crypto mining, often acquire Ethereum through mining operations, direct purchases, or as part of their business operations. They may hold these assets as part of their treasury strategy. Q3: Does a price drop always mean a loss for all holders? No, a price drop only results in a realized loss if the holder sells their assets below their purchase price. For long-term holders with a low average cost basis, or those who bought during earlier dips, a price drop might reduce their unrealized gains but still leave them in profit. Q4: Is Ethereum a good long-term investment? Many investors view Ethereum as a strong long-term investment due to its robust ecosystem, ongoing development (like the transition to Ethereum 2.0), and its foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. However, all investments carry risk. Q5: How can I track the holdings of large crypto entities? Crypto analysts and on-chain data platforms often track the movements of large wallets, sometimes referred to as ‘whales’ or institutional holdings. Resources like X (formerly Twitter) crypto analysts or blockchain analytics websites can provide such insights.

Saylor is also very much still focused on Bitcoin despite the rising interest in altcoin treasuries. Michael Saylor Eyes More Bitcoin Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, hinted at yet another major Bitcoin purchase by the company as the crypto trades just below its all-time high of over $124,000. Earlier this week, Strategy added 155 BTC worth $18 million to its holdings, bringing its total to 628,946 BTC valued at more than $74.2 billion. According to SaylorTracker , the firm is sitting on more than $28 billion in unrealized gains, with its Bitcoin investment up more than 60% overall. After pioneering the Bitcoin corporate treasury model in 2020, Strategy became the largest corporate holder of BTC. It is also often seen as a proxy investment by institutions unable to hold the asset directly and by retail investors unwilling to self-custody. The company’s stash now surpasses the combined holdings of the next ten largest Bitcoin treasury firms. Saylor seems unfazed by the emergence of altcoin treasury companies, mostly due to the fact that the overwhelming majority of capital continues to flow into Bitcoin. He pointed out that the number of firms adopting Bitcoin on their balance sheets surged from about 60 to 160 in just six months, which is a sign of growing institutional adoption. The pace of Strategy’s accumulation accelerated dramatically since Donald Trump’s election in November of 2024. In only nine months, the company bought 376,726 BTC, compared to the four years it previously took to amass 252,220 BTC.

A significant announcement from South Korean crypto exchange Upbit requires your immediate attention. Upbit has confirmed a temporary Upbit INJ suspension of deposits and withdrawals for Injective (INJ) tokens. This crucial update, effective from 03:00 UTC on August 19, is directly linked to an upcoming Injective network upgrade. Understanding the implications of this suspension is vital for managing your assets effectively. What is the Upbit INJ Suspension All About? Upbit, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, recently made an official announcement regarding its support for the Injective network’s forthcoming upgrade. Consequently, the exchange will halt all deposit and withdrawal services for INJ tokens. This temporary Upbit INJ suspension ensures the safety and integrity of user funds during the upgrade process. When: The suspension begins promptly at 03:00 UTC on August 19. What: Both deposits and withdrawals of Injective (INJ) tokens will be affected. Why: It is in direct support of the Injective network’s essential upgrade. Such suspensions are standard practice in the crypto world. Exchanges implement them to prevent potential issues, such as lost transactions or discrepancies, that might arise during significant network overhauls. Therefore, this proactive step by Upbit aims to protect its users and ensure a smooth transition for the Injective blockchain. Why is This Upbit INJ Suspension Happening? The core reason behind this particular Upbit INJ suspension is the planned upgrade of the Injective network itself. Blockchain networks periodically undergo upgrades to enhance their performance, security, and functionality. These upgrades can involve significant changes to the underlying protocol, which necessitate a temporary halt in transaction processing on integrated platforms like exchanges. Injective is a powerful blockchain built for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. It aims to provide a robust infrastructure for various financial markets. Therefore, continuous development and upgrades are crucial for its long-term viability and competitiveness. Upbit’s decision to support this upgrade by suspending INJ services demonstrates its commitment to the ecosystem’s health. Users should understand that this is not an unusual event. Many exchanges pause services for specific tokens when their underlying networks are undergoing maintenance or significant protocol changes. It is a protective measure designed to safeguard user assets and ensure compatibility post-upgrade. What Should Injective (INJ) Holders Do Regarding the Upbit INJ Suspension? If you hold Injective (INJ) tokens on Upbit, or if you plan to deposit or withdraw them around the suspension date, you must take immediate action. Here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw INJ tokens from Upbit, complete these transactions well before the August 19, 03:00 UTC deadline. Monitor Official Announcements: Keep a close eye on Upbit’s official website and announcement channels. They will provide updates on when services are expected to resume. Alternative Holdings: Consider if holding your INJ on Upbit during the suspension period aligns with your trading or investment strategy. For long-term holders, this might have minimal impact. Remember, the exact duration of the suspension is usually dependent on the completion of the network upgrade. Upbit will notify users once the upgrade is successfully implemented and services are restored. Patience and proactive monitoring are key during such periods. Impact of the Upbit INJ Suspension on Trading While deposits and withdrawals are suspended, trading of INJ tokens on Upbit typically continues unaffected. This means you can still buy, sell, and trade INJ against other cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange. However, the inability to move tokens in or out of the exchange might affect liquidity and price dynamics for some traders. For instance, traders relying on arbitrage opportunities between Upbit and other exchanges might find their strategies temporarily limited. Moreover, any significant news related to the Injective network upgrade could influence INJ’s price during the suspension period. It is always wise to stay informed about both exchange announcements and network developments. The temporary nature of the Upbit INJ suspension suggests that its long-term impact on the token’s price or trading volume should be minimal, provided the network upgrade proceeds smoothly and services resume as expected. Looking Ahead: The Future of Injective and Upbit The Injective network upgrade, facilitated by the Upbit INJ suspension , signifies a positive step forward for the Injective ecosystem. Upgrades are essential for blockchain networks to remain competitive, scalable, and secure. They often introduce new features, improve efficiency, or patch vulnerabilities, ultimately benefiting users in the long run. Upbit’s consistent support for network upgrades underscores its role as a responsible and user-focused exchange. By ensuring a secure environment during these crucial technical transitions, Upbit helps maintain trust and stability within the broader crypto market. As the Injective network evolves, its utility and adoption are likely to grow, potentially benefiting INJ holders. In conclusion, while the temporary suspension of INJ deposits and withdrawals on Upbit might require minor adjustments for some users, it is a necessary and beneficial measure. It paves the way for a stronger, more efficient Injective network, ultimately contributing to the robustness of the decentralized finance landscape. Stay informed, plan accordingly, and look forward to the enhanced capabilities of Injective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How long will the Upbit INJ suspension last? A1: The exact duration depends on the completion of the Injective network upgrade. Upbit will issue a new announcement once services are restored. Q2: Can I still trade INJ on Upbit during the suspension? A2: Yes, typically, trading of INJ tokens on Upbit will continue as normal. Only deposits and withdrawals are affected by the suspension. Q3: Why is Upbit suspending INJ deposits and withdrawals? A3: Upbit is suspending these services to support the upcoming Injective network upgrade, ensuring the security and integrity of user funds during the process. Q4: What is the Injective network upgrade? A4: The Injective network upgrade refers to planned enhancements and changes to the Injective blockchain’s underlying protocol, aimed at improving its performance, security, and functionality. Q5: Where can I find updates on the Upbit INJ suspension? A5: Always refer to Upbit’s official website and announcement channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the suspension and its resumption.

At this point, Bitcoin has fallen by over 2% in the last 24 hours, dropping to $115,600. Bitcoin's decline also affected altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH), which had come close to breaking its previous ATH, falling 3% to $4,340, and XRP dropping 4% to $3. Other altcoins also experienced significant declines, with analysts weighing in on the decline and sharing their expectations. What Do Investors Await for Bitcoin? Speaking to The Block, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu stated that the decline was due to US data and declining investor confidence. “Bitcoin's recent decline is due to higher-than-expected US inflation and investor behavior that prefers to act cautiously in this environment. Higher inflation is dampening hopes of a Fed rate cut next month, strengthening the dollar and fueling risk aversion. Liu said that US Treasury Secretary Scott's statement that the government would not purchase new Bitcoin for its strategic reserves further eroded investor confidence and fueled the decline. Liu stated that investors are withdrawing from the cryptocurrency market amidst the negative macroeconomic environment, adding that investors are waiting for a new catalyst and improvement on the FED and macroeconomic front before coming back to crypto. What are the Critical Levels in Bitcoin? Is the Situation So Bad? However, BTC Markets Crypto Analyst Rachael Lucas said that the situation is not all bad for Bitcoin and crypto, and that spot ETF data suggests that the market decline is related to capital rotation rather than a collapse. “While daily spot Bitcoin ETF flows have declined modestly overall, institutional participation remains at a moderate level. This shows that investors are turning to lower-cost products rather than exiting the market completely.” Lucas stated that the key support levels for Bitcoin are the $115,000 and $112,500 regions, and that a break below these levels could pose a risk of a drop to $110,000. Finally, Lucas noted that the market's focus is on the Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium this week, adding that a moderate tone from the Fed could revitalize risk appetite and initiate an uptrend. *This is not investment advice.

The names that tanked, Concorde International, Ostin Technology, Top KingWin, Skyline Builders, Everbright Digital, Park Ha Biological Technology, and Pheton Holdings, had all exploded in price shortly before the collapse. The trigger was an aggressive promotion on WhatsApp and social media, followed by coordinated dumping. According to the Financial Times, the seven companies together lost a total of $3.7 billion in market value. Every one of them had been promoted online in group chats that looked like legit investment forums. None of the companies were proven to have taken part in the manipulation, but analysts pointed to clear signs of pump-and-dump activity, the kind of scam that lures in retail traders, then leaves them holding worthless stocks while the organizers walk away with profits. Victims dumped after fake brokers hijack chats The FBI said complaints involving “ramp and dump stock fraud” tripled year-over-year. Investigators say scammers are now posing as legit firms or analysts to build trust on platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, before dropping links to groups that pitch cheap Chinese stocks as can’t-miss bets. This has been tied to the surge in Chinese IPOs on US exchanges, especially in the microcap market, which has been flooded since last year by small firms from China and Hong Kong. Among those hit was Tia Castagno, a coach based in London, who lost all her savings after she joined a WhatsApp group following a Facebook ad. The group’s admins claimed they were a US investment firm. Tia was told to buy Ostin Technology, which then crashed. “There’s a feeling of emptiness in my stomach, and shame,” she said. “I keep questioning my judgment and remembering how I felt when the rug was pulled from under my feet.” Ryan Sweetnam, a lawyer at Cel Solicitors in the UK, said he’s representing “more than a hundred clients” who fell into similar traps involving Chinese penny stocks. One of those clients, a European investor, told the Financial Times they lost over $100,000 on Pheton Holdings. That investor joined a WhatsApp group that used a fake endorsement from a well-known US TV personality. “They asked if I was AI-bot early on… a good ruse. It looked like a kosher operation,” they said. “I almost fell off my chair [when the stock was dumped].” Noushin Mirshokraei, who owns a food and drinks business in Italy, said she lost $70,000 after being convinced on WhatsApp to buy Ostin ahead of a supposed partnership with a big US firm. “All the information that was given to us on WhatsApp groups was from fake participants,” she said. “The only real people in there were the ones being manipulated.” Warnings ignored as price crashes continue Matthew Michel, head of InvestorLink, has been raising the alarm for months. He said his team has flagged suspicious activity around microcap stocks every week for the past seven months. On June 9, Michel warned about Ostin, two weeks before the stock lost 94% in a single day. He also spotted red flags on Pheton three weeks before it tanked 95% in one session. One Wall Street trading firm, which uses InvestorLink’s tools and asked not to be named, has also reported concerns to Nasdaq and the SEC, saying some of these stocks were showing signs of manipulation. Michel’s breakdown of Ostin’s moves showed 12 Reddit accounts promoting the stock in the same two-hour window. He said three of the users were geolocated to Russia and Iran, which matches what his team has seen in other stock scams. Meta, which owns Facebook and WhatsApp, said it doesn’t want scam content on its platforms and claimed it’s working on better tools to catch it, including on-platform warnings, tech upgrades, and partnerships with banks and governments. On June 17, Regencell Bioscience, a Chinese herbal medicine firm, saw its shares jump 60,000% for the year, hitting a market cap of $38 billion, higher than Walgreens or Jefferies. That’s despite the company that reported a $4.4 million loss in 2024 when its stock dropped 83%. The pattern follows the same playbook: hype, spike, crash.

This move signifies a growing acceptance and strategic interest in the digital asset space by major institutional players. It’s a clear signal that traditional finance is taking cryptocurrency-related investments seriously, potentially paving the way for more mainstream adoption. What Are South Korea’s Pension Fund Crypto Stock Holdings? South Korea’s National Pension Service (NPS), one of the largest pension funds globally, significantly boosted its investments in companies linked to the cryptocurrency sector. Digital Asset reported a remarkable 182% increase in their crypto stock holdings this year, reaching approximately 770 billion won, which translates to a substantial $556.7 million. At the close of the second quarter, the fund held considerable positions in several key players within the crypto ecosystem. These included: Strategy: Their holdings in this firm saw the most significant surge, climbing by 226% in the first half of the year to $204.98 million. Coinbase: A prominent cryptocurrency exchange. Block (formerly Square): A financial technology company with a strong interest in Bitcoin. Robinhood: A popular trading platform that offers crypto trading. The total value of these specific holdings amounted to $552.89 million, highlighting a targeted investment strategy within the digital asset market. Why Is This Increase in Crypto Stock Holdings Significant? When a national pension fund, managing assets for millions of citizens, makes such a substantial move, it sends a powerful message. This isn’t speculative retail trading; it’s a calculated decision by a sophisticated institutional investor. The increase in their crypto stock holdings suggests a belief in the long-term potential and viability of the underlying technology and business models of these crypto-related companies. Such investments can lead to several positive outcomes: Legitimization: It further legitimizes the cryptocurrency industry in the eyes of traditional finance and regulators. Capital Inflow: It directs significant capital into companies that are building infrastructure and services for the digital economy. Diversification: Pension funds often seek diversification to manage risk and enhance returns. Crypto-related stocks can offer a new avenue for growth. This strategic allocation by the NPS could influence other large institutional investors to explore similar opportunities, thereby increasing overall market stability and liquidity. What Are the Implications of Growing Crypto Stock Holdings? The decision by South Korea’s NPS to expand its crypto stock holdings carries broad implications for both the crypto market and global institutional investment trends. It signals a shift from a niche interest to a more integrated part of diversified portfolios. However, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. Benefits: Increased Trust: Greater institutional participation can build trust among individual investors. Market Maturity: It encourages greater scrutiny and potentially better governance within the crypto sector. Innovation: More capital means more resources for research and development in blockchain technology. Challenges: Volatility: Crypto-related stocks can still be subject to the inherent volatility of the underlying digital assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential risks. Public Scrutiny: Pension funds face intense public scrutiny regarding their investment choices, especially in newer asset classes. Despite these challenges, the significant increase in crypto stock holdings by South Korea’s NPS indicates a strong conviction in the long-term trajectory of the digital asset economy. This bold move by South Korea’s National Pension Service to significantly boost its crypto stock holdings is a landmark event. It underscores the growing confidence of major institutional investors in the future of the digital asset space. As more traditional financial entities explore and commit to crypto-related investments, we can anticipate a continued maturation and integration of this dynamic sector into the broader global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the National Pension Service (NPS) of South Korea? A1: The National Pension Service (NPS) is South Korea’s public pension fund, established to provide social security benefits to its citizens. It is one of the largest pension funds globally, managing vast assets for retirement and other social welfare purposes. Q2: Why are pension funds investing in crypto-related stocks? A2: Pension funds invest in crypto-related stocks for several strategic reasons, including portfolio diversification, seeking higher growth potential compared to traditional assets, and gaining exposure to the rapidly expanding digital economy and blockchain technology. Q3: Which specific companies did the NPS invest in? A3: As of the second quarter, the NPS held positions in Strategy, Coinbase, Block (formerly Square), and Robinhood. Strategy saw the largest increase in their holdings. Q4: Does this mean the NPS is directly buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? A4: No, the article states the NPS boosted its “cryptocurrency-related stock holdings.” This means they are investing in the shares of companies that operate within or are closely tied to the cryptocurrency industry, rather than directly purchasing cryptocurrencies themselves. Q5: What are the potential risks for pension funds investing in crypto-related stocks? A5: Potential risks include the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, evolving and uncertain regulatory landscapes, and the general market risks associated with equity investments. Pension funds must balance these risks with potential returns. Did you find this insight into South Korea’s growing crypto stock holdings fascinating?

At the time of writing, DOGE traded at over 22 cents, representing a 4% decline on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency chalked out a bullish golden crossover last week, but the bullish pattern failed to inspire bullish momentum. Early Monday, the AI-focused blockchain project Qubic announced the community's intention to target Dogecoin on X , stating, ""There are ongoing discussions about $DOGE and preparation will take time."" It added that ""questions around blockchain resilience are being raised and we may have tools to address them."" Sergey Ivancheglo, the founder of the Qubic network, sought a community vote on which application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-enabled proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain should be targeted with a 51% attack. From a list that included Kaspa and Zcash, the community overwhelmingly voted for DOGE. “The Qubic community has chosen Dogecoin,” Ivancheglo, announced on X via his handle Come-from-Beyond. Qubic recently launched a successful 51% attack on Monero , gaining majority control over the computing power used to secure the privacy network. DOGE leads CVD decline DOGE's futures open-interest-adjusted cumulative volume delta (CVD) indicator has dropped nearly 1% in the past 24 hours, the largest among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market value, according to data source Velo. CVD, or Cumulative Volume Delta, is a technical indicator that measures the net buying or selling pressure in a market over a specific period. It is a running total of the difference between buying and selling volume. A negative CVD indicates that selling pressure is more substantial than buying pressure. This means that a greater number of market participants are selling a particular asset than buying it. It is often seen as a bearish signal, suggesting that the price is likely to drop or continue its decline. Most cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH, have a similar bearish profile. Meanwhile, LINK is the only token, boasting a positive CVD. BTC Drops below $116K Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell nearly to $115,000 early Monday, extending the decline from Thursday's record high of over $124,000. The decline follows a hotter-than-expected U.S. producer price inflation on Friday, which weakened the case for a 50-basis-point Fed rate cut in September. That said, the central bank is still expected to reduce the borrowing cost by 25 basis points. ""Given the persistent uncertainty surrounding key economic indicators, the Federal Reserve has thus far maintained a cautious stance on interest rate cuts. The recent U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) for July doesn’t make that any easier,"" analysts at Coinbase Institutional said in a weekly report. ""Nevertheless, we see this as an opportunity. We think the Fed's eventual focus on the broader economic picture, including the labor market, will ultimately lead to 25 bps rate cuts in September and October,"" analysts added. Some observers expect the Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lay the groundwork for the September move during this speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week.

There was a break below a key rising channel with support at $0.2295 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh upward move if it stays above the $0.2165 zone. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh increase above the $0.240 resistance zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE even spiked above $0.2420 before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $0.2430 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $0.240 and $0.2350 levels. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2163 swing low to the $0.2430 high. Besides, there was a break below a key rising channel with support at $0.2295 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.2320 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. The bulls are now protecting the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2163 swing low to the $0.2430 high. If there is a recovery wave, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2295 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2320 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2420 level. A close above the $0.2420 resistance might send the price toward the $0.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2650 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2780. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2320 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2220 level. The next major support is near the $0.2165 level. The main support sits at $0.2150. If there is a downside break below the $0.2150 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.2050 level or even $0.2020 in the near term.

Built on Ethereum Layer 2, $LBRETT combines meme appeal with real DeFi utility, giving it an edge over tokens that rely only on hype. With ultra-low gas fees, staking rewards, and fast-growing community support, it is already drawing comparisons to Dogecoin and PEPE, but with stronger fundamentals to back its rise. Dogecoin price performance: Traders eye next move Dogecoin has shown classic boom-and-cool patterns this year. In April, it sat below $0.20 before a surge in early May carried it past $0.36. That rally didn’t last long, with the price retracing back toward the $0.22 zone. A second push in July reached $0.28, but once again, sellers stepped in, pulling DOGE lower. Source: Sosovalue Right now, Dogecoin is trading around $0.22–$0.23, consolidating after those swings. The moving averages suggest the coin is holding its ground, but the history of quick retracements is making traders cautious. Many are watching closely to see if DOGE can build enough momentum to retest $0.28 or even project toward $0.30. The hesitation lies in the same pattern that made Dogecoin famous: rapid climbs followed by sharp pullbacks. If buyers can sustain volume, the next leg up looks possible. If not, another retracement may keep the coin range-bound for longer. Can Pepe bulls overcome the next retracement? Pepe coin has followed a similar path to other meme tokens: big bursts upward followed by quick retracements. In early May, PEPE spiked above 0.00000160 before sellers took profits, dragging the price back down. Another wave in July pushed it near 0.00000140, but momentum faded once more, sending it lower into consolidation. Source: Sosovalue As of mid-August, PEPE is holding close to 0.00000110, moving sideways with lower volatility. This stabilization is positive for long-term holders, but the history of retracements after each rally makes traders cautious. The big question is whether PEPE can project higher toward 0.00000140 again or even retest the 0.00000160 zone, or if another retracement will trap it back under 0.00000100. Volume spikes on rallies show that enthusiasm still exists, but the repeated pullbacks highlight how fragile momentum can be. Many traders are waiting for a clean breakout before committing heavily. Why Layer Brett could be the meme coin that lasts Most meme coins ride hype until the buzz fades. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is working differently. Ethereum Layer 1 often slows down during peak demand, and fees can spike to painful levels. By moving activity to Layer 2, $LBRETT keeps transactions cheap and quick. That makes trading easier for everyday users, not just whales. It delivers the performance traders expect while still keeping the viral energy that makes memes thrive. $LBRETT combines early staking rewards with an affordable entry point. New holders can grow their stack while the project gains traction, making it a strong contender for anyone looking at the best meme coin to buy heading into 2025. The presale is live, and early participants are securing positions before major listings. This early access gives them an advantage that latecomers will miss. Some key highlights driving $LBRETT momentum include: Sub-second trades with near-zero gas costs Early staking payouts that outpace most projects Multi-crypto purchase support, not limited to one token A framework balancing meme appeal with real DeFi mechanics At its core, $LBRETT is a community-first project. It draws power from meme culture but anchors it in solid technology. That blend of humor, culture, and performance is why it’s gaining traction as one of the best meme coins to buy in discussions this year. With the bull run heating up, many see $LBRETT not only as a fun play but also as the best meme coin to buy in 2025 for long-term upside. $LBRETT presale at perfect entry point The best meme coin to buy in 2025 might not be Dogecoin or Pepe, but Layer Brett . With its presale price locked at just $0.0042 currently, early backers see a perfect entry point. Traders are piling in, betting $LBRETT’s mix of utility and meme power could outshine them all. Don’t miss the $LBRETT presale now before it leaves Dogecoin and Pepe behind.

One of the most telling indicators for Bitcoin’s immediate future is the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio. This metric gives us a powerful snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves on major exchanges, revealing whether the crowd leans bullish (long) or bearish (short) on Bitcoin’s price movements. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios What exactly are long-short ratios, and why do they matter for BTC perpetual futures ? Simply put, these ratios compare the number of long positions (bets that the price will go up) to short positions (bets that the price will go down) on a specific asset, in this case, Bitcoin. A perpetual future is a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, making it a popular instrument for continuous trading. When the long percentage is higher, it suggests a generally optimistic market sentiment. Conversely, a higher short percentage indicates a more pessimistic or cautious outlook among traders. This data provides a unique lens through which we can observe the collective mood of the market participants, offering valuable context for your trading strategies. Decoding the Latest BTC Perpetual Futures Data Let’s dive into the most recent 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures across leading cryptocurrency exchanges.

Leveraging BTC Perpetual Futures Insights for Trading How can you use this information about BTC perpetual futures ratios to your advantage? While these ratios are not a standalone predictor of price, they are a powerful tool when combined with other analyses.

Consider factors like funding rates, open interest, and macroeconomic news alongside these sentiment indicators.

The current data points to a prevailing bearish outlook across major exchanges, with a slight majority of traders anticipating a price decline.

Key Takeaways: Crypto influencer Charles O. Parks III was sentenced to one year and a day for a $3.5M cloud cryptojacking scheme. He mined nearly $1M in ETH, LTC, and XMR using stolen computing power. Parks forfeited $500K and a Mercedes-Benz after pleading guilty to wire fraud. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Friday that Charles O. Parks III, known online as “CP3O,” used fake corporate identities such as “MultiMillionaire LLC” and “CP3O LLC” to trick cloud service providers into granting him elevated access. Between January and August 2021, he secretly mined nearly $1 million worth of Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Monero (XMR) using the stolen computing power. Crypto Influencer Avoids 50-Year Sentence, Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud Parks pleaded guilty to wire fraud in December. Initially, he also faced charges of money laundering and unlawful transactions that carried a maximum sentence of up to 50 years. “Charles Parks manipulated technology, stole millions in computer resources, and illegally mined cryptocurrency — and today’s sentencing holds him fully accountable,” said New York City Police Department commissioner Jessica S. Tisch. According to prosecutors, Parks told one cloud provider he was building an online training company focused on media, technology, and business strategy, claiming it would serve 10,000 students. “In reality, there was no training company, and there were no students,” the DOJ said. Instead, the resources were directed toward crypto mining operations. When providers raised concerns about unusual usage patterns and unpaid balances, Parks deflected questions while continuing to exploit the systems. Today the US Attorney's Office, Eastern Dist. of NY unsealed an indictment charging Charles O. Parks III a.k.a. ""CP3O"", with operating a large-scale illegal cryptojacking op He defrauded cloud comp. services out of $3.5mil+ worth of computing resources to mine crypto worth $1mil pic.twitter.com/geXt5BKax6 — jerbz (@JerbztheGreat) April 16, 2024 Prosecutors said Parks laundered the mined crypto through exchanges, an NFT marketplace, payment processors, and banks, converting it into cash to fund a luxury lifestyle. Purchases included a Mercedes-Benz, jewelry, and first-class travel. An April 2024 indictment revealed that Parks had accounts with a subsidiary of a Seattle-based cloud and electronics company and a Redmond-based computing firm, both of which were defrauded. As part of his sentence, Parks was ordered to forfeit $500,000 and his Mercedes-Benz, with restitution to be determined later. Prosecutors said Parks attempted to leverage his illicit gains to build credibility as a crypto influencer. He posted content online promoting a “MultiMillionaire Mentality” and ran a coaching platform offering self-improvement subscriptions for $10 per month, with one-on-one consulting for $150 — payable in his own token. Investor Loses $3M in Crypto Phishing Scam As reported, a cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to a phishing scam , losing $3.05 million in Tether (USDT) after unknowingly signing a malicious blockchain transaction. The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders. The attacker exploited a common habit among crypto users: validating only the first and last few characters of a wallet address while ignoring the middle. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.

However, they started to trade lower on Monday morning. This week could see more volatility ahead as all eyes will be on the outcome of US President Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky’s meeting on Monday. Trump issued a statement just hours before he was set to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart, saying that Zelensky “can end the war with Russia almost immediately if he wants to.” A cessation of conflict between the two nations would boost investor confidence across all asset markets. Economic Events August 18 to 22 Thursday will see two purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reports released. The August S&P Global Manufacturing PMI and Services PMI indices are leading economic indicators used to gain timely insights into changing conditions. There is also some existing home sales data released on Thursday, but real estate reports have very little impact on risk-on asset markets. Last week’s mixed inflation and consumer data refueled uncertainty into the Fed policy outlook; therefore, Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday is expected to instantly influence markets. A dovish tone could boost markets and riskier investments such as crypto. In contrast, a hawkish stance that highlights inflation risks could trigger sharp corrections and volatility. “Odds are that he will be more of an owl, waiting and watching, than either a hawk or a dove. In other words, he’ll say that a Fed rate cut is possible at the September meeting, but the Fed’s decisions are data-dependent,” stated Yardeni Research. Key Events This Week: 1. Zelensky Meets With Trump In US – Monday 2. July Fed Meeting Minutes – Wednesday 3. August S&P Manufacturing PMI data – Thursday 4. August S&P Composite PMI data – Thursday 5. July Existing Home Sales data – Thursday 6. Fed Chair Powell Speaks -… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 17, 2025 Investors expect the central bank to resume rate cuts in September, after holding off for months, and current futures markets predict an 84.6% probability of a cut to 4.0 to 4.25%. Crypto Market Outlook Digital asset markers have taken a dive this Monday morning in Asia, with total capitalization dropping back to the $4 trillion level, down almost 6% from last week’s all-time high. Bitcoin was leading losses with a fall to $115,000 on Monday morning as it shed 2.5%. The asset is now 6.9% down from its peak price last week as the correction deepens. Ethereum was also heading south, dropping to its lowest point for a week at $4,345, still 10% away from its 2021 all-time high. Altcoins were mixed with losses for XRP , Solana, Hyperliquid, and Sui while Chainlink and Monero bucked the trend.

The company recently revealed its substantial Dunamu crypto assets , totaling an impressive $1.87 billion at the close of the first half of the year. This disclosure provides a rare glimpse into the financial muscle of one of Asia’s leading cryptocurrency platforms. What Are Dunamu’s Impressive Crypto Assets? According to a corporate filing cited by local outlet TechM, Dunamu holds approximately 2.6 trillion won in digital assets. This massive portfolio primarily consists of key cryptocurrencies, showcasing a strategic allocation of their holdings. 16,879 BTC: Valued at around $1.8 billion, this Bitcoin holding alone accounts for the vast majority of their digital wealth. It underscores Bitcoin’s enduring status as a primary store of value for major entities. 10,575 ETH: Worth about $25.4 million, demonstrating a diversified approach beyond just Bitcoin. Ethereum’s role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem makes it a crucial asset. 10.18 million USDT: A significant stablecoin holding, likely used for operational liquidity and managing market volatility. These figures highlight the sheer scale of Dunamu crypto assets and their strategic allocation across different digital currencies. The dominance of Bitcoin in their portfolio is particularly noteworthy, reflecting a strong belief in its long-term value. How Did Dunamu Accumulate These Significant Holdings? It is widely believed that Dunamu has systematically built up its considerable digital asset reserves through fees generated from its robust crypto trading operations. As one of South Korea’s leading exchanges, Upbit processes a tremendous volume of transactions daily. Every trade executed on the platform typically incurs a small fee. When aggregated, these fees can result in substantial earnings over time. This operational model allows exchanges like Upbit to accumulate significant amounts of various cryptocurrencies directly from user activity. Therefore, the impressive volume of Dunamu crypto assets is a direct reflection of Upbit’s market dominance and trading activity. Their strong market position in the Korean digital asset landscape provides a consistent and powerful stream of revenue, enabling them to reinvest or strategically hold these digital currencies. This accumulation strategy strengthens their financial reserves and operational capacity. Why Do Dunamu Crypto Assets Matter for the Market? The disclosure of such large Dunamu crypto assets is crucial for several reasons, impacting both market participants and the broader regulatory environment. Firstly, it significantly enhances transparency within the often-opaque cryptocurrency ecosystem. Offering investors a clearer picture of the financial health and holdings of major exchange operators like Dunamu can foster greater confidence. This level of openness can build stronger trust among users, regulators, and institutional investors alike. Moreover, the sheer volume of assets held by a single entity can have broader implications for market stability. Dunamu’s strategic management of these holdings could potentially influence liquidity and price movements, particularly within the dynamic Korean crypto market. Such disclosures also align with growing global regulatory demands for greater accountability and financial oversight from cryptocurrency firms. The Future Outlook for Dunamu’s Crypto Holdings Looking ahead, the management and growth of Dunamu crypto assets will remain a key focus for the company and an area of interest for the wider market. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rapid evolution, so too will the strategies employed by major players like Dunamu. They face ongoing challenges, including inherent market volatility, the ever-changing global regulatory landscapes, and increasing competition from both domestic and international platforms. However, Dunamu’s strong financial position, significantly backed by its substantial digital asset holdings, places it in a robust position to navigate these complexities. For users and investors, understanding these public disclosures can provide valuable insights into the financial stability and long-term viability of the platforms they choose to use for their own digital asset transactions. Dunamu’s recent disclosure of its impressive $1.87 billion in crypto assets underscores the immense growth and financial strength of leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This transparency not only reinforces trust within the digital asset space but also highlights the significant role these platforms play in the global digital economy. As the industry matures, such revelations will become increasingly vital for fostering a secure, credible, and well-regulated crypto environment for everyone involved.

Just when ETH was expected to break its 2021 ATH, it was postponed to another spring again as macro data from the US negatively affected the market. However, an analysis revealed that Ethereum's bullish outlook is strengthening due to supply shortages. Japan-based XWIN Research said that Ethereum's supply has been shrinking in the face of increasing demand recently, and as the supply has shrunk, ETH has entered a period of strong growth. Stating that a large amount of ETH has been withdrawn from exchanges, the analysis company said that ETH balances on exchanges have decreased sharply since the end of July. Analysts noted that daily exchange withdrawals have repeatedly exceeded 100,000 ETH, with the largest withdrawal being 92,899 ETH ($412 million), withdrawn from Kraken about a week ago. In addition, analysts pointed out that spot ETH ETFs recorded a record weekly inflow of $2.85 billion, and said that all these factors support the strong bull case for ETH. “With a large amount of ETH being withdrawn from exchanges, ETF and institutional buying pressure is increasing significantly. Ethereum is in short supply, with the current exchange balance only around 18.4 million. As a result, the supply of Ethereum is gradually shrinking due to decreasing exchange supply and increasing institutional demand. If this trend in Ethereum continues, there is a high probability that a strong supply shortage-fueled bull market will emerge towards the end of the year.” Coinbase Head of Research David Duong also stated that the outlook for Ethereum is positive. He noted that current data suggests that demand for Ethereum remains strong, and that ETH treasury companies are driving demand. At this point, Duong noted that since the beginning of August, DATs have purchased a total of 795,000 ETH (worth approximately $3.6 billion), securing 2% of the total supply. Finally, Duong emphasized that these companies may continue to make additional large-scale Ethereum purchases and contribute to the rise. *This is not investment advice.

Analyst Ali Martinez tracks a triangle breakout with ADA, aiming for a technical target near $1.10. Dan Gambardello sees $1.25 as a crucial resistance that could confirm a broader bullish trend. ADA Futures Volume Jumps to Multi-Month High Cardano (ADA) futures trading saw a sharp increase on August 14, with volume reaching $6.96 billion across exchanges. This is the highest level recorded since March 2025, based on data from Glassnode.

The sudden jump reflects growing attention from traders, especially in the derivatives market. Analyst Ali Martinez posted, “Cardano $ADA futures volume hit $6.96 billion, the highest level in 5 months!” Price Moves Toward $1.10 After Breakout ADA’s price was trading near $0.93 at press time, following a 12% gain over the last week. The asset dropped 3% in the last 24 hours, but remains higher than it was earlier this month. On August 17, ADA hit $0.98, moving above a key trendline after several days of consolidation. Notably, the breakout has formed just as futures volume increased sharply. A chart shared by Martinez shows the price moving above the upper boundary of the triangle, which can often act as a short-term continuation signal. The asset is now testing resistance near $1.00, a round-number level that may slow further movement unless buying pressure builds.

Data from Market Prophit shows both trader sentiment and model-based sentiment as “bullish.” This shift has come as ADA approaches a zone that has acted as a ceiling in previous rallies. Analyst Dan Gambardello referred to $1.25 as a level that could confirm a broader uptrend. He described it as the top of a range that “would be a very important bull market indicator for Cardano.” A chart he shared highlights the zone between $1.00 and $1.25 as a barrier that ADA must clear to move higher. Institutional Activity Adds to Market Focus Grayscale recently formed a trust for ADA in Delaware. This step has led to new speculation around a possible spot Cardano ETF, although no official application has been made. Meanwhile, this move has added to the focus on ADA as the price approaches long-watched resistance. Traders now look to see if the current momentum can carry it through the $1.10–$1.25 range, which could open the door to further gains.

As a result, the bears seem to be reclaiming control once again, with sellers dominating the market. While expectations for another sharp recovery abound, crypto analyst Melikatrader has outlined two possible scenarios for the pioneer cryptocurrency, with both ending in bearish reversals toward established local peaks. Lower Trendline Break Points To Bearish Developments The analysis highlights the two possible directions that the Bitcoin price could be headed in after the fall from its new all-time highs. Both scenarios start out with a bullish push upward, and then a bearish decline. However, with each one, there is a different possible peak before resistance kicks in. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Market To Crash? Analyst’s August-September Prediction In both cases, the first trigger is the fact that the Bitcoin price had broken out of the lower trendline of the channel. This comes after it had initially broken the ascending channel that it had been trading inside of, with the result being higher highs and higher lows. Thus, the break below the trendline means that bearish pressure is beginning to dominate. With the bearish pressure mounting and sellers taking control, there are now two ways that the price could go. The first of these is that it continues to rally and then gets rejected above the $118,000 level. This is a supply zone, where sellers could unload massive amounts of BTC into the market and beat back the price. In the second scenario, the price does continue to rally even after hitting the first supply zone. This takes it into the next supply zone just below $120,000, which is currently sitting at $19,700. However, the end remains the same as that of the first scenario, where sellers are likely to dump and send the Bitcoin price plummeting again. How Low Can The Bitcoin Price Go? As the analyst highlights, the peak of both scenarios aligns with retracement levels where sellers could be waiting to dump. Given this, they both have a similar bottom after crashing. From here, the downside target for both scenarios is placed at the $115,800 target. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Be Headed To New All-Time Highs Due To These Factors This is because this is where previous demand and support had been during the previous retracement/correction. Given this, it is likely that buyers are likely to step back in at this level, making it a possible bottom and the launch point for the next rally.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading around $114,918 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden shift has caught many investors off guard, prompting urgent questions about market stability and future trends. What does this immediate decline mean for the broader crypto landscape, and how should participants react? What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces behind such a rapid movement is essential for any crypto enthusiast. Several factors often contribute to a notable Bitcoin price drop . While no single cause is definitively pinpointed at this moment, market analysts are closely watching for patterns and potential catalysts that could have led to this recent downturn. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Large sell-offs by institutional investors or “whales” – individuals or entities holding massive amounts of Bitcoin – can trigger a cascade effect, leading to rapid price declines. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news, such as inflation reports, interest rate changes by central banks, or global geopolitical events, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes. When traditional markets show weakness, riskier assets like Bitcoin often feel the impact. Technical Resistance: BTC may have hit a strong technical resistance level on its charts, a point where selling pressure typically increases. This often leads to profit-taking by traders, initiating a correction. Liquidation Events: In highly leveraged markets, a minor price dip can trigger a chain reaction of liquidations. This forces traders to sell their positions, adding further selling pressure and accelerating the Bitcoin price drop . This recent downturn highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where rapid changes are a constant part of the journey. However, it’s crucial to remember that market corrections are also a normal part of asset cycles. Navigating the Volatility: How Should Investors React to a Bitcoin Price Drop? When the market experiences a Bitcoin price drop , it’s natural for investors to feel a mix of concern and opportunity. Panic selling often leads to regret, especially in a market with a history of strong recoveries. Instead, a measured and informed approach is always advisable during such periods. Consider these actionable insights to navigate the current market conditions: Stay Informed and Verify: Always keep an eye on reliable news sources and professional market analyses. Avoid reacting impulsively to unverified rumors or social media hype. Accurate information empowers better decisions. Review Your Portfolio and Goals: Take this opportunity to assess your risk tolerance and long-term investment goals. Does this dip align with your original strategy? Re-evaluate if your initial reasons for investing in Bitcoin still hold true. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Many seasoned investors employ the Dollar-Cost Averaging strategy during dips. This involves buying smaller, fixed amounts of Bitcoin regularly, regardless of its price. Over time, this averages out your purchase price and can mitigate the impact of volatility. Avoid Emotional Decisions: The crypto market can be a rollercoaster of emotions. Making decisions based purely on fear or greed can be detrimental to your financial health. Stick to your pre-defined investment plan and avoid impulsive actions. Consider Long-Term Holding (HODLing): For those with a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future, holding through market downturns has historically proven to be a viable strategy. This approach focuses on Bitcoin’s long-term potential rather than short-term fluctuations. This is a moment for strategic thinking and disciplined execution, not impulsive reactions. Understanding your personal financial situation and goals is paramount. Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Sign of Deeper Trouble for BTC? A Bitcoin price drop below a significant psychological level like $115,000 can certainly raise alarms and lead to speculation about its future. However, it’s crucial to put such movements into a broader historical and fundamental perspective. Bitcoin has a well-documented history of experiencing significant corrections, only to recover stronger and reach new all-time highs. Historical Context of Resilience: Bitcoin has weathered numerous market downturns, including much more severe ones than this, demonstrating its remarkable resilience and long-term growth trajectory. These dips are often seen as part of its natural market cycles. Underlying Fundamentals Remain Strong: Despite price fluctuations, the core technology of Bitcoin – its decentralized nature, limited supply, and robust network security – remains unchanged. Increasing institutional interest, growing utility through layers like the Lightning Network, and expanding global adoption continue to strengthen its foundational value proposition. Market Cycles and Consolidation: Crypto markets, like many others, often move in cycles of expansion and contraction. A correction, or a significant Bitcoin price drop , can be a healthy part of a bull market. It helps to “shake out” weak hands (investors who sell due to panic) and allows for price consolidation before the next potential upward movement. While immediate concerns are valid, a broader view suggests that such dips are often part of Bitcoin’s journey toward maturity and wider acceptance. It’s a test of conviction for investors, separating short-term speculators from long-term believers. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While it naturally sparks concern, it also underscores the importance of informed decision-making and maintaining a long-term perspective. Investors who understand market cycles, practice sound risk management, and employ disciplined strategies are better equipped to navigate these fluctuations. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and remember that market movements, even sharp declines, are often part of the evolving crypto landscape. Every dip can present an opportunity for those prepared to act strategically. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Drops Q1: Is a Bitcoin price drop normal? A1: Yes, price volatility and drops are a normal part of the cryptocurrency market, especially for Bitcoin. It has experienced numerous significant corrections throughout its history, often followed by strong recoveries. Q2: What should I do if Bitcoin drops significantly? A2: It’s crucial to avoid panic selling. Instead, stay informed, review your investment strategy, consider dollar-cost averaging, and evaluate if the dip presents a buying opportunity based on your long-term goals. Q3: Does a Bitcoin price drop mean it’s failing? A3: Not necessarily. While a drop can be concerning, Bitcoin’s underlying technology and fundamentals remain strong. Price drops are often part of market cycles and can be influenced by various short-term factors. Q4: How long do Bitcoin price drops usually last? A4: The duration of Bitcoin price drops varies widely. Some can be quick corrections lasting days or weeks, while others might extend for months. Historical data shows that recoveries often follow these periods of decline. Q5: Should I buy Bitcoin after a price drop? A5: Buying after a price drop can be a strategy for some investors, often referred to as “buying the dip.” However, it carries risks, as prices could fall further. It’s essential to do your own research and align any buying decisions with your personal financial strategy and risk tolerance. Did this analysis help you understand the recent Bitcoin price drop ?

Here Is Why.,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/18/ether-market-may-become-more-exciting-below-usd4-2k-here-is-why,"Crypto traders should remain vigilant for an ether (ETH) price drop below $4,200, which could trigger millions in long liquidations and increase market volatility. As of writing, over 56,638 ETH in bullish long positions – valued at $236 million – faced liquidation risk on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid in case of an ether price drop to $4,170, according to data from Hyperdash. The data also showed a risk of sizable liquidations at $2,150-$2,160 and $3,940. At press time, ether changed hands at $4,260, down nearly 5% on the day, according to CoinDesk data. Andrew Kang, founder of the crypto venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, stated on X that large long liquidations could potentially drive ether prices down to $3,600. ""[I] would estimate we're about to hit $5b in ETH liquidations across exchanges, taking us down to $3.2k - $3.6k,"" Kang said. Liquidations, or the forced closure of leveraged bets, happen when a trader's position falls short of the margin requirements set by the exchange. The margin shortage typically occurs when the market moves against the trader's position, causing their account equity to fall below the minimum maintenance margin. This prompts the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses and ensure borrowed funds are recovered. Largely long liquidations cause a sudden surge in selling pressure, which pushes prices even lower, creating a cascading effect that can trigger additional liquidations. This negative feedback loop tends to amplify market volatility.

Traders are now eyeing $LBRETT , an Ethereum Layer 2 token that has gone viral thanks to its 9000% staking rewards. With a price still well under $1, it offers an attractive entry point. Investors believe LBRETT’s mix of meme power and real utility could outperform BNB, Dogecoin, and even Pepe in 2025. BNB price prediction: Maxwell upgrade strengthens BNB as investors eye alternatives BNB has been showing renewed strength on the charts. After trading sideways earlier in the year, it climbed back above $800, touching $869 before settling near $835. Trading volumes remain steady, and the price is holding well above key moving averages, a sign that momentum is leaning bullish. Source: Sosovalue The Maxwell upgrade has been a big driver. By boosting transaction speeds and cutting costs, it has positioned BNB as more efficient for users and developers. At the same time, ecosystem projects like xStocks and the USYC stablecoin are drawing investor interest, showing Binance’s broader strategy of linking blockchain activity with real-world finance. That narrative is now catching the eye of institutions. With a market cap surpassing Nike’s, BNB has gone far beyond being just an exchange coin. Since its 2019 launch, it has expanded into payments, DeFi, and enterprise adoption, making it one of the most versatile tokens in circulation. The BNB price prediction now points toward a possible retest of $900 and even a push to $1,000 if bullish conditions hold. But while the outlook is strong, some holders are shifting attention to $LBRETT . Its viral momentum, 9000% staking rewards, and under-$1 price are creating a sense of urgency that BNB, despite its size, can’t match. Why Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is the meme coin you can’t ignore The meme coin space is crowded with projects that pump and disappear. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is breaking that cycle. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it fuses meme culture with real blockchain performance, making it more than a short-lived trend. For investors scanning the market for the next big crypto or a low-cap crypto gem, $LBRETT is standing out fast. Ethereum’s Layer 1 issues, which include slow speeds and high gas fees, don’t exist here. By moving to Layer 2, Layer Brett delivers lightning-fast trades and near-zero costs, giving everyday users what they’ve been waiting for. This technical edge is why many already call it one of the best meme coins to buy heading into 2025. Add in its low entry price, and the presale is attracting serious early movers. Here are a few among the numerous features fueling the $LBRETT hype right now: Layer 2 speed with almost zero fees Massive staking rewards, shrinking as more users join True decentralization, no KYC, and full self-custody $1 million community giveaway, rewarding early believers Layer Brett is a meme coin designed to scale. By combining humor, culture, and real DeFi utility, $LBRETT is positioned to run hard in the upcoming bull market. For traders tired of hype without substance, this could be the project that outlasts the noise. $LBRETT presale at $0.0042 could outpace BNB by Q4 2025 Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is gaining momentum fast, with its presale price locked at just $0.0042, giving investors a rare early entry point. Running on Ethereum Layer 2, it offers near-zero gas fees, instant trades, and scalable adoption. With massive staking rewards and a $1 million giveaway, $LBRETT is drawing heavy attention. As BNB’s rally cools, traders see $LBRETT’s upside as far greater, with many betting it could outperform BNB before the end of Q4 2025. Buy Layer Brett today, stake your $LBRETT, and get ready for explosive gains.

Their forecast projects that by early 2026, this new crypto coin will be leading the pack in percentage gains, supported by an ambitious roadmap, high-impact utility, and a presale structure that is designed to reward early conviction. The DeFi sector is moving fast, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to capture the next wave of decentralized lending adoption. In an environment where top cryptocurrencies are constantly battling for market dominance, MUTM is setting itself apart by creating a non-custodial liquidity protocol that will serve both Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending models. This dual-model approach is rare in DeFi and will give the platform a flexible, multi-market reach — appealing to retail traders, long-term investors, and even institutional players looking for a scalable lending infrastructure. A DeFi model designed for mass appeal The P2P model on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will allow users to negotiate loan terms directly with one another. This means traders will be able to use popular memecoins like PEPE, FLOKI, DOGE, SHIB, and TRUMP in structured lending agreements, with rates and terms set between parties. By accommodating such high-volume community tokens, the platform will position itself as a place where both mainstream and niche traders can find value. The P2C model, on the other hand, will operate through liquidity pools, enabling seamless lending and borrowing of blue-chip cryptos and stablecoins. Here, interest rates will be tied to pool utilization, automatically adjusting to ensure efficiency and balanced liquidity. This automated flexibility will make the P2C model ideal for users who prefer instant execution without direct negotiation, catering to the broader audience in the defi crypto. Phase 6 presale — the last discount before price acceleration Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6 of its presale at a price of $0.035. Over $14.43 million has already been raised, with 17% of the tokens in this phase sold to more than 15,300 holders. Once Phase 7 begins, the price will jump by 15% to $0.040, making this the last opportunity to secure MUTM at its current discounted rate before momentum drives it higher. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and a listing price set at $0.06, the math for early investors is compelling. Consider the investor who entered during Phase 1 at $0.01 — they are already sitting at a 250% paper gain before a single exchange listing. Even for those entering now in Phase 6, a move from $0.035 to the $0.06 listing price will lock in significant appreciation before the broader market even begins trading MUTM. This is what makes it one of the top crypto to buy for those seeking strong upside with a clear timeline. Security and transparency are equally prioritized. The project has undergone a CertiK audit, earning a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, along with a $50,000 bug bounty program offering severity-based rewards. A $100,000 giveaway is also running for ten winners, adding another layer of excitement to its growing community. Utility-driven growth with built-in buy pressure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building for sustainable, utility-driven demand. Its protocol will allow lending and borrowing activity to generate consistent on-chain volume, which will feed into the platform’s buy-and-distribute model. Part of the revenue from lending and borrowing will be used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them as rewards to holders staking their mtTokens in designated smart contracts. An additional layer of utility will come from its decentralized stablecoin, pegged at $1 and minted only against overcollateralized loans. This stablecoin will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated, adding a natural supply-control mechanism. Governance will adjust borrowing interest rates to maintain the peg, while arbitrage opportunities will keep the price balanced — creating a product that will be essential for on-platform liquidity and user retention. The roadmap is equally ambitious. Four distinct phases will take the project from presale through to live platform launch, major exchange listings on Binance, KuCoin, and MEXC, and eventual multi-chain expansion. Upon listing, the beta version will be ready for user onboarding, allowing immediate interaction with its features and speeding up adoption. The clock is ticking on Phase 6, and with whale watchers already tracking MUTM’s progress, retail investors are being presented with a rare window where price, utility, and market timing align. For anyone asking what’s the best crypto to buy now or searching for the next top crypto before the market catches on, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch and act on before the presale sells out.

In his statement, he noted that Judge Torres’ “final court sign-off” was imminent and suggested that once this occurred, XRP could reach $5 in a short period. The message drew attention within the digital asset community, particularly because of the reference to Judge Torres’ involvement at this stage of the case. His view implied that the judge still held an active role in issuing a decisive ruling that could affect XRP’s trajectory. Marc Fagel’s Response on the Legal Process Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel responded directly to the comment. In his reply, Fagel clarified the procedural posture of the case by stating , “Reminder: Judge Torres has nothing further to do with this case.” His response suggested that any expectation of a new ruling or final sign-off from Judge Torres was misplaced. Reminder: Judge Torres has nothing further to do with this case. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) August 16, 2025 Fagel’s position reflects the understanding that the court’s role in the matter has already concluded at the district level, and no further involvement from Judge Torres is expected as the appeals process has advanced independently. Community Reaction and Calls Against Misinformation An additional perspective was from a user, Siebo. He expressed frustration with repeated sharing of inaccurate updates, suggesting there should be a system where accounts that spread false information multiple times would face penalties such as temporary suspensions. His reaction highlighted the ongoing challenge of misinformation circulating within the cryptocurrency community regarding legal proceedings and their potential market impact. Context from Recent Legal Developments The discussion followed a recent update in the ongoing Ripple-SEC case. On August 16, the Times Tabloid reported that the SEC had filed its August 15 status report with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This filing confirmed that both the SEC and Ripple had submitted a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal of their cross-appeals. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to attorney Bill Morgan, this filing was primarily procedural but could give rise to short-term speculation about Judge Torres issuing a final order. Morgan noted that while the step is largely a formality, the timeline could continue to be misunderstood, leading to inaccurate commentary suggesting imminent rulings from Judge Torres. Clarifying the Current Stage of the Case With the filing of the Joint Stipulation, the matter now rests with the Court of Appeals for a formal dismissal of the appeals. This means that while there remains a procedural step for the court to acknowledge the dismissal, Judge Torres’s direct role in the case has concluded. Fagel’s response aligns with this understanding, pointing out that speculation around a forthcoming ruling from the district court judge does not reflect the current legal status. The exchange between Steph Is Crypto and Marc Fagel underscores a recurring issue in public commentary on ongoing litigation. While analysts often link court actions to market forecasts, legal experts such as Fagel highlight the importance of accuracy regarding procedural details. The recent SEC filing and the comments from Bill Morgan further confirm that the case is moving through its final stages, with Judge Torres no longer playing an active role.

The company has announced a significant plan for a Bitcoin purchase , signaling a bold step into the world of digital assets. This move by a traditional industry player highlights a growing trend where businesses explore innovative strategies to manage their treasury and expand their global reach. Why is Lib Work Making This Strategic Bitcoin Purchase? Lib Work revealed its intention to acquire 500 million yen, equivalent to approximately $3.4 million, worth of Bitcoin in 2025. This decision, communicated in a press release dated August 18, wasn’t made lightly. The company explicitly pointed to two critical factors driving this strategic Bitcoin purchase : Inflation Risks: With global economic uncertainties and rising inflation concerns, traditional fiat currencies often lose purchasing power over time. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, is increasingly seen by some as a potential hedge against such risks. Overseas Expansion: As Lib Work looks to expand its operations internationally, holding a globally accessible and liquid asset like Bitcoin could streamline cross-border transactions and offer greater financial flexibility. This move was initially brought to light by NLNico on X, drawing considerable attention to the firm’s forward-thinking approach. What Does This Bitcoin Purchase Signify for Corporate Crypto Adoption? Lib Work’s decision to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet places it among a growing list of public companies worldwide embracing cryptocurrencies. This trend, often spearheaded by pioneers like MicroStrategy, demonstrates a significant shift in corporate treasury management. A corporate Bitcoin purchase can offer several potential advantages: Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk exposure. Capital Appreciation Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown substantial long-term growth potential, offering a new avenue for capital appreciation beyond traditional investments. Innovation & Brand Image: For some firms, embracing digital assets can enhance their image as innovative and future-oriented, appealing to a new generation of investors and customers. This development further legitimizes Bitcoin as a viable and strategic asset class for established businesses, moving it beyond speculative trading into serious corporate financial planning. Navigating the Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Purchase While the benefits are compelling, a corporate Bitcoin purchase also comes with its share of challenges. Companies must carefully consider these aspects to mitigate potential risks: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant fluctuations, which could impact a company’s financial statements and require robust risk management strategies. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies must navigate varying legal frameworks, tax implications, and compliance requirements in different jurisdictions. Security & Custody: Safely storing digital assets requires specialized knowledge and secure solutions to protect against hacks, theft, or loss. Choosing a reliable custodian or implementing strong internal security protocols is paramount. Understanding these challenges is crucial for any firm contemplating a similar move, ensuring a well-informed and secure transition into digital asset holdings. Actionable Insights for Future Bitcoin Purchase Decisions For other companies considering a venture into digital assets, Lib Work’s example provides valuable lessons. Making a successful Bitcoin purchase requires careful planning and execution. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Before any investment, deeply research Bitcoin’s fundamentals, market dynamics, and historical performance. Understand its unique characteristics as an asset. Define Clear Objectives: Articulate why your company is considering Bitcoin. Is it for inflation hedging, diversification, or a long-term growth play? Clear objectives guide your strategy. Consult Experts: Engage with financial advisors, tax specialists, and legal counsel who have expertise in cryptocurrencies. Their guidance can help navigate complex regulations and optimize your strategy. Prioritize Security: Implement institutional-grade security measures for custody. Whether using self-custody or a third-party custodian, robust security protocols are non-negotiable to protect your investment. Lib Work’s bold Bitcoin purchase is a testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global economy. It underscores a growing confidence in digital assets as a hedge against traditional economic pressures and a tool for global strategy. This development could inspire more companies to explore similar avenues, further integrating cryptocurrency into the global financial landscape and paving the way for a more digitally-driven future.

Lib Work plans to purchase 500 million yen worth of Bitcoin, which is approximately $3.4 million, in 2025. 2. What are Lib Work’s main reasons for buying Bitcoin? The company stated two primary reasons: to mitigate inflation risks and to support its overseas expansion efforts. 3. What are the potential risks for companies making a Bitcoin purchase? Key risks include market volatility, an evolving regulatory landscape, and the need for robust security and custody solutions to protect digital assets. 4. Will Lib Work’s Bitcoin purchase influence other Japanese companies? It’s possible. Lib Work’s strategic move could serve as a precedent, encouraging other Japanese firms to consider digital assets for similar financial and strategic benefits. 5. How does a corporate Bitcoin purchase help against inflation?

The latest acquisition brings its total holdings to 18,888 BTC as of August 18, 2025. Ramping Up Bitcoin Reserves According to its official filing, Metaplanet stated that its cumulative Bitcoin investment amounts to approximately $1.94 billion, acquired at an average cost of $102,653 per BTC. The Tokyo-listed firm has often been compared to Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) for its Bitcoin-focused treasury plan, and has maintained momentum with a string of weekly acquisitions that continue to draw market scrutiny. Following its aggressive buying push that began last year, the company purchased 463 BTC worth $53 million on August 4, followed by 518 BTC valued at $61.4 million on August 12. These acquisitions highlight Metaplanet’s ambition to expand its Bitcoin reserves at a steady pace. And this stance has already influenced many players in Asia, where companies are increasingly weighing Bitcoin as a treasury asset, which has also been catalyzed by the growing regulatory clarity in regional markets. Last week, Taiwan’s WiseLink became the latest company to adopt a BTC treasury strategy as it committed $10 million through a convertible note to Nasdaq-listed Top Win International. The move not only strengthens WiseLink’s “Bitcoin + Cross-Border Finance” framework but also indicates a wider trend of regional corporates integrating digital assets into traditional business strategies. Other examples of Asia accelerating the corporate Bitcoin race. South Korea’s K Wave Media, which partnered with Galaxy Digital to advance its own BTC treasury plans, and Singapore’s Genius Group, which raised its target from 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC. Strongest Quarter in Company History Owing to its BTC strategy, Metaplanet reported its strongest quarter ever in Q2. CEO Simon Gerovich called it the company’s best performance in history. Ordinary profit surged to $117.8 million, reversing a $46.7 million loss in the prior quarter, while net income climbed to $75.1 million from a $33.7 million loss a year earlier. Revenue rose 41% quarter-on-quarter to $8.4 million, with gross profit increasing 38% to $5.5 million. Additionally, the company recorded a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 468.1% in 2025. “We continue to project full-year revenue of ¥3.4 billion and operating profit of ¥2.5 billion, supported by recurring cash-secured-put premiums and operational performance.

It has moved into a technical correction after falling by over 11% from its highest point this month. So, why is ETH going down today? Ethereum price is crashing amid profit-taking The first main reason why the Ethereum price crash is happening is that investors are taking profits after the recent rally that pushed it closer to a record high. At its highest point last week, Ether was up by 243% from its lowest point this month. Historically, an asset tends to pull back after staging a strong rally as investors take profits. For example, Bitcoin price has dropped to $117,000 from its all-time high as investors book profits. Some of this profit-taking is taking place voluntarily, while the others is being forced on through liquidations. Data shows that liquidations jumped by 314% to $503 million in the last 24 hours. $117 million worth of ETH tokens were liquidated. Technicals explain why the ETH crash is happening A closer look at Ethereum price chart explains why it is crashing. First, the plunge could be part of a scenario known as a break-and-retest pattern, where an asset crosses a crucial resistance and then retests it. It is one of the most common continuation signs in technical analysis. In this case, ETH price crossed the important resistance level at $4,113, its highest level in December last year. It is now attempting to retest that support level, which will be a sign of a bullish continuation pattern. The other technical reason why the Ethereum price is crashing is known as mean reversion. This is a situation where a surging asset crashes so that it can come closer to the moving averages. In this case, Ethereum has deviated from the moving averages significantly. Its current price of $4,250 is much higher than the 100-day moving average at $3,200 and the 200-day MA at $2,917. As such, it makes sense for the token to crash based on the mean reversion theory. The other technical reason why ETH price is plunging is that the coin became highly overbought as it surged. The RSI indicator peaked at 86, while the Stochastic Oscillator surged to a high of 99. ETH price chart | Source: TradingView Ongoing crypto market pullback Ethereum price is also plunging because of the ongoing crypto market crash . A closer look shows that Bitcoin price has dropped to $115,000 from last week’s high of $124,200. Other tokens like XRP, BNB, and Solana have all plunged by over 5% in the last 24 hours, while the market cap of all tokens has crashed to $3.88 trillion. The crypto industry is often highly correlated, with most altcoins plunging whenever Bitcoin loses momentum. Will ETH price surge resume? So, will the Ethereum price surge resume? Odds are that the price of Ethereum will bounce back over time. Besides, data shows that there is robust demand from investors, with ETF inflows surging. The other main catalyst is that the number of Ethereum treasury companies is rising. These firms, which seek to mimic MicroStrategy, are raising billions to buy ETH. For example, Tom Lee’s BitMine is raising over $20 billion to continue its buying. The ongoing accumulation is happening at a time when the supply of ETH in exchanges has continued to fall. As such, rising demand and falling supply will always lead to more gains. Also, Ethereum is the most dominant players in key areas like decentralized finance, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens.

Lykke, a crypto trading platform incorporated in the UK, lost nearly $23 million last year due to a security breach. Investigations at the time revealed that hackers stole 158 BTC and 2,161 ETH. The hacker laundered the stolen Ether by swapping it for DAI, an algorithmic stablecoin issued by MakerDAO. Meanwhile, Bitcoins were subsequently transferred to multiple wallets. In March, a Judge ordered Lykke to be liquidated after several affected users carried out a legal campaign. Per a recent report by The Telegraph , the British Treasury’s sanctions office accused the Lazarus Group of orchestrating the heist. “The attack has been attributed to malicious Democratic People’s Republic of Korea cyberactors, who stole funds on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks,” the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) said. The OFSI had worked closely with law enforcement, the UK Treasury noted. Lazarus Group’s Biggest Known Crypto Heist Targeting the UK If reports are confirmed, the heist would become North Korea’s biggest crypto fraud targeting Britain. The Lazarus hackers have so far succeeded in the largest $1.5 billion heist connected to crypto exchange ByBit this year. Further, cybersecurity experts from Cyvers have also linked the Lazarus Group to the July 19 hack on the Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, compromising $44 million. The stolen funds from these heists are suspected to be part of Pyongyang’s broader efforts to fund its nuclear weapons and military programs, with billions already funnelled through previous crypto raids. Crypto Fraud Detection Whitestream Blames North Korean Cyber Gang An Israeli crypto investigation firm, Whitestream, has confirmed Lazarus’ involvement in Lykke’s heist, besides the UK Treasury arm’s investigation. Investigators noted that attackers had laundered the stolen funds through two other cryptocurrency companies, avoiding money-laundering controls. However, other researchers have denied the conclusions, stressing that it is too early to jump to blaming Lazarus. Founded in 2015, Lykke operated from Switzerland but was registered in the UK. The platform offered cryptocurrency trading without transaction fees. In 2023, the UK’s FCA issued a warning about Lykke over its unregistered offering of crypto products to Brits.

Centuries ago, the printing press democratized access to knowledge. Later, industrialization reshaped trade and wealth. Today, cryptocurrencies represent a similar moment of transformation. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and countless digital assets now fuel discussions about the future of money. Yet despite their promise, a critical question remains: who gets access? Financial inclusion has been a recurring theme in global development. Millions remain outside traditional banking systems, particularly in developing regions. Cryptocurrencies, often hailed as borderless, should have solved this. But technical barriers, high costs, and uneven infrastructure continue to limit participation. It is at this intersection of innovation and access that Invro Mining positions itself. Cryptocurrency as a Bridge, Not a Barrier At its core, cryptocurrency embodies decentralization. It rejects gatekeepers and invites participation. In theory, anyone with an internet connection should be able to take part. In practice, mining requires costly equipment, technical know-how, and high energy demands. For the majority, these requirements exclude rather than empower. Platforms like Invro Mining attempt to reverse this exclusion. By lowering barriers, they bring digital finance closer to its founding ideals—open, accessible, and participatory. The focus is not on creating exclusivity but on designing entry points that allow ordinary individuals to take part in wealth creation. The Path to Participation: Registration and Rewards Accessibility only matters when it is clear and actionable. Invro Mining’s registration is structured to be straightforward, ensuring that even first-time users can begin without confusion. The process follows these steps: Visit the official Invro Mining website . Click “Sign Up” and complete the registration form with basic details such as email, password, and security verification. Confirm your account through a verification email to activate participation. Log in to your dashboard to access mining features and rewards. Claim the welcome bonus of $15, which appears instantly in your account. Engage daily for check-in rewards of $0.75, added directly to your balance. Invite others using your referral link to earn a 3% commission, with the potential to rise to 5% as your network grows. This process reflects the platform’s vision: reduce complexity and replace it with clarity. For users, it transforms mining from a technical challenge into a guided entry point. Contracts That Reflect Diversity of Capacity Not every participant has the same financial resources, and inclusion means designing for this reality. Invro Mining introduces tiered contracts that scale across different levels of commitment: Starter Plan – $15 for 1 day with a return of $15.60. Stable Growth Plan – $3,000 for 15 days with a return of $3,652.50. Gain Plan – $5,000 for 20 days with a return of $6,550. High Yield Plan – $10,000 for 30 days with a return of $15,100. These structured options demonstrate how accessibility can be tailored. Entry-level contracts ensure no one is locked out, while higher plans appeal to those with greater capacity. This tiered structure turns inclusion from a slogan into an actionable framework. The Larger Meaning of Inclusion in Crypto The implications of accessible mining go beyond individual earnings. In developing regions, it provides entry into systems of value that were previously unreachable. For participants in developed markets, it underscores a shift away from financial concentration. When more people can participate in mining, wealth distribution gains the potential to become more balanced. Such developments are not just economic; they are social. They reshape how communities connect to global systems, how individuals perceive financial opportunity, and how wealth circulates beyond borders. Balancing Innovation with Responsibility Of course, inclusion without responsibility risks instability. Cryptocurrency remains volatile, and trust is not automatic. Platforms must adopt transparent practices, uphold ethical standards, and recognize the risks alongside the opportunities. Invro Mining , like others working in this space, faces the challenge of building confidence while offering accessibility. True innovation does not come from technology alone. It comes from designing systems that place people, their security, and their aspirations at the center. Innovation as a Social Equalizer The story of finance has always been about access. Who participates, who profits, and who is left behind define economic eras. Today, cryptocurrencies are writing a new chapter. Platforms like Invro Mining show how mining, once the privilege of the technically skilled or wealthy, can be opened to broader participation. When innovation meets inclusion, finance ceases to be a fortress. Instead, it becomes a gateway—one where the digital economy is not just the domain of the few but an opportunity for the many.

Recently, a significant trend has emerged: a powerful altcoin momentum gaining traction as Bitcoin’s market dominance begins to show cracks. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals a fascinating recalibration of capital within the digital asset space. What’s Driving This Altcoin Momentum? Insights from Glassnode co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel, shared via their Negentropic X account, highlight this pivotal shift. Despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price fluctuations, moving into the $113,000–$114,000 range, altcoins have demonstrated remarkable resilience. This strength is a clear indicator of active capital rotation. Capital Rotation: This phenomenon occurs when investors move funds from one asset class or cryptocurrency to another, seeking higher returns. As Bitcoin’s dominance declines, capital flows into altcoins. Resilience: Altcoins are showing they can hold their value and even gain, even when Bitcoin experiences pullbacks. Positive Momentum: This movement directly fuels positive momentum for Ethereum (ETH) and other promising altcoins. This dynamic suggests a maturing market where diverse assets can thrive independently. Why is Bitcoin Dominance Weakening? Bitcoin has historically led the crypto market, but its dominance, or its share of the total crypto market capitalization, is not static. Several factors contribute to its weakening hold, which in turn boosts altcoin momentum . The market constantly evolves, and investors are increasingly looking beyond just Bitcoin. Here are some reasons: Maturing Ecosystem: The altcoin space has grown significantly, offering more sophisticated projects, innovative technologies, and diverse use cases. Yield Opportunities: Many altcoins offer staking, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols, and other avenues for passive income, attracting capital. Risk Appetite: As market confidence grows, investors may take on more risk by exploring smaller, high-growth potential altcoins. Therefore, a weakening Bitcoin dominance is not necessarily negative for the overall market; instead, it often signals a broadening of investment opportunities. Navigating the New Wave of Altcoin Momentum Understanding this shift is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto market. The current environment presents both opportunities and challenges. While the overall altcoin momentum is positive, individual altcoins carry unique risks. Here are some actionable insights: Research is Key: Before investing, thoroughly research any altcoin. Understand its technology, team, use case, and community support. Diversification: Spreading investments across various altcoins can mitigate risk. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Monitor Market Signals: Pay attention to indicators like Bitcoin dominance charts and capital flow reports to anticipate shifts. Ethereum (ETH), as the largest altcoin, often leads this charge, but many other projects are also benefiting from this renewed interest and capital influx. What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? The shift in market dynamics towards increased altcoin momentum presents an exciting period for investors. It suggests that the crypto market is becoming more diversified and robust, moving beyond a sole reliance on Bitcoin’s performance. While Bitcoin remains a cornerstone, the rising tide of altcoins offers new avenues for growth and innovation. This period of capital rotation provides a fresh perspective on where the market’s energy is truly flowing, encouraging a broader exploration of the digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin dominance? Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. It indicates how much of the overall crypto market value is held by Bitcoin. What does it mean when Bitcoin dominance weakens? When Bitcoin dominance weakens, it means that altcoins are gaining market share relative to Bitcoin. Capital is likely flowing from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies, signaling increased interest and investment in the altcoin market. How does altcoin momentum impact Ethereum (ETH)? Ethereum (ETH) is the largest altcoin by market capitalization. Therefore, strong altcoin momentum often translates directly into positive price action and increased capital flow for ETH, as it is a primary beneficiary of funds moving out of Bitcoin or into the broader altcoin space. Is a weakening Bitcoin dominance a bad sign for the crypto market? Not necessarily. While some see it as a sign of risk, many view it as a healthy sign of market maturation and diversification. It indicates that the ecosystem is growing beyond Bitcoin, with more projects and technologies gaining investor confidence. What are the risks associated with investing in altcoins? Altcoins can be more volatile than Bitcoin due to lower liquidity and smaller market caps. They also carry risks related to project viability, technological failures, and regulatory uncertainties. Thorough research and risk management are crucial. Did you find this analysis helpful?

If so, there’s a crucial update you need to know. Leading crypto exchange Binance has officially announced that it will cease all deposits and withdrawals for tokens on the Neo Legacy (NEO) network. This significant change takes effect at 08:00 UTC on October 15 . It’s vital for all Binance NEO users to understand the implications and take timely action. What’s Happening with Binance NEO Services? Binance, a global leader in cryptocurrency trading, confirmed its plan to halt support for Neo Legacy network transactions. This means that after the specified date and time, you will no longer be able to deposit or withdraw NEO tokens using the Neo Legacy chain on the Binance platform. This decision directly responds to an upcoming fundamental change within the Neo ecosystem itself. The move by Binance ensures the security and stability of its platform for users. While the immediate focus is on the cessation of services for the Neo Legacy network, it’s important to differentiate this from other Neo-related services. This specific announcement pertains only to the older Neo Legacy chain, not necessarily the newer Neo N3 network, which operates differently. Users who hold Binance NEO assets should pay close attention to the exact deadline. Missing this window could lead to complications in accessing or moving your funds. This is a clear example of how dynamic the crypto world can be, with exchanges constantly adapting to network developments. Why is Binance Halting Neo Legacy Network Support for Binance NEO? The primary reason behind Binance’s decision to cease Binance NEO deposits and withdrawals on the Neo Legacy network is the planned shutdown of the network itself. The Neo community has been transitioning from the older Neo Legacy chain to the more advanced Neo N3 blockchain for some time. This migration aims to improve scalability, security, and developer features within the Neo ecosystem. When a blockchain network plans a shutdown, it essentially means that the underlying infrastructure supporting transactions on that specific chain will no longer be maintained or operational. For a major exchange like Binance, continuing to support a defunct or soon-to-be-defunct network would pose significant risks, including: Security vulnerabilities: An unmaintained network can become a target for exploits. Loss of funds: Transactions might fail or funds could become irrecoverable. Operational inefficiencies: Supporting a legacy system diverts resources from newer, more active networks. Therefore, Binance is taking a proactive step to protect its users and streamline its operations by aligning with the Neo community’s roadmap. This ensures that users are not left with assets on a non-functional network. Understanding the context of the Neo Legacy shutdown is key to understanding Binance’s action regarding Binance NEO . What Actions Should Binance NEO Holders Take? If you have NEO tokens on the Neo Legacy network within your Binance account, immediate action is necessary. The most important step is to withdraw your Binance NEO tokens from the exchange before the October 15, 08:00 UTC deadline. Here are your primary options: Withdraw to a Neo N3 Wallet: If you intend to continue holding NEO, transfer your tokens to a wallet that supports the Neo N3 network. Many official Neo wallets or third-party wallets have tools for migrating from Neo Legacy to Neo N3. Ensure you understand the migration process. Sell Your NEO: If you no longer wish to hold NEO, you can sell your tokens on Binance before the deadline. Convert them into other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Stay Informed: Always refer to official announcements from Binance and the Neo project for the latest updates and guidance on the migration process. Failing to withdraw or sell your tokens before the deadline could result in your funds becoming inaccessible on Binance. While Binance typically provides ample notice for such changes, it’s ultimately the user’s responsibility to manage their assets. This situation highlights the importance of staying updated on the networks supporting your crypto holdings. The cessation of Binance NEO deposits and withdrawals on the Neo Legacy network is a direct consequence of the Neo community’s transition to Neo N3. This move by Binance is a protective measure for its users, preventing potential issues arising from an unsupported network. For all Binance NEO holders, the message is clear: act before October 15th. Ensure your assets are moved or converted to avoid any disruption. Stay vigilant and manage your crypto portfolio proactively! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why is Binance stopping NEO deposits and withdrawals? Binance is ceasing NEO deposits and withdrawals on the Neo Legacy network due to the planned shutdown of the Neo Legacy network itself. This aligns with the Neo community’s transition to the newer Neo N3 blockchain. 2. Does this affect all NEO tokens on Binance? This announcement specifically affects NEO tokens on the Neo Legacy network . It does not necessarily impact NEO on the newer Neo N3 network, which operates separately. 3. What should I do if I have Binance NEO on the Neo Legacy network? You should withdraw your NEO tokens from Binance to a Neo N3-compatible wallet or sell them on the exchange before the deadline of October 15, 08:00 UTC . 4. What happens if I don’t withdraw my NEO by the deadline? If you do not withdraw or sell your Neo Legacy NEO tokens before the deadline, they may become inaccessible on Binance, as the exchange will no longer support transactions on that network. 5. Is Neo N3 affected by this announcement? No, this announcement pertains to the Neo Legacy network. The Neo N3 network is the newer, actively supported blockchain that the Neo community is migrating towards. Did you find this information helpful?

50272508,558684,1755502214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50272508.jpeg,New Solana Consensus Model ‘Alpenglow’ Enters Community Vote,https://bitcoinist.com/new-solana-consensus-alpenglow-community-vote/,"Solana core developers have pushed a sweeping consensus overhaul, “Alpenglow” (SIMD-0326), into the ecosystem’s formal governance track, setting up a validator vote that, if approved, would replace TowerBFT and re-architect finality and validator incentives on mainnet-beta. The proposal’s authors—Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski, and Roger Wattenhofer—describe Alpenglow as “a major overhaul of Solana’s core consensus protocol,” designed to supplant “the existing Proof-of-History and TowerBFT mechanisms” with a design that targets block finalization “as low as 100–150 milliseconds.” Voting Process For Solana ‘Alpenglow’ Starts The governance post lays out a three-phase timeline: discussion through epochs 833–838, stake-weight capture in epoch 839, and a binding vote across epochs 840–842 using claimable vote tokens sent to “Yes,” “No,” or “Abstain” accounts. Passage hinges on a supermajority threshold: Yes must be at least two-thirds of Yes+No, with a 33% quorum that counts abstentions. As of today, Solana is in epoch 834, making the discussion window active and the vote window scheduled several epochs out. At the heart of Alpenglow is Votor , a direct-vote, leader-pipelined finality protocol that shifts Solana away from on-chain vote transactions and heavy gossip toward off-chain vote exchange with local signature aggregation. Validators vote to notarize or skip blocks; leaders aggregate those votes eight slots later and submit compact proofs. The authors argue this design cuts latency dramatically and reduces bandwidth, while a “20+20” liveliness model aims to tolerate up to 20% adversarial and 20% unresponsive validators without halting progress. “Alpenglow… enables much lower latency, improved fault tolerance, and generally greater protocol efficiency ,” the post asserts. The upgrade also rewires validator economics. Because voting moves off-chain, the SIMD introduces a Validator Admission Ticket (VAT), a fixed per-epoch fee “initially set to 1.6 SOL per epoch,” burned to maintain an economic barrier roughly comparable to today’s on-chain vote-fee regime. Validators are “required to cast exactly one valid vote per slot”; conflicting votes are detectable, and persistent non-participation renders a validator ineligible for rewards and at risk of removal from the active set. Leaders receive compensation equal to the per-slot vote rewards of the votes they aggregate, plus a flat bonus when they include fast-finalization/finalization certificates. In a follow-up thread post, Wattenhofer explains the 1.6 SOL figure as approximately 80% of current vote costs to ensure no operator is worse off at the “AlpenSwitch.” If adopted, Alpenglow would make a visible semantic change at the client layer: the authors note that optimistic confirmation would be superseded by actual finality at sub-second timescales. The stated aim is to bring confirmation latencies in line with Web2 user expectations while tightening safety guarantees that were harder to formalize under TowerBFT. The proposal’s documentation points readers to a 50+ page white paper and independent analyses, but emphasizes that the initial rollout focuses on finalization and voting; a new data dissemination protocol, Rotor, would follow in a separate SIMD. Governance mechanics for the vote mirror Solana’s prior advisory processes but with higher stakes. Vote tokens will be claimable via an adapted Merkle distributor; validators then send those tokens to the designated choice accounts during the epoch-bounded window. The foundation’s governance post states, “If the sum of Yes votes is equal to or greater than 2/3 of the total sum of Yes + No votes, the proposal will pass,” and “Abstain” contributes to quorum but not to the supermajority tally. Stake weights and a public tally script will be published for independent verification. Community feedback has quickly homed in on operational risk and rollout discipline. One validator-oriented response urges the SIMD authors to embed “a testing, deployment and fallback plan” before a mainnet decision, likening the scope of change to other industry-scale protocol transitions. Others probe specifics around the VAT level, transaction expiry in a post-PoH world, leader equivocation handling, and effects on MEV auctions and client UX when slices of a block are ignored under certain failure modes. These threads underscore that while the performance headline—150 ms finality —is eye-catching, the vote will likely hinge on the comfort level with safety proofs, incentive edge-cases, and the migration path.

Now, a market analyst is warning that sideways action could dominate trading until September, possibly followed by a steep correction. Analyst Braces for a Red September On Sunday, crypto trader Doctor Profit told his nearly 425,000 followers on X that Bitcoin will likely consolidate within a narrow range of roughly 8% until September before undergoing what he described as a “very red month.” Last week, the analyst accurately predicted BTC’s pump to $123,000 and subsequent drop. However, this time around, his assessment is showing a constrained trading band for the cryptocurrency until September. “I’m expecting a sideways move within the range shown on the chart. This is a small mid-range of only ~8%,” he stated, advising against expecting major directional breaks soon. However, according to him, next month will present a different picture. “In September, I expect a strong correction,” he asserted. Although he refrained from providing specifics, the analyst emphasized the importance of strategic positioning for shorts in that month, saying, “the herd will panic,” and urging traders to take advantage of the dip. His comments came in the wake of a volatile week for Bitcoin, with the asset briefly setting a new all-time high above $124,000 on August 14, before sliding sharply after hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data. Other analysts have echoed Doctor Profit’s caution. For instance, Rekt Capital noted that in previous cycles, similar retraces of between 25 and 30% served as setups for major rallies, but stressed that timing matters. Meanwhile, fellow trader Titan of Crypto flagged $119,500 as a level BTC must reclaim to keep its bullish outlook intact. Market Outlook At the time of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $115,670, down 2.1% in the last 24 hours and 5% during the week. Over the past seven days, the OG crypto has swung between $115,355 and $123,782, reflecting heightened volatility. Despite the setback , it remains up nearly 95% year-over-year, underlining its longer-term strength. The broader market is following Bitcoin’s lead. Ethereum, which reached $4,700 last week, has slipped but remains well above its summer lows. Other major cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have experienced daily losses of 4 to 5%, while Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) have defied the downturn by posting 9.7% and 10.4% weekly gains, respectively. From a technical perspective, trading signals provider Material Indicators warned in an August 18 post on X that BTC’s failure to break out above its 21-day moving average could weigh on near-term price action, suggesting more downside risk before another leg higher.

California State Treasurer Fiona Ma endorsed the plan, calling it a strategy that could “boost our economy, create high-quality jobs, attract top-tier investment, and advance sustainable development worldwide.” The crypto push comes as Faraday Future attempts to reset after years of setbacks. The company scrapped a $1 billion factory in Nevada in 2016, delaying production of its flagship FF91 EV. As of January, it had delivered only 16 vehicles and recently shifted to rebadging Chinese-made vans.

This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a noteworthy shift that could reshape how we understand the market. Many are wondering what’s behind this movement of vast amounts of Bitcoin away from centralized exchanges. What’s Behind the Drop in Bitcoin Exchange Balances? On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant recently shed light on this intriguing development. They clarified that the noticeable drop in Bitcoin exchange balances primarily stems from coins moving into newly launched spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This isn’t a sign of an impending supply shortage, but rather a fundamental change in how investors choose to hold their digital assets. Shift in Custody: Instead of holding Bitcoin directly on an exchange, investors are opting for the regulated structure of ETFs. Institutional Preference: These ETFs provide a more familiar and compliant avenue for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Reduced Immediate Selling Pressure: Coins held in ETFs are generally less likely to be traded actively or sold impulsively compared to those on exchanges. Bitcoin ETFs: Reshaping Ownership of Digital Gold The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions have undeniably been a game-changer. These investment vehicles allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or dealing with specific crypto exchanges. Consequently, a substantial amount of Bitcoin has flowed into these regulated products, directly impacting Bitcoin exchange balances . This move signifies growing institutional adoption and a broader acceptance of Bitcoin within mainstream finance. Investors often prefer ETFs for several compelling reasons: Ease of Access: ETFs can be bought and sold through traditional brokerage accounts. Enhanced Security: Regulated custodians manage the underlying Bitcoin, reducing individual security risks. Regulatory Clarity: Operating under established financial regulations provides a layer of trust and compliance. Implications for Market Dynamics and Bitcoin Exchange Balances The continuous reduction in Bitcoin exchange balances has several important implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, it suggests a potential decrease in the readily available supply of Bitcoin for immediate trading on exchanges. This could lead to lower liquidity on these platforms, which might influence price volatility, particularly during periods of high demand or sudden market events. However, it also indicates a maturation of the Bitcoin market. As more Bitcoin moves into long-term holding vehicles like ETFs, it signals a shift from speculative trading to more strategic, long-term investment. This structural change could contribute to greater price stability over time, as fewer coins are subject to short-term trading whims. Navigating the Evolving Landscape: Actionable Insights For both seasoned and new crypto participants, understanding this trend is crucial. While declining Bitcoin exchange balances might seem concerning at first glance, CryptoQuant’s analysis provides a reassuring perspective. It highlights that the asset is simply changing hands and moving into different, often more secure and long-term, forms of custody. What does this mean for you? Consider the following: Monitor On-Chain Data: Platforms like CryptoQuant offer invaluable insights into market movements beyond just price charts.

Recent reports highlight how a single entity, U.S.-based mining pool Foundry USA, successfully mined eight consecutive Bitcoin (BTC) blocks. This unprecedented streak has ignited fresh discussions and reignited long-standing concerns about Bitcoin centralization , a topic vital to the network’s foundational principles. What Does Foundry USA’s Block Spree Mean for Bitcoin Centralization? Jacob King, an astute analyst at the crypto newsletter WhaleWire, recently voiced his alarm on X regarding Foundry USA’s remarkable mining run. He described it as a serious centralization issue, echoing the sentiments of many in the Bitcoin community. This event underscores the ongoing challenge Bitcoin faces with miner concentration, a situation where a few large pools control a significant portion of the network’s hash rate. For Bitcoin, decentralization is not just a buzzword; it is the very essence of its security and censorship resistance. When a single entity or a small group gains too much control over block production, it introduces potential vulnerabilities. These could range from the theoretical risk of a 51% attack to more subtle forms of influence over transaction validation and network upgrades. Why Are Consecutive Blocks a Concern for Decentralization? Mining eight blocks in a row, while technically possible through sheer luck, amplifies fears about concentrated power. It raises questions about the distribution of mining power and its potential impact on the network’s integrity. While a pool mining multiple blocks consecutively doesn’t inherently mean malicious intent, it certainly highlights a lack of broad distribution in block production. The core issue here revolves around trust. Bitcoin was designed to be a trustless system, meaning users do not need to rely on any single authority. High levels of Bitcoin centralization in mining can erode this fundamental principle, forcing users to place more trust in the dominant mining pools. This goes against the very ethos of a decentralized digital currency. Beyond Blocks: What Other Indicators Point to Centralization Risks? King’s observations extended beyond just the block streak. He also pointed to other worrying signs: empty blocks and plunging transaction fees. An empty block is a block that contains no transactions, or very few, which can sometimes occur if a miner finds a block quickly and propagates it without waiting to fill it with transactions. While not always indicative of centralization, a rise in empty blocks can suggest inefficient mining practices or, in some contexts, a miner prioritizing speed over transaction inclusion. Plunging fees often reflect weakening network activity. When fewer people are transacting on the network, the demand for block space decreases, leading to lower fees. Combined with miner concentration, these factors paint a picture of a network potentially experiencing shifts in its operational health and raising further questions about Bitcoin centralization . How Can the Community Address Bitcoin Centralization? Addressing Bitcoin centralization is a complex, ongoing challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. It is not about villainizing large mining pools, but rather about promoting a healthier, more distributed mining ecosystem. Here are some key areas for focus: Promoting Smaller Pools: Users can choose to mine with smaller, less dominant pools to help distribute hash rate. Geographic Diversification: Encouraging mining operations in diverse geographical locations reduces the risk of single-point failures due to regional regulations or power issues. Technological Advancements: Research and development into more decentralized mining protocols or technologies could offer long-term solutions. Community Vigilance: Continued monitoring and open discussion about mining distribution are crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability. The recent events with Foundry USA serve as a potent reminder that the fight for decentralization is never truly over. While Bitcoin remains incredibly robust, the community must stay vigilant and proactive in addressing any trends that could compromise its core tenets. Maintaining a truly decentralized network ensures its long-term security, censorship resistance, and ultimately, its value as a global, permissionless currency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin centralization in the context of mining? Bitcoin centralization in mining refers to a situation where a small number of mining pools or entities control a significant portion of the network’s total hashing power. This concentration can potentially undermine Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and introduce risks. Is Foundry USA’s consecutive block mining a common occurrence? While a mining pool can occasionally find multiple blocks in a row due to luck, mining eight consecutive blocks is a rare occurrence that draws significant attention and raises questions about the distribution of mining power. Why is decentralization important for Bitcoin? Decentralization is crucial for Bitcoin’s security, censorship resistance, and trustlessness. It ensures no single entity can control the network, alter transactions, or prevent others from participating, thereby protecting its integrity and value. What are ’empty blocks’ and why are they a concern? Empty blocks are blocks that contain few or no transactions. While they can occur naturally, a high frequency of empty blocks can indicate inefficient mining practices or, in some cases, a strategy by miners that prioritizes speed over transaction inclusion, potentially impacting network utility. What can individual Bitcoin users do to support decentralization? Individual users can support decentralization by choosing to mine with smaller, less dominant mining pools, advocating for diverse geographic distribution of mining, and staying informed about network developments.

Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has just made a significant announcement that will capture the attention of traders globally. The platform is expanding its offerings with crucial new Binance listings , bringing more trading opportunities to its vast user base. Specifically, Binance officially confirmed on its website that it will introduce three new spot trading pairs. These highly anticipated additions are CYBER/USDC, MAV/USDC, and SKL/USDC. Mark your calendars: trading for these pairs will commence at 08:00 UTC on August 19. This development provides fresh avenues for diversification and strategic trading. What Do These New Binance Listings Mean for Traders? The introduction of new spot trading pairs on a major exchange like Binance is always a significant event. For traders, these new Binance listings translate directly into increased market access and potential for new strategies. When an asset is listed on a platform of Binance’s scale, it typically gains wider visibility and liquidity, which can be beneficial for its price discovery. Let’s briefly look at the tokens involved: CYBER (CyberConnect): A decentralized social graph protocol that helps developers create social applications.

SKALE aims to provide high-throughput, low-cost transactions, making its listing relevant for developers and users seeking efficient blockchain solutions. These additions reflect Binance’s commitment to offering a diverse range of assets, catering to various interests within the crypto community. Why Are Spot Pairs Important for Your Portfolio? Spot trading involves the immediate purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies at their current market price. Unlike derivatives or futures, you own the underlying asset directly. This direct ownership provides a sense of security and simplicity, especially for those new to trading or investors with a long-term outlook. The availability of these new Binance listings in spot pairs offers clear advantages. Firstly, it simplifies the trading process. Users can easily convert between USDC and these newly listed tokens without complex mechanisms. Secondly, it enhances liquidity for CYBER, MAV, and SKL, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient execution of trades. Increased liquidity is a critical factor for healthy market conditions and price stability. Moreover, these listings expand the utility of USDC. As a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, USDC is a popular choice for traders seeking stability amidst crypto volatility. Pairing it with these emerging tokens provides a reliable gateway for entry and exit, making it easier for traders to manage their risk exposure. Navigating New Binance Listings : Tips for Traders While new listings present exciting opportunities, it’s crucial to approach them with a well-thought-out strategy. The initial hours and days following a listing can be volatile, characterized by significant price swings. Therefore, careful consideration and risk management are paramount. Here are a few actionable insights: Do Your Research: Before trading, thoroughly investigate CYBER, MAV, and SKL. Understand their use cases, technology, team, and market cap. Start Small: Consider allocating a smaller portion of your capital initially, especially if you are new to these specific assets. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on community discussions and news surrounding the tokens. Sentiment can heavily influence short-term price movements. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital by setting stop-loss orders to automatically close a position if the price moves unfavorably beyond a certain point. Understand Liquidity: While Binance listings generally boost liquidity, observe the order books to gauge depth and potential slippage. Remember, patience and discipline are your best friends in the dynamic crypto market. These new Binance listings offer a chance to engage with innovative projects, but always prioritize informed decision-making.

In a post on X, he wrote: “August bounce from $2.72 to $3.38 was a 3 wave corrective move up unlike $OTHERS 5 wave impulsive move up, so I believe it was a B wave & we will likely revisit the August lows in the coming days/weeks for our C wave to end the correction that started late July.” XRP Correction Isn’t Over Yet The annotated chart (XRP/USD) plots a developing five-wave sequence with waves 1 and 2 completed in May and June, a vertical wave 3 peak into mid-July, and an unfolding A-B-C that would finalize wave 4. The A leg knifed off the wave-3 high, a B-wave recovery carried to $3.40, and the projected C leg descends into a Fibonacci cluster that coincides with the August trough. At the time of the snapshot, XRP was quoted around $3.02881 on the daily close, sitting between the 0.786 and 0.888 retracement rails. Fibonacci scaffolding dominates the chart and defines the key levels the analyst is trading against. The retracement and extension ladder is printed as follows: 0 at $1.61184, 0.136 at $1.78405, 0.236 at $1.92231, 0.382 at $2.14363, 0.5 at $2.34100, 0.618 at $2.55653, 0.702 at $2.72195, 0.786 at $2.87293, 0.888 at $3.1273, and 1.000 at $3.4000. Related Reading: XRP Takes On Live TV: Analyst Predicts Surge To $13 If This Happens Above the prior high, the upside extensions that map the prospective wave-5 run are marked at 1.272 ($4.16533), 1.414 ($4.63105) and 1.618 ($5.39272). The B-wave stall unfolded beneath the $3.1273–$3.4000 resistance band (0.888–1.000), reinforcing that region as the ceiling the market must clear to confirm a finished correction. Conversely, the proposed C-wave termination zone is anchored by the 0.786–0.702–0.618 stack at $2.87293 / $2.72195 / $2.55653, with the August pivot specifically highlighted at ~$2.72. A downward-sloping magenta trendline from the wave-3 apex bisects the A-B-C, and the projected path drives price into a labeled “4” before turning sharply higher into a new advance. Related Reading: Market Expert Reveals Why XRP Price At $1,000 Is Not A Possibility The terminal “5” marker is placed almost exactly at the 1.414 extension near $4.63105—consistent with the author’s own wording that this represents a conservative target zone—while the 1.618 print at $5.39272 frames an obvious stretch objective if momentum over-delivers. Addressing community questions about his previous higher target of $8, the analyst replied, “is there anywhere in the post that says no more $8 target?” and, when asked about an extended move in November, he answered “maybe. Maybe.” On positioning, he cautioned that “dips are never guaranteed even if they seem likely,” adding: “hodl imo… use trading options or futures or a trading spot bag to make their short term gains.” The immediate read is unambiguous: unless XRP can reclaim and hold above $3.1273 and then $3.4000, Charting Guy’s roadmap favors a retest of the August floor near $2.72195 to complete wave 4. Only after such a flush—or a decisive invalidation via resistance break—does his schematic open the door to the next impulsive leg targeting $4.16533 to $4.63105, with $5.39272 reserved for an extended fifth in late-September or early-October.

While these leading cryptos ride waves of volatility, a new Layer 2 meme coin called Layer Brett is capturing attention with explosive growth. Priced at just $0.0042 in its presale, $LBRETT combines scalability, speed, and unprecedented staking rewards, making it one of the fastest-rising tokens of 2025 and a hot pick among early investors. Layer Brett Emerges as a High-Reward Altcoin to Watch While giants like Ethereum and Bitcoin dominate, Layer Brett is quickly positioning itself as a major new player. Its presale offers $LBRETT at just $0.0042, giving early investors a chance to buy before a possible bull run. Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2, Layer Brett delivers fast, low-cost, and secure transactions. Unlike hype-driven meme coins, it offers real benefits, including a reducing APY that rewards early participants with rates initially as high as 30,000%. There’s no KYC, ensuring a fully decentralized experience where holders keep full control. Presale buyers are also entered into a $1 million giveaway. The project has a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, with 30% allocated to presale, 25% for staking, and 15% for ecosystem growth. With staking, NFT integration, and a DAO on the roadmap, Layer Brett is positioning itself as the next 100x meme coin and one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Ethereum Nears ATH as Price Targets Climb but Analysts Warn of Risks Ethereum (ETH) has surged 9.17% in the last week, pushing the token close to its all-time high. This rally has renewed optimism in the market, with Standard Chartered raising its year-end ETH price target to $7,500. The strong move has also reignited institutional interest, with the bank forecasting Ethereum could reach $7,000 by December 2025. Source However, not all analysts are convinced the rally will continue. Crypto Patel warned that Ethereum recently broke a rising trendline and confirmed this with a bearish retest. According to him, this could signal a potential correction even as bullish sentiment remains high. Bitcoin Price Falls to $117K as Inflation Data Sparks Market Sell-Off Bitcoin price plummeted on Friday (August 15th) to $117,000 due to inflation data in the United States that sparked widespread panic over global markets. Bitcoin price had previously briefly touched over the 123,000 mark at earlier points in the week before pulling back. At this point, analysts are closely observing whether or not a more general bullish trend can be sustained in the face of increasing economic uncertainties and a general increase in market volatility. Source The risk-off sentiment across crypto markets resulted in over 1 billion dollars in liquidations of the top tokens, including Ethereum. Bitcoin traded between $116,953 and $119,198, marking a 0.89% decline. Panic-driven sell-offs have left investors questioning the market’s next direction. Layer Brett Presale Heats Up as Investors Eye Massive Staking Rewards With its presale moving fast and staking APYs at record levels, Layer Brett is separating itself from giants like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The project is built on a Layer 2 network designed for speed, scalability, and rewards that dwarf most competitors. Early buyers have a shrinking window to secure $LBRETT at low entry prices and stake for potentially life-changing returns. Positioned as the top gainer crypto of 2025, Layer Brett is fueling the next big meme coin revolution. Get in now on the $LBRETT presale before the wider market catches on.

50276515,https://finbold.com/?p=251236,1755508688,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Top crypto researcher says ‘Bitcoin will collapse’ in 7 to 11 Years,https://finbold.com/top-crypto-researcher-says-bitcoin-will-collapse-in-7-to-11-years/,"Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, a cryptocurrency investment firm, has warned that the chances of Bitcoin ( BTC ) collapsing in the coming years remain high. Bons pointed to diminishing block rewards, which are set to fall to 0.39 Bitcoin by 2036 under the current halving schedule. At today’s prices, this would translate to an annual security budget of roughly $2.3 billion, an amount he deems insufficient to protect a network with a potential market cap in the trillions, he said in an X post on August 17. This decline, he argued, could make it economically feasible for attackers to launch 51% attacks, enabling them to manipulate transactions and undermine trust in the system. The cryptocurrency researcher also highlighted the limitations of Bitcoin’s current governance structure. He contends that the Bitcoin Core development team, which controls key updates, has resisted increasing block sizes or allowing inflation beyond the 21 million coin cap. This rigidity, dating back to the 2015–2017 block size debates, could trigger a chain split or inflation, destabilizing the network. Bons also warned that advances in quantum computing may crack Bitcoin’s cryptographic protections, particularly in older wallets. Therefore, this combination of internal economic weaknesses and external technological risks forms the basis of his 7 to 11-year collapse timeline. BTC will collapse between 7 to 11 years from now! First, the mining industry will fall, as the security budget shrinks Then the network will be attacked (censorship & 51% attacks) Core will then have to increase inflation beyond 21M, splitting the chain & that will be the end! — Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) August 17, 2025 Quantum computing threat It is worth noting that while Bons warns of Bitcoin’s collapse, citing several factors, much of the general debate centers on the potential impact of quantum computers, with experts divided on the timeline. As reported by Finbold, most agree that quantum computing will inevitably threaten Bitcoin, but differ on when. For example, Google’s Craig Gidney sees a risk window between 2030 and 2035, while Blockstream’s Adam Back believes it’s at least two decades away. Others, such as Naoris Protocol’s David Carvalho and investor Chamath Palihapitiya, caution it could happen within five years, putting as much as 30% of all coins at risk.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $3,648.58 and a minimum price of $3,192.51. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $5,928.95 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Binance coin Token BNB Price $830.8 (-2.66%) Market Cap $115.79B Trading Volume (24-hour) $2.52B Circulating Supply 139.28M BNB All-time High $866.96 Aug 14, 2025 All-time Low $0.09611 Oct 19, 2017 24-hour High $862.74 24-hour Low $826.85 Binance coin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility 4.23% 50-Day SMA $746.71 14-Day RSI 68.62 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 60 (Greed) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 200-Day SMA $646.57 Binance coin price analysis: BNB corrects near its ATH, drops toward $830 TL;DR Breakdown: Binance Coin price analysis confirmed a downtrend as it declines toward $830 Cryptocurrency lost 2.66% of its value. BNB coin looks for support around $819. On August 18, 2025, Binance Coin price analysis revealed a corrective trend. The coin’s value dipped to $830.8 today, as it lost buying momentum near its all-time high price. According to an overall analysis, the altcoin lost 2.66 percent of its worth. The coin is still trending in its higher price envelope, but the current situation hints at traders booking profits, which has created somewhat unfavorable conditions for the intraday traders. BNB/USDT price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of Binance Coin confirmed a downward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value has decreased to $830.8. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies a selling momentum in the market. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating resistance, has shifted to $868.6, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $730.1. BNB/USDT Price Chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 59.66 in the past 24 hours. This decrease confirms rising selling activity in the market. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin also confirmed a downward trend for the altcoin. The BNB/USD value has corrected to $830.7 in the past few hours. A strong downswing was observed a few hours back, and currently, the coin is still under correction. The Bollinger Bands are maintaining a narrow distance, resulting in mild volatility. The mild volatility signifies a lesser chance of an upcoming reversal. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $864.5, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $814.9, marking the immediate support level. BNB/USDT 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has been flattening out at 45.04 for the past few hours.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $830.8 in the past 24 hours. If investors continue booking profits, BNB price might see a further correction, and the next target could be $818. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,928.95 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $830.8, but it may find support around $818. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 2.66 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,928.95 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. Heading into August, BNB is trading at approximately $767.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-18 09:20:00

For those tracking global finance, the current challenges facing the Indian Rupee are a prime example of this interconnectedness. As the specter of new US tariffs and the ongoing implications of Russian oil sanctions loom large, India’s currency finds itself at a critical juncture. Understanding these pressures is not just for economists; it offers vital insights into broader market stability and potential shifts in global trade dynamics that can influence investment decisions across all asset classes. What Role Do US Tariffs Play in Pressuring the Indian Rupee? The imposition of tariffs by major economies, particularly the United States, can significantly disrupt global trade flows and currency valuations. When the US considers or implements new tariffs, it creates a cascade of effects that can directly and indirectly impact the Indian Rupee . Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. Their primary goal is often to protect domestic industries or to exert political leverage. For India, the impact of potential US tariffs can be multifaceted: Reduced Export Competitiveness: If the US imposes tariffs on Indian goods, Indian exports become more expensive for American buyers. This can lead to a decrease in demand for Indian products, subsequently reducing India’s export earnings. A decline in export revenue means fewer US dollars flowing into India, which can weaken the Rupee against the dollar. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can force companies to re-evaluate their global supply chains. If Indian components or finished goods face tariffs, multinational corporations might seek alternative suppliers outside India. This shift can further hurt India’s manufacturing sector and its overall trade balance. Investor Sentiment: The uncertainty surrounding trade disputes can deter foreign direct investment (FDI) into India. International investors might become hesitant to commit capital if they perceive a risk of trade wars impacting profitability. Reduced FDI can lead to capital outflows, putting downward pressure on the Indian Rupee . Inflationary Pressures: While tariffs are on imports, their impact can ripple through the domestic economy. If India retaliates with its own tariffs on US goods, or if the cost of imported components rises due to tariffs, domestic production costs can increase, contributing to inflation. Historically, trade tensions have proven to be significant drivers of currency volatility. The prospect of renewed trade friction between major economies creates an environment of caution for investors, often leading to a flight to perceived safer assets, and a depreciation of emerging market currencies like the Indian Rupee . How Do Russian Oil Sanctions Affect India’s Energy Security and the Rupee? India is a major oil importer, and global crude oil prices have a profound impact on its economy and currency. The sanctions imposed on Russian oil by Western nations, while creating opportunities for India to purchase discounted crude, also introduce complex challenges that weigh on the Indian Rupee . Here’s how Russian Oil Sanctions play out for India: Balancing Act of Discounted Oil: India has been a significant buyer of discounted Russian crude oil since the sanctions began. This has provided some relief to its import bill, potentially saving billions of dollars. However, this strategy comes with geopolitical risks, as it can strain relationships with Western allies who are enforcing the sanctions. Global Oil Price Volatility: Despite India’s access to discounted Russian oil, the broader global crude oil market remains volatile due to the sanctions. Any disruption in supply, or changes in demand, can send prices soaring. Higher global oil prices directly increase India’s import bill in US dollars, leading to a higher demand for dollars and thus weakening the Indian Rupee . Inflationary Impact: Energy costs are a significant component of inflation. Even with discounted Russian oil, the overall elevated global energy prices contribute to higher domestic fuel costs, impacting transportation, manufacturing, and consumer prices. This persistent inflation erodes the purchasing power of the Rupee. Current Account Deficit Pressure: India runs a current account deficit, largely driven by its energy imports. High global oil prices exacerbate this deficit, meaning India is spending more foreign currency on imports than it earns from exports. A widening current account deficit is a classic indicator of currency weakness. The geopolitical landscape surrounding Russian Oil Sanctions is constantly evolving. While India has navigated this terrain adeptly so far, the long-term implications for energy security, trade relations, and the consistent pressure on the Indian Rupee remain a critical concern. What Are the Indian Rupee’s Vulnerabilities in the Current Global Economy? Beyond the specific pressures from US tariffs and Russian Oil Sanctions , the Indian Rupee faces inherent vulnerabilities stemming from India’s economic structure and its integration into the Global Economy . These factors amplify the impact of external shocks. Key vulnerabilities include: High Dependence on Oil Imports: As mentioned, India imports over 80% of its crude oil requirements. This makes the Rupee highly susceptible to global oil price fluctuations. A surge in oil prices quickly translates into a higher import bill and a weaker currency. Current Account Deficit (CAD): India consistently runs a CAD, meaning its total value of imports (goods, services, and transfers) exceeds its total value of exports. While services exports often offset some of this, a persistent deficit indicates a structural demand for foreign currency, which naturally pressures the Rupee. Inflationary Pressures: Inflation remains a persistent challenge for India. High food and fuel prices, combined with global supply chain issues, contribute to a high inflation rate. To combat inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) often raises interest rates, which can attract foreign capital but also slow domestic economic growth. Capital Flows and Foreign Exchange Reserves: Emerging markets like India are sensitive to global capital flows. When global interest rates rise (e.g., in the US), foreign investors may pull capital out of India to seek higher returns elsewhere. Such capital outflows deplete India’s foreign exchange reserves, reducing the RBI’s ability to intervene and support the Rupee. Global Economic Slowdown: A slowdown in the Global Economy directly impacts demand for Indian exports, reducing foreign currency inflows. This broader economic environment also affects investor confidence, leading to cautious capital allocation. The confluence of these internal and external factors creates a complex challenge for policymakers aiming to stabilize the Indian Rupee and maintain economic growth. The Rupee’s performance is a barometer of India’s economic health and its resilience against global headwinds. How Does the Forex Market React to Geopolitical and Economic Pressures? The Forex Market , or foreign exchange market, is the largest and most liquid financial market globally. It is where currencies are traded, and their values are determined by supply and demand. Geopolitical events and economic pressures like those facing the Indian Rupee cause immediate and significant reactions in this market. Here’s how the Forex Market typically responds: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty breeds volatility. When news of potential tariffs or escalating sanctions emerges, currency traders react swiftly, leading to sharp movements in exchange rates. The Rupee, being an emerging market currency, often experiences heightened volatility during such periods. Flight to Safety: During times of global instability, investors often move their capital into perceived ‘safe-haven’ currencies like the US Dollar, Japanese Yen, or Swiss Franc. This increases demand for these currencies and puts downward pressure on riskier or emerging market currencies, including the Indian Rupee . Impact on Carry Trade: The carry trade involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a high-interest-rate currency to profit from the interest rate differential. When economic or geopolitical risks rise, the perceived risk of the high-interest currency increases, leading to an unwinding of carry trades. This means investors sell the higher-yielding currency (like the Rupee) to repay their loans in the lower-yielding one, further weakening the Rupee. Central Bank Intervention: Central banks, like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), closely monitor currency movements. If the Rupee depreciates too rapidly or excessively, the RBI may intervene in the Forex Market by selling US dollars from its foreign exchange reserves to buy Rupees. This increases the demand for Rupees, aiming to stabilize its value. However, such interventions are limited by the size of the reserves. Hedging Activities: Businesses engaged in international trade use the Forex Market to hedge against currency risks. During uncertain times, hedging costs can increase as demand for currency derivatives rises, impacting the profitability of international transactions. For investors, including those in the crypto space, understanding these dynamics is crucial. A weaker Rupee can impact the cost of international transactions, the value of dollar-denominated assets, and the overall economic sentiment that influences investment flows into various markets. Challenges and Opportunities for India The current environment presents both significant challenges and potential long-term opportunities for India. Challenges: Inflationary Spiral: The combination of high oil prices, potential tariff-induced cost increases, and a weakening Rupee can create a difficult inflationary spiral, impacting household budgets and corporate profits. Widening Trade Deficit: Despite efforts to boost exports, the pressures from imports (especially energy) and potential tariff barriers can lead to a sustained and widening trade deficit. Debt Burden: A depreciating Rupee makes dollar-denominated external debt more expensive to service for Indian companies and the government. Reduced Foreign Investment: Sustained uncertainty and economic headwinds can deter foreign capital inflows, which are vital for infrastructure development and economic growth. Opportunities: Boost to Domestic Manufacturing: Tariffs on imports could, in the long run, incentivize domestic production, aligning with the ‘Make in India’ initiative. Diversification of Trade Partners: The need to navigate sanctions and tariffs can push India to diversify its trade relationships and seek new markets for its exports and imports. Renewable Energy Push: The volatility in fossil fuel prices underscores the urgency for India to accelerate its transition to renewable energy sources, reducing its reliance on imported oil. Structural Reforms: The pressure points can act as catalysts for deeper economic reforms aimed at improving ease of doing business, attracting investment, and boosting productivity. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Economic Headwinds Given the complex interplay of global economic forces, what can businesses, individuals, and policymakers do to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities? For Businesses: Diversify Supply Chains: Reduce over-reliance on single countries for imports or exports. Explore new markets and sourcing options to build resilience against tariffs and geopolitical risks. Hedge Currency Exposure: For companies with significant international trade, actively manage foreign exchange risk through hedging instruments to protect profit margins from Rupee depreciation. Focus on Value-Added Exports: Shift towards exporting higher-value goods and services that are less price-sensitive to tariffs. Embrace Digitalization: Leverage technology to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and explore new digital export opportunities. For Individuals and Investors: Monitor Inflation: Keep a close eye on inflation trends as it impacts purchasing power and investment returns. Adjust investment strategies accordingly, considering inflation-indexed instruments. Diversify Investments: Beyond traditional assets, consider a diversified portfolio that might include exposure to international equities or assets that historically perform well during periods of currency volatility, keeping in mind individual risk tolerance. Financial Planning: Prioritize debt reduction and building an emergency fund. A weaker Rupee can make foreign travel and education more expensive. Stay Informed: Regularly follow news on global trade, energy markets, and central bank policies to make informed financial decisions. For Policymakers: Fiscal Prudence: Maintain fiscal discipline to avoid adding to inflationary pressures and to preserve resources for counter-cyclical measures. Boost Domestic Production: Implement policies that genuinely support domestic manufacturing, reduce import dependence, and enhance export competitiveness. Strengthen Forex Reserves: Continue to build robust foreign exchange reserves to provide a buffer against external shocks and enable market intervention when necessary. Diplomatic Engagement: Engage proactively in international forums to advocate for fair trade practices and manage geopolitical risks related to energy security. A Resilient Path Forward for the Indian Rupee? The Indian Rupee is undoubtedly facing a challenging period, caught between the crosscurrents of potential US tariffs and the complex implications of Russian Oil Sanctions . These external pressures, combined with India’s inherent economic vulnerabilities, demand careful navigation by policymakers, businesses, and individuals alike. While the immediate outlook may present headwinds, India’s underlying economic strengths, including its large domestic market and growing digital economy, offer a foundation for resilience. The ability to adapt to changing global dynamics, pursue strategic reforms, and diversify economic relationships will be key to ensuring the long-term stability and strength of the Indian Rupee within the volatile Global Economy and Forex Market . The journey ahead will test India’s economic fortitude, but with prudent management and adaptive strategies, a path towards stability and growth remains achievable.

President Simon Gerovich said on X on Monday that Metaplanet purchased the additional 775 BTC at an average price of $120,006 each. The purchase lifts holdings to 18,888 BTC, acquired for $1.94 billion at an average cost of $102,653 per bitcoin. “18,888 BTC. Onward and upward,” Gerovich wrote. Metaplanet began its bitcoin accumulation plan in April 2024 and now ranks seventh globally in bitcoin holdings, according to Bitcointreasuries . The company reported strong second-quarter results last week. Total revenue reached 1.2 billion yen ($8.4 million), up 41% quarter-on-quarter, the report said. Net income swung to 11.1 billion yen ($75.1 million), from a loss of 5 billion yen ($34.2 million) in the first quarter. “We continue to project full-year revenue of 3.4 billion yen and operating profit of 2.5 billion yen, supported by recurring cash-secured-put premiums and operational performance,” the company said in the second-quarter filing. Metaplant introduced BTC-backed yield curve plan In its Q2 earnings presentation, Metaplanet also unveiled “Metaplanet Prefs” and an aim to build a BTC-backed yield curve in Japan. “As Japan’s largest public holder of Bitcoin, we aim to set a new standard in the Japanese fixed income market by introducing BTC-backed credit through Perpetual Preferred Equity,” the company said. It noted that issuing different preferred equity instruments can approximate a yield curve using each instrument’s Macaulay duration. Metaplanet recently filed a ¥555 billion shelf registration for two series of perpetual preferred shares, each yielding 6%. The move mirrors what Strategy (MSTR) has done over the course of this year. Metaplanet’s shares fell 8.6% to close at 866 yen on Friday in Japan, according to Yahoo Finance. The stock was up 0.6% around midday Monday with the market still open. “I hear the disappointment in the recent pullback,” Gerovich said on Sunday. “It’s natural to feel that way. But what gives us conviction is the foundation we are building.” He added that the firm’s bitcoin income-generation business has grown for three straight quarters. “This recurring income adds resilience and supports further accumulation,” he said. “This also gives us flexibility to service potential future financing to enhance our treasury operations.” Bitcoin slips to $115k after July surge Bitcoin was down 2.1% in the past 24 hours, trading at $115,305 as of 12:10 a.m. ET Monday. Cryptopolitan’s analysts linked the rise in July to post-halving trends and say this cycle could peak around September 2025.

With the global market cap stabilizing above $3.9 trillion, investors are becoming more selective, focusing on projects that can survive beyond a single bull cycle. This shift toward sustainability has created space for projects like Moonshot MAGAX, a presale token blending meme culture with practical blockchain utility. Long-term investors, in particular, are paying attention. Instead of speculating on short-term pumps, they’re looking for tokens that can build ecosystems, attract communities, and offer real rewards. MAGAX is aligning with that mindset. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Anchors of Stability Bitcoin remains the market’s “digital gold,” while Ethereum powers much of the decentralized infrastructure. These tier-one assets are indispensable to the crypto ecosystem and continue to attract institutional adoption. But their very maturity limits upside. While Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely deliver steady returns, they won’t offer the exponential gains that smaller, innovative projects can provide. This is where presales like Moonshot MAGAX stand out. MAGAX: The Meme-to-Earn Innovation At its core, Moonshot MAGAX is not just a meme coin—it’s a Meme-to-Earn ecosystem powered by Loomint AI. This model allows users to earn rewards for creating, sharing, and amplifying viral content. By tying cultural influence directly to blockchain economics, MAGAX creates a decentralized content economy where value flows to those who shape online culture. This is a fundamental shift from the typical meme coin narrative. Instead of relying solely on speculative hype, MAGAX builds a system where community activity drives real token utility. For investors who want to bet on both meme culture and blockchain mechanics, this dual appeal is a rare find. Why Long-Term Investors Are Interested Several factors explain why MAGAX is drawing serious attention: Low Entry Point: The presale offers a chance to buy in before MAGAX lists on exchanges, providing the kind of asymmetrical upside early investors look for. Practical Utility: Unlike most meme coins, MAGAX integrates AI-powered rewards and governance, giving it a roadmap beyond hype. Community-First Model: Through DAO governance, users shape the project’s future, reinforcing its long-term resilience. For long-term investors, these features signal a project built to last rather than fade. Rewarding Early Community Growth The team behind Moonshot MAGAX is focused on building a committed community from the ground up, not just attracting passive holders. They've introduced exclusive reward programs and incentives designed to thank early participants for their trust and commitment. This approach builds a foundation of loyalty and ensures that the project’s success is a shared victory. These early-stage initiatives are crucial for cultivating the kind of engaged user base that can drive long-term value. A More Realistic Approach Unlike speculative meme tokens that promise overnight riches, Moonshot MAGAX positions itself with a more realistic vision. Its value proposition isn’t built on false guarantees but on measurable engagement and transparent growth. This honesty appeals to the kind of investors who have seen cycles come and go. They know sustainable projects must combine strong communities, innovative models, and transparency—and MAGAX checks all three boxes. Why MAGAX Could Be a Project to Watch Meme coins will continue to play a role in the market, but MAGAX represents an evolution: a meme coin with structure, governance, and long-term potential. Investors tired of quick hype cycles may find MAGAX’s steady approach refreshing—and rewarding. Its Meme-to-Earn economy could be the bridge between internet culture and blockchain adoption, bringing creators, sharers, and investors together under one tokenized system. A Real Project With Real Verification The crypto space is full of presales that make bold claims but lack substance. Moonshot MAGAX is different. By merging meme culture with AI-driven economics and DAO governance, it offers a tangible vision for the future of content economies. To add to its credibility, Moonshot MAGAX has also secured a Certik Audit Certificate , a critical milestone that reassures investors this isn’t just another speculative presale—it’s a project built on transparency and security. With its Limited-Time Drop (+5% bonus tokens using MAGAX_EARLY ) and a strong long-term vision, Moonshot MAGAX is already separating itself from the noise. For patient investors looking for the next breakout project, this may be the one to watch in 2025.

50277230,558805,1755509983,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50277230.jpeg,Best Meme Coins to Watch as NFTs Make a Comeback,https://bitcoinist.com/nfts-make-a-comback/,"No, you’re not dreaming — NFTs have indeed made a comeback over the past several weeks, primarily driven by Ethereum’s recent surge. While a far cry from the heyday back in 2021, this recent surge should grab the attention of investors looking for assets available at a steep discount. This should shift attention back to the best meme coins. Top new entrants like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) are currently on presale, letting you snap them up cheaply before they’re listed on exchanges. NFTs: Back on the Menu? According to CoinMarketCap , the NFT market saw a 62.72% increase in its market capitalization over the last 30 days, peaking at $28.4B on August 15. This growth has mainly been driven by Ethereum’s rise in the last few weeks, with its price breaking past the $4K level for the first time since late 2024. As many NFTs are on the Ethereum blockchain, $ETH’s rise has also caused the values of these digital assets to increase. In fact, the top 10 NFTs based on market capitalization are all on the Ethereum blockchain, led by CryptoPunks with a $2.1B market cap, based on NFT Price Floor data . From Bitcoin to $ETH: Why Institutions Are Rotating to Ethereum A rebound of the value of NFTs could attract investors looking for alternative investments to the tried-and-tested Bitcoin. We already see this in the rise of Ethereum treasuries among businesses racing to be the top holder of the #1 altcoin. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, up nearly 20% over the past 30 days compared to Bitcoin’s down 3%. This divergence suggests the beginning of “altcoin season,” where investors seek higher returns in non-BTC assets AInvest reported that institutional investors and corporate treasuries now hold about 8% of the total $ETH supply, up from just 3% in April. This shows the speed at which these institutions are stockpiling this asset, a trend that we can expect to continue. Meme Coins Jump the Bandwagon But it’s not just NFTs that are turning heads these days. Meme coins continue to gain momentum too, as they offer investors the chance to snap up low-cap digital assets with high growth potential. With a market cap of $68.1B, the right meme coins have proven to be a gold mine for degens and more adventurous investors. Those on presale are even cheaper with potentially even higher upside, such as: 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – The Secret to Finding Hot Tokens It’s notoriously difficult to find the next big thing in the crypto market. There are simply too many launches to keep track of and so little time to research them. This situation increases your risk of landing duds and even downright scams if you’re not careful. Enter Snorter Token ($SNORT) . This token presale aims to raise funds for the development of Snorter Bot, a crypto trading bot for Telegram. Once launched, this promises to speed up how you find and snap up promising tokens. You can do practically all your trading within the bot, including sniping, managing your portfolio, and copying trades. Most importantly, it has a rugpull and honeypot detection feature, which helps protect your funds from hackers and scammers. As one of this year’s best new crypto , Snorter Token has already raised over $2.7M. You can still join and get $SNORT for only $0.1015, but there’s a price increase coming in a few hours, so act quickly. If you prefer to stake your tokens, you can currently enjoy rewards at 138% APY. A reward rate this high makes supporting the network extra enticing. Take note, though, that this can still change as more people lock in their tokens. You can HODL $SNORT too and use it to get unlimited snipes and other perks. According to our Snorter Token price prediction , it also has some real upside, as its value could reach as much as $3.25 in 2030. Get your Snorter Token today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – More Than Just a Way to Store Your Crypto As your crypto portfolio grows, so does the need to store your assets somewhere secure like Best Wallet . As a non-custodial crypto wallet, Best Wallet gives you total control over your private keys. This means only you can access your keys to sign your transactions and prove ownership of your crypto. Best Wallet lets you trade, swap, and sell over 1000 different cryptos and even find the best new presales in its Token Launchpad. It’s available for both iOS and Android devices, making it easy to install and convenient to use on the go. Powering the wallet is its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which gives you additional perks, like low transaction fees, governance rights, and early-bird access to the newest token presales. To date, the presale has raised over $14.9M and shows no signs of slowing down. To get your $BEST tokens, simply go to the Best Wallet presale page and get them for only $0.025495 each. Our Best Wallet Token buying guide has all the details to get you started. Join the Best Wallet Token presale. 3. Bitcoin Penguins ($BPENGU) – Stand to Win 1 $BTC Weekly Not all of us have the patience to HODL and wait for our tokens to appreciate, and that’s perfectly fine. This is why the Bitcoin Penguins ($BPENGU) presale exists. It’s a token presale from July 28 to August 27, letting you get in and out quickly. There are also 15 price increases, with a 5% increase in price with each stage. That means if you went in at Stage 1, your tokens will appreciate by 98% by Stage 15. The project also gives you the chance to earn Bitcoins with its weekly $BTC giveaway. With only a little over a week before the presale closes, this could be your last chance to get $BPENGU cheaply. It’s currently being sold for $0.00171 each and offers staking for as much as 100% APY. Learn more about the $BPENGU presale. Time to Buy the Dip? Despite the resurgence of NFTs, they’re still going for a steal compared to their peak around 2021. That means now’s a great time to buy before they potentially soar again. Alternatively, check out the best meme coins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . They’re currently on presale, which means, like NFTs, they’re available for cheap and offer high growth potential before they’re listed on exchanges.

South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb recently made an important announcement that impacts many users: a temporary suspension of ZRC deposits and withdrawals . This move, while seemingly restrictive, is a standard procedure in the crypto space, often signaling significant underlying network improvements. Let’s delve into the details of this upcoming change and what it means for Zircuit (ZRC) token holders. Why is Bithumb Suspending ZRC Deposits and Withdrawals? Bithumb officially announced on its website that it will temporarily suspend ZRC deposits and withdrawals starting at 09:00 UTC on August 25. This suspension is not arbitrary; it is specifically scheduled to support the Zircuit (ZRC) network’s upcoming mainnet upgrade. A mainnet upgrade is a significant event for any blockchain project, essentially an overhaul or improvement to the core network. Ensuring Data Integrity: During a major upgrade, exchanges often halt transactions to prevent any loss of funds or data inconsistencies that could arise from network changes. Smooth Transition: Suspending ZRC deposits and withdrawals allows Bithumb to ensure a seamless transition for ZRC tokens on its platform to the new, upgraded mainnet. Security Enhancements: Upgrades frequently include security patches and improvements, and a temporary halt ensures the exchange can adapt its systems without exposing user assets. What Does This ZRC Suspension Mean for You? For ZRC token holders, this announcement requires attention. If you hold ZRC on Bithumb, or if you plan to move ZRC tokens to or from the exchange around the specified date, understanding the implications is key. The temporary halt means that any attempts to initiate ZRC deposits and withdrawals after 09:00 UTC on August 25 will not be processed until the suspension is lifted. It’s important to remember that this is a temporary measure, not a permanent delisting or a sign of instability. Exchanges frequently implement such suspensions for various reasons, including: Network upgrades and hard forks. Wallet maintenance or system upgrades. Compliance checks or regulatory adjustments. Always refer to Bithumb’s official announcements for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the resumption of services. Navigating the ZRC Mainnet Upgrade The Zircuit mainnet upgrade is a positive development for the project, indicating growth and technical advancement. For users, the primary actionable insight is to plan any necessary ZRC deposits and withdrawals well in advance of the August 25 deadline. If you need to move your ZRC tokens, ensure you complete these transactions before the specified time. Key actions to consider: Check Your Wallet: Verify your ZRC holdings on Bithumb or other platforms. Plan Ahead: If you intend to deposit or withdraw ZRC, do so before the August 25 deadline. Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official website or announcements for updates on the upgrade’s progress and the resumption of services. Avoid Last-Minute Transactions: Transactions initiated close to the suspension time might face delays or complications. This proactive approach will help you avoid any inconvenience during the upgrade period. The temporary suspension of ZRC deposits and withdrawals is a testament to Bithumb’s commitment to supporting the Zircuit network’s evolution and ensuring a secure environment for its users. In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to suspend ZRC deposits and withdrawals is a standard, necessary step to facilitate the Zircuit network’s mainnet upgrade. While it requires users to be mindful of the upcoming deadline, it ultimately contributes to the long-term health and security of the ZRC ecosystem. By staying informed and planning ahead, ZRC holders can navigate this period smoothly, confident that their assets are being handled with care during this important technical transition.

50277357,558879,1755510213,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50277357.jpeg,XRP của Ripple không thể thay thế SWIFT? Một chuyên gia nói rằng đồng tiền mã hóa này mới là lựa chọn phù hợp hơn,https://bitcoinist.com/ripples-xrp-cannot-replace-swift-expert-analysis-vn/,"Ripple từ lâu đã bày tỏ tham vọng thách thức và cuối cùng thay thế SWIFT như nền tảng cốt lõi của các khoản thanh toán xuyên biên giới toàn cầu. CEO Brad Garlinghouse của Ripple đã công khai chỉ trích sự kém hiệu quả của SWIFT và nhấn mạnh rằng công ty đặt mục tiêu chiếm tới 14% thị phần trong thị trường thanh toán hàng nghìn tỷ đô la trong vòng 5 năm tới. Tuy nhiên, mặc dù tính ứng dụng của XRP trong việc hỗ trợ các giao dịch gần như tức thì đã giúp duy trì câu chuyện “XRP thay thế SWIFT” suốt nhiều năm, một chuyên gia lại cho rằng thực tế có thể đang chỉ ra một hướng đi khác. XRP không thể thay thế SWIFT Mục tiêu của Ripple là cạnh tranh với SWIFT và giành lấy một phần lớn trong số 5 nghìn tỷ USD giao dịch mà mạng lưới này xử lý mỗi ngày. Tuy nhiên, theo Zach Rynes – người giữ vai trò liên lạc cộng đồng tại Chainlink – ý tưởng về việc XRP thay thế SWIFT không phản ánh đúng những gì thực sự đang diễn ra phía sau hậu trường. Trong một bài đăng trên nền tảng mạng xã hội X, Rynes nhấn mạnh rằng SWIFT hiện đã bắt đầu tích hợp công nghệ blockchain thông qua quan hệ hợp tác với Chainlink. Các báo cáo cho thấy SWIFT hiện đang sử dụng cơ sở hạ tầng của Chainlink để kết nối hơn 11.500 ngân hàng thành viên SWIFT với cả blockchain công khai lẫn riêng tư. Mức độ tích hợp này không chỉ hiện đại hóa mạng lưới sẵn có của SWIFT mà còn cho phép họ tương tác với tài sản được mã hóa và các nền tảng hợp đồng thông minh mà không cần từ bỏ các mối quan hệ ngân hàng toàn cầu đã được thiết lập. Những người ủng hộ như Zack Rynes cũng lập luận rằng điều này đặt SWIFT ngang hàng với những tiến bộ blockchain của Ripple, đồng thời xóa bỏ mọi lợi thế mà Ripple có được trước đây. Do đó, cuộc cạnh tranh giành ưu thế trong lĩnh vực thanh toán toàn cầu có thể không phải là kịch bản Ripple thay thế hoàn toàn SWIFT, mà nếu SWIFT có thể bắt kịp thông qua các đối tác như Chainlink – và thậm chí khiến đồng tiền tiện ích LINK trở thành một loại tiền mã hóa thể chế tốt hơn. Quan hệ hợp tác giữa SWIFT và Chainlink Mối quan hệ giữa SWIFT và Chainlink bắt đầu từ năm 2016, khi Chainlink (lúc đó được gọi là SmartContract.com) tham gia và giành chiến thắng trong cuộc thi khởi nghiệp do SWIFT tổ chức. Tuy nhiên, quan hệ hợp tác này chỉ thực sự tăng tốc trong vài năm gần đây. Vào tháng 9/2022, SWIFT và Chainlink đã công bố bằng chứng ban đầu về khả năng hoạt động (proof-of-concept) sử dụng Giao thức Tương tác Chuỗi chéo (CCIP) của Chainlink tại sự kiện SmartCon 2022. Đến tháng 8/2023, SWIFT đã tiến hành thử nghiệm proof-of-concept thành công (với sự tham gia của các tổ chức như ANZ, BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon và Citi) dựa trên CCIP của Chainlink. Thử nghiệm này đã phát triển thành những trường hợp sử dụng thực tế, với hàng nghìn ngân hàng thành viên SWIFT trên toàn cầu. Đáng chú ý, những bước tiến gần đây cùng Chainlink cũng chứng kiến sự quan tâm mạnh mẽ từ các nhà đầu tư lớn đối với LINK, kèm theo việc các “cá voi” tích lũy mạnh mẽ. Tại thời điểm viết bài, LINK đang được giao dịch ở mức 21,40 USD, lần đầu tiên vượt trên 20 USD kể từ tháng 2. Trong khi đó, Ripple cũng đang mở rộng hợp tác trong nỗ lực cạnh tranh với SWIFT. Sự hợp tác này bao gồm cả Ngân hàng Trung ương châu Âu (ECB) và Ngân hàng Nhật Bản, những tổ chức hiện đang xem xét cơ sở hạ tầng của Ripple song song với SWIFT. Một lựa chọn tiềm năng khác: Bitcoin Hyper Trong khi SWIFT, Ripple và Chainlink đang cạnh tranh để hiện đại hóa hệ sinh thái thanh toán toàn cầu, một dự án mới nổi mang tên Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) đang thu hút sự chú ý mạnh mẽ. Đây là giải pháp Layer-2 được xây dựng trên mạng Bitcoin, nhằm mang lại khả năng mở rộng, tốc độ giao dịch gần như tức thì và hỗ trợ hợp đồng thông minh, đồng thời vẫn duy trì tính bảo mật của Bitcoin.

In less than a week, the NFT market cap dramatically shed $1.2 billion, plummeting to $8.1 billion. This sharp decline arrived hand-in-hand with a notable drop in Ethereum’s value, highlighting the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem. Many popular collections felt the impact, but some surprising shifts occurred within the rankings. This article explores the recent downturn, its causes, and what it means for the future of non-fungible tokens. What Triggered the Sudden NFT Market Cap Drop? The primary driver behind the recent fall in the NFT market cap was the decline in Ethereum (ETH). Since most NFTs are minted and traded on the Ethereum blockchain, their value is often denominated in ETH. When Ethereum’s price falls against the U.S. dollar, the dollar value of NFTs naturally decreases, even if their ETH price remains stable. Data from NFT Price Floor, as cited by Cointelegraph, clearly illustrates this trend. The overall market value of NFTs directly mirrored Ethereum’s performance, underscoring the foundational role ETH plays in the NFT space. Interconnectedness: The NFT market is deeply tied to the underlying blockchain. Valuation Impact: ETH price fluctuations directly affect the USD valuation of NFTs. Market Sensitivity: Even minor shifts in ETH can lead to significant changes in the overall NFT market cap . Which Collections Felt the Brunt of the Shifting NFT Market Cap? While the overall NFT market cap declined, the impact was not uniform across all collections. Some of the most iconic projects, which typically command high values, experienced substantial losses. Conversely, a few collections showed remarkable resilience or even climbed the ranks. Here’s how some top collections fared: CryptoPunks: This pioneering collection, known for its pixelated avatars, saw sharp losses in its market valuation. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC): Another blue-chip collection, the Bored Apes also experienced significant depreciation, reflecting the broader market downturn. Pudgy Penguins: In a surprising turn, Pudgy Penguins climbed into second place by market cap, demonstrating unique strength amidst the overall decline. This indicates a potential shift in investor interest or a stronger community backing for this particular project. These movements highlight the dynamic nature of the NFT landscape, where sentiment and specific project developments can sometimes defy broader market trends. Navigating Volatility: What Does This NFT Market Cap Dip Mean? The recent dip in the NFT market cap serves as a crucial reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency and digital asset space. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these market dynamics is key to making informed decisions. It’s not just about the overall market; individual collections can behave very differently. Challenges presented by such market corrections include: Liquidity Concerns: During downturns, selling NFTs at desirable prices can become more difficult. Valuation Uncertainty: It becomes harder to accurately price assets when the underlying currency is unstable. Investor Confidence: Sustained drops can erode trust and slow down new investment. However, such periods can also present opportunities for those with a long-term perspective. Price corrections can sometimes clear out speculative froth, leaving stronger, more fundamentally sound projects. Looking Ahead: Is the NFT Market Cap Resilient? Despite the recent contraction, many experts believe the fundamental technology and artistic value of NFTs remain strong. The question isn’t necessarily if the NFT market cap will recover, but rather when and how it will evolve. The market may become more discerning, focusing on utility, community, and genuine artistic merit rather than pure speculation. Actionable insights for navigating this period include: Do Your Research: Always understand the project, its team, and its roadmap before investing. Diversify: Don’t put all your digital eggs in one basket. Long-Term View: Consider holding assets through market fluctuations if you believe in their long-term potential. Stay Informed: Keep up with market news and technical developments in the crypto and NFT space. The resilience of the NFT market will depend on continued innovation, adoption of real-world use cases, and the ability of projects to build strong, engaged communities. The recent 12% fall in the NFT market cap to $8.1 billion, largely influenced by Ethereum’s decline, underscores the volatile yet dynamic nature of the digital collectibles space. While blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes faced significant losses, the unexpected rise of Pudgy Penguins highlights shifting market preferences and the emergence of new leaders. This period of correction serves as a vital lesson in market interconnectedness and the importance of due diligence for anyone involved in NFTs. The market’s future will likely be shaped by a greater focus on utility, community, and sustained innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the recent drop in the NFT market cap? The primary cause was the decline in the price of Ethereum (ETH). Since most NFTs are traded using ETH, a drop in ETH’s value directly reduces the U.S. dollar equivalent of NFT valuations. 2. Which NFT collections were most affected by the market downturn? Prominent collections such as CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) experienced sharp losses in their market value during this period. 3. Did any NFT collections perform well during the decline? Yes, Pudgy Penguins notably climbed into second place by market cap, demonstrating resilience and increased investor interest despite the overall market downturn. 4. How is the NFT market cap calculated? The NFT market cap is typically calculated by aggregating the total market value of all non-fungible tokens, often based on their floor prices or last traded prices, converted into a common currency like USD. 5. What does this market volatility mean for NFT investors? Market volatility means investors should conduct thorough research, consider diversifying their portfolios, and potentially adopt a long-term investment strategy. It also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying asset (like Ethereum) that influences NFT values. Share Your Thoughts!

That said, Momentum indicators have had the opportunity to reset. The next upward impulse may very soon be on the way. Long liquidations crush the bulls The crypto market suffered one of its habitual bloodbaths on Sunday and into Monday, with more than half a billion dollars of value liquidated across the board. More than five times long to short traders were liquidated, showing that the bears were firmly in control. The new week has opened with the bulls attempting to stop the rot. Will there be another sharp flush down to the area of $112,000, or is the next upward impulse about to kick in? Is a reversal back to the upside on the way? Source: TradingView Not long after making an all-time high, the $BTC price plunged back down to the top of the bull flag, and has now dropped back inside. The bears are probably congratulating themselves on an important victory, but the short-term chart is suggesting that a reversal back to the upside could be on the way. The price action is currently sitting on some horizontal support, while only just above, the $115,800 level has recently become resistance. Which way will the price go? The two indicators at the bottom of the chart are signalling that it could be back to the upside. Firstly, the Stochastic RSI has its indicators just about at the bottom, which is also the case for all the other short-term indicators. Even the daily is now starting to approach the bottom. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has its indicator right at the boundary of the oversold level. When looking left at the history of the RSI for the 4-hour time frame it can be seen that the price will normally bounce from this position. Of course, there is always the chance of a further slip to the downside, but the evidence is that $BTC is becoming oversold, and so there is more likelihood of an upside move from here. A correction to the 0.786 Fibonacci level? Source: TradingView The daily chart for the $BTC price reveals how the price touched the $115,000 support level. Just below this is the 0.786, the deepest of the Fibonacci levels for the whole of this bull flag move. Coming back to this level is certainly a possibility. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) looks as though the descending trendline could get a perfect retest from the indicator line. This would likely be followed by a bounce back to the upside, which would probably be reflected by positivity in the price action above. Inverse head and shoulders pattern still valid Source: TradingView Zooming out a lot further in the same daily time frame, the inverse head and shoulders pattern is still a valid formation. A test of the neckline took place when the $BTC price fell through the bottom of its bull flag, and it could be that a retest might take place in this current retracement. It can also be seen that even though this dip is coming down deeply, it still has a way to go to make a lower low and start a mini downtrend. If this did happen, it could of course negate the inverse head and shoulders. As it stands, this is not the expected course of action but the market does have a perverse way of going against expectations. $117,000 becomes make-or-break level Source: TradingView Finally, right out in the macro view of the 2-week time frame, there are concerns for the bulls. Yet another 2-week candle body closed beneath the $117,000 resistance level. Also, another longish candle wick to the upside bears testimony to the power of the bears at what is becoming a make-or-break level. The ascending trendline, which marks the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, is squeezing the price into a tighter and narrower space, meaning that an explosion could come in one direction or the other. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are shaping to cross back down to the downside. This must be avoided by the bulls at all cost. The next two weeks will be vitally important.

In recent interviews and reports, Charles Hoskinson floated the idea that ADA could become the “yield layer” for Bitcoin DeFi, and even suggested a long-term price envelope of $80–$800 if that vision plays out. As the market weighs that claim, Remittix (RTX) keeps popping up on watchlists with a concrete, near-term catalyst investors can actually trade. Cardano (ADA): from today’s price to a “Bitcoin DeFi” rerate As of today, Cardano trades around $0.96–$0.97 with deep 24-hour liquidity. That keeps ADA within reach of psychological levels as flows rebuild. Hoskinson’s pitch goes like this: Bitcoin is unmatched for collateral and brand, but it lacks native yield. Cardano already runs staking and programmable DeFi. If ADA becomes the yield-bearing layer for Bitcoin DeFi, the addressable market could be massive, hence the headline valuation talk. Reports quoting the founder put an extremely long-term range at $80–$800 per ADA, tied to integrating BTC liquidity with Cardano’s programmability. Treat that as visionary framing, not a near-term target. Closer to earth, technicians and news desks keep flagging the same ladder for the next move: defend the dollar area, then push toward $1.13–$1.31, with stretch calls at $1.50 if breadth improves. Fresh rundowns from CryptoPotato , U.Today, and others all cite that $1.50 marker as the breakout magnet many models are using right now. Remittix (RTX): the payments play with a calendar catalyst While ADA’s Bitcoin DeFi thesis develops, Remittix offers a simpler near-term setup. RTX is building PayFi rails for low-fee, multi-chain transfers that land as money in bank accounts. The team has set a binary trigger that traders love. Recent press also confirms a September 15, 2025, wallet beta with Ethereum + Solana support and crypto-to-bank payouts across 30+ countries. Why RTX keeps landing on watchlists $20M → first CEX name reveal, Bitmart (public, tradable catalyst). Wallet beta Sept 15, 2025, with ETH + SOL connectivity. Crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries highlighted in releases. Ongoing coverage tracking funding in the $20M range. Narrative fit for Q3/Q4: “utility with dates,” not just vibes. Vision vs. verification for ADA If Cardano does become the Bitcoin DeFi yield layer, the upside narrative is huge; Hoskinson’s own numbers make that clear. But markets move on verification: in the near term, the ADA story still runs through reclaiming key levels and defending the dollar zone before any push toward $1.50. RTX, by contrast, gives you a dated headline and a product beta you can circle on the calendar. Many allocators are holding both ideas at once: vision with ADA, and timeline with RTX.

Imagine hundreds of millions of dollars shifting hands in an instant. This massive movement of digital assets often signals significant market activity, and understanding these transfers is key for anyone watching the crypto space closely. Understanding the Gigantic USDT Whale Transfer Recently, blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported an astonishing transaction: a staggering 652,228,192 USDT moved from an unidentified wallet directly to the OKX exchange. This single USDT whale transfer is valued at approximately $653 million, making it one of the largest on-chain movements observed in recent times. Such substantial transfers invariably capture the attention of traders and analysts alike. What is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning one USDT is intended to be worth one USD. It’s widely used for trading and transferring value across exchanges due to its stability and liquidity. Who is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains, providing transparency into significant fund movements. Why Does a USDT Whale Transfer to OKX Matter? When an unknown wallet sends such an immense amount of USDT to an exchange like OKX, it immediately raises questions about the intentions behind the move. Large inflows to exchanges can have several implications: Increased Liquidity: The funds could be intended for active trading, potentially increasing liquidity on OKX for various trading pairs. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Whales often use exchanges for large OTC transactions, which are private deals arranged directly between parties, bypassing public order books. This helps avoid significant price slippage. Preparation for Selling: While not always the case, a large inflow of stablecoins could precede significant buying activity, as traders might be positioning themselves to acquire other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, it could also signal an intention to convert other assets into stablecoins. Market Sentiment Indicator: These movements are often seen as indicators of market sentiment. A large stablecoin inflow might suggest a whale is preparing to “buy the dip” or simply moving funds for strategic purposes. This particular USDT whale transfer highlights the immense capital held by some individual or entity within the crypto ecosystem. Who Are These Crypto Whales? The term “crypto whale” refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency. Their actions, especially significant transfers like this USDT whale transfer , can sometimes influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of assets they control. These whales can be: Early investors who accumulated large sums when prices were low. Institutional investors or hedge funds. Mining pools or large-scale crypto businesses. Founders or developers of crypto projects. Their movements are closely watched because their buying or selling pressure can impact market prices, even if indirectly. For instance, if a whale transfers a large sum to an exchange and then starts selling, it could put downward pressure on the price of the asset they are offloading. Navigating the Implications of Major Crypto Transfers While the exact motive behind this specific USDT whale transfer remains unknown, it underscores the importance of on-chain data in understanding market flows. Transparency offered by blockchain technology allows anyone to track these large movements, even if the identities of the wallets remain anonymous. For investors, observing such transfers can offer clues about potential market shifts or upcoming trading activity. It’s crucial to remember that a single large transfer doesn’t automatically dictate market direction. However, it certainly adds a layer of intrigue and necessitates further observation. Market participants often look for patterns or follow-up actions after such events to gauge their full impact. The recent USDT whale transfer to OKX serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of large-scale cryptocurrency movements. While the specific intent of the wallet remains private, the transaction’s sheer size highlights the significant capital flowing within the digital asset ecosystem. Staying informed about these on-chain activities provides valuable insights into the broader market landscape. Keep an eye on OKX and the broader stablecoin market for any subsequent developments following this monumental transfer. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto whale? A: A crypto whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency, whose transactions can significantly influence market dynamics. Q2: Why is a large USDT transfer significant? A: Large USDT transfers are significant because they can indicate potential major trading activity, preparation for OTC deals, or shifts in market sentiment due to increased liquidity or strategic positioning. Q3: What is OKX? A: OKX is a leading global cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to trade various digital assets, including stablecoins like USDT. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions? A: Services like Whale Alert track and report large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains, providing public access to significant on-chain movements. Q5: Does a large stablecoin transfer always mean selling? A: Not necessarily. While it can precede selling, a large stablecoin transfer could also indicate preparation for buying other cryptocurrencies, facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or simply moving funds for strategic asset management.

The country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has unveiled the “TouristDigiPay” project, an 18-month regulatory sandbox that will allow foreign visitors to convert cryptocurrencies into Thai baht for local spending. The program is set to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. According to the SEC’s August 18 announcement, the project is being developed in partnership with the Ministry of Finance, the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO), and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports. A Controlled Framework for Crypto Payments Importantly, the SEC clarified that cryptocurrencies will not be used directly for transactions. Instead, merchants will continue to receive payments in baht, while digital asset operators and e-money providers must comply with strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) standards outlined by AMLO. Pornanong Budsaratragoon, the SEC’s Secretary-General, said the sandbox expands upon the country’s existing financial ecosystem by integrating regulated digital asset platforms with Thailand’s e-money system, overseen by the Bank of Thailand. She emphasized that risk management measures, monthly spending limits, and a ban on direct cash withdrawals will be included to safeguard both consumers and businesses. Thailand Tourism Industry in Need of Support The TouristDigiPay initiative comes at a time when Thailand’s tourism sector is under pressure. Data from the World Tourism Institute shows the country attracted 16.8 million visitors in the first half of 2025, a drop from 17.7 million during the same period in 2024. The decline was sharpest among travelers from East Asia, down 24%, with Chinese tourists falling by 34%. Analysts note that competing destinations such as Japan and Vietnam are attracting travelers with more affordable options, thanks in part to favorable exchange rates. A recent report concluded that Thailand’s 5% tourism decline in 2025 underscores the urgent need for diversification and innovative approaches to draw international visitors. The TouristDigiPay project builds on earlier government efforts to experiment with crypto adoption in tourism. In January, a pilot program was announced to test crypto payments in Phuket, though it remains in progress.

This transaction, valued at approximately $302 million, immediately raised eyebrows and sparked widespread discussion within the crypto community. What Happened with the OKB Transferred? The prominent blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert, initially reported this significant transaction. Their data confirmed that a substantial amount of OKB transferred occurred, moving from a previously unidentified wallet to a deposit address on OKX. Such large-scale movements, often attributed to ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency – are always closely watched. This particular transfer highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Why Does This OKB Transferred Matter? When a substantial amount of a token like OKB transferred to an exchange, it can have several implications. Exchanges are typically where assets are bought and sold, meaning a large inflow could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and affecting price. Conversely, it could also be part of an internal restructuring by a large holder, or even preparation for a new listing or service. Understanding these possibilities is crucial for market participants. Understanding Whale Movements and OKB Transferred Crypto whales wield significant influence due to their massive holdings. Their transactions, especially when a large amount of OKB transferred , can send ripples through the market. This is because their actions can influence market sentiment and liquidity. It is important to note that not all large transfers signify an imminent sale. Whales often move funds for various strategic reasons, including: Consolidating holdings Preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) deals Engaging in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities Securing assets in a centralized exchange for trading or staking Potential Implications of the OKB Transferred The direct impact of this specific OKB transferred event remains to be seen. However, historical data suggests that large inflows to exchanges can sometimes precede increased selling pressure, leading to price volatility for the asset in question. Market analysts are closely monitoring OKB’s price action and trading volume on OKX to gauge the short-term effects of this monumental transfer. Investors often use such whale movements as indicators, but they are rarely definitive predictions. In conclusion, the movement of 2,660,388 OKB transferred to OKX is a significant event that underscores the opaque yet fascinating world of crypto whale activity. While the precise motives behind this $302 million transaction remain unknown, it serves as a powerful reminder of the substantial capital flowing within the digital asset ecosystem and the importance of staying informed about major blockchain movements. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is OKB? OKB is the native utility token of the OKX cryptocurrency exchange. It offers users various benefits, including trading fee discounts, access to exclusive features, and participation in OKX Jumpstart. What is a “whale” in crypto? In cryptocurrency, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price through large transactions. Why is the transfer of OKB transferred to an exchange significant? When a large amount of a cryptocurrency like OKB transferred to an exchange, it often suggests the holder might be preparing to sell, trade, or utilize exchange services, which can impact market liquidity and price dynamics. Does this mean OKB’s price will change? Not necessarily. While large transfers can precede price movements, they do not guarantee them. The market’s reaction depends on many factors, including overall sentiment, other news, and the whale’s actual intentions. How can I track large crypto transactions like this OKB transferred event? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking significant cryptocurrency movements across various blockchains, providing real-time notifications and data to the public.

50278035,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78749,1755511235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now? A Token at $0.035 Could Be the Steal of the Summer,https://timestabloid.com/best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-now-a-token-at-0-035-could-be-the-steal/,"For years, crypto investors have asked the same question every time markets turn volatile: what is going on with crypto today? Why is crypto crashing when yesterday prices looked so strong? And yet, in the middle of shaky charts and uncertainty, the greatest fortunes in crypto investing have often been made not during peaks, but in the middle of doubt—when undervalued projects with substance were still under the radar. Right now, as traders scan crypto prices searching for value, one presale token stands out not just because it’s cheap, but because it offers the rare mix of affordability and deep utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at only $0.035 in its Phase 6 presale, and it is shaping up to be the steal of the summer. Real Utility Behind the Price Tag The difference between fleeting hype and lasting growth often comes down to one question: why crypto is down today? More often than not, it’s because tokens without real substance collapse when sentiment shifts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building on the opposite strategy—pairing low entry pricing with a protocol that has baked-in demand drivers designed to strengthen over time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where lenders, borrowers, and liquidators meet through two models. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) setup, liquidity is pooled and lenders earn dynamic interest based on pool utilization. One example is a lender who deposits $27,500 in BNB at a 12% APY, generating $3,300 in yearly passive income. On top of that, the protocol issues mtTokens—ERC-20 assets representing deposits and interest—that can be staked to earn MUTM rewards sourced directly from revenue-driven buybacks. For borrowers, the model delivers flexibility and control. Someone pledging $35,000 in XRP at a 66% loan-to-value ratio unlocks $23,100 USDC with no fixed term, keeping their exposure to XRP’s upside while gaining liquidity. The peer-to-peer (P2P) model adds a custom dimension: a lender offering $32,000 USDT at 23% APR for 50 days secured against $50,000 in PEPE earns a high yield negotiated directly, with the assurance of collateralized protection. These numbers highlight something clear: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t an empty promise. It’s a working framework designed to give lending and borrowing depth, predictability, and most importantly—continuous reasons for traders to buy and hold MUTM. Presale Momentum and the Road Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with more than $14.6 million raised, 15,300 holders, and 20% of tokens already sold. The next phase will move to $0.040, a 15% increase, which is why value-seeking investors are calling this the best cheap crypto to buy now before the next pricing step closes the window. The total supply is 4 billion tokens, with each presale stage progressively priced until reaching the $0.06 listing. For perspective, a budget investor who allocated $3,000 during Phase 2 at $0.015 now holds $7,000 at today’s $0.035 presale price. When listing arrives at $0.06, that same entry becomes $12,000—a 300% return on paper before the token even hits major exchanges. Unlike other tokens that enter the market without a backbone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has placed heavy emphasis on security and credibility. The project has been audited by CertiK, receiving a 95 Token Scan score and 78 Skynet score. To go further, a $50,000 bug bounty program with severity-based rewards is set to encourage continuous code strength, and a $100,000 giveaway is fueling rapid community growth, which already counts over 12,000 social followers. Beyond audits and presale milestones, the roadmap is stacked with triggers that expand value over time. Phase 1 kicked off with marketing, audits, and listings on trackers. Phase 2 is focused on developing the engine of the platform. Phase 3 introduces stress testing, bug reporting, and a live demo, while Phase 4 is where the lights turn on: the full platform launch, bug bounty activation, exchange listings, multi-chain expansion, and institutional partnerships. Each milestone broadens the pool of users, creating real-world demand that ties directly back to the MUTM token through its revenue buyback mechanism. This design links growth in platform adoption directly to growth in token demand. That means when crypto predictions point to higher adoption and rising utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a structural advantage: it doesn’t just rely on speculation, but on the very activity of its users to generate ongoing buy pressure. Conclusion The real value story here is simple. Many are asking what is going on with crypto today as prices swing and headlines talk about corrections. But history shows that investors who step into the market during these moments—while others wonder why crypto is crashing—are often the ones positioned for outsized gains once momentum returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 is not just another entry on a chart. It is a fully audited, revenue-linked, utility-driven protocol that is about to step into its next presale phase at a higher price. With a beta launch lined up for listing and Tier-1 exchange exposure on the horizon, analysts already place short-term price bands in the $0.10–$0.16 range within the first 3 to 6 months. The window for “cheap with substance” opportunities doesn’t stay open forever. Right now, before the move to $0.040, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is living up to its title: the steal of the summer.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin has dropped over 7% from its all-time high, signaling that a deeper correction may be underway before the crypto resumes its broader upward trend. To get a clearer picture of how much further Bitcoin could drop in its correction phase, we can apply the Fibonacci retracement tool, drawing it from the low of $98,242 (i.e. the low of the latest weekly range). Since the most common assumption is that corrections typically reach at least the 50% retracement level, Bitcoin still has about 3.5% more downside before hitting that mark. This is crucial because it highlights that, despite short-term pullbacks, the broader trend remains bullish. In fact, healthy corrections are often necessary to sustain long-term uptrends, as they shake out excess leverage, reset momentum indicators, and allow for stronger bases to form. Speaking of momentum indicators, Bitcoin on the daily chart is now resting on the 50 EMA while simultaneously entering its latest support zone. This is the same zone that fueled an 11% rally just a couple of weeks ago. If this support holds, Bitcoin could make another push toward fresh all-time highs within the next 10-14 days. Metaplanet Bought $89 Million More Bitcoin as Market Crashes: Bitcoin Hyper Rides $BTC’s Hype Wave with $10M Raise August 18, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Metaplanet announced a 775 Bitcoin purchase currently worth ~$89M, with the company holding 18,888 Bitcoins worth around $2.17B. The company has a $451M YTD gain as of Q3 2025 , and it looks primed to surpass Q2’s $604M peak. Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy has lifted the company up several notches, from a no-name entity to one of the leading institutional Bitcoin holders in the world. Investors are already calling Metaplanet ‘Asia’s Strategy,’ and the market is gobbling up all this hype. Despite a temporary slump, we believe a recovery is in store. And once that happens, Bitcoin-centric presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are perfectly positioned to ride this hype. The project plans a Layer-2 to increase Bitcoin’s transaction speed, bring dApps and smart contracts to its ecosystem, and scale it to modern demands. With a $10.3M presale raise and a token price of $0.012745, $HYPER is looking ready to explode. Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper plans to do in our guide. $2,200,000 Price Prediction for Bitcoin as Max Keiser Forecasts $BTC Supremacy: Bitcoin Hyper Is the Best But in This Context August 18, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Max Keiser just made another Bitcoin prediction, and it’s quite the shock – $2.2M . This new prediction is a 10x from his previous $220K one which, at this point, seems very achievable in the next few years. His reason: the US ramping up interest rate payments to $1T in the first 10 months of the fiscal year 2025. At this rate, they’re closing in on the $1.2T annual interest expense. So, interest rate cuts are looking increasingly likely, according to Keiser. He argues that Bitcoin’s price ceiling keeps going up as the US moves toward more interest rate cuts. And this seems reasonable, if not expected. Investors looking to invest in Bitcoin’s rally should also look at promising presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Due to its L2, SVM integration, and Canonical Bridge roadmap, the project has raised over $10M in presale as investors ramp up purchases.

In 2025, Dogecoin stands shoulder-to-shoulder next to Bitcoin. One is the first cryptocurrency, while our doggo friend is widely recognized as the first meme coin. Launched in 2013, $DOGE is up by over 39,000% today, looking at a price of over $0.22 and a trading volume in the billions of dollars. If anything, Dogecoin proves that ‘anything is possible’ in crypto, and even underdogs can become industry giants. With endorsements from industry moguls like Elon Musk and official investment vehicles like the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, $DOGE seems to be going nowhere but up. Click to learn more about Maxi Doge Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Dogecoin’s bodybuilder cousin chugging Red Bull and scalping cryptos at 3AM in the morning. Embodying full-send chaos and pump potential 2.0, $MAXI is for degen traders who don’t hesitate and keep diamond hands on some of the riskiest plays. While meme coins are a dime a dozen, Maxi Doge is max-commitment, max cojones, and aiming for legend status in the memecoin land. Simply put, if rat poison squared took form, it would probably look like Maxi Doge. And this meme coin is still in presale.

On the brighter side, though, the token is now approaching a key support zone – the same level that fueled a 16% rally in early August and has previously acted as both strong support and resistance. On the 4-hour chart, Dogecoin’s price is trading comfortably below the short-term moving averages (10, 20, 50, and 100 EMA), leaving only the 200 and 400 EMAs as meaningful layers of support as far as technical indicators are concerned. So, if Dogecoin breaks below these zones, it could trigger a deeper correction, possibly toward $0.18864. This would result in another 14% drop from current levels. However, on the daily chart, Dogecoin has yet to even test its 50 EMA. This suggests that while short-term price drops are to be expected, the longer-term outlook remains bullish. That said, a clear continuation signal will still be needed to confirm the trend. Dogecoin Under Fire: Maxi Doge is Built to Withstand August 18, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Dogecoin slipped over 4% today as the Qubic community voted to target it with a 51% attack like the one it launched on Monero, which caused a sharp decline in its price. The threat has sparked panic among $DOGE holders, with Santiment’s NPL data showing the largest loss since July 2022, and Coinglass’s long-to-short ratio hitting 0.79, signaling potential for further price decline. With $DOGE under attack, traders are rotating to new meme coins on presale like Maxi Doge. Unlike Dogecoin, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is not a proof-of-work coin, making it immune to Qubic’s mining-based 51% attacks. It also lacks minting or blacklist functions that could be exploited by attackers. What’s more, its smart contract’s been audited with zero critical vulnerabilities found. As dogens look to camp out while Qubic eyes its next mark, find out how to move your funds into Maxi Doge . Why Maxi Doge Is Eating Dogecoin’s Lunch August 18, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The old alpha $DOGE appears to be skulking back as tokens that solve real problems take the lion’s share. Trading near $0.22 , Dogecoin’s price action remains highly reactive; driven more by sentiment than substance, showing sharp rallies often followed by steep drops. With no clear roadmap, limited utility, and hype cycles that fizzle fast, $DOGE’s role as a portfolio staple may be fading. Traders are increasingly looking for tokens with stronger fundamentals, tokens like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) : the meme coin built for this new cycle. Maxi Doge embodies extreme degen culture, featuring a muscular, caffeine-fueled Shiba Inu with a no pain, no gain attitude to life and trading. While $DOGE struggles to maintain relevance, Maxi Doge is flexing rapid gains through high-intensity presale sessions.

A truly massive OKB transfer , involving an astounding 8,818,097 OKB tokens, has been detected moving from an unknown wallet directly to the OKX exchange. This transaction is valued at approximately $1 billion, marking it as one of the most significant on-chain movements in recent times. What Does This Enormous OKB Transfer Signify? When such a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, particularly OKB, shifts between wallets, it immediately draws the attention of market watchers. These large movements are often attributed to ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding vast amounts of a particular digital asset. Their actions can significantly influence market dynamics. The sheer scale of this OKB transfer , amounting to a billion dollars, suggests a strategic maneuver rather than a casual transaction. It highlights the potential for major market shifts, prompting investors to consider its possible implications for OKB’s price and liquidity. Why Would Such a Large OKB Transfer Occur? Exploring Potential Reasons Several theories emerge when a whale initiates a colossal OKB transfer to an exchange. Each scenario carries different implications for the broader market and for OKB holders: Exchange Consolidation: Often, large holders move funds from cold storage (offline wallets) to exchange hot wallets to prepare for trading, staking, or participation in exchange-specific programs. This could be a sign of increased liquidity coming to OKX. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: Whales sometimes facilitate large trades directly with institutional buyers through OTC desks, bypassing public order books to minimize market impact. The transfer to OKX could be part of settling such a deal. Preparation for Listing/Feature: While less common for established assets like OKB, a large inflow might precede the introduction of new features, staking pools, or even new trading pairs on the exchange, requiring more liquidity. Security Upgrade: In some cases, wallets might be consolidated or moved as part of enhanced security protocols or system upgrades. Understanding the ‘why’ behind this OKB transfer is crucial for market participants. How Might This OKB Transfer Affect the Market? The immediate impact of a significant OKB transfer to an exchange is often a subject of speculation. While a large deposit could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on price, it could also indicate an intention to provide liquidity or engage in high-volume trading activities that could stabilize or even boost the asset. Investors should closely monitor OKB’s price action and trading volume in the coming days. A sudden increase in sell orders could confirm liquidation, whereas stable prices or even an uptick might suggest a different strategic play by the whale. This event underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Monitoring Future OKB Transfer Activity For anyone invested in or interested in OKB, tracking subsequent wallet activity is key. Whale Alert and similar on-chain analytics tools provide invaluable insights into these movements, helping to paint a clearer picture of market sentiment and potential future trends. This recent OKB transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of on-chain transparency in the crypto space. In conclusion, the detection of an 8.8 million OKB transfer to OKX is a significant event that warrants close attention. Whether it signals an impending sale, an OTC deal, or a strategic consolidation, such large movements by crypto whales are always indicative of underlying market forces at play. Stay informed and vigilant in this ever-evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is OKB? OKB is the global utility token issued by the OK Blockchain Foundation. It powers the OKX ecosystem, offering users various benefits such as trading fee discounts, access to exclusive features, and participation in OKX Jumpstart. What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? In cryptocurrency, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular digital asset. Their transactions are often large enough to potentially influence market prices due to their significant holdings. Why is this specific OKB transfer considered significant? This OKB transfer is significant due to its immense size – 8,818,097 OKB, valued at approximately $1 billion. Such a large movement to an exchange suggests a strategic intent that could impact market liquidity and sentiment. Does a large OKB transfer always mean the price will drop? Not necessarily. While a large transfer to an exchange can signal an intent to sell, it could also be for other purposes like providing liquidity for new features, participating in staking programs, or facilitating an OTC deal. The actual impact depends on the whale’s ultimate actions. How can I track large cryptocurrency transfers like this OKB transfer? You can track large cryptocurrency transfers using on-chain analytics platforms and services like Whale Alert, Etherscan (for Ethereum-based tokens), or block explorers specific to the blockchain in question. These tools provide real-time data on significant transactions. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Saturday alone saw $3.3 billion in profit taking, the largest single-day figure since mid-July and one of the highest in 2025. For most of this year, profit has been realized almost daily, with only around 10 sessions showing net losses. The trend reflects BTC’s steady climb from $90,000 at the start of 2025. Since hitting a low of $76,000 in April, profit taking has accelerated, especially as the $100,000 milestone triggered renewed selling pressure. This latest downturn follows bitcoin’s all-time high of $124,000 earlier in August. Each correction this year from all-time highs, has been smaller than the last, suggesting more resilience as the market matures: January’s drawdown reached 30%, May’s was 12%, July’s 9%, and August’s pullback now sits at 8%.

The broader cryptocurrency market experienced rapid capital rotation between meme coins, public blockchains, and emerging narratives. While some tokens registered short-te rm spikes fueled by specific events, mainstream assets within the ETH ecosystem maintained steady growth. Meme Coins Lead Weekly Gains with DONKEY and MEMEFI As the Key Focus Meme coins continued to dominate market sentiment. Known for their high volatility, low entry barriers, and strong community engagement, these tokens often act as short-term sentiment barometers. ● DONKEY (BSC Memecoin) : +197%, the week’s top gainer on HTX. Originating from a viral meme – Binance founder CZ’s self-deprecating “I am a donkey” remark – the token leveraged social traction to attract a fleet of short-term inflows, becoming a representative of trending BSC meme assets. ● MEMEFI (Memecoin): +120%. MemeFi is a Web3 social gaming platform combining PvP/PvE modes with a player-driven economy. It allows players to trade keys to earn rewards, resulting in a more engaging experience. Anticipation of airdrops and on-chain interaction activity helped sustain price momentum. Emerging Narratives and Niche Sectors Rise, Highlighted by SOON and OG Innovation-led sectors gained traction, fueled by developments in blockchain scalability, fan engagement, blockchain gaming, decentralized research, and AI integration. The sectors attract both short-term speculators and long-term investors. ● SOON (L1 Token): +145%. SOON is a rollup stack designed to provide high-performance solutions for Layer-1 chains. The project attracted both blockchain enthusiasts and speculative capital due to its high-speed, low-fee on-chain performance, and early ecosystem development. It is viewed as a potential narrative alongside Ethereum and Solana. ● OG (Fan Token): +124%. This surge highlights renewed market enthusiasm for the fan economy. Marking a collaboration between esports organization OG and Socios.com, OG leverages the significant reach of its sports and entertainment IP. This contributes to a resurgence of on-chain fan engagement in the new cycle. ● A2Z (GameFi): +108%. Built on OP Stack, Arena-Z aims to streamline Web3 gaming with player-first infrastructure, hitting record highs in active users and trading volume. The blockchain gaming sector has repeatedly been a market highlight during this year’s recovery. ● BIO (DeSci): +96%. The revival of the decentralized science narrative reignited interest in blockchain-powered scientific research. While these projects exhibit significant short-term price volatility, they hold a unique position in the exploration of long-term value. ● GRIFT (SOL AI Token): +97%. This reflects the speculative fervor surrounding the narrative of AI integrated with Solana . Orbit (GRIFT) is an AI-driven DeFi assistant operating on Solana, enabling on-chain actions via natural language prompts. With AI positioned as a key long-term narrative for the crypto market in 2025 and beyond, its combination with high-performance blockchains is particularly compelling. Market exploration of the synergy between AI and on-chain data continues to rapidly advance. Ethereum Ecosystem Assets Steadily Advance Ethereum’s price recovery supported gains in core staking and DeFi tokens, seen as more stable allocation targets. ● LDO (Staking): +63%, benefiting from a rebound in staking APRs and broader ETH staking activity. Lido is a solution for liquid staking on Ethereum. It allows users to stake ETH without minimum deposit requirements or the need to maintain infrastructure, while participating in on-chain activities (such as lending) to achieve compound interest growth on their returns. ● PENDLE (DeFi): +45%. The price increase reflects renewed institutional interest in the interest rate derivatives sector. Pendle Finance is a protocol that tokenizes and allows trading of DeFi yields, enabling users to execute various yield management strategies. ● ENA (DeFi): +38%. This uptick reflects steady growth within the strong Ethereum ecosystem. Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, aiming to provide a crypto-native solution for currencies that don’t rely on traditional banking infrastructure. Its primary product is Delta-neutral synthetic dollars (USDe). As August progresses, the market is buzzing with activity, where both established and emerging sectors are offering a wealth of trading opportunities. Traders are balancing high-volatility sectors, including memecoin, AI, Layer-1, and GameFi, with more defensive positioning in Ethereum-linked assets. HTX is committed to constantly expanding its listings and market coverage to help users identify opportunities across both speculative and structural growth narratives in the evolving crypto cycle.

This highly anticipated event marks a significant moment for both the Plume community and crypto enthusiasts looking for new opportunities. The addition of PLUME to Binance’s extensive roster signals potential growth and increased visibility for the project. What Does the Plume (PLUME) Listing Entail? Binance made the official announcement on its website, confirming that Plume (PLUME) will be available for trading on August 18 at 15:00 UTC. This isn’t just any ordinary listing; it comes with a specific designation: the Seed Tag. This tag is crucial for potential investors to understand. Launch Date: PLUME trading begins on August 18, 15:00 UTC. Seed Tag: This indicates that PLUME is an innovative project that may exhibit higher volatility and risk compared to other listed tokens. Binance applies this tag to projects in their early stages, encouraging users to conduct thorough due diligence. HODLer Airdrop: As the 32nd HODLer Airdrop project, it suggests that loyal Binance users who hold specific cryptocurrencies may be eligible for distributions of PLUME tokens. The Plume (PLUME) listing through a HODLer Airdrop underscores Binance’s commitment to supporting new projects while rewarding its long-term users. However, the Seed Tag serves as an important cautionary note, reminding everyone about the inherent risks in emerging digital assets. Why Are HODLer Airdrops Significant for the Plume (PLUME) Listing? Binance’s HODLer Airdrop program is a unique initiative designed to benefit users who hold certain cryptocurrencies on the exchange. For projects like Plume, being selected for this program offers immense exposure and a robust initial distribution mechanism. It’s a win-win scenario: users get free tokens, and the project gains immediate traction and a broader holder base. Moreover, the HODLer Airdrop model fosters a sense of community and loyalty among participants. It encourages users to maintain their holdings on Binance, thereby contributing to the platform’s liquidity and stability. This method of distribution can significantly impact the initial trading dynamics of the Plume (PLUME) listing . This approach also aligns with the broader crypto philosophy of decentralization and community-driven growth. By distributing tokens directly to existing holders, Binance helps to democratize access to new projects like Plume, rather than limiting participation to initial coin offerings or private sales. What Should Investors Consider Before the Plume (PLUME) Listing? Given the Seed Tag associated with the Plume (PLUME) listing , investors must approach this opportunity with caution and a well-informed strategy. Understanding the risks is just as important as recognizing the potential rewards. Research Plume (PLUME): Dive deep into the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use cases, and roadmap. What problem does Plume aim to solve? What is its unique value proposition? Assess Volatility: Tokens with a Seed Tag can experience rapid price swings.

Consider setting stop-loss orders if you decide to trade PLUME. Diversifying your portfolio is also a wise strategy to mitigate risk. Market Sentiment: Observe the overall market conditions and community sentiment around Plume. While not a definitive indicator, it can offer insights into short-term price movements. Remember, the crypto market is dynamic and unpredictable. Making informed decisions based on thorough research is paramount to navigating the exciting yet volatile landscape of new listings.

In outlining the initiative, Trump specifically listed XRP, alongside other digital assets, as part of the reserve framework. For those like crypto influencer John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) who have followed the market closely, this was a significant acknowledgement that a token once seen as the subject of regulatory battles had entered the center of U.S. policy considerations. Squire has now revisited that announcement, pointing out that XRP was the very first name mentioned. His remarks reflected a view that some traders continue to underestimate the importance of this moment, and how much XRP can grow. Remember this: Trump mentioned a Crypto Reserve and $XRP was the very first name he said. Go ahead… sell if you must. Just don’t ask why you’re still broke in 2030. pic.twitter.com/i4nwOCzXby — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) August 16, 2025 XRP’s Inclusion in the Crypto Reserve Trump announced plans to create a strategic crypto reserve in early March, less than two weeks after his inauguration. Squire shared a screenshot of Trump’s announcement where he described the reserve as a way to elevate digital assets after what he called years of hostile action from the previous administration. He directed the Presidential Working Group to implement the program and ensure that assets such as XRP, SOL, and ADA were included. By doing so, the administration gave XRP significant recognition as part of a structured national reserve plan, an outcome that was far from guaranteed only a few years earlier when regulatory scrutiny had been the dominant narrative. The decision to reference XRP so clearly has been interpreted as a policy signal rather than a passing mention. For financial institutions, that means XRP is now a consideration in areas such as custody, settlement, and liquidity planning. This is the point that Squire emphasized when reminding his audience that dismissing XRP now could look shortsighted years down the line. Here’s Why You Should Buy XRP Squire sent a pointed message to those looking to exit their XRP positions, writing, “Just don’t ask why you’re still broke in 2030.” With Trump’s recognition of XRP and the asset’s growing global recognition, anyone looking to see their tokens now could miss out on significant gains over the next few years. A recent Bitwise prediction suggests XRP could reach almost $30 by 2030 , marking an increase of almost 900%. Experts have consistently advised community members and investors to buy XRP and wait instead of waiting to buy tokens, and those who get in early will benefit the most from this growth over the next few years.

This massive OKB transfer , valued at a staggering $573 million, has sent ripples across the crypto community, as reported by the prominent blockchain tracker Whale Alert. Such a significant on-chain movement from an unknown wallet to a major exchange naturally raises questions and sparks considerable speculation among investors and market observers. What Exactly Happened with This Massive OKB Transfer? On [Insert Date if known, otherwise keep general], Whale Alert, a service dedicated to tracking large cryptocurrency transactions, flagged a remarkable event: 5,046,699 OKB tokens were transferred. The origin of these tokens was an unidentified wallet, and their destination was the OKX exchange. To put this into perspective, the value of this single OKB transfer amounted to approximately $573 million at the time of the transaction. For those unfamiliar, OKB is the utility token of the OKX cryptocurrency exchange, one of the largest global trading platforms. Holders of OKB tokens often receive benefits such as trading fee discounts, access to exclusive features, and participation in the OKX ecosystem. Therefore, a movement of this scale involving the exchange’s native token is always noteworthy. Why Does Such a Large OKB Transfer Matter? In the world of cryptocurrency, large holders are often referred to as ‘whales’ due to their ability to significantly influence market dynamics with their immense holdings. When a crypto whale executes a substantial OKB transfer , especially to an exchange, it can signal several potential intentions or outcomes. This is why market participants closely monitor such activities. Understanding the implications of a whale movement is crucial for any crypto enthusiast. Here are a few reasons why this particular transaction is significant: Market Sentiment: Large transfers can influence investor sentiment, leading to speculation about potential selling pressure or strategic moves. Liquidity: Moving tokens to an exchange can increase the available liquidity for trading, potentially making large trades easier to execute. Transparency (or Lack Thereof): The ‘unknown wallet’ aspect adds an element of mystery, prompting questions about the identity of the sender and their motives. Potential Implications for OKB and the Broader Market What could this substantial OKB transfer signify for the token’s future price action and the wider crypto market? While it is impossible to predict with certainty, several scenarios are often considered when such a large sum moves to an exchange. Potential Sale: The most common speculation is that the whale intends to sell their OKB holdings, which could exert downward pressure on the token’s price if executed on the open market. Internal Rebalancing: It is also possible that this is an internal transfer by OKX itself, perhaps moving funds between cold and hot wallets for operational purposes or to support new features. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The tokens might be intended for an OTC trade, which means a direct sale to a buyer outside of the public order books, minimizing market impact. Liquidity Provision or Staking: The whale might be moving the tokens to participate in liquidity pools, staking programs, or other DeFi initiatives offered by OKX, aiming to earn rewards. Each of these possibilities carries different implications for OKB holders and the market. The sheer size of this particular OKB transfer makes it a key event to watch. Monitoring Future OKB Transfer Activities For investors, staying informed about significant on-chain movements like this OKB transfer is an essential part of navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While Whale Alert provides immediate notifications, utilizing blockchain explorers can offer deeper insights into the wallet’s history and subsequent actions. It is always wise to exercise caution and conduct thorough research rather than making impulsive decisions based solely on large transfers. The crypto market thrives on information, but also on speculation. Observing how the market reacts and if further movements or announcements follow this massive transfer will be key. In conclusion, the movement of over 5 million OKB tokens to OKX represents a significant event in the crypto space. Whether it signals an impending sale, an internal rebalancing, or a strategic move for liquidity, this substantial OKB transfer underscores the dynamic nature of whale activity and its potential impact on market sentiment and price action. Vigilance and informed analysis remain paramount for participants in this exciting, yet unpredictable, digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is OKB? OKB is the global utility token issued by the OKX blockchain foundation. It serves as the native cryptocurrency of the OKX exchange, providing holders with various benefits such as trading fee discounts, access to exclusive features, and participation in the OKX ecosystem. Q2: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? In cryptocurrency, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Due to their significant holdings, their buying or selling activities can have a substantial impact on the market price and liquidity of that asset. Q3: Why is a large OKB transfer to an exchange significant? Large transfers to exchanges are significant because they often precede potential selling activity, which could increase market supply and potentially lead to price drops. However, they could also be for internal operational reasons, OTC deals, or for participating in exchange-based programs. Q4: How can I track large crypto transfers like this OKB transfer? Services like Whale Alert provide real-time notifications of significant blockchain transactions. You can also use blockchain explorers specific to the token’s network (e.g., Ethereum blockchain explorers for ERC-20 tokens) to view transaction details and wallet histories. Q5: Does this OKB transfer necessarily mean the price will drop? Not necessarily. While a large transfer to an exchange often sparks speculation about a sell-off, it could also be for other reasons such as internal rebalancing, OTC deals, or participation in staking/liquidity programs. Investors should monitor subsequent events and broader market trends. Did you find this article insightful?

Recent market data shows that both institutional and retail investors are increasingly focused on Ethereum, while also exploring crypto presale opportunities. These presale crypto tokens are reshaping early-stage investing, giving people access to new projects before public launches. From top crypto presales to innovative pre-sale cryptocurrency launches, this trend is now an important part of Web3 adoption. PepeDollar (PEPD) is one such project gaining traction in the crypto presale list, making some analysts view it as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. Ethereum ETFs Unlock Institutional Opportunities Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are experiencing a massive surge, with nearly US$3 billion in net inflows recorded in a single week. By comparison, Bitcoin ETFs attracted only US$562 million during the same period, underscoring Ethereum’s appeal. Treasury firms have also ramped up exposure, moving from US$600 million to US$11 billion in ETH holdings in just six weeks. This trend signals growing institutional confidence and the rising importance of Ethereum in the global market. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of in-kind creations and redemptions for Ethereum ETFs has further boosted momentum. The change reduces operational costs and improves efficiency, making ETH funds more attractive to large investors. Analysts highlight this shift as one of the biggest catalysts for long-term demand, showing how Ethereum remains central in discussions about wealth-building opportunities. PepeDollar Presale Brings Pay-Fi to Ethereum Layer-2 PepeDollar enters the spotlight as one of the top crypto presales of 2025, building directly on Ethereum’s Layer-2 infrastructure. Its focus is the PepeDollar Payment Protocol, designed to bridge DeFi and real-world payments, creating what the team calls the Pay-Fi economy. This integration of blockchain into daily use cases sets it apart from typical token presales. The new crypto token presale for PepeDollar is live , with Stage 2 pricing set at $0.006495 per PEPD. The token will launch at $0.03695, making the pre-sale cryptocurrency stage a crucial entry point. The total supply is capped at 3.695 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to the presale. So far, the presale has raised over $1.4 million, with investors able to buy presale crypto using ETH, BNB, and several ERC-20 coins like USDT, USDC, SHIB, and AAVE. A 20% instant bonus is available for early buyers with a presale code, adding further incentive. By aligning with Ethereum’s ecosystem, PepeDollar highlights how presale crypto coins can expand into mainstream adoption. With its listing scheduled across CEXs and DEXs later in the year, along with staking opportunities, PEPD demonstrates how token presales are evolving into functional projects within Web3. Ethereum Strength and PepeDollar Presale Tokens The rise of Ethereum ETFs shows how deeply institutional demand is shaping the cryptocurrency space. With billions in inflows, ETH has reinforced its position as a cornerstone asset for investors. Its ecosystem continues to unlock value and pave the way for broader Web3 participation. At the same time, crypto presale projects like PepeDollar (PEPD) reflect how innovation is spreading through early-stage token launches. These presale crypto tokens are no longer just speculative opportunities but represent growing infrastructure within the blockchain economy. For those exploring the best crypto presale to buy right now, Ethereum remains the foundation, while new token presales like PepeDollar showcase how emerging assets can complement established networks. Together, they highlight how cryptocurrency presales and established platforms are shaping the next growth cycle in digital assets. Lastly, boost your presale allocation with a 20% bonus by entering the code Pepe_Powell20 at the time of purchase.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains susceptible to further downside, having lost over 7% since hitting record highs above $124,000 on Thursday. Bullish momentum fading The weekly chart (candlestick format) shows that BTC's ongoing decline follows repeated bull failure to secure a foothold above $122,056, the Fibonacci golden ratio. It also marked the inability to keep gains above the significant long-term resistance trendline that connects the bull market highs of 2017 and 2021. Additionally, the weekly stochastic oscillator has rolled over from the overbought zone above 80, signaling a potential correction ahead. Daily chart On the daily chart, BTC’s latest candle has broken below the bullish trendline extending from April lows, following Friday’s bearish outside-day candle that signaled a potential shift toward seller dominance. Together, these technical signals indicate an increasing downside risk for BTC in the near term, with a potential retest of $11,982, the point from which the market turned higher on Aug. 3. A violation of this level would shift focus tothe 200-day simple moving average at around $100,000. A potential reversal higher to above $118,600 (Sunday's high) during the day ahead would weaken the bear case. Resistance: $120,000, $122,056, $124,429.

At press time, SOL hovered near ~$181 (≈-6% 24h) while XRP traded around ~$2.97 (≈-5% 24h). Bitcoin, by comparison, was relatively steadier, holding near ~$115K. The question now: is this a healthy breather, or the start of something bigger? The numbers behind the drop Solana (SOL): ~$181, down about 6% on the day. 24h volume is ~$5.6B. Over the past week, SOL’s range spans roughly $174-$209. XRP: ~$2.97, down about 5% on the day. 24h volume sits near $5.3B. Over the past week, XRP traded roughly $2.97-$3.34. Bitcoin (BTC): ~$115K with milder 24h slippage, underscoring relative stability versus higher-beta alts. Market-wide, today’s action looks more like rotation and profit-taking than broad risk liquidation: majors gave back a slice of last week’s gains, volumes remained healthy, and BTC dominance barely budged intraday. Profit-Taking or Panic? Analysts largely pointed to post-rally cooling rather than outright risk aversion. As a big publication noted, weekend flows leaned toward taking chips off the table while markets await clearer macro signals. One analyst added that Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative could reassert if monetary easing materializes, language that fits with a consolidation-rather-than-capitulation setup across large caps. Profit taking vs Panic selling In short: after parabolic moves, 5-6% pullbacks are common , especially in high-beta names like SOL and XRP. Without a new shock (regulatory, liquidity, or structural), this kind of drawdown typically reads as digestion. Bitcoin-gold divergence: why it matters for alts Gold caught a bid today as U.S. yields eased, while BTC held near the $115K handle. The divergence – gold firming as BTC drifts , keeps macro watchers focused on the September Fed path . A cut could rekindle BTC’s correlation with bullion; if not, BTC may continue behaving like a risk asset while gold rides central-bank demand and geopolitical hedging. For altcoins, this macro fork is key: easier policy + steady BTC tends to support alt rotations , while risk-off or liquidity scares hit alts first. What it means for Solana & XRP Solana (SOL): Thesis: Despite volatility, Solana’s ecosystem momentum (DeFi, NFTs, throughput improvements ) keeps it a high-beta beneficiary when risk appetite is healthy. The flip side: it corrects faster and deeper on profit-taking waves. Levels to watch: Near-term support ~$180 (today’s intraday low zone) and resistance ~$195-$205 (last week’s highs). A firm reclaim above $200 would suggest dip-buyers remain in control; a sustained break below $180 opens $175 and then the mid-$160s on momentum follow-through. XRP: Thesis: With improved legal clarity versus the 2020-2023 period and periodic institutional interest, XRP participates in broad-market risk cycles but often lags or leads on headlines. After a strong run, it’s vulnerable to profit-taking , especially around big round numbers. Levels to watch: Support ~$2.90-$3.00 (today’s lower bound) and resistance ~$3.20-$3.30 (recent highs). Acceptance back above $3.20 would neutralize today’s damage; failure to hold $2.90 risks a test of the mid-$2s if liquidity thins. https://twitter.com/galaxyBTC/status/1957351261231047125 Outlook & risks Base case (next 1-2 weeks): Sideways-to-choppy consolidation as markets digest gains and await clearer macro direction. If BTC stabilizes, alts can grind higher on rotation, but moves are likely range-bound unless a catalyst hits. Bull catalysts Dovish Fed signaling into September (risk-on, liquidity tailwind). Strong BTC tape (supports alt rotations). Positive ecosystem headlines (e.g., throughput milestones, network upgrades, institutional flows into majors). Bear risks Whale supply hitting thin weekend books (accelerates downside). ETF/inflows wobble for BTC or macro-linked de-risking (alts get hit first). Liquidity crunch around key supports (forced selling can turn routine dips into air-pockets). Trading notes (not financial advice) Respect levels: SOL $180 and XRP $2.90-$3.00 as first supports; SOL $195-$205 and XRP $3.20-$3.30 as near resistances. In consolidation regimes, scale entries rather than chase; reward often comes from buying fear at support and trimming into resistance. Watch BTC vs. gold and rates: that macro cue likely dictates whether this is a pit stop, or a bigger correction ahead. Conclusion For now, the Solana & XRP dip looks like profit-taking , not panic . If Bitcoin holds its ground while gold firms on rate-cut hopes, the next macro move could decide whether this is just a breather or the opening act of a deeper reset.

Its Layer-1 blockchain is built to handle decentralized finance applications that extend beyond crypto-native use cases — integrating payments, lending, and tokenized assets directly into blockchain-powered smartphones. By removing the dependence on centralized app stores, Coldware enables users to engage with DeFi services globally without intermediaries, censorship risks, or the friction of multiple logins and KYC processes. This is a crucial step in breaking centralization barriers. In traditional finance, even digital services ultimately route through banks and payment processors. Coldware’s architecture allows a direct, peer-to-peer financial experience that’s always accessible — whether you’re trading tokens, issuing microloans, or using stablecoins for cross-border remittances. Solana’s DeFi Speed Advantage Solana (SOL) complements this vision with its high-speed, low-cost network. Capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, Solana is a natural backbone for Coldware-powered Real World DeFi apps that require instant settlements. Institutional accumulation from heavyweights like Blackrock and Fidelity is not only a vote of confidence in Solana’s long-term viability but also a sign that mainstream liquidity is flowing into high-performance DeFi ecosystems. However, Solana’s technical history — including notable outages — highlights the importance of multi-chain resilience. Coldware (COLD) ’s device-native multi-chain access can route transactions to alternative Layer-1s in the event of downtime, keeping DeFi services uninterrupted for end users. Stellar’s Real World Integration Stellar (XLM) has long been focused on real-world payments and remittances, and it is now showing technical signs of bullish momentum. After bouncing strongly from $0.40 support, Stellar is testing resistance levels that could open a move toward $0.60. This is particularly relevant for Real World DeFi because Stellar’s network is already optimized for low-cost, high-volume transfers — ideal for the tokenized assets, stablecoin settlements, and microtransaction markets that Coldware devices aim to serve. Coldware’s interoperability strategy means Stellar-based assets and payment rails could be directly integrated into its mobile DeFi ecosystem. This would give users instant access to cross-border transfers at near-zero fees, bypassing traditional banking infrastructure entirely. Breaking the Centralization Mold All three projects — Coldware (COLD) , Solana, and Stellar — are tackling centralization from different angles: Coldware (COLD): Device-level decentralization, native dApp hosting, and censorship-resistant financial access. Solana (SOL): High-speed, scalable infrastructure for real-time DeFi transactions. Stellar (XLM): Battle-tested global payment network optimized for real-world use cases. The combined potential here is massive. Imagine a Coldware phone where a farmer in Africa can take a microloan via a DeFi app running on Solana, receive funds in Stellar-based stablecoins, and repay directly from produce sales — all without ever touching a bank or a centralized exchange. Investor Outlook With Coldware’s presale attracting strong early participation, and Solana and Stellar both gaining technical traction, this Real World DeFi trifecta could become a cornerstone of blockchain adoption outside speculative trading. Investors eyeing utility, global relevance, and decentralization in the same portfolio are already watching Coldware (COLD) closely, especially with projections of significant upside from its hardware-led entry into DeFi. The centralization barriers that once kept DeFi on the fringes are cracking — and Coldware, Solana, and Stellar may be the ones to break them wide open.

This particular address, identified as 0x815C…c3eD, recently sent 4,460 ETH, valued at approximately $19.85 million, to the Kraken exchange. This isn’t an isolated incident; over the past week, this same Ethereum ICO whale has deposited a total of 9,803 ETH, worth around $43.88 million, to the exchange, as reported by Onchain Lens on X. Such large movements by long-term holders often spark discussions about potential market implications and the strategies of these influential early adopters. What Does an Ethereum ICO Whale Movement Signify? When an Ethereum ICO whale , a wallet that participated in Ethereum’s initial public offering back in 2014, starts moving significant amounts of ETH, it naturally draws attention. These early investors acquired their ETH at extremely low prices, making their holdings incredibly valuable today. Their actions can provide insights into market sentiment or potential future trends. Potential Selling Pressure: Moving funds to an exchange often precedes a sale. If this Ethereum ICO whale intends to sell, it could introduce a notable amount of ETH into the market, potentially impacting price in the short term. Profit Taking: Given the massive gains from the ICO price, it’s a logical move for long-term holders to realize profits, especially during periods of high market valuation. Rebalancing Portfolios: Whales might be diversifying their holdings, moving ETH to exchanges to convert it into other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. The sheer volume of ETH involved, nearly $20 million in one transaction and over $43 million in a week, underscores the significance of this particular Ethereum ICO whale ‘s activity. Why Are These Large Transfers Happening Now? The timing of such substantial transfers by an Ethereum ICO whale is always a subject of speculation. Several factors could be at play, influencing this decision to move millions in ETH to Kraken: Market Conditions: The current bullish sentiment and relatively high ETH prices might present an opportune moment for profit realization. Anticipation of Events: Whales often have access to or anticipate information that the general public does not. This could relate to upcoming network upgrades, regulatory changes, or broader economic shifts. Liquidity Needs: While less common for such large amounts, the whale might require significant liquidity for other investments or personal reasons outside the crypto space. Understanding the motivations behind an Ethereum ICO whale ‘s actions is crucial for market observers. While we cannot know the exact reason, the pattern of multiple large deposits suggests a deliberate strategy rather than a random event. What Should Investors Watch For After This Ethereum ICO Whale Move? The movement of such a significant amount of ETH by an Ethereum ICO whale to an exchange like Kraken warrants careful observation. While it doesn’t guarantee a specific outcome, here are some key aspects for investors to monitor: Exchange Flow Data: Keep an eye on net exchange flows for ETH. A sustained increase in exchange inflows could signal selling pressure. Price Action: Observe how Ethereum’s price reacts. Significant selling from a whale could lead to temporary dips, but the broader market trend often dictates long-term movement. Whale Activity Tracking: On-chain analytics tools can help track if more ICO-era wallets become active, indicating a broader trend among early holders. It’s important to remember that one whale’s action, while significant, does not define the entire market. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, ongoing developments, and widespread adoption continue to be fundamental drivers. In conclusion, the recent transfer of nearly $44 million in ETH by an Ethereum ICO whale to Kraken is a noteworthy event in the crypto space. This move highlights the immense wealth held by early investors and their potential impact on market dynamics. While such large transactions can signal profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing, they also serve as a reminder of the volatility and speculative nature of the crypto market. Investors should remain vigilant, utilizing on-chain data and market analysis to make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum ICO whale?

It is shifting focus toward building products and tools that integrate SHIB at their core. The move aligns with Ryoshi’s original vision of a community ecosystem built on innovation. In an announcement on X, a Shiba Inu community account called for a major evolution in its long-term vision. It says it is now time to move beyond a burn-centric narrative and focus instead on utility-driven growth. The Shiba Inu proponent stated that while token burns have historically played a role in reducing supply and supporting price action, they are not a sustainable strategy. Instead, the future of SHIB lies in creating products, tools, and ecosystems that make SHIB a functional part of both crypto-native and real-world economies. “Burns will follow — but utility must lead,” the post read. In other words, the statement is calling for a change in priorities to align with more general trends in the crypto community where utility and real-world application are becoming the benchmark for long-term success.

50282078,559062,1755518262,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50282078.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper Presale Jumps Past $10M to Scale Bitcoin Amid Macro Tailwinds,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-presale-raises-10m/,"Bitcoin Hyper has soared past its $10M milestone, scooping up over $10.3M since going live on presale on May 16, 2025. Its early success boils down to its increasingly essential utility – a Layer 2 network designed to address Bitcoin’s pain points. With $BTC hitting a $124K ATH just four days ago on the back of macro tailwinds, Bitcoin Hyper ‘s positioned to extend its network’s capabilities amid peak demand. $BTC Hit New ATH After 92% Odds of Fed Rate Cut $BTC is the world’s largest crypto. With a current $115K price tag and $2.29T market cap, it takes up an eye-popping 59.1% of total crypto market value . Its dominance comes from being the world’s first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009. It set the benchmark and built blockchain trust ahead of its competitors, like Ethereum ($ETH) and Solana ($SOL). More recently, however, its popularity is fueled by macroeconomic uncertainty, a crypto-friendly US, and mounting institutional interest. $BTC hit its ATH as markets priced in a 92.% chance of the Fed cutting US interest rates by 25 bps this September, bringing the target range down to 4%–4.25%. Lower rates makes borrowing cheaper and thus often push investors toward risk assets like $BTC. On the backdrop of this, some analysts predict $BTC hitting $100M this year. But not everyone sees this as good news. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently cautioned that the #1 crypto could only reach that level if the US is facing severe economic distress. The crypto leader has also gained momentum since Donald Trump – the self-proclaimed ‘Crypto President’ – returned to the White House. Since then, he has supported legislation such as the ‘ GENIUS Act ,’ ‘ CLARITY Act ,’ and ‘ Project Crypto ’ to improve digital asset clarity. Trump’s crypto-friendly policies have also boosted hype for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, as clearer regulations and political support fuel institutional confidence. Backing this up, cumulative spot Bitcoin ETFs are now valued at a whopping $1.16T . Since Trump’s presidential victory on November 5, 2024, they’ve jumped by over 145% from $472.92B. Of course, these catalysts have helped push the crypto king forward ($BTC is up by 92%+ since last year). But there’s a hitch: Ethereum still wears the crown for on-chain activity. Ethereum Tops Bitcoin’s TVL by 1,000%+ Bitcoin is the foundation of $BTC, the world’s largest crypto. Yet, Ethereum – the linchpin of $ETH – leads in Total Value Locked (TVL) with $86.69B versus Bitcoin’s $7.49B . Their differences lie in their design. Bitcoin’s scripting language was built primarily for digital money and a store of value. In stark contrast, Ethereum was designed for programmability. Its ultimate goal from the get-go was to support smart contracts and a thriving DeFi ecosystem. The Bitcoin network handles around 7 transactions per second , with a block time averaging around 5 minutes and finalizes transactions within 1 hour. By comparison, Ethereum processes around 20 tps, with the capacity to scale over 100 tps. It confirms blocks every 12 seconds with finality in under 12 minutes. Bitcoin’s transaction fees are also much more volatile, averaging $0.68 compared to Ethereum’s $0.51 . Spikes occur during network congestion. Take the Bitcoin halving event , for example. It caused Bitcoin’s fees to exceed $130. It’s clear that Ethereum has the upper hand in terms of network scalability. But not if Bitcoin Hyper has anything to do with it. Bitcoin Hyper to Facilitate Near-Instant Transactions & dApps Once launched this quarter, the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 solution promises to solve the network’s long-standing scalability issues, once and for all. While it’s not the first-ever Bitcoin Layer 2, it has a competitive edge. Take the Lightning Network – it struggled with adoption due to concerns over fraud risks, maintenance requirements, and limited functionality. To ensure it doesn’t face the same hurdles, Bitcoin Hyper will integrate two powerful tools – a Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – to bring Bitcoin up to modern performance standards. The Canonical Bridge will enable Bitcoin’s base layer to connect with Hyper’s Layer 2. This way, you can deposit $BTC, mint wrapped versions for use in DeFi protocols, and withdraw back to the mainnet at any time. Batching transactions off-chain also means that it’ll reduce congestion and slash confirmation times from roughly an hour to seconds. Then there’s the SVM, bringing smart contract execution to Solana’s speeds. It’ll enable dApps, DeFi protocols, and even the best meme coins to run directly on Bitcoin’s network. In turn, it should boost its TVL and enable lower-fee transactions – all without compromising security. The project’s native token, $HYPER, is the backbone of it all. Cross-chain compatible with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, it fuels liquidity and app flows across ecosystems. To top it off, it also powers transactions with lower fees, can be staked at a 106% APY, and opens governance rights. With $10.3M already raised and 30% of its token supply earmarked for development, Bitcoin Hyper has the early backing to propel Bitcoin to greater heights. Join $HYPER for Under a Cent – Possible 2,400% Gains Ahead Bitcoin Hyper has what it takes to play a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s evolution. After all, it strives to make the network programmable, scalable, and able to compete with Ethereum’s on-chain dominance. Given that $BTC broke its ATH at the end of last week, demand on the network is bound to continue surging, so Layer 2 solutions like these are increasingly essential. To get the most out of the ecosystem, you can purchase $HYPER on presale for just $0.012745. The Layer 2’s launch is predicted to make the coin jump to $0.32 , so now signals a great time to join for potential returns exceeding 2,400%. This isn’t investment advice.

While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell below $ 115,000, Ethereum (ETH) fell to $ 4,300 levels. As volatility in Bitcoin and altcoins continues, whales have taken different actions. While some whales sold on the dip, others accumulated at lower levels. According to Lookonchain’s post, swing trading OTC whale 0xd8d0 purchased 10,000 ETH worth $43.43 million and 350 BTC worth $40.53 million during the drop. Again, 2 newly created wallets withdrew 25,684 ETH worth $114.3 million from FalconX hours ago. According to Onchain Lens data, another crypto whale withdrew 1.72 million USDC from Binance and used the funds to purchase 1.79 million Fartccoin (FARTCOIN). According to EmberCN data, the Sky Protocol co-founder bought back 16.38 million SKY using 1.77 million ENA. Since early June, it has repurchased 122 million SKY at an average price of $0.0836, for a total value of $10.21 million, using proceeds from SKY (USDS and CMB) staking and today's ENA. According to Onchain Lens data, a crypto whale sold ETH it had been holding for two years.

According to local reports, authorities looked into 2,962 people who together owed close to 20 billion won (about $14 million), and found 50 of them held crypto on major exchanges. Local Tax Office Uses AI Based on reports , the city’s tax division used AI tools to scan exchange records and trace possible hidden holdings. Officials reviewed data from Bithumb, Dunamu’s Upbit, Coinone and Korbit to match accounts to outstanding tax bills. The checks turned up roughly $166,270 in combined crypto assets tied to those 50 accounts — about 230 million won when converted — and the city has named the exchanges as third-party debtors to begin freezing and securing those coins. South Korea has given local and national tax bodies the power to confiscate crypto from delinquents since laws passed in 2021, and Jeju’s action follows a string of similar moves elsewhere. Reports show authorities across the country seized large sums in the last few years as they enforced tax collections , with national totals in the hundreds of millions of dollars. That legal backing makes it easier for cities to ask exchanges for customer data and to designate accounts for seizure when debts go unpaid. Exchanges Named As Third-Party Debtors Designating an exchange as a third-party debtor means the platform may be required to freeze assets and hand them over if the tax debts remain. For people who keep funds on exchanges, that raises immediate risk. If you owe more than a certain amount, your crypto could be locked or sold to cover what you owe. The sums in Jeju’s case are small compared with national totals, but the move signals that local tax offices will use available data and tools to go after unpaid bills. The sums seized in a single local sweep are unlikely to move global markets. Still, the practical effect is real for individuals and exchanges. People who keep crypto on domestic platforms may face faster enforcement, and exchanges will likely see more formal requests and stricter compliance checks. That could push some users to change how they hold digital assets or to be more punctual with tax filings.

50282207,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=805919,1755518453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50282207.jpeg,"Bitcoin Bulls Must Survive Brutal September Before Q4 Hope, Analyst Predicts",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bulls-must-survive-brutal-september-before-q4/,"Crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz expects Bitcoin to endure a grinding, probabilistic market over the next six weeks before conditions improve into the fourth quarter, warning that September seasonality, softening momentum signals, and mixed ETF flow dynamics argue for patience rather than leverage. “The TL;DW is probably chopped and bearish near-term, bullish Q4,” he said in an August 18 video, adding that the path to a cleaner upside impulse is explicitly conditional on a handful of technical and flow triggers rather than a single catalyst. The Battle Lines Are Drawn For Bitcoin Olszewicz anchors the near-term roadmap in flows and seasonality. He wants “just nothing—just flatline on [ETF] flows for the next couple weeks and then four weeks of even worse,” arguing that a reset would “set us up for Q4.” While he noted, “We did have $550 million in a week, which is pretty good for any ETF… still a solid number… not zero,” he contrasted that with earlier, much larger weekly tallies and observed that corporate treasury buying—“still a lot of sellers obviously if price hasn’t gone anywhere”—has slowed from peak pace. The implication is not overt bearishness, but “time, not price”: either sharp pullbacks in names that ran or “dead sideways for six weeks.” On Bitcoin’s chart, Olszewicz reduces the debate to a well-defined line in the sand and a small set of Ichimoku- and trend-based triggers. “Since July… $121–$122,000 is still the imaginary line in the sand… a daily close above that level, I’m good with higher,” he said, adding, “Above $120,000 it’s easy. I like $150,000.” Until that break, he sees “chop” dominating. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Sets $100 Billion Target For Bitcoin Credit Initiative He identifies “the first signs of trouble” as “closing in the daily cloud and/or closing below the 20-week moving average—the yellow line there at $104,000,” and stresses the timing nuance: “If we get a close below the cloud in September, I’m a little less worried than if we get it in October.” A decisive slip late in Q3 rolling into Q4 would be more concerning. “If we close below $100k in October, then I’m closer to this cycle-over, no-more-cycles camp,” he warned, clarifying, “We’re far from that currently… there’s nothing here that’s bearish whatsoever—it’s just momentumless.” His preferred system-of-confirmation leans on the Ichimoku suite and a separate cloud backtest he tracks on the BTC daily chart. That model “caught [the] April move” early; at present it reads “okay,” but he outlines the precise sequence that would flip his bias: “You need first the bearish TK cross… and then a close in the cloud… then there’s a decent edge-to-edge trade.” It’s a decision tree, not a prediction: “It’s nuanced… if this, then that.” Macro timing could add friction in the interim. He points to Friday’s Jackson Hole appearance by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as the only obvious near-term “catalyst,” suggesting a hawkish tone—“not cutting, needing more data, needing more time”—would be a headwind. He also mused that “Trump may even announce his replacement before Powell speaks… just to steal the thunder,” framing it as a headline-risk factor for risk assets, not a base case. Still, the larger macro backdrop—rising global money supply and debt—remains a structural tailwind for scarce assets, in his view: “That’s going to provide a nice cushion… as they keep printing money everywhere globally.” Waiting For The Q4 Seasonality Olszewicz emphasizes that this doesn’t preclude upside, but it does undercut the probability of trending continuation in the very near term. By contrast, he calls Ethereum’s positioning “horrific… for the long side,” even as ETH just printed a record ETF-flow week—an apparent paradox he resolves by distinguishing one-week surges from the “stream of continuous flows” that sustains trends. The comparison matters for Bitcoin because a broad-based crypto risk bid is harder to maintain if ETH’s positioning and overbought technicals stall leadership. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Accumulation Prevails As LTH Selling Pressure Eases Within Bitcoin’s own market structure, Olszewicz blends tactical caution with the longer-term thesis many cycle investors still hold. He flags that “August has been bullish” so far but notes the historical rarity of “six months in a row” of green closes, and he reiterates that traders looking for “high-conviction moves” with leverage should prefer to wait for signals rather than force exposure in “nothingness.” Conversely, for long-horizon holders, he cites the power-law corridor as a reason to avoid second-guessing unless the market fails badly into Q4: “If you think there’s a… 30–50% chance that we actually attempt a parabolic move past the midpoint of the power law… it’s probably just worth sitting tight as an investor and saying, okay, show it to me.” That framework also explains his tolerance for deeper retests without abandoning the larger uptrend. He repeats that there is “plenty [of] room to get angry and go down,” with the 20-week moving average and daily cloud serving as objective guardrails. A September cloud break is a warning; an October cloud break or an October close below $100k would be a far stronger statement about the cycle’s health. Until then, he expects a market “holding levels,” with $121,000–$122,000 as the trigger that would convert “dead momentum” into a genuine impulse. For Bitcoin traders, the takeaway is spare and unsentimental. There is no “magical setup” this week, and the statistically unfriendly month of September looms. The bullish path into Q4 exists, but it must be earned: In the meantime, Olszewicz’s baseline is either rangebound “nothingness” or opportunistic pullbacks that reset overheated pockets of the market. The contingency that flips that script is clear enough to write on a Post-it: maintain the cloud, defend the 20-week around $104,000, and close decisively above $121,000–$122,000. Only then, Bitcoin could target $150,000.” At press time, BTC traded at $115,069.

The token of Ripple has endured years of volatility, lawsuits, and market cycles but continues to be among the leading altcoins by market cap and investor interest. Analysts are asking: can it finally breakout to new highs and sprint to $10 by 2025? At the same time, a new contender is beginning to gain attention. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , a Layer 2 Ethereum memecoin, is causing waves with its combination of meme-driven community expansion and actual blockchain utility. XRP can boast stability and institutional support, but $LBRETT is being hailed by many as the largest gainer cryptocurrency of 2025 on the strength of its explosive staking rewards and presale early success. XRP Price Prediction – Numbers Investors Are Watching XRP has appreciated by 30% for the past three months. Its market cap is at $184.79 billion, and trading volume has decreased by 24.19% to $5.54 billion. These figures show that interest in XRP is still ongoing but also some short-term caution among traders. For a long-term investor, the key catalyst of the XRP Price Prediction is the increasing adoption of Ripple for cross-border payments and international remittances. Through its partnerships ranging from banks to fintechs around the world, Ripple has developed a unique value proposition within the payment industry. Why Investors Are Tipping Layer Brett Over XRP Where XRP offers steady growth, dry investors seeking exponential returns are stampeding into Layer Brett. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, $LBRETT is optimized for speed, scalability, and dirt-cheap gas fees—all upon the cultural trajectory of meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. Here are the reasons why experts think that $LBRETT will beat XRP in 2025: Near-instant transactions with practically zero gas fees Staking rewards of more than 20,000% APY for early investors Special $1 million bonus for presale contributors Fully decentralized system with no KYC limitationsBuilt for mass adoption as the next 100x meme token As opposed to XRP, which is betting on regulatory clarity and business momentum, Layer Brett is built on viral community sentiment and decentralized growth. It’s where meme power meets real blockchain utility that has experts calling it one of the best crypto presales of 2025. XRP Price Prediction vs. $LBRETT’s Stunning Upside Ripple’s token can potentially go to approximately $10 by 2025, yet even that rosy prospect may appear unassuming next to the expected upside of Layer Brett. It has a limited supply of 10 billion tokens, open tokenomics, and staking rewards that are unmatchable among leading coins, and $LBRETT has the kind of early-stage growth potential that many recall witnessing on Shiba Inu’s legendary 2021 move. For traditional investors, XRP Price Predictions are security. But for those seeking life-changing returns, $LBRETT is a chance to get in before a possible 50x–100x lift. Investors seeking the best of both worlds hold both, but those that are desirous of the next break-out cryptocurrency are fighting for a spot in Layer Brett’s presale before the window is closed. With over 20,000% APY passive income rewards and an active community, it may be the project that puts even the most bullish XRP Price Prediction in the dust. Buy Layer Brett today, stake your $LBRETT, and get ready for explosive gains.

Next Bull Run Might Define New Era of Wealth,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-the-big-shift-is-coming-next-bull-run-might-define-new-era-of-wealth/,"Crypto analyst John Squire has delivered a bold message to digital asset investors. In a recent post on X, he wrote: “The Big Shift is Coming. FOX Business reports: trillions are about to flood into the crypto space. This massive inflow could reshape global finance and accelerate adoption like never before. For XRP holders, the next bull run might define an entirely new era of wealth.” His comments highlight growing anticipation that the next wave of institutional participation could transform the crypto market. Central to this narrative is JPMorgan’s policy shift, confirmed in a Fox Business segment, where the bank announced it would now allow clients to buy Bitcoin. From Critic to Reluctant Gatekeeper JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has long been a vocal critic of Bitcoin on Wall Street, directly addressed the shift in policy in a Fox Business interview, noting that financial advisors can now invest clients’ trillions of dollars in assets under management into Bitcoin. The Big Shift is Coming FOX Business reports: trillions are about to flood into the crypto space. This massive inflow could reshape global finance and accelerate adoption like never before. For #XRP holders, the next bull run might define an entirely new era of wealth pic.twitter.com/CHOHWfij1o — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) August 18, 2025 “We anticipated the price increase, given the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly stance. This move was inevitable, which is why the price has surged. It’s likely to continue, especially since major banks like Bank of America haven’t yet made a decision and will probably follow suit.” Dimon’s words underscore a striking reality. Although she has repeatedly dismissed Bitcoin in the past, even calling it “worthless” and a “fraud,” his acknowledgment that the policy shift was “inevitable” signals a profound change in how major banks engage with digital assets. Institutional Adoption Accelerates The timing of this announcement is significant. With regulatory attitudes toward crypto softening under the Trump administration, banks are increasingly exploring ways to integrate digital assets into their services. JPMorgan’s move may place pressure on competitors like Bank of America and other financial giants to follow suit. For the broader market, institutional trillions represent more than just new liquidity—they signal validation. As financial advisors across the United States gain the ability to recommend Bitcoin, investor confidence is expected to grow, potentially driving demand across the entire sector. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for XRP Holders Although JPMorgan’s decision focuses on Bitcoin, Squire highlighted its significance for investors in XRP as well. If institutional inflows reshape the crypto economy, assets like XRP, designed for cross-border payments and enterprise use cases , could benefit. By linking Dimon’s remarks to the larger market narrative, Squire suggests XRP holders should brace for more than just incremental growth. “The next bull run might define an entirely new era of wealth,” he wrote, signaling that the magnitude of institutional entry could create opportunities across multiple digital assets. A Defining Moment Approaches The convergence of regulatory shifts, banking adoption, and institutional inflows has set the stage for what Squire calls “The Big Shift.” With Fox Business confirming that trillions may soon enter the market and JPMorgan breaking ground on mainstream access, the crypto industry is on the cusp of transformation. For XRP holders, the message is clear: the coming bull run could mark more than another cycle—it may represent a structural turning point in global finance.

The national consumer regulator found that the company undermined competition by funding the country’s two biggest telecom carriers to load its search app on Android devices, limiting access for rival search engines. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said Monday that the tech giant made deals with Telstra and Optus to share ad revenue from Google Search on Android phones between late 2019 and early 2021. The regulator said the agreements ensured Google’s search app was pre-installed, reducing visibility for competing search providers. Google admits unfair practices Google acknowledged the setup had a substantial effect on rival search engines and said it has stopped entering such agreements. It also accepted the A$55 million penalty, the ACCC said. “Today’s outcome … created the potential for millions of Australians to have greater search choice in the future, and for competing search providers to gain meaningful exposure to Australian consumers,” ACCC Chair Gina-Cass Gottlieb said. The ACCC and Google jointly asked the Federal Court to impose the A$55 million fine. The regulator added that the court still needs to rule on the appropriateness of the amount, but that working with the tech giant avoided protracted litigation. A Google spokesperson said the company was pleased to resolve the ACCC’s concerns, which involved “provisions that haven’t been in our commercial agreements for some time”. The spokesperson added: “We are committed to providing Android device makers more flexibility to pre-load browsers and search apps, while preserving the offerings and features that help them innovate, compete with Apple, and keep costs low.” A Telstra spokesperson pointed Reuters to an earlier statement saying Telstra and Optus, which is owned by Singapore Telecommunications, cooperated fully with the ACCC and have pledged not to enter agreements with Google to pre-install its search product since 2024. The penalty arrives after a difficult week for the Alphabet unit Days earlier, a court largely sided with Fortnite maker Epic Games in a case alleging that Google and Apple blocked competing app stores on their mobile platforms. That lawsuit is part of Epic’s long-running push against leading smartphone companies in several markets. According to reports on the Australian decision, the Federal Court concluded the phone makers’ app stores lacked safeguards to prevent anti-competitive conduct. Epic argued Apple and Google set download fees for its games too high and prevented users from installing Epic’s alternative app store. The Australian ruling, which spans 2,000 pages, was not made public, but media said a judge’s summary indicated the companies did not intentionally violate the law. In a post on X, Epic said the Australian court “just found that Apple and Google abuse their control over app distribution and in-app payments to limit competition”.

On-chain analyst Ali Martinez suggested earlier this week that Cardano could be breaking out of a triangular consolidation pattern, “eyeing $1.10” as the next upside target. At the time, ADA was hovering just below the psychological $1 level at $0.97, its highest since March.

Highlighting a “buy signal on Cardano ADA hourly from TD Sequential,” the analyst argued that the token “could be ready to bounce.” Buy signal on Cardano $ADA hourly from TD Sequential.

Still, the token remains up 13.36% on the week, with its market capitalization climbing from $28.59 billion to $31.98 billion, adding over $3 billion in value and securing its position as the 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market worth. ADA 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold The pullback follows a rapid run-up, with ADA surging 52% over the past 60 days and notching a five-month high of $0.98 last week. Momentum indicators reflected overheating conditions, with the 14-day RSI at 70.55 signaling overbought levels. That triggered widespread profit-taking, compounded by Bitcoin’s 2.6% drop that sparked over $300 million in liquidations across altcoins. What this means for Cardano The 24-hour trading volume eased slightly, down 0.52% to $2.08 billion, signaling waning buy-side pressure. On-chain data also shows that an estimated 94% of ADA holders remain in profit, a setup that often coincides with short-term corrections as traders secure gains. For bulls, the immediate line in the sand sits between $0.89 and $0.90, aligned with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. A sustained break below this support could expose ADA to further downside, potentially retesting the $0.85 region. Conversely, holding the line could set the stage for another move higher, with $1.10 still within scope if Martinez’s breakout thesis plays out.

HYPE Price Is Down 7% in a Week,https://cryptonews.com/news/hype-price-prediction-hype-price-is-down-7-in-a-week/,"HYPE sits at a crossroads between correction and complete reversal, with bearishness creeping into Hyperliquid price predictions over the past week. The altcoin has bled 7% on the back of Russia–Ukraine peace talk uncertainty and hotter-than-expected U.S. PPI inflation data, which dented hopes for a September rate cut. Still, analysts anticipate up to four rate cuts before year-end, with the potential to stimulate new demand for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

The market appears to be betting on a short-term correction, according to Coinglass data , with a long/short ratio of 3.11 on Binance showing over 75% of traders are longing the HYPE price. This suggests the recent 7% dip was more of a shakeout of weak hands than the start of a full reversal, as derivative traders reload long positions in anticipation of further gains.

HYPE / USDT 1-day chart, ascending channel pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. Momentum indicators, however, remain on edge. The RSI has slipped back below the neutral line, signaling renewed bearish pressure as sellers dictate the short-term trend. The MACD line is on track to cross below the signal line, a looming death cross that could confirm the start of a more established mid-term downtrend. A deeper correction to the $38.60 0.786 Fibonacci level may be the next move to retest the lower trendline of the ascending channel that has guided HYPE’s 3-month uptrend. In whichever case, as bullishness returns in anticipation of September interest rate cuts, another bull run could see the HYPE price advance to retest stubborn resistance at $50. If flipped to support, $50 would open the door to new price discovery and a potential breakout from the ascending channel, targeting $100 for a potential 130% move from current prices.

This reversal has injected uncertainty into the short-term outlook, with ETH now retesting key supports that will determine whether the broader bullish trend remains intact. Ethereum Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, Ethereum was rejected near its $4.8K all-time high, as heavy selling pressure, likely from profit-taking and unstaking, added to supply. The decline pushed price back toward a confluence of supports, including the ascending channel’s midline and the $4.2K demand zone. As long as ETH holds above this area, the broader bullish market structure remains valid. However, a breakdown below this zone could expose $3.8K, which aligns with a prior consolidation base and would mark a deeper retracement. Meanwhile, the RSI indicator has rolled over from overbought conditions, forming a bearish divergence that reinforces the corrective tone. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ethereum displayed a classic liquidity hunt as it approached the liquidity pool around the $4.8K mark, triggering stop orders and late breakout entries before reversing sharply. This rejection also broke below a recent higher low, hinting at the early stages of a market structure shift. Currently, ETH is consolidating within a corrective phase, testing multiple support confluences. These include the $4.2K region, the ascending trendline (Blue), and, in the case of a deeper pullback, the multi-month channel’s midline near $3.8K. Until a decisive breakout occurs, ETH is likely to remain volatile, oscillating around these critical supports as the market establishes its next direction. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Ethereum has recently exhibited increased volatility, with the price action heavily influenced by liquidity-driven moves. The liquidation heatmap highlights where leveraged positions are concentrated, offering key levels that may attract the price in the short term. Over the past week, ETH surged toward the $4.8K region, sweeping the liquidity pool located there before encountering strong selling pressure that triggered a sharp rejection. The retracement drove price back toward the $4K zone, which serves as a critical and psychological support. Notably, a significant cluster of liquidation levels is now visible below the $3.8K threshold. This suggests that, in the event of a deeper correction, ETH could target this area to trigger long liquidations and capture liquidity before staging another bullish leg higher. Such levels often act as magnets for price, increasing the probability of a liquidity grab in that region. That said, traders should remain cautious of false breakouts, as liquidity hunts on both sides of the market are likely to continue until a decisive trend structure takes hold.

За последние 24 часа BTC снова поднялся выше отметки $120 000, а ETH достиг $4 330, максимума с 2021 года. Этот рост стал серьезным ударом для шорт-селлеров, особенно по Эфириуму, где ликвидации достигли сотен миллионов долларов. Хватит играть против Bitcoin и Ethereum Движение цен за последние сутки дало Эрику Трампу повод подчеркнуть усиливающийся бычий настрой вокруг двух крупнейших криптовалют. Семья Трампов активно участвовала в обсуждении крипторынка на протяжении всего текущего цикла. Выступая в соцсети, Эрик Трамп написал: «Мне приятно видеть, как сегодня сгорают шорты по ETH. Хватит ставить против BTC и ETH – вас просто сметет». Этими словами он ясно дал понять, что считает медвежьи позиции против топовых криптовалют опасной ставкой на фоне последних ценовых движений. Его комментарий прозвучал на фоне мощного роста Эфириума, который обернулся ликвидацией более чем $212 млн в коротких позициях, по данным Coinglass. Прорыв биткоина выше уровня сопротивления в $120 000 оказал дополнительное давление на продавцов, показав, что импульс перешёл на сторону быков. Подчеркнув успехи Bitcoin и Ethereum, Эрик Трамп не только отметил поражение медведей, но и намекнул, что восходящий тренд еще далеко не исчерпан. Семья Трампа расширяет свое присутствие в сфере криптовалют По сообщениям СМИ, World Liberty Financial сейчас привлекает крупных технологических и криптоинвесторов с целью собрать $1,5 млрд для создания публичной компании, которая будет держать токены WLFI. Кроме того, компания вышла в сферу майнинга криптовалют через проект American Bitcoin и заключила партнерство с Hut 8 для создания того, что они называют стратегическим биткоин-резервом. По данным Bloomberg, доля Эрика Трампа в American Bitcoin может достигнуть $367 млн после выхода компании на биржу в ближайшие недели. На регуляторном фронте президент Трамп недавно подписал указ, разрешающий использование криптовалют в пенсионных планах 401(k). Это шаг, который может значительно ускорить массовое внедрение цифровых активов. На момент написания биткоин торгуется на уровне $121 670, а эфириум около $4 280.
