The first name had meaning, but it also hinted at a depth that did not fit the site's clear look anymore. Today's gamers want quickness, ease, and clarity. By leaving out “King,” the site shared a strong no͏te: it's aimed at new fun, not big ideas. The change wasn't about losing honor—it was about getting meaning. A brighter, simpler name fits just right with the brand's path toward world accessibility. How the rebrand sharpened Menace’s identity instantly The transition to Menace online casino gave the platform a sharper edge. The shorter name is easier to recall, fits neatly across devices, and resonates with players in different regions. Branding updates across the website, promotions, and sportsbook made the change feel complete rather than cosmetic. Users noticed the difference immediately. The rebrand aligned perfectly with Menace’s strengths: fast registration, responsive play on mobile, and seamless integration of casino and sportsbook services. Why games and promotions make the new brand stronger The rebrand didn’t change what matters most—game variety. Menace still offers more than 7,000 titles, from slots like Book of Dead, Starburst, and Sweet Bonanza, to live dealer experiences such as Teen Patti Live and Immersive Roulette. The sportsbook continues to cover football, basketball, tennis, cricket, and esports with competitive odds. Promotions also got fresh power with the Menace name. Players like a 100% deposit match to $500, free spins and weekly cash back. The VIP Club gives rewards for loyalty with special offers, faster withdrawals and personal account managers. How the industry is reacting to Menace’s bold move Rebrands often divide opinion, but Menace’s shift has been widely praised. Industry watchers see it as a smart adjustment to meet global trends in digital branding. Players see it as a promise: less fluff, more focus on what makes gaming enjoyable. Licensing under the Autonomous Island of Anjouan (Union of the Comoros, License No. ALSI-202506021-FI1) reassures users that behind the sleek new identity lies a stable, regulated foundation. Why Menace proves bold rebrands can shape the future By dropping “King” Menace showed that simple can be a strong move. The new name, with safe payments, quick cash outs, and clear deals makes it more than only a casino and sportsbook; it's a fresh center for online fun. For players, the sign is plain. Menace ain't caught in the past. It’s making the future of online play, and it’s doing this with boldness, clearness, and style. With over 500,000 monthly active users, 7,000+ games, and jackpots topping $1 million, the numbers back the brand’s bold choice. This growth shows that clarity and confidence can fuel long-term success in a crowded global market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ether, DAI maintains relative price steadiness, making it an ideal medium for wagering without worrying about sudden swings. In this article, we explore the best DAI-friendly casinos and gambling platforms in 2025, review their features, and show what to look for when choosing one. Why Choose DAI for Online Gambling?

Use Reputable Wallets — Prefer wallets you control, not custodial ones. Check Audit Reports & Proofs — Provably fair systems and third-party audits give clues about trust.

Treat gambling as entertainment, not income. Final Thoughts DAI is a smart choice for crypto gamblers who want stability without sacrificing blockchain benefits. The casinos reviewed here provide a starting point, but always verify current status, DAI support, and your jurisdiction’s rules.

Approval odds are now close to 100% , and the market is already positioning for what could be a historic shift. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 The first Solana spot ETF , launched by REX-Osprey in July, was the first SEC-approved product with built-in staking rewards , and it has earned over $400 million so far. Now, giants like Grayscale, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton , and VanEck are awaiting green lights on their own Solana ETF products, with decisions expected in the next 48 hours . If approved, this could unleash a fresh wave of institutional capital into SOL, sending its price soaring. Solana Price Prediction: SOL’s RSI Sends Buy Signal as Price Climbs Above $200 The daily chart shows that Solana found strong resistance at around $250 last month, but the token still seems headed to retest that area as positive momentum has gained traction again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just climbed above its 14-day moving average – a move often seen as a classic buy signal. If the current downtrend continues, the $200 level will be the key support to watch. A strong bounce from that zone would reinforce a bullish Solana price prediction and could trigger the next push toward new all-time highs. With macro conditions, market sentiment, and institutional flows all leaning positive, the setup for SOL looks increasingly favorable. At the same time, top crypto presales are riding this momentum too. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has already raised $1.7 million to build its mine-to-earn (M2E) gaming platform, offering early investors a shot at outsized gains before the token lists on major exchanges. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Mining Easier Than Ever Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has turned mining into a fun game that requires zero hardware but offers high rewards to early adopters. Instead of buying and waiting until the presale token launches, users can earn $PEPENODE by setting up virtual mining nodes to collect rewards from day one. To climb the leaderboard, players can buy more rigs, upgrade their setup, and participate in competitions. Those who make it to the top will be eligible to receive attractive airdrops of tokens like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) and Bonk ($BONK). In addition, the project introduces a deflationary burn mechanic, where 70% of tokens spent on upgrades are permanently burned to reduce $PEPENODE’s circulating supply. To launch your own virtual mining system and start earning, simply head to the Pepenode official website and connect a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this presale token or use a bank card to invest instead.

52865582,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/solana-price-prediction-sol-rejected-at-229-eyes-key-support-at-200,1759963658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/52865582.jpeg,"Solana Price Prediction: SOL Rejected at $229, Eyes Key Support at $200",https://bitzo.com/2025/10/solana-price-prediction-sol-rejected-at-229-eyes-key-support-at-200,"Solana’s recent attempt to regain upward momentum has stalled. After a sharp rejection at $229.49, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, SOL broke below its 30-day Simple Moving Average and is now retracing toward key support zones. This pattern is familiar in crypto. When liquidity shifts and narratives cool, traders reposition quickly. But so do communications teams. At Outset PR, this kind of market behavior is tracked in real time using Outset Data Pulse , an in-house analytics platform that scans media cycles across Web3. The goal is simple: to keep clients visible when momentum shifts, and to optimize media strategy during volatility. Failed Breakout, Bearish Signals SOL failed to reclaim its September swing high of $253, facing hard resistance at $229—a level that had previously acted as a pivot zone. This triggered a wave of selling as short-term holders exited positions. The move pushed SOL under its 30-day SMA ($225.57), with the MACD histogram turning negative at –0.489, confirming a shift in momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI (49.79) shows neutral-to-bearish sentiment, lacking the strength typically needed for a sustained rebound. Support at $214 in Focus as Momentum Weakens Source: coinmarketcap The current pullback puts pressure on the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $214.84. If Solana closes below this level on the daily chart, selling could intensify, opening the path toward $200—a round-number support that carries both psychological and historical significance. Previous market cycles show that when similar technical setups occur (MACD flip, failed Fib breakout, and neutral RSI), 78% of cases resulted in 5–8% corrections. This gives traders a well-defined downside target range of $198–$205 in the short term. Retail Interest Shifts to BNB Chain A key reason behind Solana’s decline is the sharp rotation of speculative capital into rival ecosystems. On October 8, BNB Chain meme coins like $BSC surged, with 35x returns drawing in large volumes of retail liquidity. BNB Chain posted $20.5 billion in daily volume, outpacing Solana’s $12.7 billion by a significant margin. That 61% gap is not just statistical—it reflects a shift in risk appetite. Solana’s own meme coin activity has thinned. Tokens like $TRUMP and BONK have seen DEX volume drop 18% since October 7, and the BNB/SOL volume ratio has reached 1.61, its highest level since June 2025. Momentum, it seems, is flowing elsewhere—for now. How Outset PR Keeps Projects Visible Amid Volume Rotation These market shifts matter not only to traders, but also to crypto projects trying to remain in the spotlight. That is where Outset PR’s data-driven approach stands out. Using its proprietary Syndication Map , Outset PR identifies which publications offer the best syndication lift for a given budget. Rather than spraying stories across low-impact outlets, it targets platforms with high engagement and republishing potential—such as CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance. This is not just a tactical move. It is a strategic method to ensure projects are seen when others are buried by noise. With Anastasia Anisimova leading a deeply networked media relations team, Outset PR maintains strong ties with editors, which helps secure tier-1 coverage even during downtrends. “Most agencies pitch blindly,” Anisimova says. “We pitch thoughtfully, with timing, tone, and momentum in mind.” As a result, clients achieve coverage that not only lands—but spreads. Just one Outset PR campaign for StealthEX generated 92 republications, reaching over 3 billion views from a single placement. Conclusion: $200 Becomes the Line in the Sand Solana’s rejection at $229, declining on-chain activity, and weakening momentum indicators all suggest a deeper correction is underway. A breakdown below $214.84 could accelerate the move toward $200, where buyers may begin to re-enter—if confidence returns. In parallel to price action, narrative visibility matters too. As traders shift capital and volume flows into rival chains, media attention moves with it. Through tools like Outset Data Pulse and Syndication Map, Outset PR ensures that projects stay aligned with the cycle, adapt when needed, and remain visible—even when the market turns. Because in crypto, those who adjust early are the ones still visible when the next rally begins.

The dynamics of institutional interest are shifting, and Ethereum's advantages may position it ahead. Dive into this analysis to discover which cryptocurrencies are primed for significant growth in the coming months. Ethereum Eyes New Heights as Price Climbs Source: tradingview Ethereum is riding a wave with its price sitting in an impressive range between $4,198 and $4,725. The cryptocurrency recently enjoyed a week-long boost of over 7%, and its six-month growth stands at a staggering 192%. If Ethereum can overcome its closest resistance at just under $5,000, it could aim for a higher target above $5,463. Its relative strength index suggests it still has room to grow before hitting overbought levels. The current market sentiment reveals potential for Ethereum to push beyond its boundaries, setting the stage for exciting developments ahead. With these encouraging trends, Ethereum could soon be in uncharted territories, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. Conclusion Ethereum has seen a steady increase in interest from institutional investors. With its growing use in DeFi and NFTs, ETH offers more utility options than Bitcoin. While BTC remains a strong asset due to its established reputation, ETH's versatile applications make it a compelling option. The demand dynamics may shift, potentially positioning ETH alongside or even ahead of Bitcoin in terms of institutional demand. The evolving preferences of institutional investors could redefine the crypto market’s structure. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As US regulators begin drafting regulation ahead of what could be crypto’s last bull run before global adoption, traders are increasingly focusing on XRP, Binance Coin, and Zcash, viewing them as leading candidates for the next significant breakout. Ripple (XRP): Top Cross-Border Payments Solution and Leading Altcoin of 2025 XRP ($XRP) is the token of a lightning-fast and cheap payments-focused blockchain, positioning itself as a direct rival to legacy systems like SWIFT. Attention from the UN Capital Development Fund and partnerships with several U.S. banking institutions have given it a higher profile, helping it to become the third largest coin with a market cap of over $172 billion. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, underscores the company’s ambition to dominate the rapidly expanding stablecoin sector. Over the last year, XRP has surged 443%, rocketing to its first new peak in seven years, hitting $3.65 on July 18 before easing roughly 21% to its current price, $2.88. Still, it has nearly quintupled Bitcoin’s 97% gain over the same period. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits around 46, with plenty of headroom to reverse XRP’s intraday loss of 3.4%, which is broadly in line with a wider 2% downturn across crypto’s $4.29 trillion market. The chart shows a possible breakout soon, supported by the two bull flag formations spotted in XRP’s summer charts. With additional ETF decisions expected in mid-October, forecasts place potential upside targets between $5 and $10, with room for greater expansion in a full-fledged bull market. Binance Coin (BNB) Extends Gains as Market Consolidates Once merely an exchange token for paying Binance fees, Binance Coin ($BNB) has evolved into one of the biggest cryptos in the world. Introduced in 2017, BNB’s utility now extends to decentralized applications, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi platforms. Its deflationary tokenomics, driven by Binance’s scheduled token burns, continually reduce supply and support long-term price growth. The token’s influence stretches beyond Binance’s ecosystem. Many merchants worldwide now accept BNB, including travel companies, and gaming platforms, strengthening its position among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Earlier today, BNB reached a new all-time high of $1,330.51. It now trades just 0.9% short of that level as it breaks out from a bullish pennant pattern formed over the spring. An overscorched RSI of 79 means some short term losses are likely going into the weekend as the token’s price consolidates nort of $1,000. If bullish momentum continues over the mid-to-long-term, a run toward $2,000 by year end is possible. Conversely, in a downside scenario, the $1,000 level could serve as a major psychological and technical support zone. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy-Focused Crypto Skyrockets 147% in One Week Launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin fork, Zcash ($ZEC) has a single mission: financial privacy. Zcash utilizes zk-SNARKs, short for “zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge,” a form of advanced cryptography that validates transactions without revealing sender, recipient, or transaction amounts. Its dual-address system lets users toggle between transparent and shielded addresses, enabling privacy where desired while maintaining compliance flexibility when necessary. During the past week, ZEC has climbed 58%, trading near $139 as renewed interest in privacy coins ripples through Uptober’s rally. Similar projects such as Dash and Verge also saw double-digit percentage gains of 23% and 33% respectively over the last seven days. However, with its RSI at 69, Zcash is close to overbought, suggesting a short-term correction below $100 may be likely before the next leg up. Still, a good news cycle could push the price towards toward $300 by the end of the year. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme-Infused Bitcoin Layer-2 and 2025’s Hottest Presale Among newer entrants, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has emerged as one of 2025’s most anticipated presale tokens. The project enhances Bitcoin’s proven security with Layer-2 scalability and the viral energy of meme culture. HYPER’s mission is to expand Bitcoin’s utility, enabling faster payments, decentralized governance, and sophisticated smart contract capabilities through a dedicated Layer-2 network. So far, its presale has attracted over $22.5 million, with analysts projecting tenfold or greater returns once the token officially launches. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine, the HYPER platform offers ultra-cheap smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp support, and seamless meme token integration. A Coinsult audit recently confirmed zero vulnerabilities, further boosting investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels all ecosystem functions, from staking and transaction fees to governance rights. Early investors can currently earn up to 51% APY by staking while gaining DAO voting privileges. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

This unexpected drop has sparked debate among investors and analysts. Is this merely a temporary setback, or could it signal the beginning of a more significant downturn? This article delves into the current market dynamics and highlights other cryptocurrencies poised for potential growth. XRP Eyes Growth: Price Hanging on Resistance Challenge Source: tradingview XRP's current price floats between nearly $2.80 and just over $3. The coin's main challenge lies in breaking past the nearby resistance level at about $3.25. If it manages to do so, it might aim for the next target around $3.50. This would hint at a growth of close to 13% from its lower range. The past six months have been positive for XRP , with an increase of over 45%. However, the short-term outlook seems tepid with minimal weekly gains. While underlying signals like the MACD suggest a cautious market, XRP enthusiasts remain hopeful for robust movement past these hurdles. Conclusion XRP’s recent price drop raises questions about its future direction. It's uncertain whether this is a brief dip or the start of a longer decline. The coin showed significant gains in September but could be facing new challenges. Watching other coins like Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana might provide context, as market trends often influence each other. The crypto market remains volatile, and XRP’s next moves will be closely monitored by traders and investors. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

52866031,601453,1759964439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52866031.jpeg,Buying XRP Now Could Be A Good Idea As Negative Sentiment Jumps To 6-Month High,https://bitcoinist.com/buying-xrp-now-a-good-idea/,"XRP’s price action has underperformed most top cryptocurrencies that have rallied alongside Bitcoin in the past 48 hours. This consolidation comes after a failed attempt to break through resistance near $3.10, which has seen the token slip back down below $3. However, recent on-chain data from analytics platform Santiment shows that despite XRP’s slower pace, something important is brewing beneath the surface, and it could signal a buying opportunity. Growing Negative Sentiment Around XRP According to Santiment’s latest market data, XRP is currently experiencing its highest level of retail fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the last six months. The last time the altcoin experienced this high level of retail fear was when Trump’s tariff announcements unsettled markets earlier this year. Data from Santiment shows that bearish commentary about the token on social media has significantly outweighed bullish sentiment over the past three days. Particularly, negative sentiment has dominated two out of the last three days. The ratio of bullish to bearish mentions dropped to 0.86 on October 6 and 0.74 on October 4. Such moments of excessive pessimism among retail traders have always coincided with local price bottoms for the token. The same sentiment imbalance that came before reversals in the past is reappearing and the current fear could once again be a precursor to recovery in the coming days. The chart data below, which was shared by Santiment on the social media platform X, shows XRP’s bullish-to-bearish ratio reached 3.21 on September 17, and this was a reliable top signal that was followed by a price correction. On the other hand, the latest readings from October reveal an opposite setup, one where fear is dominating. Is Buying The Altcoin A Good Idea? Based on the latest on-chain data, Santiment believes that now could be one of the most favorable moments to buy XRP. The crowd’s tendency to sell or express skepticism during these emotional lows gives opportunity for smart traders to accumulate at lower prices before the next uptrend. Santiment’s comment on X noted that crypto prices tend to move opposite to retail expectations, with similar FUD being a good sign of a potential breakout. This means that the current surge in bearish chatter might actually point to an upcoming rally, especially if a Spot XRP ETF is launched in October. Despite its price struggles and losing both $3 and $2.9 in the past 48 hours, the altcoin has managed to hold above $2.8, which has proven to be one of the most important supports since August, alongside $2.72. Therefore, XRP’s ability to hold above its short-term support around $2.80 despite mounting negative sentiment reinforces the idea that downside pressure could soon exhaust itself and pave the way for a bounce to retest $3.10. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.87, down by 3.3% in a 24-hour timeframe.",XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 23:00:39

Related Reading: Ethereum Faces TD Sell Signal At Key Resistance—$4,100 Next? The catalyst stack is clear: Mantle unveiled a compliance-first Real-World Assets (RWA) “Tokenization-as-a-Service” suite at Token2049, positioning the L2 as one of the few ecosystems building institutional-grade RWA rails. Momentum accelerated as World Liberty Financial confirmed its USD1 stablecoin, currently the #6 stablecoin with $2.6 billion cap, will launch on Mantle, a credibility boost for the network’s DeFi and payments footprint. A deeper “Mantle × Bybit Roadmap” adds distribution as Bybit processes over $30 billion in daily volume, offering Mantle instant visibility to a global trading base. Despite Profit-Taking, Volumes, Futures, and Liquidity Show Real Demand Recently, Spot activity has exploded as daily volume climbed from $125M in early September to over $612 million, while market cap nearly doubled to $7.3 billion, lifting Mantle into the top 35. Derivatives confirm conviction, open interest rose 26% to $4.85 billion, and funding stayed positive for nearly two weeks. On the chart, MNT invalidated a textbook bearish rising-wedge by breaking upward, then stacked short-term MAs above long-term, with a 50/200-day “golden cross” and a bullish MACD backdrop to match the narrative. One yellow flag, “smart money” holdings slid 49% over 30 days to 18.1 million MNT (Nansen), implying selective profit-taking into strength. That doesn’t break the uptrend, but it does argue for disciplined risk management and attention to spot-led versus leverage-led pushes. Key levels: Can Mantle (MNT) Clear $2.60 and Open a Path to $3? Technically, MNT’s structure remains constructive. Immediate support sits near $2.00–$2.10 (watch the $2.09 gap); holding above keeps the higher-low sequence intact. Overhead, $2.60 is the next inflection and a psychological line in the sand; a high-volume daily close above $2.60 would set up a measured move toward $2.85–$3.00. MNT's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: MNTUSD on Tradingview Failure to reclaim $2.60 on rising volume raises the odds of a reset into the $2.20s, where bulls will try to defend momentum against the backdrop of a softer crypto tape. Why it matters: RWAs are moving from narrative to implementation, and Mantle has planted a flag with compliance tooling, stablecoin depth (USD1), and CEX–L2 integration.

The only fight left on the table was over whether they should aim for two or three cuts. The September 16–17 meeting closed with an 11–1 vote for a quarter-point reduction, dropping the federal funds rate to a 4%–4.25% target range, and setting the stage for more easing at the October and December meetings. The official record said: “In considering the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants noted that, with the reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, the Committee was well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.” Another passage read that: “Participants expressed a range of views about the degree to which the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and about the likely future path of policy. Most judged that it likely would be appropriate to ease policy further over the remainder of this year.” Officials argue over cuts and Miran breaks ranks, as expected The September session showed just how split officials were on the path ahead. Out of 19 officials, including 12 voting members, a tight 10–9 majority supported cutting at both of the last two meetings of the year. Projections also pointed to one more cut in 2026 and another in 2027, before stabilizing long-term policy around 3%. The meeting was the first for Governor Steve Miran, sworn in hours before talks began. Miran made himself the lone dissent by pushing for a half-point cut instead of the quarter-point that was approved. His vote was recorded in the post-meeting statement. Later, Miran told reporters he was the lone “dot” on the forecast chart calling for a more aggressive path of easing compared with everyone else on the committee. While Miran wanted deeper reductions, some argued for restraint. The minutes recorded, “Some participants noted that, by several measures, financial conditions suggested that monetary policy may not be particularly restrictive, which they judged as warranting a cautious approach in the consideration of future policy changes.” Labor weakness, tariff debate, and shutdown risks Concerns over jobs were central. Officials said the labor market was weakening while inflation risks had either stayed the same or decreased. They explained: “Participants generally noted that their judgments about this meeting’s appropriate policy action reflected a change in the balance of risks. In particular, most participants observed that it was appropriate to move the target range for the federal funds rate toward a more neutral setting because they judged that downside risks to employment had increased over the intermeeting period and that upside risks to inflation had either diminished or not increased.” President Donald Trump’s tariffs also came up. The consensus was that his levies had raised prices this year but would not fuel lasting inflation. That cleared the way for more easing without fear of long-term price spikes. Survey data from the Fed’s primary dealers backed the committee’s thinking. “Almost all respondents to the Desk survey expected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and around half expected an additional cut at the October meeting,” the minutes said. “The vast majority of survey respondents expected at least two 25 basis point cuts by year-end, with around half expecting three cuts over that time.” For the uninitiated, one basis point equals 0.01%, meaning 25 basis points equals 0.25%. The shutdown in Washington was another challenge. With the Labor Department and Commerce Department closed, officials are not getting new updates on inflation, unemployment, or consumer spending. The minutes warned that if the government is still closed by the October 28–29 meeting, the board will be “flying blind” with no new data to guide decisions. Market expectations are clear despite the chaos. Pricing shows a near certainty of two more cuts this year, according to the CME FedWatchTool.

After ruling over more than 90% of the GPU market used for AI, the company now faces a serious challenger; AMD. On Monday, AMD announced it’s selling billions of dollars’ worth of GPUs to OpenAI, a move that throws it into direct competition with Nvidia in the most valuable tech race happening today. This new deal comes nearly 30 years after Intel relied on AMD to dodge monopoly accusations.Now Nvidia finds itself in a similar spot.AMD, once again, is stepping in as the alternative. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh said it straight: “Right now, Nvidia almost has a monopoly, with AMD having a low-single-digit share in the $250 billion market” for AI data center chips. AMD gets boost after OpenAI move Until now, OpenAI and Nvidia have basically shaped the whole AI era. Nvidia’s GPU dominance drove its market cap to $4.5 trillion. Meanwhile, OpenAI, thanks to ChatGPT and huge data center plans, has hit a $500 billion private valuation. The two are deeply tied; Nvidia is a major investor in OpenAI and recently pledged up to $100 billion toward building OpenAI’s infrastructure. But AMD’s stock exploded 24% on Monday, its biggest single-day gain in 22 years. It jumped 4% Tuesday, then another 11% Wednesday, pushing its market cap to $380 billion. That’s a 43% jump in one week, putting it on pace for its best run since 2016. And this time, the surge isn’t built on hype. It’s backed by a contract that’s expected to deliver “double digit billions” in revenue to AMD, starting in the second half of next year. If AMD stock hits certain price targets, OpenAI could own up to 10% of the company. CEO Lisa Su called the deal a “win-win” and said OpenAI’s commitment shows AMD’s chips are finally fast enough, and priced right, to compete. She added that it’s a “clear signal” AMD’s software and hardware are ready for “the most demanding at-scale deployments.” Nvidia faces political heat as AMD steps up Nvidia’s dominance hasn’t gone unnoticed. Last year, around the end of the Biden administration, the Justice Department reportedly subpoenaed Nvidia, though the company denied it. Senator Elizabeth Warren backed the probe, claiming Nvidia’s rise was “supercharged by anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation.” Nvidia’s response? It said it wins on merit. The OpenAI-AMD deal also helps OpenAI distance itself from any one supplier. CEO Sam Altman posted that AMD chips will be “incremental” to its Nvidia orders, and stressed that more compute is needed across the board. On CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the deal was “unique and surprising,” adding, “I’m surprised that they would give away 10% of the company before they even built it.” Alden Abbott, a former FTC general counsel, said there’s no sign of monopolization or cartel behavior here. “None of these things are, as far as I’m aware, exclusive contracts tying up avenues to other competitors,” he said. AMD, for its part, has always tried to downplay a direct fight with Nvidia. But the company now estimates that the AI chip market could be worth $500 billion by 2028. This OpenAI deal is already expected to bring in tens of billions of dollars, and it might just rewrite the rules of the game.

Each of these tokens has dipped over the past 24 hours and week, giving back some momentum after Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $126,000 . Yet all three are still sitting in oversold zones , setting the stage for a strong rebound in the days ahead. In this article, we break down the technical outlook for each – and at the end, reveal one early-stage, low-cap gem currently in presale that could explode once it hits exchanges. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Incoming ETFs and Dip Provide Conditions for Massive Rebound XRP has fallen again today, with its drop to $2.87 making for a 3% fall in 24 hours and a 2% drop in a week. Despite these losses, XRP’s fundamental position is still bullish, with the coin looking forward to the launch of numerous XRP ETFs in the next few weeks. These will drive institutional demand to XRP, boosting its price in the way ETFs have boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum. On top of this, Ripple’s growth in recent months – via acquisitions , partnerships and expansions – has also boosted the case for XRP, which will benefit from the growth in Ripple’s cross-border payments business. And if we look at its chart, we see that it’s still in the position of waiting for a breakout. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) are both in middling positions, having been negative for most of the period since late July. As such, a rally is well overdue, and once the first XRP ETFs begin to launch, the coin’s price could rise to $3.50 very quickly. It could then go on to finish the year above $5 , as part of a longer term climb towards $10 . Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Grayscale ETF Could Help Altcoin Reach New Highs Cardano has fallen by 4% in the past 24 hours, while its current price of $0.8248 represents a 2% loss in the last 30 days. These may be disappointing percentages, but Cardano is another major token that has been sitting in an oversold position for too long. And while it doesn’t boast as many upcoming ETFs as XRP or Solana, for example, the Grayscale multi-crypto ETF will include the altcoin, something which should help it rise over the coming weeks. Its chart today also features indicators that have been subdued for a couple of months, again implying that a rally should be arriving sooner or later. Source: TradingView ADA has also been trading with a pennant, which is now converging to a point where the altcoin may make a big move, potentially upwards. And longer term, Cardano’s status as a major layer-one network should help the ADA price to continue rising. It could reach $1 in the next few weeks, before r eaching $4+ by December . Crypto Price Prediction: Pepe ($PEPE) – Overselling and Whale Accumulation Point to Incoming Rebound Pepe is one of the biggest losers today among top-100 tokens, having dropped by 6%. And at $0.000009353, it also happens to be down by 8% in a month and by 3% in the past year. Given that most major coins are up in the last 12 months, this latter percentage may be disconcerting, inviting fears that Pepe is starting to fall out of ‘fashion’ as a meme coin. Its chart supports this misgiving to some extent, seeing as how it has struggled to break out of a descending channel since the middle of May. On the other hand, its oversold RSI and MACD indicators could be taken as a sign that a rebound is coming. Source: TradingView And while its trading volume is a modest $693 million today, we have seen a few whales accumulating the token in recent weeks (e.g. here and here ). This raises hope that PEPE will rally strongly again once the market enters a bull rally, which it could do as and when the first wave of altcoin ETFs begin launching. In such a context, the PEPE price could reach $0.00002 by November, while ending the year close to $0.00005. PEPENODE Could Be the Big Meme Coin of 2026: Presale Raises $1.7 Million The crypto price prediction for the coins above look very bullish right now, with the market poised for an end-of-year rally. But major tokens won’t be the only cryptos to benefit from such a rally, with certain newer tokens – including presale coins – likely to outperform the market. One promising new token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a mine-to-earn cryptocurrency that recently opened its presale. Building a Server Room AND Virtual Mining?! Yes Please. Let the $PEPENODE flow https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/jN00FsQ3UQ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 7, 2025 It has now raised just over $1.7 million in this sale, indicating how popular it’s already becoming, and how popular it could become once it launches. What’s interesting about PEPENODE is its mine-to-earn feature, which invites users to build their own virtual mining rigs. Instead of requiring you to buy and own expensing equipment, the project enables you to buy virtual nodes simply by spending PEPENODE. The more nodes you own, the greater your mining rewards will be, with PEPENODE paying out such rewards in the form of other meme tokens, including Pepe and Fartcoin. On top of this, holders of PEPENODE will be able to stake the token, which currently offers APY in the region of 740%. This all makes the coin potentially very profitable, with investors able to join its sale by going to the official PEPENODE website . It’s currently selling at $0.0010918, although this price will rise again tomorrow.

Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $421 million in inflows on October 7, extending a seven-day institutional buying streak that tightened circulating supply and helped ETH consolidate near $4,450, supporting a potential recovery toward the $4,900–$5,000 range. Spot ETFs added $421M on Oct 7, marking seven straight days of inflows. Exchange reserves fell to 17.4 million ETH, the lowest since 2022, highlighting reduced available supply.

Ethereum ETF inflows surge $421M on Oct 7, tightening supply and supporting price consolidation—read expert analysis and trade signals now. What is driving Ethereum’s recent strength? Spot Ethereum ETF inflows are the primary driver of recent strength, supplying steady institutional demand that absorbs circulating ETH and lifts accumulation by public entities. Exchange reserves have dropped sharply, reinforcing a tighter supply backdrop while technical setups show balanced momentum near $4,450. How large were the ETF inflows and what do they mean for supply? On October 7, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $421 million in net inflows, continuing a seven-day streak. Combined ETF holdings exceeded $30 billion, with roughly $803 million added in the prior month. These flows coincide with exchange reserves declining to 17.4 million ETH from 28.8 million three years ago, indicating institutional and corporate accumulation reduced liquid supply. Frequently Asked Questions How does ETF accumulation affect Ethereum price dynamics? ETF accumulation can reduce circulating supply and increase demand stability, particularly when combined with on-chain burning mechanisms. With ETFs holding a growing share of available ETH, short-term liquidity tightens, which can support higher price floors during market stress. What on-chain metrics best show reduced supply pressure? Exchange reserves and public company holdings are key metrics. Reserves at 17.4 million ETH are at three-year lows, while public companies hold about 3.6 million ETH. EIP-1559 burns also remove ETH from circulation, contributing to a gradual deflationary trend.

Ethereum traded around $4,443 at the time of reporting, down 5.3% over 24 hours but up 7% for the week and 3.4% for the month. The price sits roughly 10% below an August peak near $4,946. Weekly intraday ranges (about $4,133–$4,748) indicate consolidation rather than a decisive trend change. Trading volume increased 27% to $51.9 billion, suggesting sustained market participation. Futures volume rose 54% to $124.2 billion while open interest fell 5.5% to $60.3 billion (Coinglass data), implying leveraged positions were reduced ahead of potential renewed stability. Technical indicators: When could Ethereum test prior highs? Ethereum is holding short-term support near $4,313 with immediate resistance around $4,731 (upper Bollinger Band). The Relative Strength Index sits near 53, signaling balanced momentum. If buyers push above $4,700 and sustain volume, a retest of $4,900–$5,000 becomes likely. Conversely, a break below $4,300 may expose downside toward $3,900. Key Takeaways ETF inflows matter : $421M on Oct 7 extended a 7-day buying streak, tightening supply. Supply tightened : Exchange reserves dropped to 17.4M ETH, lowest since 2022. Technical balance : Momentum is neutral; a move above $4,700 could trigger a push toward $5,000. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent resilience is anchored in robust institutional demand from spot ETFs and declining exchange reserves, reinforcing a tighter supply outlook. Technical indicators show consolidation with upside potential if inflows and buying pressure continue.

According to Bloomberg , the new role, referred to as a “digital markets champion,” will be tasked with coordinating private sector initiatives around tokenization of wholesale financial instruments. The official will focus on aligning technical development with regulatory priorities across the financial system. UK to Appoint Digital Markets Champion Rigby’s comments were delivered during the Digital Assets Week conference in London. She also announced the formation of a new group, the Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce, which will oversee the shift away from paper-based shareholding. The taskforce will focus on replacing physical share certificates and improving the efficiency of market infrastructure. The tokenization plan is part of the government’s Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy, first outlined in July. That strategy includes the development of blockchain-based sovereign debt instruments, referred to as digital gilts under the “DIGIT” framework. Rigby confirmed that the UK has opened a procurement process to select technology providers for digital gilt issuance. These digital instruments will function as official representations of UK sovereign debt on distributed ledger systems. Tokenization Competition Intensifies Countries including France, Singapore, and the United States are also exploring tokenization frameworks for public and private sector securities. The UK’s latest move is positioned within that wider trend, with emphasis on compatibility between emerging platforms and existing legal structures. While regulatory and institutional engagement remains focused on wholesale markets, there is growing discussion around whether similar frameworks might eventually extend to retail-facing financial services. Questions of access, interoperability, and settlement speed will likely surface as tokenization pilots evolve into operational systems. Some industry observers see the UK’s efforts as an early test of how blockchain infrastructure could reshape post-trade workflows. If successful, these initiatives may influence how custodians, clearinghouses, and regulators approach infrastructure upgrades across traditional and decentralized markets.

Naver is the country’s biggest and most prominent internet firm, South Korea’s answer to Google. Upbit, meanwhile, has cornered some 72% of the domestic crypto market . Dunamu Naver Merger: 5 Legal Obstacles A Dunamu-Naver merger could create a crypto-tech behemoth on a scale previously unseen in the East Asian market. However, the South Korean newspaper Hanguk Kyungjae identified several issues that stand in the way of the alliance, despite the merger talk leaving the tech and crypto sectors “abuzz.” It called these legal hurdles “significant,” and added that “policy uncertainties” could also undermine the bid. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit in the past week. (Source: CoinGecko) Hurdle 1: Tradfi Regulations In late 2017, South Korean regulators imposed a rule effectively barring traditional financial companies from doing crypto-related business. Although they never enshrined this in national law, financial industry guidelines still exclude the possibility of banks and other lenders providing crypto-related services. Naver wants to merge its Naver Financial unit with Dunamu. The former is classified as an electronic financial service provider under the terms of the Electronic Financial Transactions Act. Regulators would, in theory, need to modify their guidelines for the merger to go ahead as currently proposed. The Dunamu Chairman Song Chi-hyung speaking at Seoul National University in 2021. (Source: Seoul National University/Seoul Kyungjae/YouTube/Screenshot) Hurdle 2: Stablecoin Legislation Uncertainty Domestic market observers think that one of the key goals of a Naver-Dunamu merger centers on the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins and the expansion of the payment ecosystem. If Naver’s existing Naver Pay platform could make use of a KRW-pegged coin, the firm could expand its presence in the payments market. However, politicians and regulators remain divided on several key stablecoin-related matters , despite President Lee Jae-myung’s intention to legalize KRW-pegged tokens. The central Bank of Korea (BOK) has taken a cautious stance, insisting that only commercial banks or consortia where banks are majority stakeholders should be allowed to issue stablecoins. But some politicians want to allow fintech firms and other IT players to issue their own tokens. Should the BOK get its way, this could prove a setback. The newspaper wrote: “A bank-centric structure would likely force the Naver-Dunamu alliance to participate solely as a technological and operational partner in a bank-led consortium, rather than directly as an issuer.” Hurdle 3: A Conflict of Interests? If the Naver-Dunamu alliance issues a KRW-pegged stablecoin, the new firm could struggle to list this token on Upbit. The terms of the Virtual Assets Act explicitly prohibit exchanges from listing or trading coins that they or their affiliates have issued. If this proves to be a major problem, the new company could explore workarounds, such as listing on other domestic and international exchanges. But such a step would “significantly diminish” the impact of the merger, the newspaper added. Dunamu's long-held ambitions for a Nasdaq listing are regaining momentum, as ongoing merger talks with Naver Financial raise the possibility of a more competitive corporate valuation, analysts said Wednesday. https://t.co/pDJEMucxyx — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) October 2, 2025 Hurdle 4: Stock Market Setbacks? A merger could see Naver restructure Naver Financial and look to list it on the NASDAQ exchange alongside Dunamu. The newspaper explained that both companies have “actively incorporated overseas listings and split listing scenarios into their mid- to long-term strategies.” But recent revisions to the Commercial Act and the Capital Markets Act have bolstered minority shareholder protection. The amended acts stipulate that in corporate restructuring processes, including mergers, spin-offs, and IPOs, minority shareholders must receive “fair value” offers for their holdings. Experts believe that class action or shareholder derivative suits could follow if existing minority shareholders are not offered a suitably advantageous financial package. At Token2049 Singapore, one question kept coming up from foreign attendees. “So, Naver acquired Upbit. Is that like Binance buying CoinMarketCap?” At first glance, it might look similar, a big platform buying a crypto company. But… pic.twitter.com/6MPlkw2Atf — Professor Jo (@0xProfessorJo) October 5, 2025 Hurdle 5: Governance structure questions Speculation is rife that Naver’s Global Investment Officer and Chairman Lee Hae-jin has earmarked Dunamu’s Chairman Song Chi-hyung as his successor. This has led to further speculation that Song could eventually become Naver’s largest single shareholder. Song currently holds over a quarter of Dunamu’s shares. The newspaper explained: “Dunamu, which generates approximately 1 trillion won [$702.2 million] per year in net profits, is unlikely to agree to a merger deal without a ‘carrot’ like securing management right or becoming the largest individual shareholder.” However, market regulations would stipulate that various compliance-related matters must first be satisfied. This could prove far from straightforward. The transfer of management rights to Chi or installing him as the largest individual shareholder is “unlikely to be achieved through a simple stock transaction,” the newspaper concluded. Only time will tell if Naver and Dunamu have what it takes to overcome these obstacles and pull off what would undoubtedly become East Asia’s biggest IT-sector merger in recent years.

Analysts now discuss where the next moves could come from with XRP , Avalanche , and even MAGACOIN FINANCE drawing new attention from investors looking for hedge and diversification options in this fast-changing market. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can BTC Stay Above $120K? Bitcoin briefly touched a record high of $126,000 earlier this week before easing to $122,784 , down about 1.7% . The retrace followed a wave of profit-taking and a stronger U.S. dollar that weighed on so-called “debasement trades.” Despite this, Bitcoin still gained 6% over the past week and remains in a clear uptrend. Analysts credit inflows into Bitcoin ETFs , which hit $1.2 billion in a single day . This shows that both retail and institutional investors continue to see BTC as a store of value in times of fiscal uncertainty. The Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut also boosted sentiment, pushing the Fear and Greed Index from 34 to 62 . As long as the U.S. government shutdown keeps pressure on the dollar, BTC may continue to act as a safe harbor , holding above the $120,000 zone . If inflows continue and risk appetite returns, analysts see a short-term path toward $130,000 . Traders are now watching today’s Fed meeting minutes for cues on policy direction. XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Sees Path to $5 Analyst Professor Astrones described XRP’s setup as “pumpy,” expecting a move toward $5 . The token trades near $2.97 , holding above the key zone between $2.60 and $2.80 . The price has stayed steady there for weeks, suggesting consistent buying activity. Astrones highlights a tightening triangle pattern on XRP’s chart that could soon break upward. A push past $3.66 may trigger the next leg to $4.50 or even $5 , which would put XRP’s value near half of Ethereum’s market cap . Other analysts, including CryptoWZRD and EGRAG , agree that the structure supports further upside. As long as XRP remains above its long-term rising line near $2.50–$3.00 , the trend stays positive. Sentiment in the XRP community has turned more confident as traders prepare for what they call a “quiet build-up before the next explosion”. If momentum continues, XRP could reclaim its all-time highs soon. Avalanche Price Prediction: Developer Growth Fuels Confidence Avalanche (AVAX) has been trading near $30 , consolidating after a sharp climb. Analysts say this zone could act as a springboard for another move higher. Recent data shows over 44 million contracts deployed on Avalanche — triple the figure from a year ago. This surge reflects developer expansion and growing liquidity across its ecosystem. Analysts say this kind of network growth usually draws more applications and usage, which often lifts the price. Some chart watchers see a bullish flag formation pointing toward a $108 target , while others project shorter-term moves to $50–$60 if activity continues to rise. Daily volumes are also nearing the $1 trillion mark, showing strong market participation. Analyst Daniel Ramsey believes the key now is maintaining stability above $30, which could set up Avalanche for a sustained climb. The next few weeks may determine if AVAX can convert that setup into a breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Underrated Altcoin for Diversification Amid rising prices across Bitcoin, XRP, and Avalanche, some investors are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE — a community-led altcoin currently trading under $0.0006 . Its scarcity and fair supply model are catching the eye of buyers who missed earlier crypto runs. Many view MAGACOIN as a strategic hedge and a safe haven when larger tokens face corrections. The attraction lies in its simple value structure, transparent approach, and the opportunity to enter early before wider listings. Imagine a move from $0.0006 to even $0.1 — that narrative alone is sparking curiosity among investors seeking the next smart entry point in 2025. Transparency First: MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads With Certified Audit Results MAGACOIN FINANCE’s completed HashEx audit and upcoming CertiK verification highlight its focus on transparency and security. What Traders Should Do Next Analysts agree this market favors diversification and timing . Traders watching Bitcoin’s $120K level and XRP’s $3 range can also explore smaller altcoins showing transparency and early adoption — like MAGACOIN FINANCE .

52867108,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85775,1759966241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Poised For $11 Price Rally,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-poised-for-11-price-rally/,"Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, has provided a new set of XRP price targets derived from Fibonacci extension levels, offering insights into potential future movements of the asset as it consolidates near the $3 region. Despite the recent market recovery led by Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB, XRP has remained under pressure. After peaking at $3.66 in July 2025, the token has struggled to maintain momentum, dropping to $2.88 amid renewed bearish sentiment. The downturn has coincided with growing fear among retail investors, reflected in a six-month high in FUD metrics . XRP’s Current Technical Position During an interview on the Thinking Crypto podcast hosted by Tony Edward, Franzen characterized XRP’s recent consolidation as a coiling phase, a period of tight price movement that often precedes a significant breakout. He reviewed XRP’s performance from December 2024 to July 2025, noting a pattern of consecutive higher highs. The asset first climbed to $2.9 in December 2024, later advancing to $3.4 in January 2025, and eventually touching $3.66 by July. These incremental gains, he said, reflect a constructive longer-term structure despite short-term declines. However, since July, XRP’s movement has tightened, producing a sequence of lower highs. Franzen believes this development suggests a temporary cooling phase rather than the beginning of a broader downtrend. He emphasized that the market could be consolidating before another attempt at a sustained upward move. Projected XRP Price Levels Franzen’s Fibonacci analysis identifies several potential price targets if XRP resumes its uptrend. Based on the 161.8% Fibonacci extension, he expects XRP could advance toward $4.40, while the 261.8% extension points to $6. Applying the same Fibonacci method to the broader consolidation range between first-quarter highs and lows, he derived even more ambitious targets of $5.40 and $11.55. Franzen stressed that these projections remain valid only if XRP holds above $2.68, which he identified as a key support level. A decisive drop below this zone, he added, would invalidate the bullish setup and could signal the need for traders to reassess their exposure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Diverging Analyst Opinions Other analysts have offered mixed short-term perspectives on XRP’s movement. Market commentator DustyBC observed that XRP recently experienced a wave of selling pressure following brief gains. He attributed the correction partly to renewed strength in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), explaining that such pullbacks are typical after extended rallies. According to DustyBC , XRP’s price is now positioned within a support range between $2.8 and $2.9, an area he had previously identified. He added that the ongoing wave structure remains incomplete until XRP surpasses the upper boundary of its recent consolidation. Similarly, analyst Lark Davis highlighted XRP’s difficulty in breaking above its descending resistance line. Davis noted that a confirmed breakout beyond the $3 level could trigger a push toward $4. Conversely, failure to do so might lead the token to retest the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at around $2.94 for potential support. Meanwhile, trader Matt Hughes expressed optimism about XRP’s resilience at current levels. He remarked that the asset’s ability to remain stable despite market volatility suggests underlying strength. Hughes predicted that once XRP successfully clears the $3.21 resistance area, a stronger breakout could follow. Franzen’s Fibonacci-based outlook, combined with the varied short-term assessments from other analysts, reflects an uncertain but closely watched phase for XRP. While the broader sentiment remains cautious, the token’s historical tendency to recover strongly after consolidation has kept long-term expectations alive among bullish traders.

Just days after launching its mainnet, Plasma has already climbed to the 5th largest DeFi chain , with $6.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) . At the same time, stablecoin reserves have risen to $5.3 billion , showing sustained capital inflows and rising confidence in the ecosystem. This may be the fastest rise to the top the DeFi space has ever seen, highlighting just how much demand there is for Plasma’s purpose-built lending platform. Within AAVE , Plasma has already attracted $6.7 billion in deposits , with $2.15 billion actively borrowed by users. Its lending vault is offering a highly attractive 9.92% APY , drawing in both retail and institutional capital. Meanwhile, fresh data from Nansen shows that transaction volume on Plasma has surged by 5,000% in just the past 30 days, signaling explosive growth in user activity. Plasma Price Prediction: Descending Triangle Breakout Sets the Stage for Big Gains Just two days ago, XPL broke out of a descending triangle pattern on the hourly chart, signaling a potential short-term trend reversal. The price briefly pulled back after touching the 200-period EMA , but is now retesting its former trendline resistance from above – a bullish setup that could lead to a fresh breakout. If XPL bounces off this key level, a move toward $1 per token looks likely, offering a 15% short-term upside from current levels. Looking further ahead, Plasma’s rapidly growing on-chain metrics point to a potential move back to $1.70 or higher , representing a possible 95% gain based on today’s price. And while large-cap tokens like XPL show strength, some of the best-performing opportunities this cycle may come from top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) .

The semiconductor companies affected by the October 7 report include ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, KLA Corp, and Lam Research. According to the report, these companies walked away with significant profits for selling to Chinese state-owned and military-linked firms, raising the potential for new U.S. export restrictions to be rolled out. No laws were directly broken. However, the prospect of tighter controls has triggered market reactions, causing shares to fall as much as 7.1% in Amsterdam on Wednesday morning in what is being called the biggest intraday drop since July. It has since pared some of the losses and is up 14% over the last year. Shares in the other semiconductor equipment companies are also trading lower. Chip makers implicated in US committee report ASML is the world’s only producer of cutting-edge lithography machines required to produce high-end chips used in electric vehicles and military gear. Unfortunately, the company has struggled to sell its most advanced machines to China because of US-led export restrictions. Last year, the Dutch government also restricted sales of ASML’s second-most advanced machines, immersion deep ultraviolet lithography systems, to China after getting pressured by the Biden administration. Despite the restrictions, China has emerged as ASML’s second-largest market after Taiwan, accounting for 27% of its net system sales in the second quarter, primarily through less advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) machines. Applied Materials is projected to lose $710 million in revenue next year due to the new U.S. export rules expanding restrictions on Chinese clients, as China accounts for over a third of its revenue. The committee wants President Donald Trump’s administration to “dramatically expand country-wide bans and licensing requirements” on tool exports to China. To be clear, the committee has no power to impose those restrictions on its own, and the US Commerce Department is not mandated to follow its recommendations. However, the call to action has raised concerns that further export bans are in the pipeline. The semiconductor industry is caught between warring factions The battle over computer chips by the current world powers is intensifying and the semiconductor industry has been a major target. As tensions between China and the US ramp up, the industry continues to face greater restrictions and the fact that there is a new president in the White House has not changed that. In fact, last month, the US scrapped Biden-era authorizations that allowed ASML customers Samsung Electronics Co., SK Hynix Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to transport supplies to Chinese factories without needing Washington’s permission each time. This is because many lawmakers in the US believe that China’s advance in manufacturing chips “poses threats” to US national security. To that end the Trump administration has even taken a stake in struggling American chipmaker Intel Corp. in the hopes of supporting a national champion that can compete with Asia’s giant manufacturers on an equal footing. In the meantime, China has been playing catch up where cutting-edge chip technology is concerned, with the government pushing local tech companies to develop advanced AI processors that can compete with those produced by US giant Nvidia Corp. Huawei is now building a shadow manufacturing network of semiconductor-fabrication facilities across the country. In September, it publicly laid out a three-year roadmap for chip development and unveiled new technology, from memory chips to AI accelerators, designed to compete with the most powerful Nvidia products. Also, despite the chip restrictions, Chinese companies have still been able to make strides in AI. In January, Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek released an AI model that held its ground against the best offerings from US rivals OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. while boasting it was developed at a fraction of the cost. The breakthrough re-energized the Chinese tech community and was touted by national media as a monumental achievement in the face of US containment efforts.

For now, the cryptocurrency has failed to break out above the upper band with strength, despite reaching an all-time high of $126,000 earlier this week. According to past local consolidation ranges, “it could take as long as a hundred days to get a valid breakout (or breakdown, if BTC dumps instead),” he said. Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool used to measure market volatility and identify potential overbought or oversold conditions in assets. Potential to Go Parabolic The analyst added that expanding from a squeeze setup like this can lead to “head fakes,” which we might have seen with the latest move. “We also might see another head fake down from here before eventually taking off higher,” he said before adding: “This has the potential to send Bitcoin parabolic, or put an end to the three-year mature bull rally.” Chief strategist at Satsuma Technology, Mark Moss, said that Bitcoin breaking out to new peaks still doesn’t look anywhere near cycle peaks, “while external fundamentals are looking hot.” “Unlike 2021, the Fed is not tightening; they are loosening, ETFs and BTC [treasury companies] are creating the greatest demand shock, and the world has woken up to the ‘debasement trade’.” Uptober Still On Track Despite today’s 2.5% pullback to the $121,000 level, Bitcoin’s ‘Uptober’ is still on track with the asset up 7% so far this month. BTC has gained in 10 of the past 12 Octobers and 8 of the past 12 fourth quarters, according to Coinglass. Meanwhile, analyst ‘Sykodelic’ is one of many who claim that the four-year cycle is no more. “The clear fact here is that Bitcoin has a fairly large area in which to expand before it would recent the end of its price cycle,” he said on Wednesday. “I would not be surprised if Bitcoin will NOT drop below $100k again, as we see $100k resistance turn into $100k support,” said Stock-to-Flow model creator ‘Plan B’. The September close was the fifth month in a row in six figures, and the same happened with $10, $100, $1,000, and $10,000, he added.

Saad Ahmed, Gemini’s head of Asia Pacific, said that crypto adoption in Australia is “quite significant, somewhere in the range of 23 to 25%,” leaving the exchange with “headroom for growth.” To grant access to local payment rails, the exchange announced on Thursday that it has established a local corporation registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the nation’s financial intelligence agency. Gemini, which offers trading on a limited number of assets and has few and costly payment methods, has been accessible to Australians since August 2019 as part of its global operation. Gemini establishes local entity to strengthen presence in Australia The creation of a local entity marks a significant step in Gemini’s regional expansion. Ahmed stated that by using Gemini Intergalactic Australia as its registered local organization, it no longer has to tread carefully on the legal tightrope when it comes to marketing, integrating local payment rails, and providing financial services to Australians. “We’re changing that because we think Australia is a market that we want to be in, and it’s a market that we want to grow, so we’re going to build a local team here,” he said. The company will be based out of Sydney and has appointed James Logan, who previously led the local entities of rival exchanges Luno and Bitget, to head its Australian operation. According to Ahmed, the exchange is working on obtaining an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) to offer services such as cryptocurrency staking and credit card services. “We’re not going to have all of the products that we offer in the US, for example, the credit card and staking, out of the gate, but we’re working on it,” he said. Gemini adopts a wait-and-see approach to Australia’s crypto regulations While Gemini’s founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, are known for their active engagement in US policy, Saad Ahmed indicated that the company’s Australian arm will adopt a more reserved stance. Rather than lobbying, Gemini plans to observe the government’s consultation on new crypto regulations. Last month, the Albanese government released draft legislation aimed at strengthening oversight of crypto exchanges and requiring companies to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL). The proposals have been met with cautious optimism by the local industry. Ahmed noted that there will be some back-and-forth between the industry and the government for a while. He continued to say Gemini will likely take the position of just observing and seeing how things unfold over the next few months. “There’s limited upside for us to respond to the laws that have come out,” he said. “There is an existing ecosystem here, we’re somebody new that’s coming in, and we just want to make sure that we’re building and focused on our customers.” Ahmed added that they believed they would be well-prepared for whatever regulations come into effect and would be able to comply with them. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently reached a preliminary settlement with Gemini regarding all allegations that the cryptocurrency platform failed to register a cryptocurrency asset lending program before offering it to retail investors. According to reports, the settlement resolves the agency’s lawsuit over the Gemini Earn program. According to a letter filed in a Manhattan federal court, lawyers representing both parties indicated that the settlement would “completely resolve” the lawsuit. However, it was still subject to approval by the SEC. Reports indicate that the lawyers requested that the US District Judge Edgardo Ramos grant them up to December 15 to submit their final paperwork and put all deadlines on hold.

After weeks of relentless Bitcoin strength, smart investors are quietly moving capital into altcoins, anticipating the next major phase of the 2025 bull market. The strategy follows a familiar pattern: Bitcoin ignites the rally, but it’s Ethereum, BNB, and select emerging tokens that often deliver the cycle’s largest percentage gains. Data from CryptoQuant shows that while Bitcoin inflows into spot ETFs remain strong, on-chain transaction volume has started to plateau, a classic early signal of market rotation. Historically, when BTC dominance stabilizes above 52%, funds begin flowing downstream toward high-conviction altcoins. This week, both Ethereum and BNB are showing signs of renewed strength, while analysts are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE the “hidden gem” of the current rotation, a project marrying structure with speculation, and timing the cycle perfectly. The Rotation Playbook: How Smart Money Moves Every major bull market follows a predictable rhythm. Bitcoin rallies first, capturing institutional capital and restoring broad confidence. Then, liquidity expands into Ethereum, the foundational Layer 1 ecosystem for decentralized finance. Finally, retail traders – drawn by higher upside – rotate into emerging altcoins and presales with exponential potential. We’re now entering that second phase. Ethereum’s network activity has risen 12% this week, with new addresses and staking volume increasing as investors anticipate renewed momentum in DeFi and NFT markets. Meanwhile, BNB continues to reclaim relevance after Binance’s renewed global compliance initiatives, positioning itself once again as a bridge between retail adoption and institutional utility. This shifting capital landscape is setting the stage for high-upside plays. Traders know that after Bitcoin’s dominance peaks, the biggest returns often emerge from projects still under the radar, like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum and BNB Regain the Spotlight Ethereum remains the undisputed backbone of blockchain development. With Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and Base now surpassing $20 billion in total value locked , ETH’s utility narrative is gaining renewed traction. Developers are also preparing for the upcoming “Pectra” upgrade , which aims to streamline wallet interactions and smart contract usability – both crucial for onboarding mainstream users. At the same time, BNB has quietly evolved from an exchange token into a full-fledged ecosystem. Binance Smart Chain continues to rank among the most active networks by daily transactions, attracting developers seeking affordable alternatives to Ethereum. Institutional desks are now beginning to re-enter BNB positions, noting its consistent deflationary burns and liquidity strength. But even as these large-cap assets dominate headlines, smaller projects are stealing speculative momentum. The search for the next 20×–50× return has never been stronger – and analysts agree one emerging contender stands out. With Bitcoin profits peaking and institutional inflows slowing, smart investors are rotating into altcoins offering sharper risk-reward setups. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the prime target of that rotation, a presale project now modeled for 900%–1,400% ROI based on early-stage metrics and exchange momentum. The PATRIOT50X bonus code remains one of the market’s most discussed early-access advantages, granting users expanded allocations before the next pricing tier. Analysts compare MAGACOIN FINANCE’s setup to early SHIB and DOGE phases, but with stronger fundamentals and verified transparency. Its scarcity mechanics ensure each new stage grows costlier, creating built-in FOMO dynamics. As capital flows from Bitcoin into faster-moving assets, this hidden gem is being described as the retail-driven “second wave”, the phase where disciplined risk-takers turn prior cycle profits into next-cycle fortunes. Why Rotation Favors Early Movers The logic behind rotation investing is simple: capital seeks efficiency. Once Bitcoin’s returns flatten, funds move to assets with higher elasticity and growth potential. During the 2021 cycle, Ethereum gained 600% after Bitcoin’s peak, while emerging tokens like Solana, Avalanche, and SHIB saw returns exceeding 30×. This time, the environment is even more favorable. Institutional infrastructure – from ETFs to custodial solutions, has created a safety net for capital to flow freely between assets. As traders diversify exposure, the projects offering a mix of security, scarcity, and community momentum are capturing the largest inflows. In that context, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another speculative play – it’s a rotation magnet. It offers the volatility investors crave, but underpinned by the audit integrity that institutional allocators now demand. Key Metrics to Watch Bitcoin Dominance : If BTC.D begins to decline from current levels (~58%), it confirms altcoin rotation is underway. Ethereum Network Fees : Rising gas usage typically signals a healthy rebound in decentralized activity. BNB Smart Chain TVL : Sustained growth above $5 billion could trigger renewed investor confidence. MAGACOIN FINANCE Listing Announcements : Exchange partnerships or presale caps reached will likely act as catalysts for parabolic moves. According to historical data, early rotation phases often last two to three months, the period when 10×–50× returns materialize before retail euphoria sets in. The Bigger Picture: Positioning for 2025 Analysts from CoinShares and K33 Research predict that the 2025 bull market could surpass 2021’s total capitalization , fueled by ETF access, macro liquidity expansion, and AI-related blockchain integration. The smart money narrative is shifting from passive accumulation to active rotation. For investors, this means one thing: diversification within conviction. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the base. BNB offers structural exposure to exchange infrastructure. But it’s projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that give portfolios their asymmetric edge, the kind capable of multiplying capital at scale. The message is simple: the rotation has started. The early movers are already positioning. Those who follow the flow, and identify the next hidden gem, will define the winners of 2025.

52868077,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=835191,1759968009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52868077.jpeg,From Greed To Fear: Expert Says 2026 Bitcoin Bubble Will Dwarf 2017,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/from-greed-to-fear-2026-bitcoin-bubble/,"A prominent macro-crypto commentator argues that digital assets are transitioning from a greed-driven cycle to a “fear bubble,” with Bitcoin poised for a more powerful and more parabolic phase in 2026 than the euphoric surge of 2017. In a post on X from October 8, the analyst known as plur_daddy (@plur_daddy) contends that two narratives—monetary debasement and artificial intelligence—are now the dominant behavioral drivers, and that they operate less on promise than on anxiety. 2017 Vibes: Trump And AI Could Ignite Next Bitcoin Rally “We are in a bubble, and the most parabolic leg is approaching. The true fireworks will be next year but this Q4 we shall get a taste,” he wrote, adding that the stories animating this cycle are “fueled by twin narratives: debasement and AI. What is especially potent about these stories is the way they operate on fear, not hope. You NEED to buy gold/BTC to avoid getting your net worth debased away, and you NEED to have AI exposure to offset your future loss of labor market value.” While the themes are familiar to market professionals, he argues they have not yet been fully internalized by the broader public or by “bureaucratic real money funds such as pensions and endowments,” which he characterizes as slow to reposition for debasement risk. The result, he suggests, is under-owned exposure that can be forced higher once allocation committees catch up. “There is also a lot of investor capital that still hasn’t reflected these views yet,” he wrote, laying the groundwork for what he believes will be a structurally higher demand base for both Bitcoin and gold as the cycle matures. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Not Crash: Jeff Park Rejects Paul Tudor Jones’ 1999 Comparison A central pillar of his thesis is a policy pivot he expects under the current administration, which he describes as “shifting in a pro-cyclical manner, leaning hard into the bubble, and ready to step on the gas ahead of the midterms.” He outlines four channels. First, “Trump Fed Hijacking,” shorthand for rate cuts followed by yield curve control to cushion the bond market and stimulate housing—timed “most likely… not… until May of next year,” which he frames as the ignition point for the final, steep ascent. Second, a Treasury issuance tilt to bills to pull down long-end yields and free up risk appetite. Third, enabling the GSE balance sheets to expand into mortgage bonds, compressing mortgage spreads and transmitting stimulus to housing via purchases and refinancing. Fourth, stimulus checks delivered through budget reconciliation—politically contested, he concedes, but with “decent odds” of prevailing given “ironclad” party control. Each mechanism, as he describes it, reduces financial frictions at the same time that fear-based narratives pull new capital into hard assets and AI-adjacent equities. The macro mix, in his view, is complicated but ultimately supportive. “The economy is not robust, but it is chugging along, floated by AI capex… a two speed economy, with real world businesses and the average consumer not doing great, but the high end and asset owners are soaring.” Moments later he sharpened the framing: “the two speed economy makes it goldilocks as the genuine weakness in parts of the economy creates a justification for continued fiscal/monetary stimulus while continuing to benefit asset owners. Be the asset owner, the beneficiary of it all.” This is the crux of the “fear bubble” argument: soft spots provide the political cover for policy support, while debasement concerns and job-market anxieties around AI keep households and institutions defensively overweight exposure to scarce assets and growth narratives. Why Q1 2026 Could See A Bitcoin Rally Pause For Bitcoin specifically, he lays out a path that interleaves seasonal strength, cycle reflexivity, and a final acceleration. “My base case is a strong Q4 for BTC, then a sharp downturn as the 4 year cycle debate must be played out in the markets, and finally a rebound that leaves doubters in the dust.” He later endorsed the possibility of “truly manic vertical days at the very end. Similar in vibes to early Dec 2017 in BTC,” invoking the last cycle’s most frenetic stage but recasting the psychology from greed to fear-driven defensiveness. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s On-Chain Roadmap Shows $111,000 – $143,000 As The Range To Watch The thread triggered broader speculation about end-cycle dynamics. Responding to a scenario from another user—“some kind of point in 2026 or 2027 where everyone collectively decides that the USD is going to 0 very quickly and impulsively buys whatever they can to get rid of it… Everything pumps +30% for 3 days straight… And then that is the top”—plur_daddy didn’t endorse the currency-collapse framing but did agree on the “truly manic vertical days at the very end.” Despite the bullish architecture, the analyst does not claim the underlying economy is healthy or that the path will be smooth. He argues instead that policy engineering—whether via issuance tactics, mortgage-market plumbing, or outright transfers—can keep liquidity channels open long enough to accelerate asset prices into a blow-off. “This is an environment where you want to stay long over the next 12 months, but you should be thoughtful in shifting portfolio composition between gold, BTC, and stocks,” he wrote, describing a rotation that acknowledges both macro dispersion and the possibility of sharp drawdowns en route to a higher peak. The bottom line of his thesis is unambiguous: the next stage of this cycle is fear-led, policy-fueled, and likely to exceed 2017’s magnitude. The difference, he argues, is psychological and structural. Where 2017 fed on retail euphoria, 2025–26 is animated by the defensive compulsion to preserve purchasing power and job relevance—“fear… is a much more potent driver of behavior than hope or even greed.” If his timeline holds, a taste in Q4, a shakeout on cycle debates, and a policy-catalyzed vertical in 2026 could define Bitcoin’s next act. At press time, BTC traded at $122,512.

Despite recent underperformance compared to other leading digital assets, Sanh has reiterated his strong belief in the token’s long-term potential, maintaining that XRP will eventually deliver significant gains. XRP’s Recent Performance and Market Position Over the past week, the crypto market has undergone a mild correction following a period of recovery. XRP, which initially lagged behind other major assets during the rebound, has now declined further to approximately $2.88. This continued downturn has caused the asset to drop to fourth place among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, after BNB surpassed it. BNB’s recent performance highlights the contrast between the two assets. While XRP has recorded a 3.49% decline this month, BNB has appreciated by nearly 26%, reaching an all-time high of $1,347 and achieving a market capitalization of $177 billion. XRP’s valuation currently stands near $171 billion. One of the hardest parts of holding XRP is self-control. Watching BNB pump while XRP stands still is painful. But I know this , XRP will have its moment. When it moves, it’ll move harder than anything else on the screen. pic.twitter.com/lbODUCksdj — BD (@DiepSanh) October 7, 2025 Investor Psychology and the Challenge of Patience Addressing this performance gap, Sanh pointed out that maintaining composure and conviction is one of the hardest parts of holding XRP. He explained that when other cryptocurrencies post large gains while XRP remains stagnant, many investors experience frustration and doubt, often leading to premature selling. According to Sanh, this emotional challenge requires strong conviction in the asset’s long-term potential. He emphasized that holding through underperformance can be particularly difficult, especially when other altcoins are rallying. The current situation, with BNB’s rapid growth and XRP’s muted movement, exemplifies the test of patience many XRP investors face. Historical Trends Supporting Sanh’s View Despite current challenges, Sanh remains confident that XRP will eventually recover strongly. He argued that XRP has historically lagged during early stages of bull markets but tends to deliver exceptional gains once its rally begins. Data from previous market cycles support this observation. During the 2017 bull run , XRP underperformed for several months while the broader market advanced. Between October 2016 and February 2017, XRP fell by about 54%, even as most cryptocurrencies appreciated. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, once momentum shifted in March 2017, XRP surged more than 60,000%, reaching $3.31 by January 2018, outperforming every other major asset at the time. A similar pattern emerged in late 2024. While Bitcoin rose by 11% and BNB gained about 1.5% in October 2024, XRP declined by nearly 17%. Yet, in November 2024, the asset reversed course, rallying 284% and reaching $3.4 by January 2025, surpassing both Bitcoin and BNB in short-term performance. Drawing on these past cycles, Sanh reiterated that XRP’s periods of underperformance are often followed by sharp recoveries. He believes the current market phase mirrors earlier conditions that preceded major price surges. “XRP will have its moment,” Sanh stated, stressing that patience and conviction are essential for investors who expect to benefit from the next significant rally. His remarks are similar to the sentiment shared by other XRP advocates, including Coach JV, who recently commented that when XRP eventually breaks out, the move will likely be rapid and substantial. For now, XRP continues to face short-term market pressures, but analysts like Sanh remain focused on its long-term trajectory, arguing that the asset’s track record suggests resilience and strong recovery potential once momentum returns.

As the cryptocurrency gains mainstream recognition, the blockchain is at the forefront of the crucial expansion across the globe. S&P Broad Crypto Index Welcomes Cardano While the bull market phase is still ongoing, Cardano continues to make history, reaching crucial milestones that could shape its future trajectory. On Tuesday, Mintern, the Chief Meme Officer (CMO) of Minswap, shared the blockchain’s latest achievements in the financial landscape, which has ignited a frenzy within the community. In a major victory for the Cardano ecosystem, ADA has officially been added to the S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund, marking a new chapter in its path to global adoption. This inclusion highlights the blockchain’s growing popularity in the context of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) , governance, and practical applications. By becoming one of the most well-known digital assets in the world, Cardano has bolstered its reputation among traditional investors, which could enhance adoption in the short term. Such an achievement during growing crypto acceptance reflects how the network is developing from a research-driven project to a significant player, influencing the future of blockchain innovation . In the meantime, this crucial development seems to have triggered mixed signals among the Cardano community. Dan Gambardello, a crypto pundit, has outlined a bearish outlook for ADA following its latest listing on the S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund. According to the crypto pundit, the development is likely to trigger a downward trend in the price of ADA . With the inclusion, Gambardello is confident that manipulation is highly possible at this point, while he keeps track of its duration. Transactions On The Blockchain Are Picking Up Steam Cardano’s inclusion in the S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund is likely driven by the blockchain’s reputation and notable performance. A recent report from TapTools reveals that activity on the blockchain is heating up due to a sharp increase in transactions processed over the past 30 days. TapTool highlighted that the overall transactions processed on the network have surpassed 1 million within the time frame. This increase demonstrates how the Cardano ecosystem is gaining momentum because of increased developer activity, expanded DeFi membership, and more user engagement. Such a massive number of transactions processed suggests that the network activity remains stable, demonstrating persistent on-chain usage despite market volatility. Furthermore, the growth points to a resurgence in confidence in the network’s scalability and potential in the long term. Given its growing scalability, the Cardano blockchain is constantly being compared to the likes of Ethereum. OxManuel, a crypto expert, has picked the blockchain over Ethereum, underscoring its increasing relevance. Putting aside liquidity, OxManuel declares that the network is miles ahead of Ethereum.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano blockchain|Cardano ecosystem|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Dan Gambardello|decentralized finance|DeFi|Ethereum|Minswap|Mintern|OxManuel|S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund|TapTools,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 00:00:27

The announcements, made on Wednesday, October 8, 2025, reveal how the two powerful tech companies are leaning on AI to drive their next wave of growth amid intensifying global competition. Alibaba bets on embodied AI Alibaba Group has set up an in-house robotics and embodied AI team within its Qwen division, the Hangzhou-based company’s flagship AI unit. The move, disclosed by Qwen’s technology lead Justin Lin in a post on X, marks Alibaba’s most explicit foray yet into physical AI systems. “These applications should definitely step from the virtual world to the physical world,” Lin wrote . This reflects Alibaba’s effort to translate its generative AI advances into tangible products. The company recently led a $140 million funding round for robotics startup X Square Robot. Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu has forecast global AI investment to reach as much as $4 trillion over the next five years, with embodied AI seen as a major growth driver. Alibaba’s push comes as rivals from Nvidia to SoftBank and ABB accelerate their robotics investments. SoftBank this week agreed to acquire ABB’s industrial robot business for $5.4 billion, while Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has described AI-powered robotics as a multitrillion-dollar opportunity . Google’s AI-first hardware strategy While Alibaba looks to bring AI into the physical world through robotics, Google is embedding it deeper into everyday devices. Following the summer release of its Pixel 10 smartphones, the company on Wednesday introduced the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Google’s third-generation foldable, retains the look of its predecessor but brings key refinements. It features thinner bezels, a slightly larger 6.4-inch external screen, IP68 dust and water resistance, the first foldable in the US to achieve that rating, and support for magnetic wireless charging via the new Qi2 standard. The device’s gearless hinge offers improved stability, while its larger frame allows for stronger speakers and haptics. The 5,015 mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day, though the Tensor G5 processor still trails Samsung’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in gaming and video-editing performance. But the real story lies in the integration of Gemini, Google’s conversational AI model, across the device. Gemini can summarize emails, schedule appointments directly from messages, and power features such as Magic Cue for automated replies and Ask Photos for image editing through text or voice prompts. These capabilities extend across the company’s hardware ecosystem, offering a more unified AI experience than many rivals. Critics note that Gemini’s performance remains uneven, occasionally misreading context or failing to activate gestures consistently. AI’s next frontier The two announcements show that there’s a growing consensus across the technology industry that the next phase of AI competition will hinge on embodiment and this may be in the form of a smartphone assistant, a physical robot or something else. Apple is expected to enter the foldable market next year, while Chinese firms like Huawei and Oppo continue to close the gap in both design and camera performance. For Google, focusing on AI helps differentiate its Pixel line in a saturated smartphone market. For Alibaba, robotics could mark its next strategic frontier as Chinese firms push to localize core technologies amid global supply chain tensions.

Open account → XRP is showing bearish signs: a descending triangle, dominant sell-side CVD and weakening on-chain and derivatives metrics increase the probability of a retest of $2.72 in the short term unless demand and network activity rebound quickly. Descending triangle with flat support near $2.72 indicates downside risk. Spot taker CVD shows sustained sell-side dominance, limiting bullish momentum. On-chain and derivatives metrics: transactions ~109K, network growth ~859, OI down 6.51% to 2.78B. XRP technical outlook: descending triangle and sell-side CVD point to a possible retest of $2.72 — read the on-chain and derivatives analysis and key takeaways. Is XRP’s chart signaling a deeper decline toward $2.72? XRP currently trades inside a descending triangle, with lower highs compressing against a flat support near $2.72. Technical weakness combined with dominant sell-side cumulative volume delta (CVD) and softer on-chain and derivatives activity increases the probability of a retest of $2.72 in the near term. How does Spot Taker CVD affect XRP price momentum? The Spot Taker CVD is in “Taker Sell Dominant” territory, indicating net selling pressure from aggressive participants. Short-term bounces have failed to reverse the CVD trend, which suggests sellers retain control of momentum and limit sustained bullish recoveries.

Open futures account → Source: TradingView (image provided for visual context) Can weakening on-chain and derivatives activity affect XRP’s stability? On-chain metrics reveal a notable cooldown in network participation. Transaction count fell to ~109K and network growth dropped to ~859, indicating fewer active addresses and lower throughput on the XRP Ledger. This reduced participation tends to suppress organic demand and can amplify technical downtrends. Source: CryptoQuant (data snapshot) What do derivatives tell us about participation and risk? Open Interest (OI) contracted by 6.51% to 2.78 billion, showing lower derivatives participation and fewer new directional bets. A falling OI alongside sell-side dominance often precedes trend continuation rather than reversal, though lower leverage can reduce the scale of forced liquidations.

Monitor Spot Taker CVD for changes from sell to neutral/buy dominance. Watch transaction count and network growth for renewed on-chain engagement. Track Open Interest for increasing participation that could fuel rallies. Source: Santiment (on-chain snapshot) Frequently Asked Questions Will XRP fall to $2.72? Current indicators favor a retest: a descending triangle, sell-side CVD, falling OI and cooled on-chain activity raise the probability of another move toward $2.72 unless demand and network engagement recover swiftly. What would invalidate the bearish case? A sustained shift in Spot Taker CVD to buy dominance, rising transaction counts and a notable increase in Open Interest would suggest renewed demand and reduce the likelihood of a $2.72 retest. Key Takeaways Technical setup : Descending triangle with flat support at $2.72 favors downside risk. Market structure : Spot taker CVD and falling OI show sell-side control and lower participation. Actionable insight : Watch CVD, transaction count and OI for confirmation before positioning. Conclusion COINOTAG analysis shows XRP’s short-term outlook leans bearish as technical, on-chain and derivatives signals align toward downside pressure. The $2.72 level remains critical; a meaningful recovery requires stronger on-chain engagement and a reversal in Spot Taker CVD.

She projected that global growth will likely see only a slight slowdown this year and in 2026. Recent economic reports indicate that while the US economy is losing some momentum, it has so far avoided the recession many analysts had warned about over the past six months. Georgieva attributed this resilience to sound policy decisions, a dynamic private sector, milder-than-anticipated import tariffs, and generally favourable financial conditions that have helped sustain economic strength in the US and other major economies. Georgieva points out several serious challenges dragging behind the global economy During an event organised by the Milken Institute in Washington, Georgieva said, “We see global growth slowing only slightly this year and next.” At this time, the economy was demonstrating all signs indicating a world economy that had generally encountered serious strains from multiple shocks. The managing director’s remarks were part of her preview for the IMF’s upcoming World Economic Outlook. In July, the agency increased its prediction for global economic growth by 0.2 % points to 3.0% for 2025 and by 0.1 % points to 3.1% for 2026. For a new economic outlook, the IMF will share it on Tuesday, October 14, at the annual IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington. This situation arises as US President Donald Trump implements high tariffs and stringent immigration policies, affecting global trade. On the other hand, AI is playing a crucial role in the economy as it has swiftly transformed the tech sector and job prospects. “The global economy is doing better than expected, but worse than needed,” said Georgieva. The IMF has set a target of about 3% for global economic growth in the medium term. This target is considerably lower than the 3.7% target set before the COVID-19 crisis. Concerning the lower target, Georgieva highlighted serious circumstances, such as marginalisation, dissatisfaction, and struggles that many individuals around the globe encounter, concluding that the global economy is facing various risks. Uncertainties surrounding the global economy increase amid changing US tariff rates Earlier, Georgieva mentioned that uncertainty surrounding the global economy is very high and still continues to rise even as the appetite for gold — considered a safe haven for many investors — grows. She also noted that monetary gold now represents over 20% of the world’s official reserves. Her remarks followed recent reports, which revealed that gold achieved a record high as the US government shutdown continued, and bets that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates this month spurred demand. The impact of Trump’s tariffs , on the other hand, was not as severe as reported in April. Today, the trade-weighted tariff rate is approximately 17.5%, which is lower than the 23% rate. Additionally, most countries are not retaliating by imposing their own tariffs. However, analysts have raised concerns about the changing US tariff rates, pointing out that inflation in the country could escalate if companies begin passing more of their costs from tariffs onto consumers or, for that matter, if a large number of products meant for the United States end up creating new tariff increases elsewhere.

Once dismissed as fleeting trends, meme tokens are now evolving into complex ecosystems with real economic engines. Each cycle reveals the same truth: volatility rewards preparation. As markets swing, smart investors pivot toward early-stage projects with tangible growth mechanics. Over the last 24 hours, SPX6900 ($SPX) tumbled by 10.69% to $1.45, while Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) declined 7.32% to $0.03089. These corrections have tempered enthusiasm for older players but spotlighted a new contender that’s generating excitement across the Ethereum network. That project is BullZilla ($BZIL),a presale titan that merges scarcity, narrative, and staking rewards into a single roaring ecosystem. With its live burn mechanics and progressive price engine, BullZilla is now viewed as one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Myth That Burns Brighter Every Stage BullZilla ($BZIL) isn’t just a token; it’s an evolving story coded into Ethereum’s core. Its presale is a living mechanism of conviction,a system where price rises automatically every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours without that milestone. Currently in Stage 5 (Roar Drop Incoming), BullZilla has surpassed $830,000 raised, sold 30 billion tokens, and attracted 2,700+ holders. The token price sits at $0.0001324, and the next scheduled increase will push it to $0.00013907, marking a 5.03% jump. This model creates urgency without artificial hype. Early participants at Stage 5D have already recorded returns of approximately 3,881.42% relative to the projected listing price of $0.00527, while the earliest believers are sitting at around 2,202.60%. The Roar Burn Mechanism ensures that each presale milestone reduces supply, reinforcing the token’s scarcity and price momentum. Every burn is broadcast in real-time, a symbolic and financial reminder that the beast keeps growing stronger. Complementing this is the Lore Bible, a 24-chapter saga that ties each stage of the presale to BullZilla’s fictional evolution. Every new chapter triggers a token burn, transforming each milestone into a community celebration. The blend of narrative and mathematics gives BullZilla’s ecosystem a cinematic rhythm that few competitors can match among the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. Presale Snapshot Metric Data Current Stage 5 (Roar Drop Incoming) Price $0.0001324 Total Raised $830,000+ Tokens Sold 30 B+ Holders 2,700+ ROI (Stage 5D ➝ Listing) 3,881.42 % ROI (Earliest Stage ➝ 5D) 2,202.60 % $1,000 Investment 7.552 million $BZIL Next Stage Price $0.00013907 (+5.03 %) Referral Bonus 10 % on $50+ buys Referral Reward 10 % from referrals Burn Reserve 8 B $BZIL A $1,000 BullZilla presale buy at $0.0001324 secures about 7.55 million $BZIL, worth roughly $39,800 at its projected $0.00527 listing,a 3,881 % ROI. With the 10 % referral bonus and 70 % APY staking, total holdings could exceed 14 million tokens, underscoring why BullZilla ranks among the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet and configure it for the Ethereum network. Buy Ethereum (ETH) Purchase ETH through reputable exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase, then transfer it to your wallet. This covers the purchase and gas fees. Visit the BullZilla Presale Portal Head to the official BullZilla presale website and connect your wallet. Always verify the contract address before proceeding. Swap ETH for $BZIL Select the desired purchase amount, approve the transaction, and confirm. Your $BZIL allocation will be secured immediately and claimable once the presale ends. Buyers spending at least $50 receive a 10% token bonus, while referrers earn a 10% reward from their network’s purchases, both unlocking two weeks post-sale. These incentive layers drive organic growth and retention, hallmarks of a disciplined project within the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. SPX6900 ($SPX): The Veteran in a Cooling Cycle SPX6900, once a symbol of raw community energy, is now navigating a period of correction. In the last 24 hours, its price fell 10.69% to $1.45, signaling the start of consolidation after months of explosive growth. Many traders see this as a natural pause, an interval where momentum resets and early profit-takers step aside. For long-term holders, this retracement could be a healthy recalibration rather than a collapse. The technical indicators for SPX6900 reveal a mixed outlook. Its trading volume remains stable, and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is trending toward neutral, implying possible stabilization. Moving averages, however, are flattening, reflecting uncertainty about near-term direction. This tug-of-war between optimism and caution is common after exponential climbs, and SPX now stands at a crossroads between revival and further decline. Still, SPX6900 remains a case study in how meme coins can evolve. Its community-led ethos and viral marketing continue to keep it visible, but the absence of an automated supply-control mechanism limits its resilience. Compared to BullZilla’s live burn structure and progressive presale engine, SPX appears reactive rather than proactive. That’s why many investors are shifting focus toward early-stage projects like BullZilla, which structurally enforce upward motion,cementing their place among the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU): A Beloved Brand Navigating Market Chill Pudgy Penguins, born from a celebrated NFT franchise, has built one of crypto’s most recognizable brands. Its expansion into tokenized markets with $PENGU bridged the worlds of collectibles, culture, and DeFi. However, over the last 24 hours, PENGU’s token price dropped 7.32% to $0.03089, reflecting broader market cooling. This decline isn’t necessarily negative; it often precedes new accumulation phases when long-term supporters quietly re-enter positions. From a technical view, Pudgy Penguins is consolidating within a tight range between $0.028 and $0.035. Trading volumes have lightened, indicating temporary fatigue rather than capital flight. Many traders see this as an opportunity zone where buyers test support levels before a new upward phase. The project’s gaming partnerships and expanding NFT ecosystem still serve as strong tailwinds for recovery once market sentiment improves. Yet, PENGU’s growth depends largely on brand loyalty and ecosystem expansion. Its success relies on maintaining engagement, while BullZilla’s growth is algorithmic, programmed to progress through automated burns and presale triggers. This contrast illustrates why BullZilla has quickly become a standout among the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. Pudgy Penguins will likely continue to thrive culturally, but BullZilla offers a more mechanical and measurable path to appreciation. Conclusion Based on current data and ongoing market analysis, BullZilla stands as one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025 . While SPX6900 cools and Pudgy Penguins consolidates, BullZilla accelerates. Its Roar Burn system, progressive presale engine, staking furnace, and referral mechanics create a virtuous cycle of growth. For early-stage investors, the presale represents an opportunity not just to speculate but to own a piece of a self-fueling ecosystem. A $1,000 investment today yields roughly 7.55 million tokens, and with each price stage rising automatically, waiting comes at a cost. Add referral bonuses and staking APY, and potential returns multiply even before listing. The next presale surge is just one roar away. BullZilla isn’t just bullish, it’s built for domination. For those scanning the horizon for the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025, the time to act is before the next chapter burns through the supply.

Solana (SOL) price is testing resistance near $235 after rebounding from $220 support, supported by growing institutional accumulation, higher on-chain revenue and increased trading volume. These factors combined create a tighter supply-demand balance that could enable a breakout toward $253 if momentum sustains. How are institutional flows and treasury purchases affecting SOL price? Institutional accumulation has increased materially: public firms now hold over 13.4 million SOL, and a corporate treasury recorded roughly $530 million in purchases. Reduced available supply and large-scale corporate buys typically strengthen price support and reduce sell-side liquidity, reinforcing upward pressure. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Solana testing resistance at $235 after rebounding from $220?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Solana rebounds from $220 support and tests $235 resistance, eyeing a potential move toward $253. Institutional accumulation grows as public firms hold 13.4M SOL and treasury adds $530M in purchases. Network revenue hit $141M in September, reinforcing Solana’s strength amid rising trading volume. Solana (SOL) continues to gain momentum after rebounding from the $220 support level. The asset is now testing resistance near $235, with traders monitoring for a potential breakout toward $253. Increased institutional interest, growing network activity, and sustained volume continue to support Solana’s upward trend and market resilience. Why is the $220–$253 range important for SOL? Price action between $220 and $253 represents a full recent trading channel where support and resistance have been tested. Buyers defended $220, creating higher lows, while $253 remains the upper boundary tested in recent sessions. A breakout above $235 with sustained volume could reopen momentum toward the $253 zone. How does on-chain activity support the current rally? On-chain metrics signal stronger usage: decentralized applications on Solana generated $141M in revenue in September, and 24-hour trading volume rose 16.69% to $8.95 billion. Higher revenue and volume indicate increased transaction demand, which often precedes sustained price appreciation if network activity continues.

After reaching its peak near $253, the price corrected but quickly regained strength above the $210 zone. Buyers have defended the $220 area, forming higher lows that maintain short-term momentum. CoinMarketCap reports SOL at $221.46, up 2.14% over seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap Liquidity and participation were high with trading volume rising 16.69% within 24 hours to $8.95 billion. Market capitalization sits near $120.96 billion and fully diluted value near $135.41 billion. Analysts note a breakout to $253 is more likely if consolidation holds between $220 and $240 and volume continues to push the price higher. How much SOL do institutions hold and what does that mean? Public firms now hold roughly 13.4 million SOL, representing about 2.46% of circulating supply. Large purchases — including a corporate treasury buy of approximately $530M and a separate ~760,000 SOL acquisition by an institutional buyer (valued at roughly $167M) — reduce available float and can amplify price moves on positive flow. Grayscale’s Solana Trust (GSOL) has announced staking plans to broaden institutional utility pending regulatory clearance. Data referenced: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and institutional filings (mentioned as plain text sources) indicate increased corporate and fund-level exposure. Frequently Asked Questions Will Solana break $235 and reach $253? A breakout to $253 requires sustained buying pressure and rising volume. If SOL closes above $235 with above-average volume, the next test is $253; failure to hold $220 would signal weakening momentum. How are network revenues influencing investor sentiment? Network revenue of $141M in September signals strong dApp usage and fee generation, which supports investor confidence by demonstrating real economic activity on Solana’s chain. Key Takeaways Support and resistance: $220 is the key support; $235 is immediate resistance, $253 is the next target. Institutional demand: Public firms hold ~13.4M SOL and corporate buys totaling ~$530M tighten supply. On-chain strength: $141M in network revenue for September and higher trading volume bolster the outlook. Conclusion Solana (SOL) has rebounded from $220 and is testing $235 resistance, supported by institutional accumulation and rising network revenue. Watch trading volume and on-chain metrics closely; a confirmed breakout with strong participation could target $253.

Senior Treasury advisors and lawmakers have begun referencing digital assets as potential additions to long-term fiscal policy planning, signaling a dramatic shift in perception at the highest levels of government. Recent statements from financial committees suggest that holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve could complement existing gold and bond portfolios by improving currency diversification and technological credibility. Analysts see this as one of the clearest signs yet that digital assets have matured from speculative instruments to macroeconomic tools. With policy discourse evolving, investor sentiment is surging across both institutional and retail segments, creating conditions ripe for a new wave of capital rotation, one that also brings rising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. The institutional logic behind a Bitcoin reserve For years, advocates have argued that Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralization make it a logical complement to traditional reserves. The idea gained traction following international diversification trends among central banks seeking assets beyond US Treasuries. With multiple countries experimenting with digital reserve frameworks, a formal US plan would represent the ultimate validation of cryptocurrency’s legitimacy. According to recent policy notes, officials have acknowledged Bitcoin’s resilience and increasing adoption rate as reasons for consideration. Market strategists at major investment firms describe the potential reserve strategy as a symbolic alignment between traditional and decentralized economies, a move that could redefine how nations manage value preservation in an era of fiscal uncertainty. Renewed institutional accumulation and liquidity expansion Institutional participation has grown steadily through exchange-traded products and custodial infrastructure improvements. Data from CoinShares and CryptoQuant shows continued inflows into large-cap digital asset funds and declining exchange balances, suggesting accumulation rather than speculation. Hedge funds, pension managers, and corporate treasuries are adjusting allocation models to include measured exposure to digital assets. Analysts believe this accumulation trend reflects increasing confidence that policy normalization is imminent. As liquidity deepens and macro risks stabilize, smaller market segments often benefit next, an effect already visible in the surge of altcoin interest across retail networks and crypto social platforms. Retail optimism fuels new market rotation Retail traders interpret government acknowledgment of Bitcoin’s role as validation for the entire crypto ecosystem. This enthusiasm isn’t limited to blue chips; it’s spilling into cultural assets and narrative-based altcoins that embody the decentralized spirit of crypto. Traders are seeking projects that combine structure, scarcity, and community engagement, reflecting a desire to balance excitement with accountability. The U.S. government’s growing interest in a Bitcoin reserve has reignited debate about digital sovereignty, and while institutions plan, retail investors act. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become their focal point, evolving from a niche meme idea into a national movement within crypto. Its current presale price of $0.00051 and $0.007 listing target encode above 13× upside gap , now widely discussed by traders online. Audits by CertiK and HashEx give it uncommon legitimacy, and the PATRIOT50X bonus code continues to drive early participation. Analysts say this blend of patriotic branding, verifiable structure, and aggressive market timing could make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins, a reflection of both cultural identity and economic opportunity in the digital age. Strategic alignment between macro policy and digital innovation The conversation around a potential Bitcoin reserve represents more than symbolism; it indicates the government’s growing recognition of blockchain as a stabilizing force rather than a threat. This shift aligns with the broader narrative of financial modernization. As the US contemplates integrating decentralized assets into national reserves, it implicitly validates the innovation ecosystem driving projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The shared principle between both movements is scarcity, a finite resource anchoring trust. Institutional endorsement of digital scarcity and retail enthusiasm for community scarcity converge to create the most inclusive market dynamic since the rise of ETFs. Why this shift matters for investors Institutional recognition tends to create secondary effects across all market layers. When governments and corporations begin framing Bitcoin as a strategic asset, risk appetite expands. Investors start exploring derivative opportunities in altcoins, governance tokens, and meme-culture projects that mirror the decentralization ethos. This layered adoption cycle reinforces liquidity across the spectrum, ensuring that both conservative and speculative segments benefit simultaneously. In this emerging balance, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a representation of the new retail identity, informed, engaged, and motivated by transparency. Market analysts from 10x Research describe this cycle as a “convergence phase,” where institutional credibility meets retail passion to produce the broadest base of participation ever recorded in crypto. If Bitcoin becomes a formalized component of US fiscal reserves, the symbolic impact alone could multiply global adoption rates. Each wave of recognition by major economies typically triggers waves of innovation at the grassroots level, and that interplay could define the entire 2025 narrative. A new era of credibility and creativity The possibility of a US Bitcoin reserve demonstrates how far digital assets have come since their fringe beginnings. What began as an experiment in digital scarcity is now entering the halls of global finance. The parallel rise of community-driven tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE proves that the original decentralized ethos remains alive within this new legitimacy. Institutional capital may set the direction, but it is the collective creativity of retail traders that drives momentum. Together, they form the twin engines of adoption that ensure crypto’s next chapter will be both credible and imaginative. As the year advances, the conversation will likely broaden from Bitcoin reserves to wider digital diversification strategies. Analysts expect altcoins that combine transparency and culture to thrive in this evolving landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE exemplifies that model, blending structure with sentiment, scarcity with participation. Whether viewed through the lens of policy or retail psychology, its timing and architecture reflect the same fundamentals that made Bitcoin’s own rise inevitable.

Among the discussions to be had will be talks surrounding how innovation is changing payments and shaping what money looks like in a digital asset age, featuring all-star speakers from Wall Street and beyond. Speakers who have been confirmed include Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management; Rob Goldstein, Chief Operating Officer at BlackRock Inc.; and Heath Tarbert, Chief Legal Officer at Circle Internet Financial. Also on the lineup are Alesia Haas, Chief Financial Officer at Coinbase; Tim Spence, CEO of Fifth Third Bank; and Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. Fed explores convergence of traditional and decentralized finance The conference will centre on the interaction between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), two previously parallel systems now converging as blockchain and tokenization technologies gain momentum. The focus of the conversations will be on new stablecoins applications and business models for payments, as well as the tokenization of financial assets. The Fed has indicated that it’s interested in exploring how digital assets could enhance cross-border payments, financial inclusion, and real-time settlement. Governor Christopher Waller is likely to emphasize that payment innovation should continue to be led by the private sector and reinforce his previous comments that competition — not regulation alone — will spur the development of safer and faster payment systems. The event also arrives as the Fed is in the process of rolling out FedNow, its instant payment platform introduced in 2023. Though FedNow was conceived for bank-to-bank payments, the upcoming summit may provide a preview of how its use case might expand in a world where money can be tokenized or programmed. Innovators and rule makers from industry-leading organizations Representatives from the industry will share their perspectives on striking a balance between innovation and economic stability. Cathie Wood, an early champion of Bitcoin and blockchain investments, would likely assert that crypto assets have the potential to make global finance more efficient in the long term. Rob Goldstein, on behalf of the world’s largest asset manager, may focus on institutional tokenized assets and how digital infrastructure can impact portfolio management. Heath Tarbert, the former Chair of the US CFTC, has emerged as a strong voice at the intersection of regulatory bodies and cryptocurrency companies. His involvement is a sign of Circle’s increased importance in digital payments, especially with the asset it backs — the USD Coin (USDC) — one of the most widely used stablecoins worldwide. Alesia Haas of Coinbase will give the crypto exchange’s take on compliance and innovation. At the same time, Tim Spence will discuss how traditional banks are responding to digital transformation and real-time payment requirements. The Payments Innovation Conference takes place at a moment when US regulators are facing pressure to provide clearer guidance on stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and digital dollar experiments. Analysts anticipate the meeting will be closely monitored for any hints on how the Fed’s approach to integrating crypto into mainstream finance may be changing. Several central banks around the world — including those in the European Union and China — are already pushing to develop digital currencies, adding pressure on American authorities to weigh in on the issue of where the world is heading with money. The Fed, which also plans to open the event with public remarks by the central bank’s vice chair, has made clear that it will livestream the event to the public in an effort to encourage broader participation and transparency. With such a potent mix of voices — from the wilds of crypto to Wall Street boardrooms — assembled, the Federal Reserve seems determined to mould not merely how Americans pay for things but also how finance will work in our digital age.

It's a TRAP — Here's How Scammers Are Stealing Millions,https://coinpaper.com/11499/free-shiba-inu-tokens-it-s-a-trap-here-s-how-scammers-are-stealing-millions,"Shiba Inu token holders are exposed to a new security risk. With the huge number of cryptocurrency users, a complex phishing scheme is being used to take advantage of them. The attack targets legitimate token airdrops, which are used to lure victims into compromising their digital wallets. The SHIB community has been issued with an urgent warning by Shibarium Trustwatch, an account on X focused on security. The alert follows the detection of a coordinated scam targeting unsuspecting token holders across multiple wallets. The Phishing Scheme Explained The fraud is carried out in a peculiar way. Hackers are sending real Shiba Inu tokens to random wallet addresses. These airdrops look credible and genuine. However, they include coded messages, which lead customers to scam websites. The spam messages inform users that they need to access specific sites to receive additional rewards. Such websites mimic official Shiba Inu platforms. When the victims link their wallets, the fraudsters access the funds and drain them instantly. Shibarium Trustwatch verified that there is no relation between the counterfeit websites and the legitimate Shiba Inu ecosystem . The attachment of a wallet to such platforms can lead to stolen assets and compromised security. This may cause serious and permanent damage. According to security experts, this type of attack exploits the trust individuals place in others. Airdrops are considered valid opportunities automatically by many crypto holders. The internalised messages bring a sense of urgency, where the victims undertake their actions without due diligence. Protecting Your Assets SHIB holders received clear guidance from the security team. Users should ignore all messages embedded in token names and unforeseen airdrops. No legitimate Shiba Inu promotion requires connecting wallets through unsolicited tokens. The best defence against such attacks is verification. Any official news is communicated through the official Shiba Inu channels. The project has verified profiles on major social media sites. These are the official sources through which community members should verify any claims and then take action. There are several additional precautions that cybersecurity professionals recommend. Users are advised to enable two-factor authentication on all cryptocurrency-related accounts. Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of security for significant holdings. Regular security audits of connected applications help identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Pattern of Ongoing Threats This is one of the larger trends targeting the Shiba Inu community. In the first quarter of the year, Shibarium Trustwatch identified fraudulent accounts on X that posed as legitimate supporters. These fraudsters were marketing irrelevant tokens under the guise of being part of the SHIB system. The scammers took advantage of a specific platform, HypeIt, which is developed on Shibarium to share content and communicate with the community. The attackers exploited the platform's validity to defraud users. The other explanation was regarding the misconception about the LEASH token . The meme coin associated with Shiba Inu exists only as an ERC-20 token. LEASH is not available on Solana, and any claims to the contrary are fraudulent. Buyers who attempt to purchase LEASH on Solana may lose their funds to fake tokens. In a recent update , we covered that crypto users were also warned about scammers buying trusted Telegram usernames to impersonate community members and steal assets. These usernames are highly important in the cryptocurrency community due to their reputation and trust.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|AIRDROP|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-09 00:38:57

The token is scheduled to launch in 2026 and will initially be offered to banks and credit unions in the state. It aims to revolutionise money movement within the state’s financial network — much like how the internet transformed information exchange. The Roughrider Coin will be held in parity with the U.S. dollar, thereby maintaining a stable value. It will underpin various types of financial transactions, such as interbank settlements, merchant payments, and cross-border remittances. This is the first time a state-owned bank in the U.S. has launched its own stablecoin for use within its local monetary system. Don Morgan, the president of the Bank of North Dakota, which will operate the effort, called it a way of solidifying the state’s financial infrastructure and maintaining its relevance in an increasingly global economy. The bank’s job has always been to lend for agriculture, commerce and industry — and digital assets are among those now in that lane, he said. The project received the support of Governor Kelly Armstrong, who described it as a “state-of-the-art approach” and part of the state’s progressive financial strategy. He insisted that the stablecoin would be “backed by real money,” ensuring trust and safety for citizens and institutions. The Roughrider Coin is contingent upon approval from the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which regulates the state’s banking industry. When approved, pilot testing is scheduled with local financial institutions and public use is set to start in 2026. Fiserv expands its digital asset reach Fiserv acquired Bento a few years after it bought out CheckFree, which gives the Brookfield, Wisconsin-based company even more reach into new payments technology and digital assets. Fiserv, a leading provider of payments and financial technology solutions, will provide the digital infrastructure for Roughrider Coin. For years, the firm has been developing its stablecoin and digital asset platform, specifically designed for banks and payment networks. Fiserv launched its independent white-label stablecoin , FIUSD, earlier this year, creating a way for traditional financial institutions to issue and manage digital tokens while remaining compliant with U.S. fintech regulations. Roughrider Coin will be built on the same technology and work with other stablecoins running on Fiserv’s network. This is crucial for compatibility with various payment systems and blockchains. There are also strong compliance and anti-fraud protections built into the platform, a concern for community banks that want to upgrade while keeping themselves shielded from the risks often associated with crypto markets. The North Dakota partnership is proof that digital money can work in tandem with brick-and-mortar banking, Fiserv executives said. As regulations evolve, we anticipate that more states and institutions will follow this direction. Navigating opportunities and challenges ahead The Roughrider Coin may enable banking to become more efficient and accessible, but it faces obstacles. Its acceptance will depend on how eagerly banks, merchants, and consumers adopt it in their daily business conduct. Most community banks are lagging, and caution has prevented some from participating in the blockchain-based payment marketplace. Security remains another priority as digital currencies are susceptible to cyberattacks and system malfunctions. Fiserv’s solution specifically addresses these concerns with safeguards already in place, including fraud monitoring and data security. BND has also consented to robust monitoring and risk-management obligations. Unlike private stablecoins, the Roughrider Coin would be overseen by a state-owned bank, something that has the potential to build trust among risk-averse users. However, it must still prove itself to be hardy and reliable in the field. Private stablecoins like USDC and USDT already dominate the market, while companies such as PayPal and Cloudflare are offering plans to issue their own. Roughrider Coin will have to demonstrate that it offers clear advantages — such as regulatory approval, cost savings, or benefits to the local economy.

Litecoin price outlook: Litecoin price nears key $135–$140 resistance; monitor $100 support—act on confirmed breakdowns or ETF-driven sentiment shifts. Read analysis and trade considerations now. What is Litecoin’s current price outlook? Litecoin price is approaching the $135–$140 resistance after an uptrend since early March. Technicals show a rising weekly channel with support near $100; a sustained rejection at the upper channel could form a bearish double-top and increase downside risk toward $66–$70. How could a break below $100 affect Litecoin price? A decisive break below the $100 neckline would signal a channel breakdown and likely accelerate selling. Technical projections indicate a 35–40% decline to $66–$70, with extended downside to around $50 if selling momentum intensifies after a failed retest of the $135–$140 barrier. Litecoin price nears $140 resistance with potential downside toward $70, while optimism rises over Canary Capital’s ETF proposal. Litecoin is testing a strong $135–$140 resistance level that has repeatedly halted upward moves since December last year. A confirmed breakdown below $100 could trigger a 35–40% decline, with downside targets between $66 and $70 per coin. Optimism around Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF proposal may cushion price weakness if broader sentiment turns favorable. Litecoin is approaching a crucial resistance zone between $135 and $140 after maintaining a steady uptrend since early March. The cryptocurrency has respected a rising channel on the weekly chart, yet the upper boundary now poses a significant technical challenge. This resistance has capped rallies since late last year, including a reversal near $134 in August. The medium-term trend remains upward, supported by an ascending trendline near $100 that has repeatedly attracted buyers. Analysts caution that rejection at the current resistance could create a bearish double-top on the weekly chart. If confirmed, that pattern would increase pressure toward lower price zones and end the recent phase of relative stability. Why does the $66–$70 range matter for Litecoin? The $66–$70 band represents historical accumulation and prior support zones that often absorb selling pressure. Technical projections place this as the next key support if the $100 neckline fails. Traders view this range as a potential area where long-term holders may re-enter, limiting deeper declines. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Source: TradingView Market strategist Ali Martinez commented that a confirmed rejection at current resistance could accelerate selling toward $50. Despite that risk, Litecoin’s rising channel shows resilience, and short-term buyers remain active. The coming weeks will determine whether the market sustains the uptrend or shifts into a deeper retracement phase. How might Canary Capital’s ETF filing influence Litecoin? Canary Capital’s amended filing for a spot Litecoin ETF has introduced fundamental optimism. Market participants expect that a favorable regulatory environment or progress on filings could attract fresh demand into LTC. While technical risk remains, ETF progress can shorten correction cycles by improving market sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions What price levels should traders watch for Litecoin short-term? Watch resistance at $135–$140 and support at $100. Confirmed close below $100 increases odds of a 35–40% drop to $66–$70, while a sustained break above $140 would open higher targets within the channel. Is the current Litecoin trend bullish or bearish? Technically the medium-term trend is still upward given the rising channel and support near $100. However, repeated resistance rejections could flip the bias to bearish if a double-top or channel breakdown is confirmed. Key Takeaways Resistance is critical : $135–$140 repeatedly caps rallies and must be cleared for bullish continuation. Support to watch : $100 is the immediate neckline; a break targets $66–$70, with downside extension to $50 possible. ETF factor : Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF filing could provide sentiment support and limit downside if regulatory progress continues. Conclusion Litecoin price sits at a tactical crossroads: the $135–$140 resistance defines near-term risk, while $100 forms the key support that preserves the uptrend. Traders should watch for confirmed breakdowns or a decisive breakout, and factor ETF developments into position sizing and risk management.

BTC is now up ~29% year-to-date. Ether's closing price rose more than 10% this week, hitting its highest level in three weeks. ETH is now up ~33% year-to-date and is ~8% below its record close from August 2025. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price reached a new record high this week, crossing $124,000 for the first time in history. BTC is now up ~29% year-to-date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price rose more than 10% this week, hitting its highest level in three weeks. ETH is now up ~33% year-to-date and is ~8% below its record close from August 2025. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) , Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

But while the spotlight typically falls on the top two giants, clever investors know that the real wealth creation opportunity lies elsewhere, and because of this, attention is rapidly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new DeFi phenomenon is gaining momentum with its two-way lending protocol, allowing borrowers to borrow with ease, a revolutionary use case that’s fueling widespread early adoption. Its presale has been one of the fastest-moving in 2025, with over 60% of Phase 6 sold out and still costing just $0.035, leading many analysts to predict explosive growth in the future. As institutional money flows into crypto, Mutuum Finance is becoming the altcoin that most likely will make retail investors into early-stage winners. ETF Momentum Drives Bitcoin and Ethereum Surge The institutional rush of latest times is infusing fresh life into the crypto space as both Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded one of their strongest inflow weeks of the year. On-chain data shows whales are not sitting still either, freshly minted wallets have taken huge quantities of BTC and ETH off exchanges to self-custody, which speaks of a strong long-term accumulation wave. This relationship has already toll on prices: Bitcoin shattered all previous records to hit $125,506, while Ethereum hit a high of $4,575, taunting the potential rally to $130,000 and $5,000, respectively. Even if there is a temporary pullback, analysts believe institutional demand and whale positioning will keep the trend going, a trend that’s also guiding investor attention to the next big thing in DeFi, where a new project is quickly gathering pace. Mutuum Finance Presale Update Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale Phase 6 presale with more than 16,800 registered investors and more than $16.9 million locked up. Such figures indicate growing market confidence in the long-term project vision and makes it a very high-demand ecosystem for investors to invest in and gain sustainable profits and long-term expansion. The protocol also includes firm Loan-to-Value (LTV) composition and dynamic liquidation protocol, both of which respond in real time to shock prices. There is also a reserve multiplier of 10% to 35% based on collateral risk profile that has the role to provide an additional layer of security as well as enhancing platform overall resilience. Mutuum Finance has a $50,000 bug bounty program where it classifies vulnerabilities under four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low, with a structured methodology for early detection and prevention prior to problems reaching the community. Security by design and open architecture integrated makes Mutuum Finance a stable, secure, and long-term DeFi system. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance also introduced its new lending and borrowing protocol , a key milestone in its expanding DeFi platform. The V1 will be launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with its essential features including liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be available as assets for borrowing, lending, and collateralization from day one, offering an open-ended and scalable DeFi framework. As a gesture of appreciation for its initial investors, the group conducted a $100,000 giveaway , to gift 10 lucky people with $10,000 MUTM tokens. Early-Stage Potential with MUTM While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still making headlines with $4.5 billion in ETF inflows, savvy investors are increasingly turning to newer DeFi projects for potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is another hopeful substitute with a price of just $0.035 and over 60% of Phase 6 presale, 16,800+ investors, and raising $16.9 million. Its dynamic risk management, secure architecture, and dual-lending protocol make it a utility-driven project with real growth potential. With institutional purchasing driving BTC and ETH, MUTM offers an early investor a chance to benefit from disproportionate returns while getting exposure to a transparent, scalable, and secure DeFi ecosystem.

In just two weeks, the token has skyrocketed from $0.46 to $2.04, marking a jaw-dropping gain of more than 340%. The sudden rally has shaken up the market, reminding investors that explosive moves can still happen even amid growing competition in the Layer-1 space. Analysts attribute Astar’s remarkable run to a combination of strong fundamentals, network growth in Japan, and increased exposure after Binance’s latest listings. The project’s integration with government-backed blockchain initiatives, alongside partnerships with Sony, NTT, and SBI Holdings, has cemented Astar as one of Asia’s leading smart contract networks. In recent weeks, trading volume has surged to record levels, with Astar’s market cap now surpassing several mid-tier rivals. Technical indicators show no immediate signs of weakness, and the project’s expansion into tokenization and cross-chain interoperability continues to strengthen investor confidence. But while Astar’s rally has dominated headlines, a new contender is beginning to capture the spotlight – MAGACOIN FINANCE , an early-stage project many believe could be the next major breakout story. Astar’s Rise: Fuelled by Utility and Adoption Astar’s rapid climb didn’t come out of nowhere. The network has been quietly building a strong ecosystem focused on interoperability between Ethereum, Polkadot, and other major chains. Its leadership position in Japan’s national tokenization strategy has given it a level of legitimacy that few blockchain projects can match. Developers and enterprises alike have turned to Astar for creating compliant Web3 solutions, particularly as Japan pushes ahead with real-world asset tokenization. This combination of government support and enterprise partnerships has created a unique environment for growth. However, analysts warn that after such an intense rally, Astar could face short-term corrections as traders lock in profits. Long-term holders, though, remain confident that Astar’s expanding network and strong fundamentals will support higher valuations throughout 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Star Stealing the Show Even as Astar dominates the headlines, the real buzz in crypto circles right now is surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new project that’s already generating massive hype among early investors. Despite being in its early stages, its performance so far has been nothing short of incredible – and it’s quickly becoming the most talked-about presale token of the year. Following full audits by HashEX and CertiK, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned a reputation for transparency and trustworthiness, two qualities often lacking in the presale market. Its combination of a strong community, growing ecosystem, and innovative tokenomics has analysts predicting a potential rise of up to 20,000% once it hits major exchanges. Early backers have already seen astonishing returns as presale rounds sold out in record time. The project’s structure rewards strategic entry and long-term holding, encouraging community participation rather than short-term speculation. Many investors now believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could follow the same early trajectory as SHIBA INU or DOGECOIN, but with greater staying power thanks to its development roadmap and ecosystem utility. For retail investors searching for the next big opportunity, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a clear front-runner. The project’s strong fundamentals, verified security audits, and rapidly growing user base have all contributed to its meteoric rise in popularity – even before major exchange listings have begun. Market Outlook: The Shift Toward New Opportunities Astar’s recent surge has reinvigorated market optimism, but it has also sparked a broader discussion among traders about where the next big wave of profits will come from. While established networks like Astar are proving their staying power, new altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves as the high-upside plays for 2025. With Bitcoin holding steady above $120,000 and anticipation growing around upcoming altcoin ETF approvals, market liquidity is expected to pour into emerging projects. Retail investors, in particular, are showing stronger appetite for early-stage opportunities – especially those that combine verified transparency with strong community growth. Conclusion Astar’s explosive rally has reignited enthusiasm across the crypto market, highlighting how fast momentum can build around fundamentally strong projects. But while Astar enjoys its moment in the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming the name that retail investors are watching most closely. With a proven track record of success in its presale phase, full audit certifications, and predictions of massive upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE could soon emerge as one of the best-performing assets of 2025 – potentially rivaling or even surpassing Astar’s incredible run.

He pointed to his decision in December 2020 to back the token when the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a suit against Ripple, saying he went all-in while many others were selling.

He chose to hold and add. That move, according to his account, set the stage for later gains — from $0.17 to roughly $three, a rise he places at about 1,660% since the lawsuit announcement. XRP will be one of the greatest assets of our lifetime. From the moment I was introduced to it, I felt it deep in my gut. I remember December 2020 when the SEC launched their case against Ripple.

In July 2025 he warned investors that ignoring XRP might mean missing a major transfer of wealth. In August he even forecast that XRP could overtake Bitcoin and Ethereum by 2030. Those are strong claims. They are based on legal clarity and new services that connect the token to everyday use. Related Reading: $140K Or Bust?

52872157,601667,1759971649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52872157.jpeg,‘Rugged’ By Gold? Economist Thinks Bitcoin’s Glory Days May Be Numbered,https://bitcoinist.com/rugged-by-gold-economist-thinks-bitcoins-glory-days-may-be-numbered/,"Bitcoin pulled back from fresh highs this week, while gold pushed higher and grabbed attention. According to social posts by economist Peter Schiff, a move into precious metals could force crypto prices lower. Bitcoin briefly slipped below $122,000 after hitting an intraday peak near $126,000 earlier, and the total crypto market cap eased to about $4.13 trillion. Based on figures, most large coins fell; Ethereum, XRP and Solana dropped between 5% and 6%, while BNB was among the few gainers. Schiff Issues Stark Warning Schiff wrote on X that “Bitcoin and everything crypto are about to be rugged by gold,” and he forecasted gold reaching $4,000 per ounce if the trend continues. He argued Wall Street’s optimism on crypto has become hard to justify and suggested that a sharp move in bullion could pull funds away from digital assets. Gold is trading near $2,700 per ounce at present, putting Schiff’s $4,000 target roughly 50% above current levels. If that happened, large investors would likely take notice, he said. Wall Street is so bullish on crypto that it’s hard to imagine it going much higher from here. Instead, it’s very likely that Bitcoin and everything crypto are about to be rugged by gold. As gold tops $4k, it’s likely that Bitcoin will sell off, taking the rest of crypto with it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 7, 2025 Deutsche Bank Sees A Role For Both Assets Meanwhile, reports have disclosed a Deutsche Bank research note that paints a different picture. The bank said both bitcoin and gold could be held on central bank balance sheets by 2030 as policymakers respond to a weaker dollar and rising geopolitical risks. According to the report, bitcoin reached about $123,500 in August and roughly $125,000 in October during a record run for the token in 2025. Deutsche Bank suggested that a strategic allocation to bitcoin might become part of a modern reserve play, alongside traditional bullion. Sentiment Split Among Investors Some market veterans see the recent dips as a pause, not a top. Paul Tudor Jones, for example, has voiced bullish views and expects further upside for bitcoin. Others, like Schiff, view the setup as the start of a reallocation toward safer stores of value. Traders also noted that the market was pricing in a possible three-week US government shutdown, a factor that briefly boosted volatility across risky assets. Market Moves Broad But Mild Trading data showed the total crypto market off slightly after several weeks of gains. Small profit-taking appears to explain the pullback more than any single event. Based on reports and public comments, two clear scenarios exist: a rotation into gold that drags crypto lower, or a continued appetite for bitcoin that keeps both assets bid. Some institutional players prefer holding both. Others will watch inflation, rate expectations and dollar strength for clues. For now, markets are split and investors are watching price action closely.

Open account → AVAX price fell ~5% in 24 hours amid a broad market pullback, but rising on-chain volume, whale accumulation and growing development activity on Avalanche suggest a potential reversal if key technical support near the 0.75 Fib and the 200 EMA holds. Whales accumulated ~200K AVAX and moved $12M to an exchange wallet On-chain volume rose by $200 million, with DEX trades ≈33% of daily volume Smart contract count tripled year-over-year; total burned AVAX reached 4.8M AVAX price: Avalanche dips 5% as whales buy in; monitor on-chain volume and 200 EMA for reversal—read the latest on-chain data and trading cues. What is driving the AVAX price drop? AVAX price fell roughly 5% in the last 24 hours as the broader crypto market corrected following recent bullish momentum. Short-term selling pressure coincided with profit-taking, while elevated on-chain buying suggests informed accumulation beneath key technical levels. How significant is whale activity on Avalanche? Blockchain analytics show a large whale purchase of about 200,000 AVAX (~$6 million) in 24 hours and a separate transfer of roughly $12 million to a Coinbase wallet. These moves indicate accumulation and potential liquidity rotation. Source: Arkham (data referenced as plain text). Avalanche (AVAX) has seen heightened on-chain engagement despite the price dip. Over the past day, AVAX dropped 5%, extending a weekly decline near 7%. However, the pullback coincided with strong buy-ins that often mark the start of trend reversals when paired with rising activity. Why is on-chain activity rising for Avalanche? On-chain metrics show a $200 million increase in trading volume, pushing cumulative daily volume past significant thresholds. Decentralized exchange (DEX) trades accounted for approximately 33% of the total daily volume, highlighting retail and protocol-level participation. Source: DefiLlama (plain text reference). What development signals support a bullish outlook? Development activity is climbing: the number of smart contracts in Avalanche’s ecosystem has more than tripled year-over-year to over 44 million cumulative contracts. The total burned AVAX hit 4.8 million, with an average burn of ~1,250 tokens per day since mid-July, tightening supply. Will AVAX price reverse and how can traders watch it? Technically, AVAX broke a narrowing rising wedge and fell below the 200 EMA on the four-hour chart. Price is stabilizing near the 0.75 Fibonacci retracement level—often a zone for reversals. Reclaiming the 200 EMA would strengthen a bullish case; failure could lead to a retest of $26 and the recent $22–$26 range. Traders should monitor: 1) reclaim of the 200 EMA, 2) sustained DEX share above ~30%, 3) continued whale accumulation and net burn trends. A blockchain analyst at COINOTAG notes that coordinated on-chain and technical signals increase the probability of a meaningful bounce. How could investors interpret the current data? Short-term traders may view the 0.75 Fib zone as a tactical long opportunity with tight risk management, while longer-term investors should weigh growing development activity and supply burns as constructive fundamentals for Avalanche’s ecosystem growth. Frequently Asked Questions Is AVAX price likely to recover soon? Possible—if AVAX reclaims the 200 EMA and on-chain volume remains elevated, a reversal is plausible. Watch whale accumulation and Fib support for confirmation within the next 1–2 weeks. How much did whales buy and where was the liquidity moved? Arkham data indicated a whale purchased ~200,000 AVAX (~$6M) and another transfer of about $12M was moved into a Coinbase wallet. These actions signal both accumulation and exchange liquidity inflows. What on-chain metrics matter most for AVAX? Key metrics include daily trading volume, DEX share of volume, burn rate, smart contract growth, and large transfer patterns. Combined, they give a clearer picture of demand and network health. Key Takeaways Price action : AVAX slipped ~5% in 24 hours amid a market correction. On-chain strength : $200M uptick in volume and DEX trades ≈33% of total volume. Signals to watch : 200 EMA reclamation, continued whale buys, and burn rate trends. Conclusion AVAX price pulled back through technical support but rising on-chain volume, whale accumulation and growing development activity point to an improving fundamental backdrop. Monitor the 200 EMA and Fib support for reversal confirmation; COINOTAG will update its coverage as fresh data arrives. How to watch AVAX for a potential reversal Check if AVAX reclaims the 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart. Verify DEX volume share remains near or above 30% and total volume stays elevated. Track whale transfers and net burn to confirm sustained demand and reduced supply. Use a stop-loss below the $22–$26 range if entering long on a bounce.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is beginning the Thursday trading day in Asia trading above $123,000, and its chart looks like a rocket trail through the fog, analysts say, painting it as an aggressive rally high powered by ETF inflows, mid-tier accumulation, and a quiet conviction that this isn’t the top yet. That conviction is grounded in three converging signals from major market watchers. In its most recent note , QCP wrote that it sees capital rotating out of overextended AI equities and into “credibility hedges” like gold and Bitcoin as policy uncertainty deepens. Glassnode points to record ETF inflows and mid-tier accumulation flipping resistance into support. And CryptoQuant wrote that it finds on-chain profit-taking still well below historic peaks, suggesting the rally has room to run even as leverage builds. Together, they describe a market that’s structurally bullish but tactically crowded: steady hands underneath, froth on top. But the same data that show conviction also point to complacency. Futures open interest has reached record highs, funding rates are above 8%, and a call-heavy options positioning leaves the market vulnerable to a sharp decline if momentum fades. Analysts call it a classic “strong trend, weak hands” setup: one that often needs a leverage reset before the next leg higher. “The current pullback is now testing this leverage, helping to reset positioning and restore balance,” wrote Glassnode in its weekly report. QCP Capital added that “yesterday’s move lower looked like positioning, not policy,” while CryptoQuant observed that “profit-taking remains subdued compared to previous market tops.” Yet even among the data desks, the message isn’t uniform. Glassnode warns that leverage needs to be flushed before the rally can stabilize; CryptoQuant argues the market still has breathing room before euphoria sets in; and QCP frames the move as a macro rotation into “credibility hedges” like gold and BTC. Bitcoin’s climb is being watched from three different altitudes. With funding rates high and open interest still climbing, traders may get the reset they’ve been warning about. The question isn’t whether Bitcoin can hold $120,000, it’s whether the next dip will prove the rally’s depth or expose its fragility. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $123,000, steady after rebounding from this week’s pullback as ETF inflows and whale accumulation continue to support prices. While short-term momentum has cooled, institutional demand and the broader “debasement trade” narrative keep the uptrend intact heading into October’s seasonally bullish period. ETH: Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,516, holding steady after recent volatility as traders rotate back into major layer-1 assets. Sentiment remains supported by strong ETF inflows, optimism ahead of December’s Fusaka upgrade, and renewed institutional interest in staking and DeFi yields. Gold: Gold surged past $4,000 for the first time Wednesday, its 40th record high this year, driven by geopolitical tensions, U.S. fiscal uncertainty, and sustained central bank demand led by China’s eleventh consecutive month of gold purchases Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.1% Thursday, led by a 10% surge in SoftBank after it agreed to buy ABB’s robotics unit for $5.4 billion, as optimism over Prime Minister-elect Sanae Takaichi’s expansionist agenda and continued loose monetary policy fueled gains across tech and cyclical stocks.

It is the asset’s best year-to-date run in more than forty-five years, according to data from CoinGecko, which shows just how much blockchain-based versions of the metal have grown in circulation. Since January, the number of wallets holding tokenized gold has climbed by 53%, according to rwa.xyz. At the same time, supply has surged, with Tether Gold up 52% and Paxos Gold rising 50%. These tokens are designed to represent ownership of physical gold, but traded as crypto. Investors load into tokenized gold as fiat weakens The rally is part of what analysts call the debasement trade. Since the start of the year, gold has gained 54%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 31% climb. Tom Bailey, head of research at HANetf, said, “Gold is on track for its strongest annual performance since 1979. Mounting fiscal strains across developed economies are raising questions about long-term debt sustainability.” Bailey was pointing to the value erosion in currencies such as the US dollar. Governments have expanded deficits and printed more money, while inflation has run above target levels. That has led investors to buy gold and Bitcoin, assets seen as a safer way to protect wealth. Political events have also added fuel. The election of Sanae Takaichi as Japan’s prime minister boosted the trend. She supports more public spending and tax cuts, a policy mix seen as negative for the yen. Investors are betting those steps will weaken Japan’s currency and push more demand toward gold and Bitcoin. Gold rally brings tokenization into focus The record-breaking price run is encouraging both traditional and crypto investors to look at gold in new ways. Timo Lehes, co-founder of Swarm, said, “Every new all-time high brings renewed interest to an asset and gold’s breakout is no exception. We’re seeing clear momentum toward real-world assets becoming a backbone of onchain finance.” One of the key features of tokenized gold is its use in decentralized finance. Holders can deploy it on networks such as Ethereum, giving the commodity more utility beyond storage. Even with this expansion, the market for tokenized gold remains small compared to traditional investment vehicles. Gold ETFs still dominate, holding $461 billion in assets this year, and recording inflows of $64 billion, figures released by the World Gold Council show. The trend has also been tied to wider economic fears. Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, chief investment officer at XBTO and a former BlackRock and JPMorgan executive, said the so-called debasement trade has made crypto products clear winners. The recent government shutdown reignited concerns about fiat stability, sending money toward both Bitcoin and tokenized precious metals. Meanwhile, Bitcoin set a new all-time high this week, briefly touching $126,200 before pulling back near $123,200. The crypto has added about 30% year-to-date. But the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio now sits at 31.6, down from above 40 in December 2024, showing that gold has been the stronger performer in recent months. Equity markets have also rallied at the same time. The S&P 500 reached 6,753 points, setting a fresh record even as alternative assets climbed. Tokenized gold products remain unique. Each token is backed by physical gold held in secure vaults, while giving investors the portability and divisibility of crypto. The model combines the characteristics of a commodity that has stood the test of time with the technology powering today’s markets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

52871709,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=831356,1759973936,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52871709.jpeg,Bitwise sets 0.20% fee for Solana staking ETF,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitwise-sets-0-20-fee-for-solana-staking-etf/,"Bitwise Asset Management announced its planned Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) will charge a fee of 0.20%, in the latest salvo by the firm to undercut competitors and attract investor dollars. The move comes as asset managers rush to secure U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for several crypto-based ETFs, amid a volatile regulatory environment. Bitwise announced Wednesday that its upcoming Solana Staking ETF will carry a 0.20% management fee—significantly lower than many expected. Observers of the industry view this move as a well-thought-out one that will solidify Bitwise’s position ahead of other market participants in a business where being cost-effective is key to attracting fund inflows. At 0.20%, the proposed fee would align Bitwise’s Solana ETF with its previous Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , which also charge approximately the same rate. This parity between digital asset classes suggests that Bitwise aims to create an investable vehicle for both institutional and retail investors in Solana, a fast-growing blockchain renowned for its scalability and low fees. Should it be approved, the fund may create new avenues for traditional investors to access exposure to Solana’s staking rewards without having to manage the tokens themselves, according to analysts. Staking allows holders to earn yield by supporting blockchain network operations, a hallmark that may add to the longer-term appeal. Market competition intensifies amid SEC delays The filing, however, comes at a sensitive juncture. Last week’s government shutdown in the U.S. has put several normally functioning operations at the SEC on hold, pending decisions regarding certain ETFs. The agency’s contingency plan suggests that only a limited number of staff members are still available to address pressing issues, leaving firms with uncertainty about whether any approvals will be forthcoming. This lag is beginning to have an impact on a growing list of applications, with more than two dozen crypto-related ETF proposals awaiting approval. Among these are products linked to assets including Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC) and Solana (SOL), indicating that traditional finance has an appetite for decentralized tech. The overall ETF market has been heating up since the SEC sanctioned spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, and then Ethereum ETFs a few months later. Those approvals, following a seminal court decision in favour of the Grayscale Investments fund, led to a shift in how regulators and supervision of digital assets is viewed in the U.S. If the Solana ETF is approved, it could be yet another step in that evolution. In the meantime, 21Shares unveiled improvements to its 21Shares Ethereum ETF product, including the introduction of staking and a one-year waiver of the sponsor fee. The firm referred to the move as the natural evolution of Ethereum investment products in the U.S. market, providing investors with exposure to yield generation that leverages a regulated ETF structure. Bitwise boosts its footprint in crypto finance Bitwise’s low fee is the latest move in a series of strategic efforts that solidify Bitwise’s position as a leading industry player among crypto index providers and ETF managers. The firm, based in San Francisco, has been a vocal advocate for clear regulatory frameworks and user-friendly products that help bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance. By charging one of the lowest fees among digital asset ETFs, Bitwise is betting on scale. This could be a successful play if more institutional investors, financial advisors and retail traders ultimately want broad crypto exposure when the SEC leaves the building. Regulatory hurdles remain, but investors continue to be enthusiastic about the growth of Solana’s network and its staking opportunity. If approved, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF would be a bellwether product for crypto-curious investors seeking to enter the market through traditional, regulated products. Get seen where it counts.

Holiday data showed that households were tightening their belts, opting for cheaper road trips instead of flights, while box office revenues fell short of expectations. The spending pullback comes as demand for AI talent surges, propelling global tech stocks to record highs even as China’s markets briefly paused and companies deepened ties with AI firms like OpenAI. Chinese traders initiate a search for hints on policy changes in the market During the Chinese market closure , a measure of major mainland stocks listed in Hong Kong dropped by 0.3%, with the offshore yuan declining slightly. Regarding the situation , traders are looking for clues on policy changes ahead of the Communist Party’s meeting, scheduled to take place from October 20 to 23. In this meeting, officials will discuss plans to be implemented over the next five years. Another factor that sparks hope for a solution is a potential meeting between US President Donald Trump and the President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping. The meeting is anticipated to take place at the November APEC summit in South Korea. Analysts project that this could have an impact if tariff talks start again. Xin-Yao Ng, an Investment Director and Fund Manager at Aberdeen Investments, commented on the topic of discussion, stating that he was not pleased with the early data for tourism during the holidays. He predicted that the data would remain about the same or decrease unless new and more accurate information is released later. The fund manager made these remarks regarding the opening of the mainland stock market. In the meantime, reliable sources have highlighted that the CSI 300 Index has increased for five consecutive months through September, marking its prolonged success since 2017. The heightened excitement over chip stocks has mainly triggered this increase after DeepSeek introduced a new model and Huawei Technologies Co. announced its intention to double production of its top AI chips. Following this, Ian Samson, a Multi Asset Portfolio Manager at Fidelity International in Singapore, pointed out that at one point, if fast-growing Chinese firms, particularly in the internet sector, can achieve their earnings expectations, investors view them as very appealing compared to other firms globally. Weak consumer spending in China raises concerns in the market Spending during Golden Week suggested that consumers are cautious with their money. According to sources, people continued to spend on travel and experiences, but box office and airline demand were not as robust as anticipated. In addition, shares of movie stocks, such as Maoyan Entertainment and Damai Entertainment Holdings Ltd., declined sharply in Hong Kong after Citigroup highlighted low ticket sales. Travellers, on the other hand, began moving away from air and rail to road trips, and the number of highway passengers in private cars rose 6% compared to last year during Golden Week, according to Morgan Stanley. This was after data from the Ministry of Transport showed that total passenger traffic was approximately 7% higher over the first seven days than it was last year. This percentage reflected a decrease from the 8% increase observed during May’s five-day Labour Day holiday. Regarding the situation, analysts at Julius Baer stated that the Golden Week results indicate that consumer spending in China remains weak, and this will likely add to the pressure on investors to sell off their shares in consumer good-related stocks Get seen where it counts.

Recent chart analysis indicates that Dogecoin’s dominance may be on the verge of a significant breakout, a move that could translate into stronger upward momentum for its price. Analysts believe Dogecoin’s current chart setup is similar to previous major bullish cycles, making this a critical period for traders. Dogecoin Dominance Breakout To Ignite Fresh Rally Dogecoin‘s dominance has spent nearly three and a half years in a controlled downtrend, beginning in 2021, and finally breaking out of this major resistance in late 2024. According to crypto analyst EtherNasyonal on X social media, the market experienced its first key breakout in November 2024, with a successful retest taking place in June 2025. More recently, a minor downtrend also broke out and retested, signaling growing strength in DOGE’s market position . The accompanying chart shows a “bullish pin bar” on the retest, which EtherNasyonal emphasized is a classic sign of trend reversal and strong buying momentum . This aligns with the growing dominance curve projected well into 2026, potentially positioning DOGE to capture a larger share of the overall crypto market capitalization. If the dominance continues its current trajectory, the analyst expects it to move from 0.95% dominance to almost 5.5%, an increase that could trigger an explosive price action. EtherNasyonal also reiterated Dogecoin’s unique history and growth in the crypto space. In a previous post, he noted that what began as a light-hearted meme has now evolved into a global financial and cultural phenomenon. According to the analyst, a single image of a Shiba Inu has evolved into a movement built on community, humour, and accessibility. He also stated that when SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk first embraced Dogecoin, the coin’s profile skyrocketed. He mentioned that Musk’s lighthearted tweets gave Dogecoin an identity, transforming it from meme to movement. He further added that the meme coin now stands on a more mature foundation, with a loyal global community and integration with various exchange platforms. DOGE Resistance Battle Could Define Its Next Move For months, Dogecoin has repeatedly tested the $0.25-$0.28 resistance zone but has so far failed to break through. Crypto market analyst Matt Hughes pointed out that the current price structure is showing a tightening consolidation near $0.24, indicating growing momentum beneath the surface and signaling that the cryptocurrency may be gearing up for a breakout . The analyst noted that a decisive push above $0.27 could trigger a sharp rally toward the final target of $0.36 or higher.

Ripple native token, XRP, is on the forefront with new institutional adoption, whereas Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) are still rising in popularity as the ecosystem is expanding. Analysts also identified MAGACOIN FINANCE, an Ethereum-based presale project, as one of the most promising altcoins to buy ahead of the Q4 rally . XRP ETF Speculation on the Rise XRP remains at the center of market speculation as seven spot ETF applications await U.S. SEC decisions this October. These filings from major asset managers like BlackRock and Grayscale could unlock over $5 billion in capital inflows if approved. XRP is trading at an average of $3, and it has a 35% monthly increase as major investors accumulate the asset before any regulation milestones. On-chain data indicates that whales have accumulated more than 160 million XRP , worth 1.5 billion in the last 30 days, which indicates confidence in a breakout. The price is currently trading in an ascending triangle pattern with the key resistance of $3.12 to $3.30 . A successful breakout above this zone could pave the way toward $5.00 , according to analysts. Technically, XRP has a good bullish momentum. The 50-day moving average, which is at the moment close to $2.93 , is in favor of an uptrend, while the derivatives data show an increase in open interest which leads to greater involvement in the market. With such trends and ETF expectations, XRP is becoming considered one of the best altcoins to buy before Q4. The quest by Ripple to receive a federal banking charter at the Office of the Comptroller in the United States is also a credible addition. Provided the approvals are made, Ripple may be a regulated entity providing settlement and custody services in XRP. Cardano Price Strengthens as Market Recovers Cardano (ADA) continues to attract investor attention as its ecosystem expands through new DeFi and governance initiatives . ADA price has rebounded from the $0.75 level, with bullish analysts forecasting a possible move toward $3.29 and $3.74 if the uptrend sustains. Moreover, the Cardano Foundation’s 2025 roadmap outlines a major liquidity fund and venture initiatives worth over 200 million ADA to support the growth of Web3. Analysts highlight that ADA’s chart mirrors the 2020–2021 bull run structure, suggesting another parabolic cycle may be near. Institutional participation has also grown, with Hashdex confirming ADA’s inclusion in its Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. This move is expected to introduce fresh liquidity. With these developments, Cardano ranks among the best altcoins to buy this quarter . Amid this optimism, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as another key name drawing investor attention for Q4 positioning. AVAX Price Bullish Flag Signals $108 Target Avalanche (AVAX) is forming a bullish flag pattern on the monthly chart, signaling a potential breakout toward $108 . The token currently consolidates near $30 , supported by a threefold surge in developer activity, with over 44 million contracts deployed in the past year. This growth underscores Avalanche’s rising prominence as a leading smart contract network. Analysts identify $32–$35 as the breakout zone, beyond which bulls could drive AVAX toward the $50–$100 range . AVAXUSD 1-Month Chart | Source: X Liquidity on Avalanche’s network now exceeds $950 billion , approaching the $1 trillion milestone. This deep on-chain activity suggests institutional confidence, strengthening the long-term bullish case. While established altcoins like AVAX show solid upside potential, presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being recognized by analysts as the best crypto presales with significant ROI potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst Picks of Best Altcoin to Buy in Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE , an Ethereum-based presale project, has raised over $15.5 million from 18,000+ investors, positioning itself as one of the most trusted new altcoins in 2025. Backed by successful audits from HashEx and an ongoing Certik review , the project is drawing attention for its verified smart contract, and fast-growing investor community. Whales and analysts have also begun referencing MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside XRP and Cardano in major reports, a rare crossover for a presale-stage token. This inclusion signals strong market credibility and early recognition among institutional and retail players. The project’s momentum is further supported by limited-time presale bonuses and rising holder numbers, with experts predicting 100x potential ROI post-exchange listing. Combining Ethereum’s reliability , community engagement, and strong audit credentials, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the best altcoin to buy before Q4 for investors seeking early-stage growth. Conclusion With the market preparing to make ETF decisions and wider institutional inflows, top assets, such as XRP, Cardano, and AVAX , are positioned to have breakouts in Q4. MAGACOIN FINANCE is, however, a proven, high-growing presale with huge upside potential. To investors planning on investing in the 2025 bull cycle, the most desirable altcoin to buy prior to Q4 run is this Ethereum-based project.

After weeks of volatility and record-breaking highs, BTC now faces a pivotal test — it must either reclaim its all-time highs and enter a new phase of price discovery, or continue its correction to establish a stronger base of consolidation around current levels. The market appears finely balanced, with traders watching closely for signs of direction. Related Reading: Grayscale Stakes 32,000 Ethereum Worth $150 Million – Institutional Demand Grows Recent onchain data highlights a surge in new buyers, marking one of the strongest inflows of fresh capital seen in months. This trend suggests renewed bullish momentum, as investors increasingly view Bitcoin’s current range as an opportunity rather than a peak. According to key metrics, the supply held by short-term holders has grown substantially, reflecting the entry of new participants eager to ride the next major impulse. While short-term volatility remains a concern, analysts agree that the underlying structure of the market remains strongly bullish. As long as Bitcoin holds above its major support zones, the stage could be set for another breakout — one that propels the asset beyond its previous highs and into uncharted territory once again. Short-Term Holders Signal a New Phase for Bitcoin Top analyst Axel Adler shared key insights revealing that over the past quarter, short-term holders’ supply has increased by 559,000 BTC, climbing from a low of 4.38 million to 4.94 million BTC. This rise marks a clear influx of new participants entering the market, a pattern often seen during the early stages of bullish expansions. The growth in short-term holder supply suggests that fresh demand is building up — as new investors accumulate Bitcoin, older coins are redistributed, creating a healthier market structure. Historically, periods of rising short-term holder activity have coincided with momentum shifts, as fresh liquidity enters the system and fuels upward volatility. This dynamic reflects renewed market confidence following Bitcoin’s recent push to new all-time highs. More importantly, it shows that retail and short-term investors are re-engaging, positioning for what many analysts expect to be the next major impulse in the cycle. While some caution that high short-term holder activity can also lead to faster profit-taking and volatility, the broader outlook remains constructive. With long-term holders maintaining strong conviction and institutions continuing to accumulate, the combination of new inflows and resilient fundamentals supports a bullish continuation setup. Adler notes that this expansion in short-term supply typically precedes a new phase of market acceleration, as liquidity and optimism return in tandem. If Bitcoin manages to reclaim and sustain levels above its previous all-time high, the growing base of active short-term investors could provide the momentum needed for another breakout. In short, the data suggests that the market isn’t exhausted — it’s recharging, setting the stage for the next leg of the bull cycle.

The 12-hour chart highlights that BTC has entered a consolidation phase following its explosive breakout, with the $120,000–$121,000 range now acting as a short-term support zone. The yellow line at $117,500, a previous resistance from earlier in the cycle, continues to serve as a key structural level that could define the next move. The blue 50-period moving average is trending upward, reinforcing bullish momentum, while the 200-period moving average remains far below the current price, confirming that Bitcoin is still in a strong uptrend. Despite the recent correction, the price structure remains constructive — higher highs and higher lows continue to form, suggesting that bulls are maintaining control.

Overall, this chart reflects a healthy cooldown after an aggressive rally, allowing momentum indicators to reset. As long as BTC holds above its key supports, the broader trend remains firmly bullish, setting the stage for another attempt toward price discovery.

Open account → Bitcoin ETF inflows are forecast to hit a record in Q4 as higher BTC prices and broadened access for advisers drive demand. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says strong price momentum and renewed institutional adoption make Bitcoin ETF inflows the key catalyst for more capital entering BTC in Q4. Record Q4 inflows forecast Analysts see steady upward momentum in Bitcoin price with low short-term volatility. Bitcoin ETFs attracted $22.5B in the first nine months; Q4 flows could set a new annual record. Bitcoin ETF inflows predicted to peak in Q4 — Bitcoin ETF inflows front and center; read expert analysis and next steps for investors. What are the latest forecasts for Bitcoin ETF inflows? Bitcoin ETF inflows are expected to surge in Q4, with Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicting record quarterly net flows driven by higher BTC prices and wider adviser adoption. The first nine months saw $22.5 billion in ETF inflows, signaling momentum that could push full-year ETF flows to new highs. How is Bitcoin’s price momentum shaping ETF demand? Bitcoin’s price recently reached a new peak above $126,000 while technical indicators show balanced upward momentum. CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain notes a 30-day moving average near $116,000 and relatively low 30-day standard deviation of about $4,540, suggesting compressed volatility that often precedes strong price moves. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Bitcoin’s growth ratio has been on an upward trajectory since May 2024. Source: CryptoQuant Analysts observe that Bitcoin typically reaches cycle peaks within roughly 600 days after halving events. If that historical cadence holds, BTC is in a critical window that has previously produced major bull-market tops, yet current momentum indicators do not yet show classic overbought signals. Why does Bitwise expect record inflows in Q4? Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan attributes the forecast to three key drivers: rising Bitcoin prices, increasing adviser access to ETFs, and macro conditions favoring assets that perform well amid US dollar weakness. Hougan argues that higher prices attract media and investor attention, which tends to amplify ETF demand. What are the recent ETF flow figures and outlook? US Bitcoin ETFs logged $22.5 billion in inflows during the first nine months of the year. Hougan noted ETFs took in $3.5 billion in the first four trading days of Q4, putting momentum on pace to exceed prior annual totals such as the $36 billion seen in the launch year. Gold (blue) and Bitcoin (orange) ETF inflows by year since launch. Source: Bitwise How are wealth managers and advisers influencing flows? Hougan highlights that large wealth managers opening access to Bitcoin ETFs will materially expand the investor base. A recent Morgan Stanley report (plain text reference) indicated advisers are increasingly able to allocate to cryptocurrency, with suggested allocations for risk-tolerant clients up to 4% in multi-asset portfolios. That adviser adoption, combined with year-end client reviews that favor showing top-performing holdings, creates a practical pathway for significant year-end buying into Bitcoin ETFs. Frequently Asked Questions Will Q4 ETF inflows push Bitcoin to a new all-time high? ETF inflows can provide sustained demand that supports higher prices, but price moves also depend on liquidity, macro conditions and miner behavior. Analysts say current momentum and inflows increase the probability of further upside, not guarantee it. How much did US Bitcoin ETFs attract so far this year? US Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $22.5 billion in inflows through the first nine months, with early Q4 net flows around $3.5 billion in the first four trading days. Are Bitcoin’s technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions? Technical metrics referenced by analysts show Bitcoin below classic overbought thresholds, with a steady 30-day moving average and compressed volatility—conditions that often precede larger directional moves if liquidity supports them. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will Q4 ETF inflows push Bitcoin to a new all-time high?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ETF inflows can support higher prices, but outcomes also depend on liquidity and macro factors.

Adviser adoption matters : Broader access through wealth managers can amplify year-end flows and investor allocations. Conclusion Bitcoin ETF inflows are positioned to be the dominant demand driver in Q4 as BTC price momentum and adviser access converge. Industry figures such as Matt Hougan of Bitwise and market data highlight a scenario where ETFs could absorb substantial capital before year-end. Investors should monitor net flows, technical indicators, and adviser adoption when evaluating positioning. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Smarter tools. Better decisions.

The Bitcoin four-year cycle is a historical observation tying the interval from a cycle low to a halving with an equal interval from halving to cycle high. Traders use this pattern to estimate peak windows, but the pattern is descriptive—not a guaranteed predictor. How did Peter Brandt interpret the cycle this week? Veteran trader Peter Brandt noted Bitcoin’s cycle low on Nov. 9, 2022, occurred 533 days before the April 20, 2024 halving. Adding 533 days to that halving places a critical window in early October 2025, which aligns with recent strong price action above prior highs.

Open futures account → Bitcoin is trading at $122,070 at the time of publication, up 9.74% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Why could deviation from the cycle be dramatic? Market trends that break long-observed cyclic patterns often produce outsized moves. If Bitcoin fails to respect the four-year symmetry, traders and algorithms recalibrating positions can amplify volatility. What are other analysts saying about timing and targets? Several analysts and market participants offer varied projections. Some models indicate a substantial chance Bitcoin could exceed $140,000 in short windows. Other voices have suggested targets ranging up to $250,000 by the end of 2025, reflecting divergent assumptions on liquidity and adoption. When did Bitcoin hit its recent all-time high? Bitcoin set a new all-time high above $126,100 on Monday following the crucial cycle date over the weekend. Observers point to that move as confirmation of continued price discovery, provided the advance sustains itself beyond short-term corrections. How should traders and investors act on the cycle? Prudent market participants combine cycle analysis with risk management: set clear position limits, monitor volatility indicators, and incorporate macro signals such as ETF flows and institutional treasury allocations. Betting solely on cycle symmetry ignores evolving market structure. Frequently Asked Questions Does the four-year cycle guarantee price targets? No. The cycle provides timing context based on historical patterns but does not guarantee price levels. Structural shifts—like ETF adoption or corporate treasuries—can alter outcomes. Can cycles change suddenly? Yes. Cycles can evolve as market participants, products, and regulations change, which is why many analysts treat the pattern as one input among many. Key Takeaways Historical symmetry: Bitcoin’s pre- and post-halving intervals have matched in past cycles, making timing windows useful for planning. Not infallible: Deviations from the cycle can cause dramatic volatility; combine cycle insights with risk controls. Data-driven approach: Use volume, open interest, and macro indicators alongside cycle projections to form balanced views. Conclusion The Bitcoin four-year cycle remains a meaningful reference point for traders and analysts, but it should be integrated with contemporary data and sound risk management. COINOTAG will continue monitoring on-chain metrics, institutional flows, and expert commentary to update readers as conditions evolve. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Smarter tools.

Bitcoin attempts to flip $123K into support as analysts project a 20–30% rally, backed by strong on-chain data and rising activity. By COINOTAG | Published: October 7, 2025 | Updated: October 7, 2025 How is Bitcoin price attempting to flip $123K into support? Bitcoin price is testing its prior ATH region near $123,000 and forming higher lows, with traders watching for multiple weekly closes above that level. Technical momentum and on‑chain strength suggest that holding $123K would increase the probability of a 20–30% rally toward $130K–$133K. What is the technical outlook for BTC as it tests $123K? BTC rebounded from the $121,000 support zone and consolidated around $123,000. Technical indicators show strong buying momentum and a cleared descending trendline from August–September. Analysts emphasize that a few weekly closes above $123K are needed to confirm the next bullish phase. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → $BTC is now trying to flip its previous ATH into support. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a fakeout below it, but overall a few weekly close above $123K is needed. This will set the stage for the next 20%-30% rally in the coming weeks. — BitBull (@AkaBull_) October 7, 2025 The breakout above $123,000 followed months of consolidation and repeated rejections. Market behavior indicates recovery momentum supported by stronger buying pressure and consistent liquidity inflows across major exchanges. Traders are monitoring weekly closes and order‑flow at $120K–$124K ranges for confirmation of continuation. Source: KamranAsghar (X) Market quote: Kamran Asghar: “BTC is a ticking clock. The breakout above $124,500 is the trigger for $130,000.” Recent trading indicates support near $120,800–$121,500 and upward targets around $126,000–$128,000. What on-chain data supports a potential Bitcoin rally? On‑chain data is currently aligned with bullish price structure. CryptoQuant metrics show 99.4% of circulating BTC in profit, indicating historically high realized gains for holders. This level of profitability typically coincides with elevated market participation and the potential for volatile upside moves. Which participation metrics matter most? Key metrics to monitor include active addresses, TVL in DeFi, exchange flows, and 24‑hour trading volume. DeFi TVL, active address counts, and large inflows to exchanges can collectively indicate stronger demand from both retail and institutional segments. Source: DeFiLlama DeFi TVL stands at approximately $8.952 billion, showing continued ecosystem growth. Active addresses are near 767,705, while 24‑hour trading volumes have exceeded $70.9 billion (CoinMarketCap data). These metrics reflect heightened engagement across the network. What are the key price levels and analyst targets? Analysts cite short‑term resistance between $126K and $128K and medium targets of $130K–$133K. A confirmed flip of $123K to support with follow‑through volume would increase the probability of reaching those targets. Price levels and targets Level Range / Target Significance Support test $120,800–$121,500 Immediate on‑chain support zone Flip level $123,000 Confirmation needed via weekly closes Near target $126,000–$128,000 First resistance cluster Medium target $130,000–$133,000 Analyst target area Frequently Asked Questions How likely is a 20–30% rally if $123K holds? If Bitcoin holds $123K on multiple weekly closes, probability for a 20–30% rally rises materially. Confirmation requires sustained volume and continued on‑chain strength alongside reduced liquidation risk for short positions. How can traders monitor confirmation signals? Watch for: 1) multiple weekly closes above $123K, 2) rising on‑chain inflows and active addresses, 3) strengthening exchange order books. These signals together increase confidence in breakout sustainability. Key Takeaways Support flip is pivotal : Holding $123K on weekly closes increases odds of a 20–30% rally. On‑chain strength : 99.4% of BTC supply is in profit, indicating broad holder gains. Watch volume and liquidity : Rising exchange activity and TVL suggest growing participation; monitor weekly closes and order flow. Conclusion Bitcoin price is at a critical juncture as it attempts to flip $123K into support. Front‑loaded on‑chain data and technical structure support a bullish case, but confirmation requires multiple weekly closes above $123K and sustained volume. Traders should monitor levels, on‑chain metrics, and exchange liquidity for next steps. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-flip-123k-support"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Attempts to Flip $123K into Support, Analysts Eye 20–30% Rally"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-111.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" }, ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin attempts to flip $123K into support as on-chain metrics and exchange activity point to a potential 20–30% rally; traders watch weekly closes for confirmation.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How is Bitcoin price attempting to flip $123K into support?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bitcoin is testing its prior ATH near $123,000 and forming higher lows; multiple weekly closes above this level would signal a confirmed flip and increase the chance of a 20–30% rally."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on‑chain metrics support a potential rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key metrics include 99.4% of circulating supply in profit, rising active addresses, DeFi TVL near $8.952B, and elevated 24h trading volumes above $70B."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor Bitcoin's flip of $123K"", ""description"": ""Step‑by‑step checklist to validate whether BTC has flipped $123K into support."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm weekly closes"", ""text"": ""Wait for at least two weekly closes above $123,000 to reduce false breakouts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check on‑chain profitability"", ""text"": ""Verify that a high percentage of circulating supply remains in profit; elevated profitability supports holding momentum."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor volume and liquidity"", ""text"": ""Ensure daily trading volume and exchange order book depth rise alongside price to confirm demand."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch nearby resistance"", ""text"": ""Track price reaction at $126K–$128K and evaluate strength before assuming medium targets of $130K–$133K."" } ]} COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Smarter tools.

Interestingly, while BNB’s institutional strength continues to impress, retail investors are increasingly shifting their attention toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-rising project that many believe could deliver extraordinary long-term returns thanks to its robust roadmap and consistent growth momentum. According to data from CryptoQuant , BNB’s rally has been fueled by powerful on-chain signals. Over the past quarter, its Futures Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) has shown a clear buy-side dominance, with aggressive accumulation visible since May 2025. The token’s price has surged nearly 30% in a week, pushing its market capitalization to almost $183 billion. Analysts say this growth is a direct result of deflationary mechanics, liquidity concentration, and institutional adoption, all of which have transformed BNB from a simple exchange token into a key player bridging Web3 and traditional finance. Institutional Liquidity and Deflation Mechanics BNB’s rise is closely tied to Binance’s growing share of market liquidity. Data shows that Binance now holds roughly 60% of all stablecoin reserves across exchanges, with total reserves exceeding $50 billion. This dominance gives the exchange unmatched control over liquidity flows – a critical advantage during bullish phases. Combined with its ongoing token burn program, which steadily reduces supply, BNB’s value proposition continues to strengthen. Experts note that this unique mix of scarcity and institutional credibility has allowed BNB to outperform most large-cap assets. Its seamless integration into DeFi platforms, payment systems, and cross-chain applications has expanded its utility, while long-term investors increasingly view it as a cornerstone of a diversified crypto portfolio. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The New Favorite for Explosive ROI As BNB consolidates its dominance, new capital from retail traders is flowing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has become one of the most talked-about presale projects of 2025. Known for its exceptional growth trajectory and rapid sellouts in early rounds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already drawn comparisons to the early days of SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN. However, what sets it apart is its focus on stability, continuous development, and long-term ecosystem expansion – qualities that are attracting both retail and early institutional interest. Analysts say that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s roadmap is designed to deliver real, sustainable growth rather than short-term hype. With its current presale rounds nearing completion and growing visibility across social media platforms, projections suggest that returns exceeding 20,000% could be within reach if momentum continues at its current pace. This combination of limited access, strong community backing, and clear tokenomics has positioned it as a standout altcoin for investors building their long-term portfolios. BNB’s Broader Market Impact BNB’s record-breaking run has also lifted sentiment across the broader crypto market. Its steady climb signals a renewed appetite for exchange-linked assets and a wider resurgence in altcoin liquidity. The strong price action has encouraged traders to revisit other high-quality tokens with similar growth structures, further fueling optimism that the current rally could extend into Q4 2025. Analysts highlight that BNB’s fundamentals – from its deflationary model to its deep liquidity base – provide a roadmap for other projects aiming to achieve sustainable, long-term value. This success has also created a halo effect that benefits innovative new tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is capturing attention for combining scalability, token utility, and early-mover potential in a fast-growing ecosystem. Looking Ahead The combination of BNB’s institutional strength and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive growth story perfectly reflects today’s evolving crypto market. BNB stands as proof that solid fundamentals and deflationary design can create enduring value, while MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the next frontier for investors seeking the kind of upside that once defined early-stage legends.

This movement among treasuries often serves as a leading signal of shifting sentiment within the broader ETH ecosystem. A Look At The Data Behind Ethereum On-Chain Recovery In a subtle shift that suggests the broader market may be stabilizing, Ethereum treasury stocks are beginning to flash early signs of reversal. Despite these encouraging signals, Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH). Investor Ted Pillows pointed out on X that the institutional interest will only return once the charts show sustained momentum over several weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Store-of-Value Evolution: From Utility Token To Digital Reserve Asset Ted believes that for ETH to reclaim its ATH and hinges on capital inflow, it requires the same kind of large-scale liquidity injection the network experienced in July and August, which are critical to fueling the next leg higher. SharpLink Gaming Inc., a prominent corporate holder of ETH, has reported strong compounding returns from its treasury strategy asset. In the past week alone, the company generated 451 ETH in staking rewards, which is utilized through both liquid and native staking. Since the launch of its ETH treasury strategy on June 2, 2025, SharpLink’s total cumulative ETH staking rewards have now reached an impressive 4,723 ETH. According to the company, 100% continuous generation of yield is the amount of its ETH treasury, which is currently generating approximately $370,000 worth of ETH every day, showcasing ETH’s unique ability to generate yield while maintaining liquidity. SharpLink highlighted this as the reason the altcoin stands out as a superior treasury asset, which is productive, yield-bearing, and constantly compounding in value. Despite the strong performance, the firm confirmed there were no new ETH purchases or stock buybacks over the past week, which means there won’t be a new press release for now. The company’s focus remains clear: “the asset is ETH, and the ticker is SBET,” SharpLink noted. Ethereum Market Share Is Moving Exactly As Scripted Technical analyst Umair Crypto has noted that Ethereum dominance is currently at a critical juncture, having completed the first half of a projected move and now setting the stage for the second half. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces TD Sell Signal At Key Resistance—$4,100 Next? This view anticipates a rejection from the current resistance area on the dominance chart toward the lower level for ETH Dominance, which will likely lead to a price correction where the next bounce for ETH will form. Umair concluded that the altcoin itself could experience a short-term correction once the move unfolds before reclaiming momentum for the next leg higher.

52876128,601671,1759978859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52876128.jpeg,Binance Smart Chain Dominates 24H Activity – $6.05B DEX Volume And $5.57M Fees,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-smart-chain-dominates-activity-dex-volume/,"Binance is celebrating a major milestone as BNB reaches new all-time highs around $1,350, marking another chapter in the exchange’s dominance. The price of BNB has surged over 55% since early September, fueled by strong momentum across the broader crypto market. With this latest rally, BNB has overtaken XRP to become the third most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now standing at $182.1 billion. The surge comes amid renewed enthusiasm around Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which continues to outperform other networks in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity. Data shows that BSC ranks #1 across all chains, recording billions in daily volume, with PancakeSwap — its flagship DEX — leading the charge. This on-chain strength highlights Binance’s deep ecosystem advantage, combining network efficiency, liquidity, and user engagement at scale. Analysts attribute BNB’s performance not only to speculative demand but also to real ecosystem growth. As transaction fees, user activity, and staking metrics rise, confidence in Binance’s ecosystem continues to grow. With market sentiment improving and altcoins showing strength, many see BNB’s breakout as a signal of the next phase of the bull cycle, positioning Binance at the center of crypto’s expanding momentum. BSC Dominates As Binance Narrative Gains Strength According to Lookonchain, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) continues to dominate the crypto landscape, ranking #1 among all blockchains in both decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and chain fees. Over the past 24 hours alone, BSC recorded more than $6.05 billion in DEX trading volume and $5.57 million in transaction fees, surpassing competitors like Ethereum and Solana by a wide margin. This surge in activity coincides with BNB’s strong performance, which recently broke into new all-time highs around $1,350. The token’s rise has reignited enthusiasm around Binance’s expanding ecosystem, reflecting renewed confidence in its scalability and utility. Analysts note that this growth underscores Binance’s position as a central player in the next wave of crypto adoption — combining high transaction throughput, competitive fees, and an increasingly diverse network of DeFi applications. The Binance narrative has been gaining momentum across the market as investors recognize the growing impact of BSC’s ecosystem. Projects built on BSC, including PancakeSwap, are attracting significant liquidity, while daily user activity continues to climb. This consistent onchain growth highlights how Binance’s infrastructure supports sustainable demand, even in volatile market conditions. As BNB leads altcoins into new highs, its ecosystem metrics validate the rally’s fundamentals. Increased trading activity, elevated chain fees, and network expansion all signal healthy organic growth, not just speculative hype. With Binance Smart Chain maintaining the top position in DEX volume and user engagement, the data points to a clear shift in market dominance — one driven by Binance’s unique blend of innovation, liquidity depth, and community scale. If this momentum continues, BSC and BNB could define the next leg of the altcoin bull market. BNB Reaches Parabolic Phase With Record Momentum BNB is showing one of its strongest performances in years, with the weekly chart confirming a parabolic breakout above all previous highs. The token surged to $1,349 before slightly cooling to around $1,313, marking a 12.5% weekly gain and extending its rally that began near $850 just weeks ago. This move represents a 55% rise since early September, firmly placing BNB in price discovery territory. The chart highlights a clear breakout above long-term resistance, supported by growing volume and expanding bullish momentum. The 50-week moving average (blue) has steepened upward and remains well above the 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) moving averages — a strong confirmation of trend acceleration. The price structure also mirrors BNB’s 2021 rally, but with healthier market conditions and broader ecosystem strength. As long as BNB holds above the $1,100–$1,150 range, the technical outlook remains bullish, with potential upside targets beyond $1,400–$1,500 in the short term. Analysts view this surge as both a technical and fundamental breakout, driven by renewed network activity on Binance Smart Chain and strong investor confidence. With market sentiment turning optimistic, BNB’s chart reflects clear bullish continuation potential as the altcoin bull cycle matures.

New entrants to BNB Chain will also gain access to technical support and infrastructure resources. Analysts view the initiative as a strategic response to growing competition among Layer-1 chains. It underscores Binance’s effort to maintain relevance amid a shifting DeFi landscape, where institutional developers are starting to test new on-chain models. Kazakhstan Tightens Crypto Oversight Kazakhstan’s Financial Monitoring Agency (AFM) has closed 130 unauthorized cryptocurrency platforms and seized $16.7 million in illicit funds linked to money laundering. Authorities have also strengthened AML rules, requiring ID verification for transactions above 500,000 tenge ($925). While enforcement intensified, up from 36 closures the previous year, Kazakhstan continues to support legitimate crypto use. The government has launched a national Bitcoin fund, allowed stablecoin fee payments, and is considering a state-backed crypto reserve. The balanced approach highlights a key emerging-market trend: regulatory tightening that does not stifle innovation. Investors view this as constructive for market stability, supporting Bitcoin’s current range around $124,000. MetaMask Adds Hyperliquid, Eyes Polymarket MetaMask has integrated Hyperliquid, enabling users to trade perpetual futures directly from their wallet. The move expands decentralized trading options and reduces reliance on centralized exchanges like OKX and Binance. Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, rose 2.4% following the announcement.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Mid-Trend Correction Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase after rallying to $126,300. The 4-hour chart now shows a descending channel, with resistance near $123,500 and Fibonacci support between $119,500 and $117,400. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators are neutral, with the RSI at 47, while the MACD histogram narrows, signaling a fading bearish pressure. A breakout above $124,000 could retest $126,300 and open the path to $130,000, while a drop below $117,400 may test $115,000. This pullback appears to be a healthy correction within Bitcoin’s long-term bullish channel. Traders are watching the 0.5 and 0.618 retracement zones for renewed strength as we head into Q4.

YETH's synthetic long options strategy significantly underperforms ether spot ETFs like ETHA, with only 8.9% return versus ETHA's 83% over the past year. The fund's high 0.95% expense ratio and poor structuring result in NAV erosion and misleadingly high distribution rates. Sell YETH and consider ETHA for direct ether exposure and better total return potential. Thesis We recently reviewed a very robust and well-structured fund from Roundhill, namely the Roundhill PLTR WeeklyPay ETF ( PLTW ). In that article we praised the asset manager on the fund and its structuring. Today we are going to tackle a different name from Roundhill, but one that sits at the opposite side of the spectrum, unfortunately. Today's article will deal with the Roundhill Ether Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YETH ), and will highlight why we are of the opinion the fund fails to achieve its goals. What does YETH actually do? Let us start by looking at the fund objective: The Roundhill Ether Covered Call Strategy ETF (“YETH”) seeks to offer exposure to ether*, subject to a cap, while providing the potential for current income. YETH is an actively-managed ETF. YETH is therefore a name that aims to extract dividends from ether's performance. An investor always has to keep in mind that such a fund, by design, is supposed to follow the total return provided by the underlying asset. An investor can always just buy ether outright via the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ), and the only reason to go long on a name like YETH is to capitalize on constant gains harvesting, to the extent the fund is correctly structured. YETH employs a synthetic long structure via options A fund can achieve dividends from an underlying asset via various strategies: hold the asset and write covered calls do a total return swap with a bank use a synthetic long A synthetic long position is a financial strategy that is constructed to replicate the exact payoff and risk profile of owning the underlying asset without actually buying the asset outright. Now one can structure a robust synthetic long, and one can structure a poor synthetic long. Without getting too much into financial engineering terms, let us give you a flavor of the YETH holdings: Holdings (Fund Website) The fund uses the ProShares Ether ETF ( EETH ) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) as building blocks. ETHA tracks spot ether, while EETH aims to track ether via futures: Data by YCharts We can see a divergence in performance recently between a construct using futures and one using the spot reference asset. At the end of the day, as a retail investor, you do not need to know too much about how to build a synthetic long, but only observe if the manager is actually doing a good job. Let us have a look at how it works for this name. Performance - large basis Now that we have established what the fund aims to do and how it is built, let us see if it manages to achieve its goal: Data by YCharts The above chart is a total return graph for the three ETFs in the past year. Please note that YETH is astoundingly far off from the ether building blocks. A good dividend extractor would see a total return in a +/-10% band when benchmarked against the underlying asset. We have a basis of 60% to 74% here. How is this possible? Poor structuring. The synthetic long employed does not work well when benchmarked against an actual ether performance. Please note YETH retained all the downside from January 2025 to April 2025 but lagged significantly during an up market. For 0.95% in fees, this fund should do much, much better. Please note the ETF, just like any buy write fund on a volatile asset, shows very large distribution rates (60% currently). Ignore these figures since they are meaningless. The ETF has seen a significant NAV erosion, which has not been compensated enough by the dividend. In fact, in the past year the ETF has mustered a total return of only 8.9% when ether spot is up roughly 83%! What can an investor do here? Well, to put it succinctly, just don't buy YETH and buy ETHA outright. An investor can construct the dividend profile she/he desires via an outright purchase and small sales each month. Let us go through an example: you purchase $1,000 worth of ETHA after 1 month the position is up +12%, and you have $1,120 in your account you can just outright sell $120 worth of stock and give yourself a 144% annualized dividend rate (multiply 120 by 12 to annualize it and divide by 1000) The takeaway here is that extracting dividends from an asset is not that hard; it just takes very active management. Buying a fund that should do that for you is an alternative, but only when it actually achieves that goal. Mind you that YETH could do just what we outlined above, but then it would be hard pressed to charge you 0.95% for it. Instead it employs a complex options strategy, which just fails to achieve its goals. Conclusion YETH is an exchange-traded fund that aims to track ether and extract dividends from its appreciation. The name uses a complex synthetic long options strategy but fails to achieve its stated goal. Ether via ETHA is up almost +83% in the past year, while YETH has posted a paltry +8.9% gain. The structuring here is not great, and it should be changed. The ETF charges a 0.95% expense ratio for this endeavor. While we are sanguine ether into the year's end, we find YETH to be a poor vehicle to express that view.

ETH is now moving lower and might extend losses below $4,400 in the short term. Ethereum started a downside correction below $4,600 and $4,550. The price is trading below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $4,460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it trades below $4,400. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price extended gains above $4,620 and $4,650, like Bitcoin . ETH price tested the $4,750 resistance zone before there was a fresh decline. A low was formed at $4,414 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above $4,500. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,759 swing high to the $4,414 low. However, the bears are active near the $4,550 level. Besides, there is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $4,460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,520 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,585 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,759 swing high to the $4,414 low. A clear move above the $4,585 resistance might send the price toward the $4,620 resistance. An upside break above the $4,620 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,720 resistance zone or even $4,750 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,550 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,460 level. The first major support sits near the $4,420 zone. A clear move below the $4,420 support might push the price toward the $4,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,250 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,150. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

A Bitcoin ETN is an exchange-traded note that tracks the price of Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency and trades on regulated exchanges. It gives investors price exposure without direct ownership of the underlying coins and functions as an unsecured debt instrument issued by a financial issuer. How does the FCA change affect UK retail investors? From 8 October 2025, retail investors can buy Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs listed on recognized exchanges, provided the products meet strict listing, disclosure and distribution rules. The FCA’s framework focuses on investor protection by requiring comprehensive prospectuses and clear risk disclosures. Bitcoin UK: FCA lifts ban on ETNs for retail investors — what you need to know The FCA has reversed its 2021 restriction and now permits ETNs linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum for retail sale when listed on a recognized exchange. This restores a regulated pathway for retail exposure to leading cryptocurrencies without requiring direct custody. Key conditions: issuers must satisfy listing rules, provide transparent fee and risk information, and comply with distribution safeguards. ETNs remain unsecured notes, so counterparty credit risk is a primary consideration for investors. Who commented on the move? Industry representatives welcomed the change. Susie Violet Ward, CEO of Bitcoin Policy UK, said, “Access matters, and lifting the ETN restriction is a welcome step in the right direction. What is important now is that the UK builds on this momentum.” Public authorities referenced include the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England, noted here as plain text sources for regulatory context. What is the Bank of England doing about stablecoins? The Bank of England is signaling measured flexibility. It plans to offer exemptions to proposed stablecoin-holding limits for firms that require higher stablecoin balances for liquidity and settlement purposes. The bank will also allow stablecoins to be used as settlement assets inside its Digital Securities Sandbox for controlled experiments. Which firms may qualify for exemptions? According to reporting by plain text source Bloomberg, certain exchanges and liquidity providers that need to hold large stablecoin balances to run continuous trading and settlement operations could be eligible for waivers. The Bank’s sandbox approach aims to balance innovation with financial stability safeguards. Why are stablecoins rising in prominence? Stablecoins remain central to digital asset liquidity, settlement, and cross-border payments. Recent legislative and market developments — including the U.S. GENIUS Act (as plain text reference) and new issuers launching regional stablecoins — are increasing competitive pressure and innovation in the space. Notably, AnchorX has introduced AxCNH, a stablecoin pegged to the offshore Chinese Yuan (CNH), marking a new entrant targeting regional payment corridors and FX settlements. These developments emphasize the geopolitical and commercial drivers shaping stablecoin policy choices. Frequently Asked Questions Can retail investors lose money with ETNs? Yes. ETNs carry market risk tied to crypto price moves and issuer credit risk because they are unsecured debt instruments. Investors should review issuers’ creditworthiness and ETN prospectuses before investing. Will stablecoins be widely accepted for settlement in the UK? The Bank of England’s sandbox will test settlement uses. Widespread acceptance depends on regulatory outcomes, interoperability, and risk controls established through these trials. Key Takeaways Regulated retail access restored : The FCA now allows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs to be sold to retail investors on recognized exchanges under strict rules. ETN risk profile : ETNs provide price exposure without crypto custody and include issuer credit risk; read prospectuses carefully. Stablecoin flexibility : The Bank of England may grant exemptions for firms needing stablecoin liquidity and will pilot settlement use in a sandbox. Conclusion The FCA’s decision to lift the ETN ban reintroduces a regulated route for UK retail investors to access Bitcoin and Ethereum price exposure while the Bank of England’s pragmatic sandbox and exemption approach signals a willingness to support practical stablecoin uses. Market participants should weigh product disclosures and issuer risk as these regulatory changes take effect.

In a note to investors, Hougan outlined three primary catalysts behind the anticipated surge, pointing to platform approvals, the broader macroeconomic environment, as well as BTC’s recent price momentum. Hougan’s Hot Take First on his list is the wave of institutional approvals now clearing the path for major wealth managers to offer Bitcoin ETFs to their clients. He highlighted Morgan Stanley’s October 1 guidance, which allows its 16,000 advisors managing $2 trillion in assets to include cryptocurrency allocations of up to 4% for risk-tolerant clients. Wells Fargo has made a similar pivot, and the Bitwise exec suggested that firms including UBS and Merrill Lynch are likely to follow suit. While the rollout won’t happen overnight, conversations Hougan has had with advisors indicate strong pent-up demand. The second factor is what Hougan calls the “Debasement Trade,” referring to the growing interest in assets seen as hedges against currency debasement. Bitcoin, alongside gold, has been among the year’s best-performing major assets. US monetary expansion since 2020 has been up 44% and has brought this trade into sharper focus, with major financial institutions, including JPMorgan, publishing reports spotlighting the strategy. Hougan argued that advisors looking to showcase strong year-end portfolio performance are likely to steer clients toward BTC ETFs, which is similar to last year’s preference for high-performing tech equities. Bitcoin Market Momentum Hougan also pointed to Bitcoin’s own market performance as a fundamental driver of inflows. The crypto asset recently surpassed $126,000, as it broke past key psychological thresholds and posted a 9% gain in the first week of October alone. Historically, quarters marked by double-digit positive returns for BTC have coincided with billions in ETF inflows, a pattern Hougan believes will repeat in Q4. Hougan’s bullish outlook is supported by early Q4 numbers as Bitcoin ETFs drew $3.5 billion in just four trading days, which has catapulted YTD flows to $25.9 billion. With 64 trading days remaining, the exec predicts that the sector could easily exceed $10 billion more in inflows, and could also potentially surpass last year’s record-setting $36 billion.

Open account → BNB’s surge is driven by a sharp rise in investor mindshare, network upgrades that cut block times and gas costs, and stronger developer and institutional interest—pushing BNB above $1,330 and making it the third-largest crypto by market cap in days. BNB price jumped over 27% in a week, topping $1,330 Mindshare rose ~251% in seven days, signaling heightened public attention Market cap climbed from ~$140B to over $183B; memecoins and a $1B builder fund boosted usage BNB surge: BNB price and network upgrades drive investor demand—read how ecosystem growth and memecoins pushed BNB to new highs. Learn more now. What is driving the BNB surge? BNB surge is driven by rising investor mindshare, major protocol upgrades that reduced block time and gas costs, and a wave of retail memecoin activity. These factors, combined with a new $1 billion builder fund and growing institutional allocations, have propelled BNB’s market cap and network usage higher. Rachael Lucas, an analyst at BTC Markets, noted that BNB’s recent surge highlights growing investor confidence in its long-term prospects. BNB “mindshare” has surged over 250% in just a week, according to Messari, with one analyst pointing to a market shift toward high-throughput, low-cost chains. The native token of BNB Chain crossed over $1,330 for the first time on Wednesday, after registering a gain of over 27% in the last week, according to data aggregator CoinGecko, nearly a week after clocking its previous high of $1,111. Crypto market intelligence firm Messari said in an X post on Wednesday, BNB’s mindshare, which measures public attention, discussion, and awareness, has seen a 251% spike to 5.09% in the last seven days, while its price gains have come alongside “very bullish sentiment.” COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Source: Messari Speaking to Cointelegraph, Rachael Lucas, an analyst at Australian cryptocurrency exchange BTC Markets, said the surge in sentiment is likely due to BNB benefiting from a shift in market focus toward high-throughput, low-cost chains with active ecosystems. The token terminal lists BNB Chain fees at an average of $0.46, while an upgrade to increase the gas limit to 100 million per second and reduce the block time to 750 milliseconds went live on Tuesday, up from a 3-second block time and a 47 million gas limit per second. How did BNB mindshare spike so rapidly? Messari’s mindshare metric spiked ~251% to 5.09% over seven days, reflecting a surge in social discussion, searches, and public attention. Short-term catalysts included price momentum, memecoin trading on BNB Chain, and announcements such as the $1 billion builder fund and protocol upgrades that improved throughput and reduced fees. Memecoins and market cap flip spur investor interest Two major drivers in the last week were a sharp market-cap rise and a memecoin trading boom. BNB’s market capitalization rose from about $140 billion on Oct. 1 to a peak above $183 billion on Wednesday, moving it into the third-largest crypto slot by market cap. BNB is now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, having surpassed Tether and XRP. Source: CoinGecko “Its recent flip of XRP and Tether in market cap underscores growing investor confidence in BNB’s long-term positioning,” Lucas said. Traders reported outsized gains from small-cap memecoins native to BNB Chain over the past week, with retail engagement surging as memecoin momentum drew liquidity and attention to the ecosystem. “The memecoin boom has driven retail engagement, while innovations like onchain access to macroeconomic data are attracting DeFi developers.” Ecosystem growth and institutional interest also play a factor BNB announced a $1 billion builder fund to support projects on the chain, including AI, trading, wallets, and payments. The initiative signals increased commitment to developer growth and longer-term utility. Lucas said such initiatives “signal a strong commitment to developer growth, while a surge in memecoin trading has pushed BNB Chain’s network fees and usage to record highs.” BNB Chain is leading the market in DEX volume, with over $6 billion recorded and $5.57 million in chain fees, according to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain. Source: Lookonchain “Institutional interest, such as CEA Industries’ treasury allocation, adds further credibility. While short-term technicals suggest BNB may be overbought, the underlying fundamentals, including real utility and growing developer traction, provide a solid foundation,” Lucas added. BNB launched its Maxwell upgrade in June and the Lorentz Hard Fork in April, both aimed at improving block times, validator networking, and overall throughput. User metrics have jumped as well BNB Chain’s total locked value reached $9.26 billion, while monthly active addresses spiked to 73.24 million—the highest recorded level. These metric improvements indicate real usage growth beyond speculative trading. BNB’s outperformance amid broader market softness suggests capital is rotating into ecosystems showing actual adoption and developer activity, Lucas observed. Frequently Asked Questions Why did BNB price jump above $1,300? BNB price rose above $1,300 due to a mix of increased public mindshare, protocol upgrades that lowered costs and block times, a builder fund announcement, and elevated memecoin trading on the chain. Is the BNB rally driven by retail or institutions? Both. Retail memecoin trading boosted short-term volume, while institutional allocations and a $1B builder fund signal longer-term institutional and developer interest. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""BNB surge: mindshare spike, upgrades and memecoins push BNB above $1,330"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199c6f5-c283-7ac1-b925-621fcc517ffd.jpeg""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-09T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-09T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""description"": ""BNB surge is driven by rising mindshare, protocol upgrades and memecoin activity—pushing price above $1,330 and market cap past $183B."", ""keywords"": ""BNB surge, BNB price, BNB Chain, memecoins, market cap, blockchain upgrades""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why did BNB price jump above $1,300?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""BNB price rose above $1,300 because of a surge in investor mindshare, protocol upgrades that reduced block time and fees, a $1B builder fund announcement, and heightened memecoin trading on BNB Chain."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the BNB rally driven by retail or institutions?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The rally has both retail-driven memecoin volume and growing institutional allocations; developer-focused initiatives also support longer-term adoption."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess BNB momentum"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check mindshare and on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Review public attention metrics and active-address statistics to gauge retail interest and network usage."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Evaluate protocol upgrades"", ""text"": ""Confirm recent upgrades and their impact on block time, gas limits and transaction costs to understand throughput improvements."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor market-cap and fund announcements"", ""text"": ""Track market-cap shifts and large developer or treasury allocations to assess institutional and developer commitment."" } ]} Key Takeaways Price action : BNB rose over 27% in a week, topping $1,330.

Crypto staking ETFs are exchange-traded funds that both hold crypto assets and participate in on-chain staking to earn rewards for validating or securing proof-of-stake networks. They combine price exposure with an additional yield stream, potentially improving net returns for investors without requiring direct wallet management. How are Bitwise and 21Shares changing U.S. ETF offerings? Bitwise updated a filing to rename one product “Bitwise Solana Staking ETF” and added language allowing exposure to Solana held by the trust. The fund proposes a 0.20% unitary management fee, waived for the first three months on the first $1 billion. 21Shares revised its 21Shares Ethereum ETF (TETH) to include staking and announced a 0.21% sponsor fee waiver for 12 months starting October 9. These moves followed Grayscale’s recent introduction of staking in its U.S. Ethereum ETFs. How does staking affect investor returns and fund mechanics? Staking generates small on-chain rewards by helping secure networks like Ethereum and Solana. Those rewards accrue to the ETF, which can compound returns inside the fund rather than distributing them as separate payouts. Operationally, funds must handle validator selection, slashing risk, and operational costs. Bitwise’s unitary fee simplifies costs into a single charge, while 21Shares’ temporary fee waiver incentivizes early inflows.

Bitwise proposes a 0.20% unitary management fee, waived for three months on the first $1 billion. 21Shares is waiving its 0.21% sponsor fee for 12 months starting October 9. Fee structures may change upon final approval. How do funds handle staking rewards? Funds collect and reinvest staking rewards into the trust, which can compound inside the ETF and raise NAV. Details depend on fund policy regarding reward allocation and reporting. Who commented on these filings? Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, called staking a natural evolution for Ethereum products. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted low fees often attract investor inflows. COINOTAG and Bloomberg are cited as plain-text sources for reporting context. Key Takeaways Staking expands ETF utility : ETFs can now deliver both price exposure and protocol rewards. Fee competition intensifies : Bitwise and 21Shares use low fees and waivers to attract capital. Operational risks remain : Validator selection, slashing, and reward volatility require close fund governance and disclosure. Conclusion U.S. crypto funds are evolving beyond pure price plays; Bitwise and 21Shares adding staking and cutting fees signal a shift toward yield-enhanced ETFs. Investors should evaluate fee structures, staking mechanics, and disclosure before allocating capital. COINOTAG will monitor filings and updates as these products move toward final approval.

Is the four-year crypto cycle dead? The four-year crypto cycle as a strict timing rule is no longer reliable. Arthur Hayes argues Bitcoin cycles respond to changes in the money supply — especially US dollar and Chinese yuan liquidity — and that current policy easing makes this phase distinct from prior cycles. How does monetary policy drive Bitcoin cycles? Bitcoin’s major rallies historically coincided with periods of ample liquidity. Short-term spikes often follow central-bank easing, mortgage and bank liquidity flows, or Chinese credit expansion. Conversely, past cycle endings aligned with global tightening and reduced credit growth. What makes the current cycle different? Hayes highlights several structural differences this cycle: Large Treasury operations: The US Treasury has moved liquidity via Reverse Repo reductions and Treasury bill issuance, shifting cash into markets. US monetary easing signals: Fed rate cuts are being priced in by futures markets, increasing expected USD liquidity. Chinese policy pivot: Beijing appears focused on ending deflation and preventing credit contraction, which limits the deflationary headwind that stopped prior rallies. Regulatory and lending changes: Deregulation and policies to boost bank lending can further amplify liquidity. What do market signals indicate now? Futures markets price high odds of additional Fed cuts later this year. Those expectations imply easier dollar conditions and greater risk appetite. Hayes notes that if both US and Chinese policy tilt neutral-to-easing, there is less force to terminate a Bitcoin rally via simultaneous liquidity withdrawal. How have previous cycles differed by driver? Cycle Primary driver Why it ended 2011–2013 US QE + Chinese credit expansion Fed & Chinese slowdown of money printing 2015 (ICO cycle) Yuan credit explosion Chinese credit deceleration and tighter dollar conditions 2020–2021 (COVID-era) USD liquidity surge Fed tightening from late 2021 COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → When the economic pressure proves too intense, Chinese policymakers print money, says Arthur Hayes. Source: Arthur Hayes Why won’t China kill the cycle this time? Hayes argues China is moving away from aggressive liquidity withdrawal. Policymakers appear prepared to combat deflation and support domestic credit. That reduces the odds that Chinese policy will act as the counterweight that ended past Bitcoin rallies. What do other market participants say? On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has noted that some cyclical patterns still appear. Saad Ahmed, Gemini’s head of APAC region, told Cointelegraph that many market participants expect some form of recurring cycle to persist. These views indicate the debate remains open, but monetary flows now receive heavier emphasis. Frequently Asked Questions How long could this Bitcoin rally last given current policy? There is no fixed timeline. If US and Chinese liquidity remain supportive, the rally could extend beyond historical four-year bounds; if either region tightens drastically, the cycle could still end. Watch central-bank actions and credit indicators closely. Does a halving no longer matter for Bitcoin price? Halvings remain supply-side events, but Hayes argues their price impact is conditioned by liquidity. A halving in an easing environment may have a different effect than one that coincides with global tightening. How should investors track these signals? Monitor Fed communications, futures-implied rates, Chinese credit growth data, and bank lending trends. Combine macro indicators with on-chain metrics to form a layered view of cycle risk. Key Takeaways Monetary policy matters most : Bitcoin cycles historically align with USD and yuan liquidity shifts. Four-year timing is unreliable : Fixed halving schedules do not guarantee cycle endpoints without considering macro liquidity. Monitor policy and credit : Fed rate projections, Chinese credit trends, and Treasury operations are key indicators for cycle outlook. Conclusion Arthur Hayes’ assessment reframes the debate: the four-year crypto cycle is not dead because of a unique market quirk, but because macro liquidity now dominates cycle dynamics. Investors should prioritize monetary-policy signals from the US and China and use short, data-driven checks to gauge whether this cycle sustains or reverses. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the main driver of Bitcoin cycles according to Arthur Hayes?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Arthur Hayes states that Bitcoin cycles are mainly driven by the supply and quantity of money — particularly USD and Chinese yuan liquidity — rather than strict four-year timing tied to halvings."" } } ]} COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Smarter tools.

What was once valued near a staggering $20 billion market cap has now been reduced to a shadow of its former self, leaving many early supporters disillusioned. Once praised as a revolutionary “mobile mining” experiment, the project now finds itself cited as one of the most disappointing stories of the decade. Industry watchers are calling it a sobering reminder that hype without delivery rarely lasts. The crash in value has not only erased millions in paper wealth but also fractured a once-thriving community that believed Pi could challenge established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts Describe a ‘Slow-Motion Rug Pull’ Crypto analyst Mr. Spock Ape reignited debate this week by labeling Pi’s trajectory a “slow-motion rug pull.” He argues that many users continue to mine tokens unaware of how little value remains in circulation. For years, the community has clung to the idea of incredible growth potential – but that dream has turned into a symbol of denial. With no clear liquidity or meaningful exchange listings, Pi’s ecosystem remains locked in a self-contained bubble, detached from real market demand. Behind the scenes, cracks in leadership have widened. Leaked reports and legal filings describe internal conflicts between founders Nicolas Kokkalis and Chengdiao Fan, along with accusations from former executive McPhilip that project funds were mismanaged. These issues, dating back to as early as 2020, have resurfaced during the recent collapse, intensifying investor frustration and eroding what little trust remains. Upgrades Fail to Stop the Bleeding In an effort to revive enthusiasm, the team rolled out several new features – including a DeFi simulation tool and an AI-powered Fast Track KYC system designed to speed up user verification. Both were presented as steps toward Pi’s long-promised mainnet launch, yet the market’s response was muted. Pi Coin has continued its downward spiral, falling out of the top 50 cryptocurrencies and losing nearly all of its early momentum. Mining rewards have also been slashed, with the rate now down to 0.0027405 π per hour – a drastic cut that means miners need more than two weeks to earn just one token. The result has been an exodus of users, with critics suggesting that the remaining community is held together more by nostalgia than by tangible value. The Rise of a New Hope While Pi Network’s downfall serves as a warning, many investors are redirecting their attention toward new opportunities – and one project in particular has become the talk of the market: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Unlike Pi, which struggled to achieve real liquidity, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown remarkable progress, delivering one record-breaking milestone after another. Its presale rounds have consistently sold out, attracting strong retail participation and even catching the attention of analysts who view it as one of the fastest-growing altcoins of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE combines transparency, security, and utility – a trio that investors believe Pi lacked. The project’s audited codebase, clear roadmap, and expanding ecosystem have created an environment where long-term holders can benefit from both early access and sustained growth. As one observer put it, “Where Pi overpromised and underdelivered, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly executing.” With analysts predicting returns that could reach 20,000% for early participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a symbol of renewed optimism in a year filled with cautionary tales. It’s proving that even after high-profile disappointments, the crypto market still rewards innovation and credibility. A Lesson in Overpromise and Underperformance The Pi Network story now stands as a cautionary tale about unchecked ambition. Its founders once promoted it as the “people’s crypto,” but in the absence of transparency, accessibility, and results, the narrative collapsed. The obsession with speculative valuations and a never-ending testnet phase drove away many believers who had once seen Pi as a gateway to financial inclusion. As new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE take the spotlight, investors are reminded that strong fundamentals and clear communication matter far more than grand promises. The market may forgive volatility, but it does not forgive stagnation. The Path Ahead The digital asset space continues to evolve, with projects that combine innovation, compliance, and community-driven value creation gaining the upper hand. S&P’s introduction of tokenized market indexes and the steady flow of institutional capital show that blockchain technology remains strong – but retail investors are becoming more selective. For many, Pi Network’s collapse is the end of one chapter and the start of another. It has underscored the risks of speculation without delivery and highlighted how new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are redefining what success looks like in the next phase of crypto adoption.

BNB’s market cap now hovers near $182–185 billion, capping a seven-day run that outpaced Bitcoin and Ethereum.

On the downside, $1,200–$1,240 is the first support zone traders are watching for a healthy retest. BNB's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview Record On-Chain Activity and Meme-Season Tailwinds Currently, BNB Chain is printing cycle-high activity. Daily transactions have ranged 10–17 million, monthly active addresses reportedly hit 60 million, and DEX turnover on BNB Chain just notched $6.05 billion in 24 hours (with PancakeSwap contributing $4.29B). A memecoin rush has also gripped the network as analytics from Bubblemaps show 100,000+ traders piled into BNB memecoins, with 70% booking gains and $516M in total profits across over 93,000 winners. CZ-themed tickers like “4” and “Broccoli” helped propel BNB to the top of DEXScreener’s trending lists, while tokens such as PALU and “Binance Life” collectively moved over $300 million in a single session, eclipsing meme volumes on rival chains. Institutional and enterprise signals are building too, with CEA Industries disclosing 480,000 BNB ($585M) with an aim to reach 1% of supply. Regionally, a Kazakhstan-backed BNB fund and growing integrations (including Chainlink’s data standard bringing official U.S. macro series like GDP and PCE on-chain) underscore expanding utility across DeFi, prediction markets, and payments. What to Watch For Binance Coin (BNB): Levels, Catalysts, and Risks Near term, the setup favors trend continuation while $1,200–$1,240 holds; reclaiming $1,320–$1,360 on rising spot volume would strengthen a run at $1,500. Key medium-term drivers include sustained on-chain throughput, sticky DEX/DeFi fees, and additional institutional balance-sheet exposure or partnerships.

The S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index, released as of September 30, 2025, tracks 304 cryptocurrency constituents and represents a significant move by one of the most recognized names in global finance. The launch was highlighted online by JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a well-known XRP community figure, who shared the official index factsheet featuring XRP among the top constituents.

The price is now struggling and might continue to move down if it trades below $2.820. XRP price is slowly moving lower below the $2.90 zone. The price is now trading below $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it settles below $2.820. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to stay above $3.00 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $2.950 and $2.920 to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price tested the $2.8320 zone and recently attempted a recovery wave. It climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $2.8320 swing low. However, the bears remained active near $2.920. The price is now trading below $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.880 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.920 level. A clear move above the $2.920 resistance might send the price toward the $2.950 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $2.8320 swing low. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.050. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.920 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.820 level. The next major support is near the $2.80 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.80 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.7250. The next major support sits near the $2.650 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.60. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.
