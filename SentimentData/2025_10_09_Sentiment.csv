The first name had meaning, but it also hinted at a depth that did not fit the site's clear look anymore. Today's gamers want quickness, ease, and clarity. By leaving out “King,” the site shared a strong no͏te: it's aimed at new fun, not big ideas. The change wasn't about losing honor—it was about getting meaning. A brighter, simpler name fits just right with the brand's path toward world accessibility. How the rebrand sharpened Menace’s identity instantly The transition to Menace online casino gave the platform a sharper edge. The shorter name is easier to recall, fits neatly across devices, and resonates with players in different regions. Branding updates across the website, promotions, and sportsbook made the change feel complete rather than cosmetic. Users noticed the difference immediately. The rebrand aligned perfectly with Menace’s strengths: fast registration, responsive play on mobile, and seamless integration of casino and sportsbook services. Why games and promotions make the new brand stronger The rebrand didn’t change what matters most—game variety. Menace still offers more than 7,000 titles, from slots like Book of Dead, Starburst, and Sweet Bonanza, to live dealer experiences such as Teen Patti Live and Immersive Roulette. The sportsbook continues to cover football, basketball, tennis, cricket, and esports with competitive odds. Promotions also got fresh power with the Menace name. Players like a 100% deposit match to $500, free spins and weekly cash back. The VIP Club gives rewards for loyalty with special offers, faster withdrawals and personal account managers. How the industry is reacting to Menace’s bold move Rebrands often divide opinion, but Menace’s shift has been widely praised. Industry watchers see it as a smart adjustment to meet global trends in digital branding. Players see it as a promise: less fluff, more focus on what makes gaming enjoyable. Licensing under the Autonomous Island of Anjouan (Union of the Comoros, License No. ALSI-202506021-FI1) reassures users that behind the sleek new identity lies a stable, regulated foundation. Why Menace proves bold rebrands can shape the future By dropping “King” Menace showed that simple can be a strong move. The new name, with safe payments, quick cash outs, and clear deals makes it more than only a casino and sportsbook; it's a fresh center for online fun. For players, the sign is plain. Menace ain't caught in the past. It’s making the future of online play, and it’s doing this with boldness, clearness, and style. With over 500,000 monthly active users, 7,000+ games, and jackpots topping $1 million, the numbers back the brand’s bold choice. This growth shows that clarity and confidence can fuel long-term success in a crowded global market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ether, DAI maintains relative price steadiness, making it an ideal medium for wagering without worrying about sudden swings. In this article, we explore the best DAI-friendly casinos and gambling platforms in 2025, review their features, and show what to look for when choosing one. Why Choose DAI for Online Gambling?

Use Reputable Wallets — Prefer wallets you control, not custodial ones. Check Audit Reports & Proofs — Provably fair systems and third-party audits give clues about trust.

Treat gambling as entertainment, not income. Final Thoughts DAI is a smart choice for crypto gamblers who want stability without sacrificing blockchain benefits. The casinos reviewed here provide a starting point, but always verify current status, DAI support, and your jurisdiction’s rules.

Approval odds are now close to 100% , and the market is already positioning for what could be a historic shift. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 The first Solana spot ETF , launched by REX-Osprey in July, was the first SEC-approved product with built-in staking rewards , and it has earned over $400 million so far. Now, giants like Grayscale, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton , and VanEck are awaiting green lights on their own Solana ETF products, with decisions expected in the next 48 hours . If approved, this could unleash a fresh wave of institutional capital into SOL, sending its price soaring. Solana Price Prediction: SOL’s RSI Sends Buy Signal as Price Climbs Above $200 The daily chart shows that Solana found strong resistance at around $250 last month, but the token still seems headed to retest that area as positive momentum has gained traction again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just climbed above its 14-day moving average – a move often seen as a classic buy signal. If the current downtrend continues, the $200 level will be the key support to watch. A strong bounce from that zone would reinforce a bullish Solana price prediction and could trigger the next push toward new all-time highs. With macro conditions, market sentiment, and institutional flows all leaning positive, the setup for SOL looks increasingly favorable. At the same time, top crypto presales are riding this momentum too. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has already raised $1.7 million to build its mine-to-earn (M2E) gaming platform, offering early investors a shot at outsized gains before the token lists on major exchanges. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Mining Easier Than Ever Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has turned mining into a fun game that requires zero hardware but offers high rewards to early adopters. Instead of buying and waiting until the presale token launches, users can earn $PEPENODE by setting up virtual mining nodes to collect rewards from day one. To climb the leaderboard, players can buy more rigs, upgrade their setup, and participate in competitions. Those who make it to the top will be eligible to receive attractive airdrops of tokens like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) and Bonk ($BONK). In addition, the project introduces a deflationary burn mechanic, where 70% of tokens spent on upgrades are permanently burned to reduce $PEPENODE’s circulating supply. To launch your own virtual mining system and start earning, simply head to the Pepenode official website and connect a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this presale token or use a bank card to invest instead.

52865582,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/solana-price-prediction-sol-rejected-at-229-eyes-key-support-at-200,1759963658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/52865582.jpeg,"Solana Price Prediction: SOL Rejected at $229, Eyes Key Support at $200",https://bitzo.com/2025/10/solana-price-prediction-sol-rejected-at-229-eyes-key-support-at-200,"Solana’s recent attempt to regain upward momentum has stalled. After a sharp rejection at $229.49, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, SOL broke below its 30-day Simple Moving Average and is now retracing toward key support zones. This pattern is familiar in crypto. When liquidity shifts and narratives cool, traders reposition quickly. But so do communications teams. At Outset PR, this kind of market behavior is tracked in real time using Outset Data Pulse , an in-house analytics platform that scans media cycles across Web3. The goal is simple: to keep clients visible when momentum shifts, and to optimize media strategy during volatility. Failed Breakout, Bearish Signals SOL failed to reclaim its September swing high of $253, facing hard resistance at $229—a level that had previously acted as a pivot zone. This triggered a wave of selling as short-term holders exited positions. The move pushed SOL under its 30-day SMA ($225.57), with the MACD histogram turning negative at –0.489, confirming a shift in momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI (49.79) shows neutral-to-bearish sentiment, lacking the strength typically needed for a sustained rebound. Support at $214 in Focus as Momentum Weakens Source: coinmarketcap The current pullback puts pressure on the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $214.84. If Solana closes below this level on the daily chart, selling could intensify, opening the path toward $200—a round-number support that carries both psychological and historical significance. Previous market cycles show that when similar technical setups occur (MACD flip, failed Fib breakout, and neutral RSI), 78% of cases resulted in 5–8% corrections. This gives traders a well-defined downside target range of $198–$205 in the short term. Retail Interest Shifts to BNB Chain A key reason behind Solana’s decline is the sharp rotation of speculative capital into rival ecosystems. On October 8, BNB Chain meme coins like $BSC surged, with 35x returns drawing in large volumes of retail liquidity. BNB Chain posted $20.5 billion in daily volume, outpacing Solana’s $12.7 billion by a significant margin. That 61% gap is not just statistical—it reflects a shift in risk appetite. Solana’s own meme coin activity has thinned. Tokens like $TRUMP and BONK have seen DEX volume drop 18% since October 7, and the BNB/SOL volume ratio has reached 1.61, its highest level since June 2025. Momentum, it seems, is flowing elsewhere—for now. How Outset PR Keeps Projects Visible Amid Volume Rotation These market shifts matter not only to traders, but also to crypto projects trying to remain in the spotlight. That is where Outset PR’s data-driven approach stands out. Using its proprietary Syndication Map , Outset PR identifies which publications offer the best syndication lift for a given budget. Rather than spraying stories across low-impact outlets, it targets platforms with high engagement and republishing potential—such as CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance. This is not just a tactical move. It is a strategic method to ensure projects are seen when others are buried by noise. With Anastasia Anisimova leading a deeply networked media relations team, Outset PR maintains strong ties with editors, which helps secure tier-1 coverage even during downtrends. “Most agencies pitch blindly,” Anisimova says. “We pitch thoughtfully, with timing, tone, and momentum in mind.” As a result, clients achieve coverage that not only lands—but spreads. Just one Outset PR campaign for StealthEX generated 92 republications, reaching over 3 billion views from a single placement. Conclusion: $200 Becomes the Line in the Sand Solana’s rejection at $229, declining on-chain activity, and weakening momentum indicators all suggest a deeper correction is underway. A breakdown below $214.84 could accelerate the move toward $200, where buyers may begin to re-enter—if confidence returns. In parallel to price action, narrative visibility matters too. As traders shift capital and volume flows into rival chains, media attention moves with it. Through tools like Outset Data Pulse and Syndication Map, Outset PR ensures that projects stay aligned with the cycle, adapt when needed, and remain visible—even when the market turns. Because in crypto, those who adjust early are the ones still visible when the next rally begins.

The dynamics of institutional interest are shifting, and Ethereum's advantages may position it ahead. Dive into this analysis to discover which cryptocurrencies are primed for significant growth in the coming months. Ethereum Eyes New Heights as Price Climbs Source: tradingview Ethereum is riding a wave with its price sitting in an impressive range between $4,198 and $4,725. The cryptocurrency recently enjoyed a week-long boost of over 7%, and its six-month growth stands at a staggering 192%. If Ethereum can overcome its closest resistance at just under $5,000, it could aim for a higher target above $5,463. Its relative strength index suggests it still has room to grow before hitting overbought levels. The current market sentiment reveals potential for Ethereum to push beyond its boundaries, setting the stage for exciting developments ahead. With these encouraging trends, Ethereum could soon be in uncharted territories, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. Conclusion Ethereum has seen a steady increase in interest from institutional investors. With its growing use in DeFi and NFTs, ETH offers more utility options than Bitcoin. While BTC remains a strong asset due to its established reputation, ETH's versatile applications make it a compelling option. The demand dynamics may shift, potentially positioning ETH alongside or even ahead of Bitcoin in terms of institutional demand. The evolving preferences of institutional investors could redefine the crypto market’s structure. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As US regulators begin drafting regulation ahead of what could be crypto’s last bull run before global adoption, traders are increasingly focusing on XRP, Binance Coin, and Zcash, viewing them as leading candidates for the next significant breakout. Ripple (XRP): Top Cross-Border Payments Solution and Leading Altcoin of 2025 XRP ($XRP) is the token of a lightning-fast and cheap payments-focused blockchain, positioning itself as a direct rival to legacy systems like SWIFT. Attention from the UN Capital Development Fund and partnerships with several U.S. banking institutions have given it a higher profile, helping it to become the third largest coin with a market cap of over $172 billion. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, underscores the company’s ambition to dominate the rapidly expanding stablecoin sector. Over the last year, XRP has surged 443%, rocketing to its first new peak in seven years, hitting $3.65 on July 18 before easing roughly 21% to its current price, $2.88. Still, it has nearly quintupled Bitcoin’s 97% gain over the same period. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits around 46, with plenty of headroom to reverse XRP’s intraday loss of 3.4%, which is broadly in line with a wider 2% downturn across crypto’s $4.29 trillion market. The chart shows a possible breakout soon, supported by the two bull flag formations spotted in XRP’s summer charts. With additional ETF decisions expected in mid-October, forecasts place potential upside targets between $5 and $10, with room for greater expansion in a full-fledged bull market. Binance Coin (BNB) Extends Gains as Market Consolidates Once merely an exchange token for paying Binance fees, Binance Coin ($BNB) has evolved into one of the biggest cryptos in the world. Introduced in 2017, BNB’s utility now extends to decentralized applications, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi platforms. Its deflationary tokenomics, driven by Binance’s scheduled token burns, continually reduce supply and support long-term price growth. The token’s influence stretches beyond Binance’s ecosystem. Many merchants worldwide now accept BNB, including travel companies, and gaming platforms, strengthening its position among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Earlier today, BNB reached a new all-time high of $1,330.51. It now trades just 0.9% short of that level as it breaks out from a bullish pennant pattern formed over the spring. An overscorched RSI of 79 means some short term losses are likely going into the weekend as the token’s price consolidates nort of $1,000. If bullish momentum continues over the mid-to-long-term, a run toward $2,000 by year end is possible. Conversely, in a downside scenario, the $1,000 level could serve as a major psychological and technical support zone. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy-Focused Crypto Skyrockets 147% in One Week Launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin fork, Zcash ($ZEC) has a single mission: financial privacy. Zcash utilizes zk-SNARKs, short for “zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge,” a form of advanced cryptography that validates transactions without revealing sender, recipient, or transaction amounts. Its dual-address system lets users toggle between transparent and shielded addresses, enabling privacy where desired while maintaining compliance flexibility when necessary. During the past week, ZEC has climbed 58%, trading near $139 as renewed interest in privacy coins ripples through Uptober’s rally. Similar projects such as Dash and Verge also saw double-digit percentage gains of 23% and 33% respectively over the last seven days. However, with its RSI at 69, Zcash is close to overbought, suggesting a short-term correction below $100 may be likely before the next leg up. Still, a good news cycle could push the price towards toward $300 by the end of the year. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme-Infused Bitcoin Layer-2 and 2025’s Hottest Presale Among newer entrants, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has emerged as one of 2025’s most anticipated presale tokens. The project enhances Bitcoin’s proven security with Layer-2 scalability and the viral energy of meme culture. HYPER’s mission is to expand Bitcoin’s utility, enabling faster payments, decentralized governance, and sophisticated smart contract capabilities through a dedicated Layer-2 network. So far, its presale has attracted over $22.5 million, with analysts projecting tenfold or greater returns once the token officially launches. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine, the HYPER platform offers ultra-cheap smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp support, and seamless meme token integration. A Coinsult audit recently confirmed zero vulnerabilities, further boosting investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels all ecosystem functions, from staking and transaction fees to governance rights. Early investors can currently earn up to 51% APY by staking while gaining DAO voting privileges. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

This unexpected drop has sparked debate among investors and analysts. Is this merely a temporary setback, or could it signal the beginning of a more significant downturn? This article delves into the current market dynamics and highlights other cryptocurrencies poised for potential growth. XRP Eyes Growth: Price Hanging on Resistance Challenge Source: tradingview XRP's current price floats between nearly $2.80 and just over $3. The coin's main challenge lies in breaking past the nearby resistance level at about $3.25. If it manages to do so, it might aim for the next target around $3.50. This would hint at a growth of close to 13% from its lower range. The past six months have been positive for XRP , with an increase of over 45%. However, the short-term outlook seems tepid with minimal weekly gains. While underlying signals like the MACD suggest a cautious market, XRP enthusiasts remain hopeful for robust movement past these hurdles. Conclusion XRP’s recent price drop raises questions about its future direction. It's uncertain whether this is a brief dip or the start of a longer decline. The coin showed significant gains in September but could be facing new challenges. Watching other coins like Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana might provide context, as market trends often influence each other. The crypto market remains volatile, and XRP’s next moves will be closely monitored by traders and investors. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

52866031,601453,1759964439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52866031.jpeg,Buying XRP Now Could Be A Good Idea As Negative Sentiment Jumps To 6-Month High,https://bitcoinist.com/buying-xrp-now-a-good-idea/,"XRP’s price action has underperformed most top cryptocurrencies that have rallied alongside Bitcoin in the past 48 hours. This consolidation comes after a failed attempt to break through resistance near $3.10, which has seen the token slip back down below $3. However, recent on-chain data from analytics platform Santiment shows that despite XRP’s slower pace, something important is brewing beneath the surface, and it could signal a buying opportunity. Growing Negative Sentiment Around XRP According to Santiment’s latest market data, XRP is currently experiencing its highest level of retail fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the last six months. The last time the altcoin experienced this high level of retail fear was when Trump’s tariff announcements unsettled markets earlier this year. Data from Santiment shows that bearish commentary about the token on social media has significantly outweighed bullish sentiment over the past three days. Particularly, negative sentiment has dominated two out of the last three days. The ratio of bullish to bearish mentions dropped to 0.86 on October 6 and 0.74 on October 4. Such moments of excessive pessimism among retail traders have always coincided with local price bottoms for the token. The same sentiment imbalance that came before reversals in the past is reappearing and the current fear could once again be a precursor to recovery in the coming days. The chart data below, which was shared by Santiment on the social media platform X, shows XRP’s bullish-to-bearish ratio reached 3.21 on September 17, and this was a reliable top signal that was followed by a price correction. On the other hand, the latest readings from October reveal an opposite setup, one where fear is dominating. Is Buying The Altcoin A Good Idea? Based on the latest on-chain data, Santiment believes that now could be one of the most favorable moments to buy XRP. The crowd’s tendency to sell or express skepticism during these emotional lows gives opportunity for smart traders to accumulate at lower prices before the next uptrend. Santiment’s comment on X noted that crypto prices tend to move opposite to retail expectations, with similar FUD being a good sign of a potential breakout. This means that the current surge in bearish chatter might actually point to an upcoming rally, especially if a Spot XRP ETF is launched in October. Despite its price struggles and losing both $3 and $2.9 in the past 48 hours, the altcoin has managed to hold above $2.8, which has proven to be one of the most important supports since August, alongside $2.72. Therefore, XRP’s ability to hold above its short-term support around $2.80 despite mounting negative sentiment reinforces the idea that downside pressure could soon exhaust itself and pave the way for a bounce to retest $3.10. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.87, down by 3.3% in a 24-hour timeframe.",XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 23:00:39

Related Reading: Ethereum Faces TD Sell Signal At Key Resistance—$4,100 Next? The catalyst stack is clear: Mantle unveiled a compliance-first Real-World Assets (RWA) “Tokenization-as-a-Service” suite at Token2049, positioning the L2 as one of the few ecosystems building institutional-grade RWA rails. Momentum accelerated as World Liberty Financial confirmed its USD1 stablecoin, currently the #6 stablecoin with $2.6 billion cap, will launch on Mantle, a credibility boost for the network’s DeFi and payments footprint. A deeper “Mantle × Bybit Roadmap” adds distribution as Bybit processes over $30 billion in daily volume, offering Mantle instant visibility to a global trading base. Despite Profit-Taking, Volumes, Futures, and Liquidity Show Real Demand Recently, Spot activity has exploded as daily volume climbed from $125M in early September to over $612 million, while market cap nearly doubled to $7.3 billion, lifting Mantle into the top 35. Derivatives confirm conviction, open interest rose 26% to $4.85 billion, and funding stayed positive for nearly two weeks. On the chart, MNT invalidated a textbook bearish rising-wedge by breaking upward, then stacked short-term MAs above long-term, with a 50/200-day “golden cross” and a bullish MACD backdrop to match the narrative. One yellow flag, “smart money” holdings slid 49% over 30 days to 18.1 million MNT (Nansen), implying selective profit-taking into strength. That doesn’t break the uptrend, but it does argue for disciplined risk management and attention to spot-led versus leverage-led pushes. Key levels: Can Mantle (MNT) Clear $2.60 and Open a Path to $3? Technically, MNT’s structure remains constructive. Immediate support sits near $2.00–$2.10 (watch the $2.09 gap); holding above keeps the higher-low sequence intact. Overhead, $2.60 is the next inflection and a psychological line in the sand; a high-volume daily close above $2.60 would set up a measured move toward $2.85–$3.00. MNT's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: MNTUSD on Tradingview Failure to reclaim $2.60 on rising volume raises the odds of a reset into the $2.20s, where bulls will try to defend momentum against the backdrop of a softer crypto tape. Why it matters: RWAs are moving from narrative to implementation, and Mantle has planted a flag with compliance tooling, stablecoin depth (USD1), and CEX–L2 integration.

The only fight left on the table was over whether they should aim for two or three cuts. The September 16–17 meeting closed with an 11–1 vote for a quarter-point reduction, dropping the federal funds rate to a 4%–4.25% target range, and setting the stage for more easing at the October and December meetings. The official record said: “In considering the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants noted that, with the reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, the Committee was well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.” Another passage read that: “Participants expressed a range of views about the degree to which the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and about the likely future path of policy. Most judged that it likely would be appropriate to ease policy further over the remainder of this year.” Officials argue over cuts and Miran breaks ranks, as expected The September session showed just how split officials were on the path ahead. Out of 19 officials, including 12 voting members, a tight 10–9 majority supported cutting at both of the last two meetings of the year. Projections also pointed to one more cut in 2026 and another in 2027, before stabilizing long-term policy around 3%. The meeting was the first for Governor Steve Miran, sworn in hours before talks began. Miran made himself the lone dissent by pushing for a half-point cut instead of the quarter-point that was approved. His vote was recorded in the post-meeting statement. Later, Miran told reporters he was the lone “dot” on the forecast chart calling for a more aggressive path of easing compared with everyone else on the committee. While Miran wanted deeper reductions, some argued for restraint. The minutes recorded, “Some participants noted that, by several measures, financial conditions suggested that monetary policy may not be particularly restrictive, which they judged as warranting a cautious approach in the consideration of future policy changes.” Labor weakness, tariff debate, and shutdown risks Concerns over jobs were central. Officials said the labor market was weakening while inflation risks had either stayed the same or decreased. They explained: “Participants generally noted that their judgments about this meeting’s appropriate policy action reflected a change in the balance of risks. In particular, most participants observed that it was appropriate to move the target range for the federal funds rate toward a more neutral setting because they judged that downside risks to employment had increased over the intermeeting period and that upside risks to inflation had either diminished or not increased.” President Donald Trump’s tariffs also came up. The consensus was that his levies had raised prices this year but would not fuel lasting inflation. That cleared the way for more easing without fear of long-term price spikes. Survey data from the Fed’s primary dealers backed the committee’s thinking. “Almost all respondents to the Desk survey expected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and around half expected an additional cut at the October meeting,” the minutes said. “The vast majority of survey respondents expected at least two 25 basis point cuts by year-end, with around half expecting three cuts over that time.” For the uninitiated, one basis point equals 0.01%, meaning 25 basis points equals 0.25%. The shutdown in Washington was another challenge. With the Labor Department and Commerce Department closed, officials are not getting new updates on inflation, unemployment, or consumer spending. The minutes warned that if the government is still closed by the October 28–29 meeting, the board will be “flying blind” with no new data to guide decisions. Market expectations are clear despite the chaos. Pricing shows a near certainty of two more cuts this year, according to the CME FedWatchTool.

After ruling over more than 90% of the GPU market used for AI, the company now faces a serious challenger; AMD. On Monday, AMD announced it’s selling billions of dollars’ worth of GPUs to OpenAI, a move that throws it into direct competition with Nvidia in the most valuable tech race happening today. This new deal comes nearly 30 years after Intel relied on AMD to dodge monopoly accusations.Now Nvidia finds itself in a similar spot.AMD, once again, is stepping in as the alternative. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh said it straight: “Right now, Nvidia almost has a monopoly, with AMD having a low-single-digit share in the $250 billion market” for AI data center chips. AMD gets boost after OpenAI move Until now, OpenAI and Nvidia have basically shaped the whole AI era. Nvidia’s GPU dominance drove its market cap to $4.5 trillion. Meanwhile, OpenAI, thanks to ChatGPT and huge data center plans, has hit a $500 billion private valuation. The two are deeply tied; Nvidia is a major investor in OpenAI and recently pledged up to $100 billion toward building OpenAI’s infrastructure. But AMD’s stock exploded 24% on Monday, its biggest single-day gain in 22 years. It jumped 4% Tuesday, then another 11% Wednesday, pushing its market cap to $380 billion. That’s a 43% jump in one week, putting it on pace for its best run since 2016. And this time, the surge isn’t built on hype. It’s backed by a contract that’s expected to deliver “double digit billions” in revenue to AMD, starting in the second half of next year. If AMD stock hits certain price targets, OpenAI could own up to 10% of the company. CEO Lisa Su called the deal a “win-win” and said OpenAI’s commitment shows AMD’s chips are finally fast enough, and priced right, to compete. She added that it’s a “clear signal” AMD’s software and hardware are ready for “the most demanding at-scale deployments.” Nvidia faces political heat as AMD steps up Nvidia’s dominance hasn’t gone unnoticed. Last year, around the end of the Biden administration, the Justice Department reportedly subpoenaed Nvidia, though the company denied it. Senator Elizabeth Warren backed the probe, claiming Nvidia’s rise was “supercharged by anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation.” Nvidia’s response? It said it wins on merit. The OpenAI-AMD deal also helps OpenAI distance itself from any one supplier. CEO Sam Altman posted that AMD chips will be “incremental” to its Nvidia orders, and stressed that more compute is needed across the board. On CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the deal was “unique and surprising,” adding, “I’m surprised that they would give away 10% of the company before they even built it.” Alden Abbott, a former FTC general counsel, said there’s no sign of monopolization or cartel behavior here. “None of these things are, as far as I’m aware, exclusive contracts tying up avenues to other competitors,” he said. AMD, for its part, has always tried to downplay a direct fight with Nvidia. But the company now estimates that the AI chip market could be worth $500 billion by 2028. This OpenAI deal is already expected to bring in tens of billions of dollars, and it might just rewrite the rules of the game.

Each of these tokens has dipped over the past 24 hours and week, giving back some momentum after Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $126,000 . Yet all three are still sitting in oversold zones , setting the stage for a strong rebound in the days ahead. In this article, we break down the technical outlook for each – and at the end, reveal one early-stage, low-cap gem currently in presale that could explode once it hits exchanges. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Incoming ETFs and Dip Provide Conditions for Massive Rebound XRP has fallen again today, with its drop to $2.87 making for a 3% fall in 24 hours and a 2% drop in a week. Despite these losses, XRP’s fundamental position is still bullish, with the coin looking forward to the launch of numerous XRP ETFs in the next few weeks. These will drive institutional demand to XRP, boosting its price in the way ETFs have boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum. On top of this, Ripple’s growth in recent months – via acquisitions , partnerships and expansions – has also boosted the case for XRP, which will benefit from the growth in Ripple’s cross-border payments business. And if we look at its chart, we see that it’s still in the position of waiting for a breakout. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) are both in middling positions, having been negative for most of the period since late July. As such, a rally is well overdue, and once the first XRP ETFs begin to launch, the coin’s price could rise to $3.50 very quickly. It could then go on to finish the year above $5 , as part of a longer term climb towards $10 . Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Grayscale ETF Could Help Altcoin Reach New Highs Cardano has fallen by 4% in the past 24 hours, while its current price of $0.8248 represents a 2% loss in the last 30 days. These may be disappointing percentages, but Cardano is another major token that has been sitting in an oversold position for too long. And while it doesn’t boast as many upcoming ETFs as XRP or Solana, for example, the Grayscale multi-crypto ETF will include the altcoin, something which should help it rise over the coming weeks. Its chart today also features indicators that have been subdued for a couple of months, again implying that a rally should be arriving sooner or later. Source: TradingView ADA has also been trading with a pennant, which is now converging to a point where the altcoin may make a big move, potentially upwards. And longer term, Cardano’s status as a major layer-one network should help the ADA price to continue rising. It could reach $1 in the next few weeks, before r eaching $4+ by December . Crypto Price Prediction: Pepe ($PEPE) – Overselling and Whale Accumulation Point to Incoming Rebound Pepe is one of the biggest losers today among top-100 tokens, having dropped by 6%. And at $0.000009353, it also happens to be down by 8% in a month and by 3% in the past year. Given that most major coins are up in the last 12 months, this latter percentage may be disconcerting, inviting fears that Pepe is starting to fall out of ‘fashion’ as a meme coin. Its chart supports this misgiving to some extent, seeing as how it has struggled to break out of a descending channel since the middle of May. On the other hand, its oversold RSI and MACD indicators could be taken as a sign that a rebound is coming. Source: TradingView And while its trading volume is a modest $693 million today, we have seen a few whales accumulating the token in recent weeks (e.g. here and here ). This raises hope that PEPE will rally strongly again once the market enters a bull rally, which it could do as and when the first wave of altcoin ETFs begin launching. In such a context, the PEPE price could reach $0.00002 by November, while ending the year close to $0.00005. PEPENODE Could Be the Big Meme Coin of 2026: Presale Raises $1.7 Million The crypto price prediction for the coins above look very bullish right now, with the market poised for an end-of-year rally. But major tokens won’t be the only cryptos to benefit from such a rally, with certain newer tokens – including presale coins – likely to outperform the market. One promising new token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a mine-to-earn cryptocurrency that recently opened its presale. Building a Server Room AND Virtual Mining?! Yes Please. Let the $PEPENODE flow https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/jN00FsQ3UQ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 7, 2025 It has now raised just over $1.7 million in this sale, indicating how popular it’s already becoming, and how popular it could become once it launches. What’s interesting about PEPENODE is its mine-to-earn feature, which invites users to build their own virtual mining rigs. Instead of requiring you to buy and own expensing equipment, the project enables you to buy virtual nodes simply by spending PEPENODE. The more nodes you own, the greater your mining rewards will be, with PEPENODE paying out such rewards in the form of other meme tokens, including Pepe and Fartcoin. On top of this, holders of PEPENODE will be able to stake the token, which currently offers APY in the region of 740%. This all makes the coin potentially very profitable, with investors able to join its sale by going to the official PEPENODE website . It’s currently selling at $0.0010918, although this price will rise again tomorrow.

Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $421 million in inflows on October 7, extending a seven-day institutional buying streak that tightened circulating supply and helped ETH consolidate near $4,450, supporting a potential recovery toward the $4,900–$5,000 range. Spot ETFs added $421M on Oct 7, marking seven straight days of inflows. Exchange reserves fell to 17.4 million ETH, the lowest since 2022, highlighting reduced available supply.

Ethereum ETF inflows surge $421M on Oct 7, tightening supply and supporting price consolidation—read expert analysis and trade signals now. What is driving Ethereum’s recent strength? Spot Ethereum ETF inflows are the primary driver of recent strength, supplying steady institutional demand that absorbs circulating ETH and lifts accumulation by public entities. Exchange reserves have dropped sharply, reinforcing a tighter supply backdrop while technical setups show balanced momentum near $4,450. How large were the ETF inflows and what do they mean for supply? On October 7, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $421 million in net inflows, continuing a seven-day streak. Combined ETF holdings exceeded $30 billion, with roughly $803 million added in the prior month. These flows coincide with exchange reserves declining to 17.4 million ETH from 28.8 million three years ago, indicating institutional and corporate accumulation reduced liquid supply. Frequently Asked Questions How does ETF accumulation affect Ethereum price dynamics? ETF accumulation can reduce circulating supply and increase demand stability, particularly when combined with on-chain burning mechanisms. With ETFs holding a growing share of available ETH, short-term liquidity tightens, which can support higher price floors during market stress. What on-chain metrics best show reduced supply pressure? Exchange reserves and public company holdings are key metrics. Reserves at 17.4 million ETH are at three-year lows, while public companies hold about 3.6 million ETH. EIP-1559 burns also remove ETH from circulation, contributing to a gradual deflationary trend.

Ethereum traded around $4,443 at the time of reporting, down 5.3% over 24 hours but up 7% for the week and 3.4% for the month. The price sits roughly 10% below an August peak near $4,946. Weekly intraday ranges (about $4,133–$4,748) indicate consolidation rather than a decisive trend change. Trading volume increased 27% to $51.9 billion, suggesting sustained market participation. Futures volume rose 54% to $124.2 billion while open interest fell 5.5% to $60.3 billion (Coinglass data), implying leveraged positions were reduced ahead of potential renewed stability. Technical indicators: When could Ethereum test prior highs? Ethereum is holding short-term support near $4,313 with immediate resistance around $4,731 (upper Bollinger Band). The Relative Strength Index sits near 53, signaling balanced momentum. If buyers push above $4,700 and sustain volume, a retest of $4,900–$5,000 becomes likely. Conversely, a break below $4,300 may expose downside toward $3,900. Key Takeaways ETF inflows matter : $421M on Oct 7 extended a 7-day buying streak, tightening supply. Supply tightened : Exchange reserves dropped to 17.4M ETH, lowest since 2022. Technical balance : Momentum is neutral; a move above $4,700 could trigger a push toward $5,000. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent resilience is anchored in robust institutional demand from spot ETFs and declining exchange reserves, reinforcing a tighter supply outlook. Technical indicators show consolidation with upside potential if inflows and buying pressure continue.

According to Bloomberg , the new role, referred to as a “digital markets champion,” will be tasked with coordinating private sector initiatives around tokenization of wholesale financial instruments. The official will focus on aligning technical development with regulatory priorities across the financial system. UK to Appoint Digital Markets Champion Rigby’s comments were delivered during the Digital Assets Week conference in London. She also announced the formation of a new group, the Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce, which will oversee the shift away from paper-based shareholding. The taskforce will focus on replacing physical share certificates and improving the efficiency of market infrastructure. The tokenization plan is part of the government’s Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy, first outlined in July. That strategy includes the development of blockchain-based sovereign debt instruments, referred to as digital gilts under the “DIGIT” framework. Rigby confirmed that the UK has opened a procurement process to select technology providers for digital gilt issuance. These digital instruments will function as official representations of UK sovereign debt on distributed ledger systems. Tokenization Competition Intensifies Countries including France, Singapore, and the United States are also exploring tokenization frameworks for public and private sector securities. The UK’s latest move is positioned within that wider trend, with emphasis on compatibility between emerging platforms and existing legal structures. While regulatory and institutional engagement remains focused on wholesale markets, there is growing discussion around whether similar frameworks might eventually extend to retail-facing financial services. Questions of access, interoperability, and settlement speed will likely surface as tokenization pilots evolve into operational systems. Some industry observers see the UK’s efforts as an early test of how blockchain infrastructure could reshape post-trade workflows. If successful, these initiatives may influence how custodians, clearinghouses, and regulators approach infrastructure upgrades across traditional and decentralized markets.

Naver is the country’s biggest and most prominent internet firm, South Korea’s answer to Google. Upbit, meanwhile, has cornered some 72% of the domestic crypto market . Dunamu Naver Merger: 5 Legal Obstacles A Dunamu-Naver merger could create a crypto-tech behemoth on a scale previously unseen in the East Asian market. However, the South Korean newspaper Hanguk Kyungjae identified several issues that stand in the way of the alliance, despite the merger talk leaving the tech and crypto sectors “abuzz.” It called these legal hurdles “significant,” and added that “policy uncertainties” could also undermine the bid. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit in the past week. (Source: CoinGecko) Hurdle 1: Tradfi Regulations In late 2017, South Korean regulators imposed a rule effectively barring traditional financial companies from doing crypto-related business. Although they never enshrined this in national law, financial industry guidelines still exclude the possibility of banks and other lenders providing crypto-related services. Naver wants to merge its Naver Financial unit with Dunamu. The former is classified as an electronic financial service provider under the terms of the Electronic Financial Transactions Act. Regulators would, in theory, need to modify their guidelines for the merger to go ahead as currently proposed. The Dunamu Chairman Song Chi-hyung speaking at Seoul National University in 2021. (Source: Seoul National University/Seoul Kyungjae/YouTube/Screenshot) Hurdle 2: Stablecoin Legislation Uncertainty Domestic market observers think that one of the key goals of a Naver-Dunamu merger centers on the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins and the expansion of the payment ecosystem. If Naver’s existing Naver Pay platform could make use of a KRW-pegged coin, the firm could expand its presence in the payments market. However, politicians and regulators remain divided on several key stablecoin-related matters , despite President Lee Jae-myung’s intention to legalize KRW-pegged tokens. The central Bank of Korea (BOK) has taken a cautious stance, insisting that only commercial banks or consortia where banks are majority stakeholders should be allowed to issue stablecoins. But some politicians want to allow fintech firms and other IT players to issue their own tokens. Should the BOK get its way, this could prove a setback. The newspaper wrote: “A bank-centric structure would likely force the Naver-Dunamu alliance to participate solely as a technological and operational partner in a bank-led consortium, rather than directly as an issuer.” Hurdle 3: A Conflict of Interests? If the Naver-Dunamu alliance issues a KRW-pegged stablecoin, the new firm could struggle to list this token on Upbit. The terms of the Virtual Assets Act explicitly prohibit exchanges from listing or trading coins that they or their affiliates have issued. If this proves to be a major problem, the new company could explore workarounds, such as listing on other domestic and international exchanges. But such a step would “significantly diminish” the impact of the merger, the newspaper added. Dunamu's long-held ambitions for a Nasdaq listing are regaining momentum, as ongoing merger talks with Naver Financial raise the possibility of a more competitive corporate valuation, analysts said Wednesday. https://t.co/pDJEMucxyx — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) October 2, 2025 Hurdle 4: Stock Market Setbacks? A merger could see Naver restructure Naver Financial and look to list it on the NASDAQ exchange alongside Dunamu. The newspaper explained that both companies have “actively incorporated overseas listings and split listing scenarios into their mid- to long-term strategies.” But recent revisions to the Commercial Act and the Capital Markets Act have bolstered minority shareholder protection. The amended acts stipulate that in corporate restructuring processes, including mergers, spin-offs, and IPOs, minority shareholders must receive “fair value” offers for their holdings. Experts believe that class action or shareholder derivative suits could follow if existing minority shareholders are not offered a suitably advantageous financial package. At Token2049 Singapore, one question kept coming up from foreign attendees. “So, Naver acquired Upbit. Is that like Binance buying CoinMarketCap?” At first glance, it might look similar, a big platform buying a crypto company. But… pic.twitter.com/6MPlkw2Atf — Professor Jo (@0xProfessorJo) October 5, 2025 Hurdle 5: Governance structure questions Speculation is rife that Naver’s Global Investment Officer and Chairman Lee Hae-jin has earmarked Dunamu’s Chairman Song Chi-hyung as his successor. This has led to further speculation that Song could eventually become Naver’s largest single shareholder. Song currently holds over a quarter of Dunamu’s shares. The newspaper explained: “Dunamu, which generates approximately 1 trillion won [$702.2 million] per year in net profits, is unlikely to agree to a merger deal without a ‘carrot’ like securing management right or becoming the largest individual shareholder.” However, market regulations would stipulate that various compliance-related matters must first be satisfied. This could prove far from straightforward. The transfer of management rights to Chi or installing him as the largest individual shareholder is “unlikely to be achieved through a simple stock transaction,” the newspaper concluded. Only time will tell if Naver and Dunamu have what it takes to overcome these obstacles and pull off what would undoubtedly become East Asia’s biggest IT-sector merger in recent years.

Analysts now discuss where the next moves could come from with XRP , Avalanche , and even MAGACOIN FINANCE drawing new attention from investors looking for hedge and diversification options in this fast-changing market. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can BTC Stay Above $120K? Bitcoin briefly touched a record high of $126,000 earlier this week before easing to $122,784 , down about 1.7% . The retrace followed a wave of profit-taking and a stronger U.S. dollar that weighed on so-called “debasement trades.” Despite this, Bitcoin still gained 6% over the past week and remains in a clear uptrend. Analysts credit inflows into Bitcoin ETFs , which hit $1.2 billion in a single day . This shows that both retail and institutional investors continue to see BTC as a store of value in times of fiscal uncertainty. The Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut also boosted sentiment, pushing the Fear and Greed Index from 34 to 62 . As long as the U.S. government shutdown keeps pressure on the dollar, BTC may continue to act as a safe harbor , holding above the $120,000 zone . If inflows continue and risk appetite returns, analysts see a short-term path toward $130,000 . Traders are now watching today’s Fed meeting minutes for cues on policy direction. XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Sees Path to $5 Analyst Professor Astrones described XRP’s setup as “pumpy,” expecting a move toward $5 . The token trades near $2.97 , holding above the key zone between $2.60 and $2.80 . The price has stayed steady there for weeks, suggesting consistent buying activity. Astrones highlights a tightening triangle pattern on XRP’s chart that could soon break upward. A push past $3.66 may trigger the next leg to $4.50 or even $5 , which would put XRP’s value near half of Ethereum’s market cap . Other analysts, including CryptoWZRD and EGRAG , agree that the structure supports further upside. As long as XRP remains above its long-term rising line near $2.50–$3.00 , the trend stays positive. Sentiment in the XRP community has turned more confident as traders prepare for what they call a “quiet build-up before the next explosion”. If momentum continues, XRP could reclaim its all-time highs soon. Avalanche Price Prediction: Developer Growth Fuels Confidence Avalanche (AVAX) has been trading near $30 , consolidating after a sharp climb. Analysts say this zone could act as a springboard for another move higher. Recent data shows over 44 million contracts deployed on Avalanche — triple the figure from a year ago. This surge reflects developer expansion and growing liquidity across its ecosystem. Analysts say this kind of network growth usually draws more applications and usage, which often lifts the price. Some chart watchers see a bullish flag formation pointing toward a $108 target , while others project shorter-term moves to $50–$60 if activity continues to rise. Daily volumes are also nearing the $1 trillion mark, showing strong market participation. Analyst Daniel Ramsey believes the key now is maintaining stability above $30, which could set up Avalanche for a sustained climb. The next few weeks may determine if AVAX can convert that setup into a breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Underrated Altcoin for Diversification Amid rising prices across Bitcoin, XRP, and Avalanche, some investors are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE — a community-led altcoin currently trading under $0.0006 . Its scarcity and fair supply model are catching the eye of buyers who missed earlier crypto runs. Many view MAGACOIN as a strategic hedge and a safe haven when larger tokens face corrections. The attraction lies in its simple value structure, transparent approach, and the opportunity to enter early before wider listings. Imagine a move from $0.0006 to even $0.1 — that narrative alone is sparking curiosity among investors seeking the next smart entry point in 2025. Transparency First: MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads With Certified Audit Results MAGACOIN FINANCE’s completed HashEx audit and upcoming CertiK verification highlight its focus on transparency and security. What Traders Should Do Next Analysts agree this market favors diversification and timing . Traders watching Bitcoin’s $120K level and XRP’s $3 range can also explore smaller altcoins showing transparency and early adoption — like MAGACOIN FINANCE .

52867108,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85775,1759966241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Poised For $11 Price Rally,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-poised-for-11-price-rally/,"Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, has provided a new set of XRP price targets derived from Fibonacci extension levels, offering insights into potential future movements of the asset as it consolidates near the $3 region. Despite the recent market recovery led by Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB, XRP has remained under pressure. After peaking at $3.66 in July 2025, the token has struggled to maintain momentum, dropping to $2.88 amid renewed bearish sentiment. The downturn has coincided with growing fear among retail investors, reflected in a six-month high in FUD metrics . XRP’s Current Technical Position During an interview on the Thinking Crypto podcast hosted by Tony Edward, Franzen characterized XRP’s recent consolidation as a coiling phase, a period of tight price movement that often precedes a significant breakout. He reviewed XRP’s performance from December 2024 to July 2025, noting a pattern of consecutive higher highs. The asset first climbed to $2.9 in December 2024, later advancing to $3.4 in January 2025, and eventually touching $3.66 by July. These incremental gains, he said, reflect a constructive longer-term structure despite short-term declines. However, since July, XRP’s movement has tightened, producing a sequence of lower highs. Franzen believes this development suggests a temporary cooling phase rather than the beginning of a broader downtrend. He emphasized that the market could be consolidating before another attempt at a sustained upward move. Projected XRP Price Levels Franzen’s Fibonacci analysis identifies several potential price targets if XRP resumes its uptrend. Based on the 161.8% Fibonacci extension, he expects XRP could advance toward $4.40, while the 261.8% extension points to $6. Applying the same Fibonacci method to the broader consolidation range between first-quarter highs and lows, he derived even more ambitious targets of $5.40 and $11.55. Franzen stressed that these projections remain valid only if XRP holds above $2.68, which he identified as a key support level. A decisive drop below this zone, he added, would invalidate the bullish setup and could signal the need for traders to reassess their exposure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Diverging Analyst Opinions Other analysts have offered mixed short-term perspectives on XRP’s movement. Market commentator DustyBC observed that XRP recently experienced a wave of selling pressure following brief gains. He attributed the correction partly to renewed strength in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), explaining that such pullbacks are typical after extended rallies. According to DustyBC , XRP’s price is now positioned within a support range between $2.8 and $2.9, an area he had previously identified. He added that the ongoing wave structure remains incomplete until XRP surpasses the upper boundary of its recent consolidation. Similarly, analyst Lark Davis highlighted XRP’s difficulty in breaking above its descending resistance line. Davis noted that a confirmed breakout beyond the $3 level could trigger a push toward $4. Conversely, failure to do so might lead the token to retest the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at around $2.94 for potential support. Meanwhile, trader Matt Hughes expressed optimism about XRP’s resilience at current levels. He remarked that the asset’s ability to remain stable despite market volatility suggests underlying strength. Hughes predicted that once XRP successfully clears the $3.21 resistance area, a stronger breakout could follow. Franzen’s Fibonacci-based outlook, combined with the varied short-term assessments from other analysts, reflects an uncertain but closely watched phase for XRP. While the broader sentiment remains cautious, the token’s historical tendency to recover strongly after consolidation has kept long-term expectations alive among bullish traders.

Just days after launching its mainnet, Plasma has already climbed to the 5th largest DeFi chain , with $6.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) . At the same time, stablecoin reserves have risen to $5.3 billion , showing sustained capital inflows and rising confidence in the ecosystem. This may be the fastest rise to the top the DeFi space has ever seen, highlighting just how much demand there is for Plasma’s purpose-built lending platform. Within AAVE , Plasma has already attracted $6.7 billion in deposits , with $2.15 billion actively borrowed by users. Its lending vault is offering a highly attractive 9.92% APY , drawing in both retail and institutional capital. Meanwhile, fresh data from Nansen shows that transaction volume on Plasma has surged by 5,000% in just the past 30 days, signaling explosive growth in user activity. Plasma Price Prediction: Descending Triangle Breakout Sets the Stage for Big Gains Just two days ago, XPL broke out of a descending triangle pattern on the hourly chart, signaling a potential short-term trend reversal. The price briefly pulled back after touching the 200-period EMA , but is now retesting its former trendline resistance from above – a bullish setup that could lead to a fresh breakout. If XPL bounces off this key level, a move toward $1 per token looks likely, offering a 15% short-term upside from current levels. Looking further ahead, Plasma’s rapidly growing on-chain metrics point to a potential move back to $1.70 or higher , representing a possible 95% gain based on today’s price. And while large-cap tokens like XPL show strength, some of the best-performing opportunities this cycle may come from top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) .

The semiconductor companies affected by the October 7 report include ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, KLA Corp, and Lam Research. According to the report, these companies walked away with significant profits for selling to Chinese state-owned and military-linked firms, raising the potential for new U.S. export restrictions to be rolled out. No laws were directly broken. However, the prospect of tighter controls has triggered market reactions, causing shares to fall as much as 7.1% in Amsterdam on Wednesday morning in what is being called the biggest intraday drop since July. It has since pared some of the losses and is up 14% over the last year. Shares in the other semiconductor equipment companies are also trading lower. Chip makers implicated in US committee report ASML is the world’s only producer of cutting-edge lithography machines required to produce high-end chips used in electric vehicles and military gear. Unfortunately, the company has struggled to sell its most advanced machines to China because of US-led export restrictions. Last year, the Dutch government also restricted sales of ASML’s second-most advanced machines, immersion deep ultraviolet lithography systems, to China after getting pressured by the Biden administration. Despite the restrictions, China has emerged as ASML’s second-largest market after Taiwan, accounting for 27% of its net system sales in the second quarter, primarily through less advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) machines. Applied Materials is projected to lose $710 million in revenue next year due to the new U.S. export rules expanding restrictions on Chinese clients, as China accounts for over a third of its revenue. The committee wants President Donald Trump’s administration to “dramatically expand country-wide bans and licensing requirements” on tool exports to China. To be clear, the committee has no power to impose those restrictions on its own, and the US Commerce Department is not mandated to follow its recommendations. However, the call to action has raised concerns that further export bans are in the pipeline. The semiconductor industry is caught between warring factions The battle over computer chips by the current world powers is intensifying and the semiconductor industry has been a major target. As tensions between China and the US ramp up, the industry continues to face greater restrictions and the fact that there is a new president in the White House has not changed that. In fact, last month, the US scrapped Biden-era authorizations that allowed ASML customers Samsung Electronics Co., SK Hynix Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to transport supplies to Chinese factories without needing Washington’s permission each time. This is because many lawmakers in the US believe that China’s advance in manufacturing chips “poses threats” to US national security. To that end the Trump administration has even taken a stake in struggling American chipmaker Intel Corp. in the hopes of supporting a national champion that can compete with Asia’s giant manufacturers on an equal footing. In the meantime, China has been playing catch up where cutting-edge chip technology is concerned, with the government pushing local tech companies to develop advanced AI processors that can compete with those produced by US giant Nvidia Corp. Huawei is now building a shadow manufacturing network of semiconductor-fabrication facilities across the country. In September, it publicly laid out a three-year roadmap for chip development and unveiled new technology, from memory chips to AI accelerators, designed to compete with the most powerful Nvidia products. Also, despite the chip restrictions, Chinese companies have still been able to make strides in AI. In January, Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek released an AI model that held its ground against the best offerings from US rivals OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. while boasting it was developed at a fraction of the cost. The breakthrough re-energized the Chinese tech community and was touted by national media as a monumental achievement in the face of US containment efforts.

For now, the cryptocurrency has failed to break out above the upper band with strength, despite reaching an all-time high of $126,000 earlier this week. According to past local consolidation ranges, “it could take as long as a hundred days to get a valid breakout (or breakdown, if BTC dumps instead),” he said. Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool used to measure market volatility and identify potential overbought or oversold conditions in assets. Potential to Go Parabolic The analyst added that expanding from a squeeze setup like this can lead to “head fakes,” which we might have seen with the latest move. “We also might see another head fake down from here before eventually taking off higher,” he said before adding: “This has the potential to send Bitcoin parabolic, or put an end to the three-year mature bull rally.” Chief strategist at Satsuma Technology, Mark Moss, said that Bitcoin breaking out to new peaks still doesn’t look anywhere near cycle peaks, “while external fundamentals are looking hot.” “Unlike 2021, the Fed is not tightening; they are loosening, ETFs and BTC [treasury companies] are creating the greatest demand shock, and the world has woken up to the ‘debasement trade’.” Uptober Still On Track Despite today’s 2.5% pullback to the $121,000 level, Bitcoin’s ‘Uptober’ is still on track with the asset up 7% so far this month. BTC has gained in 10 of the past 12 Octobers and 8 of the past 12 fourth quarters, according to Coinglass. Meanwhile, analyst ‘Sykodelic’ is one of many who claim that the four-year cycle is no more. “The clear fact here is that Bitcoin has a fairly large area in which to expand before it would recent the end of its price cycle,” he said on Wednesday. “I would not be surprised if Bitcoin will NOT drop below $100k again, as we see $100k resistance turn into $100k support,” said Stock-to-Flow model creator ‘Plan B’. The September close was the fifth month in a row in six figures, and the same happened with $10, $100, $1,000, and $10,000, he added.

Saad Ahmed, Gemini’s head of Asia Pacific, said that crypto adoption in Australia is “quite significant, somewhere in the range of 23 to 25%,” leaving the exchange with “headroom for growth.” To grant access to local payment rails, the exchange announced on Thursday that it has established a local corporation registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the nation’s financial intelligence agency. Gemini, which offers trading on a limited number of assets and has few and costly payment methods, has been accessible to Australians since August 2019 as part of its global operation. Gemini establishes local entity to strengthen presence in Australia The creation of a local entity marks a significant step in Gemini’s regional expansion. Ahmed stated that by using Gemini Intergalactic Australia as its registered local organization, it no longer has to tread carefully on the legal tightrope when it comes to marketing, integrating local payment rails, and providing financial services to Australians. “We’re changing that because we think Australia is a market that we want to be in, and it’s a market that we want to grow, so we’re going to build a local team here,” he said. The company will be based out of Sydney and has appointed James Logan, who previously led the local entities of rival exchanges Luno and Bitget, to head its Australian operation. According to Ahmed, the exchange is working on obtaining an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) to offer services such as cryptocurrency staking and credit card services. “We’re not going to have all of the products that we offer in the US, for example, the credit card and staking, out of the gate, but we’re working on it,” he said. Gemini adopts a wait-and-see approach to Australia’s crypto regulations While Gemini’s founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, are known for their active engagement in US policy, Saad Ahmed indicated that the company’s Australian arm will adopt a more reserved stance. Rather than lobbying, Gemini plans to observe the government’s consultation on new crypto regulations. Last month, the Albanese government released draft legislation aimed at strengthening oversight of crypto exchanges and requiring companies to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL). The proposals have been met with cautious optimism by the local industry. Ahmed noted that there will be some back-and-forth between the industry and the government for a while. He continued to say Gemini will likely take the position of just observing and seeing how things unfold over the next few months. “There’s limited upside for us to respond to the laws that have come out,” he said. “There is an existing ecosystem here, we’re somebody new that’s coming in, and we just want to make sure that we’re building and focused on our customers.” Ahmed added that they believed they would be well-prepared for whatever regulations come into effect and would be able to comply with them. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently reached a preliminary settlement with Gemini regarding all allegations that the cryptocurrency platform failed to register a cryptocurrency asset lending program before offering it to retail investors. According to reports, the settlement resolves the agency’s lawsuit over the Gemini Earn program. According to a letter filed in a Manhattan federal court, lawyers representing both parties indicated that the settlement would “completely resolve” the lawsuit. However, it was still subject to approval by the SEC. Reports indicate that the lawyers requested that the US District Judge Edgardo Ramos grant them up to December 15 to submit their final paperwork and put all deadlines on hold.

After weeks of relentless Bitcoin strength, smart investors are quietly moving capital into altcoins, anticipating the next major phase of the 2025 bull market. The strategy follows a familiar pattern: Bitcoin ignites the rally, but it’s Ethereum, BNB, and select emerging tokens that often deliver the cycle’s largest percentage gains. Data from CryptoQuant shows that while Bitcoin inflows into spot ETFs remain strong, on-chain transaction volume has started to plateau, a classic early signal of market rotation. Historically, when BTC dominance stabilizes above 52%, funds begin flowing downstream toward high-conviction altcoins. This week, both Ethereum and BNB are showing signs of renewed strength, while analysts are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE the “hidden gem” of the current rotation, a project marrying structure with speculation, and timing the cycle perfectly. The Rotation Playbook: How Smart Money Moves Every major bull market follows a predictable rhythm. Bitcoin rallies first, capturing institutional capital and restoring broad confidence. Then, liquidity expands into Ethereum, the foundational Layer 1 ecosystem for decentralized finance. Finally, retail traders – drawn by higher upside – rotate into emerging altcoins and presales with exponential potential. We’re now entering that second phase. Ethereum’s network activity has risen 12% this week, with new addresses and staking volume increasing as investors anticipate renewed momentum in DeFi and NFT markets. Meanwhile, BNB continues to reclaim relevance after Binance’s renewed global compliance initiatives, positioning itself once again as a bridge between retail adoption and institutional utility. This shifting capital landscape is setting the stage for high-upside plays. Traders know that after Bitcoin’s dominance peaks, the biggest returns often emerge from projects still under the radar, like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum and BNB Regain the Spotlight Ethereum remains the undisputed backbone of blockchain development. With Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and Base now surpassing $20 billion in total value locked , ETH’s utility narrative is gaining renewed traction. Developers are also preparing for the upcoming “Pectra” upgrade , which aims to streamline wallet interactions and smart contract usability – both crucial for onboarding mainstream users. At the same time, BNB has quietly evolved from an exchange token into a full-fledged ecosystem. Binance Smart Chain continues to rank among the most active networks by daily transactions, attracting developers seeking affordable alternatives to Ethereum. Institutional desks are now beginning to re-enter BNB positions, noting its consistent deflationary burns and liquidity strength. But even as these large-cap assets dominate headlines, smaller projects are stealing speculative momentum. The search for the next 20×–50× return has never been stronger – and analysts agree one emerging contender stands out. With Bitcoin profits peaking and institutional inflows slowing, smart investors are rotating into altcoins offering sharper risk-reward setups. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the prime target of that rotation, a presale project now modeled for 900%–1,400% ROI based on early-stage metrics and exchange momentum. The PATRIOT50X bonus code remains one of the market’s most discussed early-access advantages, granting users expanded allocations before the next pricing tier. Analysts compare MAGACOIN FINANCE’s setup to early SHIB and DOGE phases, but with stronger fundamentals and verified transparency. Its scarcity mechanics ensure each new stage grows costlier, creating built-in FOMO dynamics. As capital flows from Bitcoin into faster-moving assets, this hidden gem is being described as the retail-driven “second wave”, the phase where disciplined risk-takers turn prior cycle profits into next-cycle fortunes. Why Rotation Favors Early Movers The logic behind rotation investing is simple: capital seeks efficiency. Once Bitcoin’s returns flatten, funds move to assets with higher elasticity and growth potential. During the 2021 cycle, Ethereum gained 600% after Bitcoin’s peak, while emerging tokens like Solana, Avalanche, and SHIB saw returns exceeding 30×. This time, the environment is even more favorable. Institutional infrastructure – from ETFs to custodial solutions, has created a safety net for capital to flow freely between assets. As traders diversify exposure, the projects offering a mix of security, scarcity, and community momentum are capturing the largest inflows. In that context, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another speculative play – it’s a rotation magnet. It offers the volatility investors crave, but underpinned by the audit integrity that institutional allocators now demand. Key Metrics to Watch Bitcoin Dominance : If BTC.D begins to decline from current levels (~58%), it confirms altcoin rotation is underway. Ethereum Network Fees : Rising gas usage typically signals a healthy rebound in decentralized activity. BNB Smart Chain TVL : Sustained growth above $5 billion could trigger renewed investor confidence. MAGACOIN FINANCE Listing Announcements : Exchange partnerships or presale caps reached will likely act as catalysts for parabolic moves. According to historical data, early rotation phases often last two to three months, the period when 10×–50× returns materialize before retail euphoria sets in. The Bigger Picture: Positioning for 2025 Analysts from CoinShares and K33 Research predict that the 2025 bull market could surpass 2021’s total capitalization , fueled by ETF access, macro liquidity expansion, and AI-related blockchain integration. The smart money narrative is shifting from passive accumulation to active rotation. For investors, this means one thing: diversification within conviction. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the base. BNB offers structural exposure to exchange infrastructure. But it’s projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that give portfolios their asymmetric edge, the kind capable of multiplying capital at scale. The message is simple: the rotation has started. The early movers are already positioning. Those who follow the flow, and identify the next hidden gem, will define the winners of 2025.

52868077,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=835191,1759968009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52868077.jpeg,From Greed To Fear: Expert Says 2026 Bitcoin Bubble Will Dwarf 2017,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/from-greed-to-fear-2026-bitcoin-bubble/,"A prominent macro-crypto commentator argues that digital assets are transitioning from a greed-driven cycle to a “fear bubble,” with Bitcoin poised for a more powerful and more parabolic phase in 2026 than the euphoric surge of 2017. In a post on X from October 8, the analyst known as plur_daddy (@plur_daddy) contends that two narratives—monetary debasement and artificial intelligence—are now the dominant behavioral drivers, and that they operate less on promise than on anxiety. 2017 Vibes: Trump And AI Could Ignite Next Bitcoin Rally “We are in a bubble, and the most parabolic leg is approaching. The true fireworks will be next year but this Q4 we shall get a taste,” he wrote, adding that the stories animating this cycle are “fueled by twin narratives: debasement and AI. What is especially potent about these stories is the way they operate on fear, not hope. You NEED to buy gold/BTC to avoid getting your net worth debased away, and you NEED to have AI exposure to offset your future loss of labor market value.” While the themes are familiar to market professionals, he argues they have not yet been fully internalized by the broader public or by “bureaucratic real money funds such as pensions and endowments,” which he characterizes as slow to reposition for debasement risk. The result, he suggests, is under-owned exposure that can be forced higher once allocation committees catch up. “There is also a lot of investor capital that still hasn’t reflected these views yet,” he wrote, laying the groundwork for what he believes will be a structurally higher demand base for both Bitcoin and gold as the cycle matures. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Not Crash: Jeff Park Rejects Paul Tudor Jones’ 1999 Comparison A central pillar of his thesis is a policy pivot he expects under the current administration, which he describes as “shifting in a pro-cyclical manner, leaning hard into the bubble, and ready to step on the gas ahead of the midterms.” He outlines four channels. First, “Trump Fed Hijacking,” shorthand for rate cuts followed by yield curve control to cushion the bond market and stimulate housing—timed “most likely… not… until May of next year,” which he frames as the ignition point for the final, steep ascent. Second, a Treasury issuance tilt to bills to pull down long-end yields and free up risk appetite. Third, enabling the GSE balance sheets to expand into mortgage bonds, compressing mortgage spreads and transmitting stimulus to housing via purchases and refinancing. Fourth, stimulus checks delivered through budget reconciliation—politically contested, he concedes, but with “decent odds” of prevailing given “ironclad” party control. Each mechanism, as he describes it, reduces financial frictions at the same time that fear-based narratives pull new capital into hard assets and AI-adjacent equities. The macro mix, in his view, is complicated but ultimately supportive. “The economy is not robust, but it is chugging along, floated by AI capex… a two speed economy, with real world businesses and the average consumer not doing great, but the high end and asset owners are soaring.” Moments later he sharpened the framing: “the two speed economy makes it goldilocks as the genuine weakness in parts of the economy creates a justification for continued fiscal/monetary stimulus while continuing to benefit asset owners. Be the asset owner, the beneficiary of it all.” This is the crux of the “fear bubble” argument: soft spots provide the political cover for policy support, while debasement concerns and job-market anxieties around AI keep households and institutions defensively overweight exposure to scarce assets and growth narratives. Why Q1 2026 Could See A Bitcoin Rally Pause For Bitcoin specifically, he lays out a path that interleaves seasonal strength, cycle reflexivity, and a final acceleration. “My base case is a strong Q4 for BTC, then a sharp downturn as the 4 year cycle debate must be played out in the markets, and finally a rebound that leaves doubters in the dust.” He later endorsed the possibility of “truly manic vertical days at the very end. Similar in vibes to early Dec 2017 in BTC,” invoking the last cycle’s most frenetic stage but recasting the psychology from greed to fear-driven defensiveness. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s On-Chain Roadmap Shows $111,000 – $143,000 As The Range To Watch The thread triggered broader speculation about end-cycle dynamics. Responding to a scenario from another user—“some kind of point in 2026 or 2027 where everyone collectively decides that the USD is going to 0 very quickly and impulsively buys whatever they can to get rid of it… Everything pumps +30% for 3 days straight… And then that is the top”—plur_daddy didn’t endorse the currency-collapse framing but did agree on the “truly manic vertical days at the very end.” Despite the bullish architecture, the analyst does not claim the underlying economy is healthy or that the path will be smooth. He argues instead that policy engineering—whether via issuance tactics, mortgage-market plumbing, or outright transfers—can keep liquidity channels open long enough to accelerate asset prices into a blow-off. “This is an environment where you want to stay long over the next 12 months, but you should be thoughtful in shifting portfolio composition between gold, BTC, and stocks,” he wrote, describing a rotation that acknowledges both macro dispersion and the possibility of sharp drawdowns en route to a higher peak. The bottom line of his thesis is unambiguous: the next stage of this cycle is fear-led, policy-fueled, and likely to exceed 2017’s magnitude. The difference, he argues, is psychological and structural. Where 2017 fed on retail euphoria, 2025–26 is animated by the defensive compulsion to preserve purchasing power and job relevance—“fear… is a much more potent driver of behavior than hope or even greed.” If his timeline holds, a taste in Q4, a shakeout on cycle debates, and a policy-catalyzed vertical in 2026 could define Bitcoin’s next act. At press time, BTC traded at $122,512.

Despite recent underperformance compared to other leading digital assets, Sanh has reiterated his strong belief in the token’s long-term potential, maintaining that XRP will eventually deliver significant gains. XRP’s Recent Performance and Market Position Over the past week, the crypto market has undergone a mild correction following a period of recovery. XRP, which initially lagged behind other major assets during the rebound, has now declined further to approximately $2.88. This continued downturn has caused the asset to drop to fourth place among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, after BNB surpassed it. BNB’s recent performance highlights the contrast between the two assets. While XRP has recorded a 3.49% decline this month, BNB has appreciated by nearly 26%, reaching an all-time high of $1,347 and achieving a market capitalization of $177 billion. XRP’s valuation currently stands near $171 billion. One of the hardest parts of holding XRP is self-control. Watching BNB pump while XRP stands still is painful. But I know this , XRP will have its moment. When it moves, it’ll move harder than anything else on the screen. pic.twitter.com/lbODUCksdj — BD (@DiepSanh) October 7, 2025 Investor Psychology and the Challenge of Patience Addressing this performance gap, Sanh pointed out that maintaining composure and conviction is one of the hardest parts of holding XRP. He explained that when other cryptocurrencies post large gains while XRP remains stagnant, many investors experience frustration and doubt, often leading to premature selling. According to Sanh, this emotional challenge requires strong conviction in the asset’s long-term potential. He emphasized that holding through underperformance can be particularly difficult, especially when other altcoins are rallying. The current situation, with BNB’s rapid growth and XRP’s muted movement, exemplifies the test of patience many XRP investors face. Historical Trends Supporting Sanh’s View Despite current challenges, Sanh remains confident that XRP will eventually recover strongly. He argued that XRP has historically lagged during early stages of bull markets but tends to deliver exceptional gains once its rally begins. Data from previous market cycles support this observation. During the 2017 bull run , XRP underperformed for several months while the broader market advanced. Between October 2016 and February 2017, XRP fell by about 54%, even as most cryptocurrencies appreciated. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, once momentum shifted in March 2017, XRP surged more than 60,000%, reaching $3.31 by January 2018, outperforming every other major asset at the time. A similar pattern emerged in late 2024. While Bitcoin rose by 11% and BNB gained about 1.5% in October 2024, XRP declined by nearly 17%. Yet, in November 2024, the asset reversed course, rallying 284% and reaching $3.4 by January 2025, surpassing both Bitcoin and BNB in short-term performance. Drawing on these past cycles, Sanh reiterated that XRP’s periods of underperformance are often followed by sharp recoveries. He believes the current market phase mirrors earlier conditions that preceded major price surges. “XRP will have its moment,” Sanh stated, stressing that patience and conviction are essential for investors who expect to benefit from the next significant rally. His remarks are similar to the sentiment shared by other XRP advocates, including Coach JV, who recently commented that when XRP eventually breaks out, the move will likely be rapid and substantial. For now, XRP continues to face short-term market pressures, but analysts like Sanh remain focused on its long-term trajectory, arguing that the asset’s track record suggests resilience and strong recovery potential once momentum returns.

As the cryptocurrency gains mainstream recognition, the blockchain is at the forefront of the crucial expansion across the globe. S&P Broad Crypto Index Welcomes Cardano While the bull market phase is still ongoing, Cardano continues to make history, reaching crucial milestones that could shape its future trajectory. On Tuesday, Mintern, the Chief Meme Officer (CMO) of Minswap, shared the blockchain’s latest achievements in the financial landscape, which has ignited a frenzy within the community. In a major victory for the Cardano ecosystem, ADA has officially been added to the S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund, marking a new chapter in its path to global adoption. This inclusion highlights the blockchain’s growing popularity in the context of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) , governance, and practical applications. By becoming one of the most well-known digital assets in the world, Cardano has bolstered its reputation among traditional investors, which could enhance adoption in the short term. Such an achievement during growing crypto acceptance reflects how the network is developing from a research-driven project to a significant player, influencing the future of blockchain innovation . In the meantime, this crucial development seems to have triggered mixed signals among the Cardano community. Dan Gambardello, a crypto pundit, has outlined a bearish outlook for ADA following its latest listing on the S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund. According to the crypto pundit, the development is likely to trigger a downward trend in the price of ADA . With the inclusion, Gambardello is confident that manipulation is highly possible at this point, while he keeps track of its duration. Transactions On The Blockchain Are Picking Up Steam Cardano’s inclusion in the S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund is likely driven by the blockchain’s reputation and notable performance. A recent report from TapTools reveals that activity on the blockchain is heating up due to a sharp increase in transactions processed over the past 30 days. TapTool highlighted that the overall transactions processed on the network have surpassed 1 million within the time frame. This increase demonstrates how the Cardano ecosystem is gaining momentum because of increased developer activity, expanded DeFi membership, and more user engagement. Such a massive number of transactions processed suggests that the network activity remains stable, demonstrating persistent on-chain usage despite market volatility. Furthermore, the growth points to a resurgence in confidence in the network’s scalability and potential in the long term. Given its growing scalability, the Cardano blockchain is constantly being compared to the likes of Ethereum. OxManuel, a crypto expert, has picked the blockchain over Ethereum, underscoring its increasing relevance. Putting aside liquidity, OxManuel declares that the network is miles ahead of Ethereum.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano blockchain|Cardano ecosystem|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Dan Gambardello|decentralized finance|DeFi|Ethereum|Minswap|Mintern|OxManuel|S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund|TapTools,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 00:00:27

The announcements, made on Wednesday, October 8, 2025, reveal how the two powerful tech companies are leaning on AI to drive their next wave of growth amid intensifying global competition. Alibaba bets on embodied AI Alibaba Group has set up an in-house robotics and embodied AI team within its Qwen division, the Hangzhou-based company’s flagship AI unit. The move, disclosed by Qwen’s technology lead Justin Lin in a post on X, marks Alibaba’s most explicit foray yet into physical AI systems. “These applications should definitely step from the virtual world to the physical world,” Lin wrote . This reflects Alibaba’s effort to translate its generative AI advances into tangible products. The company recently led a $140 million funding round for robotics startup X Square Robot. Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu has forecast global AI investment to reach as much as $4 trillion over the next five years, with embodied AI seen as a major growth driver. Alibaba’s push comes as rivals from Nvidia to SoftBank and ABB accelerate their robotics investments. SoftBank this week agreed to acquire ABB’s industrial robot business for $5.4 billion, while Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has described AI-powered robotics as a multitrillion-dollar opportunity . Google’s AI-first hardware strategy While Alibaba looks to bring AI into the physical world through robotics, Google is embedding it deeper into everyday devices. Following the summer release of its Pixel 10 smartphones, the company on Wednesday introduced the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Google’s third-generation foldable, retains the look of its predecessor but brings key refinements. It features thinner bezels, a slightly larger 6.4-inch external screen, IP68 dust and water resistance, the first foldable in the US to achieve that rating, and support for magnetic wireless charging via the new Qi2 standard. The device’s gearless hinge offers improved stability, while its larger frame allows for stronger speakers and haptics. The 5,015 mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day, though the Tensor G5 processor still trails Samsung’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in gaming and video-editing performance. But the real story lies in the integration of Gemini, Google’s conversational AI model, across the device. Gemini can summarize emails, schedule appointments directly from messages, and power features such as Magic Cue for automated replies and Ask Photos for image editing through text or voice prompts. These capabilities extend across the company’s hardware ecosystem, offering a more unified AI experience than many rivals. Critics note that Gemini’s performance remains uneven, occasionally misreading context or failing to activate gestures consistently. AI’s next frontier The two announcements show that there’s a growing consensus across the technology industry that the next phase of AI competition will hinge on embodiment and this may be in the form of a smartphone assistant, a physical robot or something else. Apple is expected to enter the foldable market next year, while Chinese firms like Huawei and Oppo continue to close the gap in both design and camera performance. For Google, focusing on AI helps differentiate its Pixel line in a saturated smartphone market. For Alibaba, robotics could mark its next strategic frontier as Chinese firms push to localize core technologies amid global supply chain tensions.

Open account → XRP is showing bearish signs: a descending triangle, dominant sell-side CVD and weakening on-chain and derivatives metrics increase the probability of a retest of $2.72 in the short term unless demand and network activity rebound quickly. Descending triangle with flat support near $2.72 indicates downside risk. Spot taker CVD shows sustained sell-side dominance, limiting bullish momentum. On-chain and derivatives metrics: transactions ~109K, network growth ~859, OI down 6.51% to 2.78B. XRP technical outlook: descending triangle and sell-side CVD point to a possible retest of $2.72 — read the on-chain and derivatives analysis and key takeaways. Is XRP’s chart signaling a deeper decline toward $2.72? XRP currently trades inside a descending triangle, with lower highs compressing against a flat support near $2.72. Technical weakness combined with dominant sell-side cumulative volume delta (CVD) and softer on-chain and derivatives activity increases the probability of a retest of $2.72 in the near term. How does Spot Taker CVD affect XRP price momentum? The Spot Taker CVD is in “Taker Sell Dominant” territory, indicating net selling pressure from aggressive participants. Short-term bounces have failed to reverse the CVD trend, which suggests sellers retain control of momentum and limit sustained bullish recoveries.

Open futures account → Source: TradingView (image provided for visual context) Can weakening on-chain and derivatives activity affect XRP’s stability? On-chain metrics reveal a notable cooldown in network participation. Transaction count fell to ~109K and network growth dropped to ~859, indicating fewer active addresses and lower throughput on the XRP Ledger. This reduced participation tends to suppress organic demand and can amplify technical downtrends. Source: CryptoQuant (data snapshot) What do derivatives tell us about participation and risk? Open Interest (OI) contracted by 6.51% to 2.78 billion, showing lower derivatives participation and fewer new directional bets. A falling OI alongside sell-side dominance often precedes trend continuation rather than reversal, though lower leverage can reduce the scale of forced liquidations.

Monitor Spot Taker CVD for changes from sell to neutral/buy dominance. Watch transaction count and network growth for renewed on-chain engagement. Track Open Interest for increasing participation that could fuel rallies. Source: Santiment (on-chain snapshot) Frequently Asked Questions Will XRP fall to $2.72? Current indicators favor a retest: a descending triangle, sell-side CVD, falling OI and cooled on-chain activity raise the probability of another move toward $2.72 unless demand and network engagement recover swiftly. What would invalidate the bearish case? A sustained shift in Spot Taker CVD to buy dominance, rising transaction counts and a notable increase in Open Interest would suggest renewed demand and reduce the likelihood of a $2.72 retest. Key Takeaways Technical setup : Descending triangle with flat support at $2.72 favors downside risk. Market structure : Spot taker CVD and falling OI show sell-side control and lower participation. Actionable insight : Watch CVD, transaction count and OI for confirmation before positioning. Conclusion COINOTAG analysis shows XRP’s short-term outlook leans bearish as technical, on-chain and derivatives signals align toward downside pressure. The $2.72 level remains critical; a meaningful recovery requires stronger on-chain engagement and a reversal in Spot Taker CVD.

She projected that global growth will likely see only a slight slowdown this year and in 2026. Recent economic reports indicate that while the US economy is losing some momentum, it has so far avoided the recession many analysts had warned about over the past six months. Georgieva attributed this resilience to sound policy decisions, a dynamic private sector, milder-than-anticipated import tariffs, and generally favourable financial conditions that have helped sustain economic strength in the US and other major economies. Georgieva points out several serious challenges dragging behind the global economy During an event organised by the Milken Institute in Washington, Georgieva said, “We see global growth slowing only slightly this year and next.” At this time, the economy was demonstrating all signs indicating a world economy that had generally encountered serious strains from multiple shocks. The managing director’s remarks were part of her preview for the IMF’s upcoming World Economic Outlook. In July, the agency increased its prediction for global economic growth by 0.2 % points to 3.0% for 2025 and by 0.1 % points to 3.1% for 2026. For a new economic outlook, the IMF will share it on Tuesday, October 14, at the annual IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington. This situation arises as US President Donald Trump implements high tariffs and stringent immigration policies, affecting global trade. On the other hand, AI is playing a crucial role in the economy as it has swiftly transformed the tech sector and job prospects. “The global economy is doing better than expected, but worse than needed,” said Georgieva. The IMF has set a target of about 3% for global economic growth in the medium term. This target is considerably lower than the 3.7% target set before the COVID-19 crisis. Concerning the lower target, Georgieva highlighted serious circumstances, such as marginalisation, dissatisfaction, and struggles that many individuals around the globe encounter, concluding that the global economy is facing various risks. Uncertainties surrounding the global economy increase amid changing US tariff rates Earlier, Georgieva mentioned that uncertainty surrounding the global economy is very high and still continues to rise even as the appetite for gold — considered a safe haven for many investors — grows. She also noted that monetary gold now represents over 20% of the world’s official reserves. Her remarks followed recent reports, which revealed that gold achieved a record high as the US government shutdown continued, and bets that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates this month spurred demand. The impact of Trump’s tariffs , on the other hand, was not as severe as reported in April. Today, the trade-weighted tariff rate is approximately 17.5%, which is lower than the 23% rate. Additionally, most countries are not retaliating by imposing their own tariffs. However, analysts have raised concerns about the changing US tariff rates, pointing out that inflation in the country could escalate if companies begin passing more of their costs from tariffs onto consumers or, for that matter, if a large number of products meant for the United States end up creating new tariff increases elsewhere.

Once dismissed as fleeting trends, meme tokens are now evolving into complex ecosystems with real economic engines. Each cycle reveals the same truth: volatility rewards preparation. As markets swing, smart investors pivot toward early-stage projects with tangible growth mechanics. Over the last 24 hours, SPX6900 ($SPX) tumbled by 10.69% to $1.45, while Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) declined 7.32% to $0.03089. These corrections have tempered enthusiasm for older players but spotlighted a new contender that’s generating excitement across the Ethereum network. That project is BullZilla ($BZIL),a presale titan that merges scarcity, narrative, and staking rewards into a single roaring ecosystem. With its live burn mechanics and progressive price engine, BullZilla is now viewed as one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Myth That Burns Brighter Every Stage BullZilla ($BZIL) isn’t just a token; it’s an evolving story coded into Ethereum’s core. Its presale is a living mechanism of conviction,a system where price rises automatically every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours without that milestone. Currently in Stage 5 (Roar Drop Incoming), BullZilla has surpassed $830,000 raised, sold 30 billion tokens, and attracted 2,700+ holders. The token price sits at $0.0001324, and the next scheduled increase will push it to $0.00013907, marking a 5.03% jump. This model creates urgency without artificial hype. Early participants at Stage 5D have already recorded returns of approximately 3,881.42% relative to the projected listing price of $0.00527, while the earliest believers are sitting at around 2,202.60%. The Roar Burn Mechanism ensures that each presale milestone reduces supply, reinforcing the token’s scarcity and price momentum. Every burn is broadcast in real-time, a symbolic and financial reminder that the beast keeps growing stronger. Complementing this is the Lore Bible, a 24-chapter saga that ties each stage of the presale to BullZilla’s fictional evolution. Every new chapter triggers a token burn, transforming each milestone into a community celebration. The blend of narrative and mathematics gives BullZilla’s ecosystem a cinematic rhythm that few competitors can match among the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. Presale Snapshot Metric Data Current Stage 5 (Roar Drop Incoming) Price $0.0001324 Total Raised $830,000+ Tokens Sold 30 B+ Holders 2,700+ ROI (Stage 5D ➝ Listing) 3,881.42 % ROI (Earliest Stage ➝ 5D) 2,202.60 % $1,000 Investment 7.552 million $BZIL Next Stage Price $0.00013907 (+5.03 %) Referral Bonus 10 % on $50+ buys Referral Reward 10 % from referrals Burn Reserve 8 B $BZIL A $1,000 BullZilla presale buy at $0.0001324 secures about 7.55 million $BZIL, worth roughly $39,800 at its projected $0.00527 listing,a 3,881 % ROI. With the 10 % referral bonus and 70 % APY staking, total holdings could exceed 14 million tokens, underscoring why BullZilla ranks among the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet and configure it for the Ethereum network. Buy Ethereum (ETH) Purchase ETH through reputable exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase, then transfer it to your wallet. This covers the purchase and gas fees. Visit the BullZilla Presale Portal Head to the official BullZilla presale website and connect your wallet. Always verify the contract address before proceeding. Swap ETH for $BZIL Select the desired purchase amount, approve the transaction, and confirm. Your $BZIL allocation will be secured immediately and claimable once the presale ends. Buyers spending at least $50 receive a 10% token bonus, while referrers earn a 10% reward from their network’s purchases, both unlocking two weeks post-sale. These incentive layers drive organic growth and retention, hallmarks of a disciplined project within the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. SPX6900 ($SPX): The Veteran in a Cooling Cycle SPX6900, once a symbol of raw community energy, is now navigating a period of correction. In the last 24 hours, its price fell 10.69% to $1.45, signaling the start of consolidation after months of explosive growth. Many traders see this as a natural pause, an interval where momentum resets and early profit-takers step aside. For long-term holders, this retracement could be a healthy recalibration rather than a collapse. The technical indicators for SPX6900 reveal a mixed outlook. Its trading volume remains stable, and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is trending toward neutral, implying possible stabilization. Moving averages, however, are flattening, reflecting uncertainty about near-term direction. This tug-of-war between optimism and caution is common after exponential climbs, and SPX now stands at a crossroads between revival and further decline. Still, SPX6900 remains a case study in how meme coins can evolve. Its community-led ethos and viral marketing continue to keep it visible, but the absence of an automated supply-control mechanism limits its resilience. Compared to BullZilla’s live burn structure and progressive presale engine, SPX appears reactive rather than proactive. That’s why many investors are shifting focus toward early-stage projects like BullZilla, which structurally enforce upward motion,cementing their place among the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU): A Beloved Brand Navigating Market Chill Pudgy Penguins, born from a celebrated NFT franchise, has built one of crypto’s most recognizable brands. Its expansion into tokenized markets with $PENGU bridged the worlds of collectibles, culture, and DeFi. However, over the last 24 hours, PENGU’s token price dropped 7.32% to $0.03089, reflecting broader market cooling. This decline isn’t necessarily negative; it often precedes new accumulation phases when long-term supporters quietly re-enter positions. From a technical view, Pudgy Penguins is consolidating within a tight range between $0.028 and $0.035. Trading volumes have lightened, indicating temporary fatigue rather than capital flight. Many traders see this as an opportunity zone where buyers test support levels before a new upward phase. The project’s gaming partnerships and expanding NFT ecosystem still serve as strong tailwinds for recovery once market sentiment improves. Yet, PENGU’s growth depends largely on brand loyalty and ecosystem expansion. Its success relies on maintaining engagement, while BullZilla’s growth is algorithmic, programmed to progress through automated burns and presale triggers. This contrast illustrates why BullZilla has quickly become a standout among the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. Pudgy Penguins will likely continue to thrive culturally, but BullZilla offers a more mechanical and measurable path to appreciation. Conclusion Based on current data and ongoing market analysis, BullZilla stands as one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025 . While SPX6900 cools and Pudgy Penguins consolidates, BullZilla accelerates. Its Roar Burn system, progressive presale engine, staking furnace, and referral mechanics create a virtuous cycle of growth. For early-stage investors, the presale represents an opportunity not just to speculate but to own a piece of a self-fueling ecosystem. A $1,000 investment today yields roughly 7.55 million tokens, and with each price stage rising automatically, waiting comes at a cost. Add referral bonuses and staking APY, and potential returns multiply even before listing. The next presale surge is just one roar away. BullZilla isn’t just bullish, it’s built for domination. For those scanning the horizon for the top new meme coins to buy and hold in 2025, the time to act is before the next chapter burns through the supply.

Solana (SOL) price is testing resistance near $235 after rebounding from $220 support, supported by growing institutional accumulation, higher on-chain revenue and increased trading volume. These factors combined create a tighter supply-demand balance that could enable a breakout toward $253 if momentum sustains. How are institutional flows and treasury purchases affecting SOL price? Institutional accumulation has increased materially: public firms now hold over 13.4 million SOL, and a corporate treasury recorded roughly $530 million in purchases. Reduced available supply and large-scale corporate buys typically strengthen price support and reduce sell-side liquidity, reinforcing upward pressure. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Solana testing resistance at $235 after rebounding from $220?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Solana rebounds from $220 support and tests $235 resistance, eyeing a potential move toward $253. Institutional accumulation grows as public firms hold 13.4M SOL and treasury adds $530M in purchases. Network revenue hit $141M in September, reinforcing Solana’s strength amid rising trading volume. Solana (SOL) continues to gain momentum after rebounding from the $220 support level. The asset is now testing resistance near $235, with traders monitoring for a potential breakout toward $253. Increased institutional interest, growing network activity, and sustained volume continue to support Solana’s upward trend and market resilience. Why is the $220–$253 range important for SOL? Price action between $220 and $253 represents a full recent trading channel where support and resistance have been tested. Buyers defended $220, creating higher lows, while $253 remains the upper boundary tested in recent sessions. A breakout above $235 with sustained volume could reopen momentum toward the $253 zone. How does on-chain activity support the current rally? On-chain metrics signal stronger usage: decentralized applications on Solana generated $141M in revenue in September, and 24-hour trading volume rose 16.69% to $8.95 billion. Higher revenue and volume indicate increased transaction demand, which often precedes sustained price appreciation if network activity continues.

After reaching its peak near $253, the price corrected but quickly regained strength above the $210 zone. Buyers have defended the $220 area, forming higher lows that maintain short-term momentum. CoinMarketCap reports SOL at $221.46, up 2.14% over seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap Liquidity and participation were high with trading volume rising 16.69% within 24 hours to $8.95 billion. Market capitalization sits near $120.96 billion and fully diluted value near $135.41 billion. Analysts note a breakout to $253 is more likely if consolidation holds between $220 and $240 and volume continues to push the price higher. How much SOL do institutions hold and what does that mean? Public firms now hold roughly 13.4 million SOL, representing about 2.46% of circulating supply. Large purchases — including a corporate treasury buy of approximately $530M and a separate ~760,000 SOL acquisition by an institutional buyer (valued at roughly $167M) — reduce available float and can amplify price moves on positive flow. Grayscale’s Solana Trust (GSOL) has announced staking plans to broaden institutional utility pending regulatory clearance. Data referenced: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and institutional filings (mentioned as plain text sources) indicate increased corporate and fund-level exposure. Frequently Asked Questions Will Solana break $235 and reach $253? A breakout to $253 requires sustained buying pressure and rising volume. If SOL closes above $235 with above-average volume, the next test is $253; failure to hold $220 would signal weakening momentum. How are network revenues influencing investor sentiment? Network revenue of $141M in September signals strong dApp usage and fee generation, which supports investor confidence by demonstrating real economic activity on Solana’s chain. Key Takeaways Support and resistance: $220 is the key support; $235 is immediate resistance, $253 is the next target. Institutional demand: Public firms hold ~13.4M SOL and corporate buys totaling ~$530M tighten supply. On-chain strength: $141M in network revenue for September and higher trading volume bolster the outlook. Conclusion Solana (SOL) has rebounded from $220 and is testing $235 resistance, supported by institutional accumulation and rising network revenue. Watch trading volume and on-chain metrics closely; a confirmed breakout with strong participation could target $253.

Senior Treasury advisors and lawmakers have begun referencing digital assets as potential additions to long-term fiscal policy planning, signaling a dramatic shift in perception at the highest levels of government. Recent statements from financial committees suggest that holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve could complement existing gold and bond portfolios by improving currency diversification and technological credibility. Analysts see this as one of the clearest signs yet that digital assets have matured from speculative instruments to macroeconomic tools. With policy discourse evolving, investor sentiment is surging across both institutional and retail segments, creating conditions ripe for a new wave of capital rotation, one that also brings rising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. The institutional logic behind a Bitcoin reserve For years, advocates have argued that Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralization make it a logical complement to traditional reserves. The idea gained traction following international diversification trends among central banks seeking assets beyond US Treasuries. With multiple countries experimenting with digital reserve frameworks, a formal US plan would represent the ultimate validation of cryptocurrency’s legitimacy. According to recent policy notes, officials have acknowledged Bitcoin’s resilience and increasing adoption rate as reasons for consideration. Market strategists at major investment firms describe the potential reserve strategy as a symbolic alignment between traditional and decentralized economies, a move that could redefine how nations manage value preservation in an era of fiscal uncertainty. Renewed institutional accumulation and liquidity expansion Institutional participation has grown steadily through exchange-traded products and custodial infrastructure improvements. Data from CoinShares and CryptoQuant shows continued inflows into large-cap digital asset funds and declining exchange balances, suggesting accumulation rather than speculation. Hedge funds, pension managers, and corporate treasuries are adjusting allocation models to include measured exposure to digital assets. Analysts believe this accumulation trend reflects increasing confidence that policy normalization is imminent. As liquidity deepens and macro risks stabilize, smaller market segments often benefit next, an effect already visible in the surge of altcoin interest across retail networks and crypto social platforms. Retail optimism fuels new market rotation Retail traders interpret government acknowledgment of Bitcoin’s role as validation for the entire crypto ecosystem. This enthusiasm isn’t limited to blue chips; it’s spilling into cultural assets and narrative-based altcoins that embody the decentralized spirit of crypto. Traders are seeking projects that combine structure, scarcity, and community engagement, reflecting a desire to balance excitement with accountability. The U.S. government’s growing interest in a Bitcoin reserve has reignited debate about digital sovereignty, and while institutions plan, retail investors act. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become their focal point, evolving from a niche meme idea into a national movement within crypto. Its current presale price of $0.00051 and $0.007 listing target encode above 13× upside gap , now widely discussed by traders online. Audits by CertiK and HashEx give it uncommon legitimacy, and the PATRIOT50X bonus code continues to drive early participation. Analysts say this blend of patriotic branding, verifiable structure, and aggressive market timing could make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins, a reflection of both cultural identity and economic opportunity in the digital age. Strategic alignment between macro policy and digital innovation The conversation around a potential Bitcoin reserve represents more than symbolism; it indicates the government’s growing recognition of blockchain as a stabilizing force rather than a threat. This shift aligns with the broader narrative of financial modernization. As the US contemplates integrating decentralized assets into national reserves, it implicitly validates the innovation ecosystem driving projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The shared principle between both movements is scarcity, a finite resource anchoring trust. Institutional endorsement of digital scarcity and retail enthusiasm for community scarcity converge to create the most inclusive market dynamic since the rise of ETFs. Why this shift matters for investors Institutional recognition tends to create secondary effects across all market layers. When governments and corporations begin framing Bitcoin as a strategic asset, risk appetite expands. Investors start exploring derivative opportunities in altcoins, governance tokens, and meme-culture projects that mirror the decentralization ethos. This layered adoption cycle reinforces liquidity across the spectrum, ensuring that both conservative and speculative segments benefit simultaneously. In this emerging balance, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a representation of the new retail identity, informed, engaged, and motivated by transparency. Market analysts from 10x Research describe this cycle as a “convergence phase,” where institutional credibility meets retail passion to produce the broadest base of participation ever recorded in crypto. If Bitcoin becomes a formalized component of US fiscal reserves, the symbolic impact alone could multiply global adoption rates. Each wave of recognition by major economies typically triggers waves of innovation at the grassroots level, and that interplay could define the entire 2025 narrative. A new era of credibility and creativity The possibility of a US Bitcoin reserve demonstrates how far digital assets have come since their fringe beginnings. What began as an experiment in digital scarcity is now entering the halls of global finance. The parallel rise of community-driven tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE proves that the original decentralized ethos remains alive within this new legitimacy. Institutional capital may set the direction, but it is the collective creativity of retail traders that drives momentum. Together, they form the twin engines of adoption that ensure crypto’s next chapter will be both credible and imaginative. As the year advances, the conversation will likely broaden from Bitcoin reserves to wider digital diversification strategies. Analysts expect altcoins that combine transparency and culture to thrive in this evolving landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE exemplifies that model, blending structure with sentiment, scarcity with participation. Whether viewed through the lens of policy or retail psychology, its timing and architecture reflect the same fundamentals that made Bitcoin’s own rise inevitable.

Among the discussions to be had will be talks surrounding how innovation is changing payments and shaping what money looks like in a digital asset age, featuring all-star speakers from Wall Street and beyond. Speakers who have been confirmed include Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management; Rob Goldstein, Chief Operating Officer at BlackRock Inc.; and Heath Tarbert, Chief Legal Officer at Circle Internet Financial. Also on the lineup are Alesia Haas, Chief Financial Officer at Coinbase; Tim Spence, CEO of Fifth Third Bank; and Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. Fed explores convergence of traditional and decentralized finance The conference will centre on the interaction between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), two previously parallel systems now converging as blockchain and tokenization technologies gain momentum. The focus of the conversations will be on new stablecoins applications and business models for payments, as well as the tokenization of financial assets. The Fed has indicated that it’s interested in exploring how digital assets could enhance cross-border payments, financial inclusion, and real-time settlement. Governor Christopher Waller is likely to emphasize that payment innovation should continue to be led by the private sector and reinforce his previous comments that competition — not regulation alone — will spur the development of safer and faster payment systems. The event also arrives as the Fed is in the process of rolling out FedNow, its instant payment platform introduced in 2023. Though FedNow was conceived for bank-to-bank payments, the upcoming summit may provide a preview of how its use case might expand in a world where money can be tokenized or programmed. Innovators and rule makers from industry-leading organizations Representatives from the industry will share their perspectives on striking a balance between innovation and economic stability. Cathie Wood, an early champion of Bitcoin and blockchain investments, would likely assert that crypto assets have the potential to make global finance more efficient in the long term. Rob Goldstein, on behalf of the world’s largest asset manager, may focus on institutional tokenized assets and how digital infrastructure can impact portfolio management. Heath Tarbert, the former Chair of the US CFTC, has emerged as a strong voice at the intersection of regulatory bodies and cryptocurrency companies. His involvement is a sign of Circle’s increased importance in digital payments, especially with the asset it backs — the USD Coin (USDC) — one of the most widely used stablecoins worldwide. Alesia Haas of Coinbase will give the crypto exchange’s take on compliance and innovation. At the same time, Tim Spence will discuss how traditional banks are responding to digital transformation and real-time payment requirements. The Payments Innovation Conference takes place at a moment when US regulators are facing pressure to provide clearer guidance on stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and digital dollar experiments. Analysts anticipate the meeting will be closely monitored for any hints on how the Fed’s approach to integrating crypto into mainstream finance may be changing. Several central banks around the world — including those in the European Union and China — are already pushing to develop digital currencies, adding pressure on American authorities to weigh in on the issue of where the world is heading with money. The Fed, which also plans to open the event with public remarks by the central bank’s vice chair, has made clear that it will livestream the event to the public in an effort to encourage broader participation and transparency. With such a potent mix of voices — from the wilds of crypto to Wall Street boardrooms — assembled, the Federal Reserve seems determined to mould not merely how Americans pay for things but also how finance will work in our digital age.

It's a TRAP — Here's How Scammers Are Stealing Millions,https://coinpaper.com/11499/free-shiba-inu-tokens-it-s-a-trap-here-s-how-scammers-are-stealing-millions,"Shiba Inu token holders are exposed to a new security risk. With the huge number of cryptocurrency users, a complex phishing scheme is being used to take advantage of them. The attack targets legitimate token airdrops, which are used to lure victims into compromising their digital wallets. The SHIB community has been issued with an urgent warning by Shibarium Trustwatch, an account on X focused on security. The alert follows the detection of a coordinated scam targeting unsuspecting token holders across multiple wallets. The Phishing Scheme Explained The fraud is carried out in a peculiar way. Hackers are sending real Shiba Inu tokens to random wallet addresses. These airdrops look credible and genuine. However, they include coded messages, which lead customers to scam websites. The spam messages inform users that they need to access specific sites to receive additional rewards. Such websites mimic official Shiba Inu platforms. When the victims link their wallets, the fraudsters access the funds and drain them instantly. Shibarium Trustwatch verified that there is no relation between the counterfeit websites and the legitimate Shiba Inu ecosystem . The attachment of a wallet to such platforms can lead to stolen assets and compromised security. This may cause serious and permanent damage. According to security experts, this type of attack exploits the trust individuals place in others. Airdrops are considered valid opportunities automatically by many crypto holders. The internalised messages bring a sense of urgency, where the victims undertake their actions without due diligence. Protecting Your Assets SHIB holders received clear guidance from the security team. Users should ignore all messages embedded in token names and unforeseen airdrops. No legitimate Shiba Inu promotion requires connecting wallets through unsolicited tokens. The best defence against such attacks is verification. Any official news is communicated through the official Shiba Inu channels. The project has verified profiles on major social media sites. These are the official sources through which community members should verify any claims and then take action. There are several additional precautions that cybersecurity professionals recommend. Users are advised to enable two-factor authentication on all cryptocurrency-related accounts. Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of security for significant holdings. Regular security audits of connected applications help identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Pattern of Ongoing Threats This is one of the larger trends targeting the Shiba Inu community. In the first quarter of the year, Shibarium Trustwatch identified fraudulent accounts on X that posed as legitimate supporters. These fraudsters were marketing irrelevant tokens under the guise of being part of the SHIB system. The scammers took advantage of a specific platform, HypeIt, which is developed on Shibarium to share content and communicate with the community. The attackers exploited the platform's validity to defraud users. The other explanation was regarding the misconception about the LEASH token . The meme coin associated with Shiba Inu exists only as an ERC-20 token. LEASH is not available on Solana, and any claims to the contrary are fraudulent. Buyers who attempt to purchase LEASH on Solana may lose their funds to fake tokens. In a recent update , we covered that crypto users were also warned about scammers buying trusted Telegram usernames to impersonate community members and steal assets. These usernames are highly important in the cryptocurrency community due to their reputation and trust.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|AIRDROP|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-09 00:38:57

The token is scheduled to launch in 2026 and will initially be offered to banks and credit unions in the state. It aims to revolutionise money movement within the state’s financial network — much like how the internet transformed information exchange. The Roughrider Coin will be held in parity with the U.S. dollar, thereby maintaining a stable value. It will underpin various types of financial transactions, such as interbank settlements, merchant payments, and cross-border remittances. This is the first time a state-owned bank in the U.S. has launched its own stablecoin for use within its local monetary system. Don Morgan, the president of the Bank of North Dakota, which will operate the effort, called it a way of solidifying the state’s financial infrastructure and maintaining its relevance in an increasingly global economy. The bank’s job has always been to lend for agriculture, commerce and industry — and digital assets are among those now in that lane, he said. The project received the support of Governor Kelly Armstrong, who described it as a “state-of-the-art approach” and part of the state’s progressive financial strategy. He insisted that the stablecoin would be “backed by real money,” ensuring trust and safety for citizens and institutions. The Roughrider Coin is contingent upon approval from the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which regulates the state’s banking industry. When approved, pilot testing is scheduled with local financial institutions and public use is set to start in 2026. Fiserv expands its digital asset reach Fiserv acquired Bento a few years after it bought out CheckFree, which gives the Brookfield, Wisconsin-based company even more reach into new payments technology and digital assets. Fiserv, a leading provider of payments and financial technology solutions, will provide the digital infrastructure for Roughrider Coin. For years, the firm has been developing its stablecoin and digital asset platform, specifically designed for banks and payment networks. Fiserv launched its independent white-label stablecoin , FIUSD, earlier this year, creating a way for traditional financial institutions to issue and manage digital tokens while remaining compliant with U.S. fintech regulations. Roughrider Coin will be built on the same technology and work with other stablecoins running on Fiserv’s network. This is crucial for compatibility with various payment systems and blockchains. There are also strong compliance and anti-fraud protections built into the platform, a concern for community banks that want to upgrade while keeping themselves shielded from the risks often associated with crypto markets. The North Dakota partnership is proof that digital money can work in tandem with brick-and-mortar banking, Fiserv executives said. As regulations evolve, we anticipate that more states and institutions will follow this direction. Navigating opportunities and challenges ahead The Roughrider Coin may enable banking to become more efficient and accessible, but it faces obstacles. Its acceptance will depend on how eagerly banks, merchants, and consumers adopt it in their daily business conduct. Most community banks are lagging, and caution has prevented some from participating in the blockchain-based payment marketplace. Security remains another priority as digital currencies are susceptible to cyberattacks and system malfunctions. Fiserv’s solution specifically addresses these concerns with safeguards already in place, including fraud monitoring and data security. BND has also consented to robust monitoring and risk-management obligations. Unlike private stablecoins, the Roughrider Coin would be overseen by a state-owned bank, something that has the potential to build trust among risk-averse users. However, it must still prove itself to be hardy and reliable in the field. Private stablecoins like USDC and USDT already dominate the market, while companies such as PayPal and Cloudflare are offering plans to issue their own. Roughrider Coin will have to demonstrate that it offers clear advantages — such as regulatory approval, cost savings, or benefits to the local economy.

Litecoin price outlook: Litecoin price nears key $135–$140 resistance; monitor $100 support—act on confirmed breakdowns or ETF-driven sentiment shifts. Read analysis and trade considerations now. What is Litecoin’s current price outlook? Litecoin price is approaching the $135–$140 resistance after an uptrend since early March. Technicals show a rising weekly channel with support near $100; a sustained rejection at the upper channel could form a bearish double-top and increase downside risk toward $66–$70. How could a break below $100 affect Litecoin price? A decisive break below the $100 neckline would signal a channel breakdown and likely accelerate selling. Technical projections indicate a 35–40% decline to $66–$70, with extended downside to around $50 if selling momentum intensifies after a failed retest of the $135–$140 barrier. Litecoin price nears $140 resistance with potential downside toward $70, while optimism rises over Canary Capital’s ETF proposal. Litecoin is testing a strong $135–$140 resistance level that has repeatedly halted upward moves since December last year. A confirmed breakdown below $100 could trigger a 35–40% decline, with downside targets between $66 and $70 per coin. Optimism around Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF proposal may cushion price weakness if broader sentiment turns favorable. Litecoin is approaching a crucial resistance zone between $135 and $140 after maintaining a steady uptrend since early March. The cryptocurrency has respected a rising channel on the weekly chart, yet the upper boundary now poses a significant technical challenge. This resistance has capped rallies since late last year, including a reversal near $134 in August. The medium-term trend remains upward, supported by an ascending trendline near $100 that has repeatedly attracted buyers. Analysts caution that rejection at the current resistance could create a bearish double-top on the weekly chart. If confirmed, that pattern would increase pressure toward lower price zones and end the recent phase of relative stability. Why does the $66–$70 range matter for Litecoin? The $66–$70 band represents historical accumulation and prior support zones that often absorb selling pressure. Technical projections place this as the next key support if the $100 neckline fails. Traders view this range as a potential area where long-term holders may re-enter, limiting deeper declines. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Source: TradingView Market strategist Ali Martinez commented that a confirmed rejection at current resistance could accelerate selling toward $50. Despite that risk, Litecoin’s rising channel shows resilience, and short-term buyers remain active. The coming weeks will determine whether the market sustains the uptrend or shifts into a deeper retracement phase. How might Canary Capital’s ETF filing influence Litecoin? Canary Capital’s amended filing for a spot Litecoin ETF has introduced fundamental optimism. Market participants expect that a favorable regulatory environment or progress on filings could attract fresh demand into LTC. While technical risk remains, ETF progress can shorten correction cycles by improving market sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions What price levels should traders watch for Litecoin short-term? Watch resistance at $135–$140 and support at $100. Confirmed close below $100 increases odds of a 35–40% drop to $66–$70, while a sustained break above $140 would open higher targets within the channel. Is the current Litecoin trend bullish or bearish? Technically the medium-term trend is still upward given the rising channel and support near $100. However, repeated resistance rejections could flip the bias to bearish if a double-top or channel breakdown is confirmed. Key Takeaways Resistance is critical : $135–$140 repeatedly caps rallies and must be cleared for bullish continuation. Support to watch : $100 is the immediate neckline; a break targets $66–$70, with downside extension to $50 possible. ETF factor : Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF filing could provide sentiment support and limit downside if regulatory progress continues. Conclusion Litecoin price sits at a tactical crossroads: the $135–$140 resistance defines near-term risk, while $100 forms the key support that preserves the uptrend. Traders should watch for confirmed breakdowns or a decisive breakout, and factor ETF developments into position sizing and risk management. Monitor price action and official filings closely. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Litecoin Price Nears $140 Resistance; Breakdown Could Target $66–$70"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-104-1024x459.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-09T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-09T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Litecoin price tests $135–$140 resistance; a break below $100 could push LTC toward $66–$70.

But while the spotlight typically falls on the top two giants, clever investors know that the real wealth creation opportunity lies elsewhere, and because of this, attention is rapidly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new DeFi phenomenon is gaining momentum with its two-way lending protocol, allowing borrowers to borrow with ease, a revolutionary use case that’s fueling widespread early adoption. Its presale has been one of the fastest-moving in 2025, with over 60% of Phase 6 sold out and still costing just $0.035, leading many analysts to predict explosive growth in the future. As institutional money flows into crypto, Mutuum Finance is becoming the altcoin that most likely will make retail investors into early-stage winners. ETF Momentum Drives Bitcoin and Ethereum Surge The institutional rush of latest times is infusing fresh life into the crypto space as both Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded one of their strongest inflow weeks of the year. On-chain data shows whales are not sitting still either, freshly minted wallets have taken huge quantities of BTC and ETH off exchanges to self-custody, which speaks of a strong long-term accumulation wave. This relationship has already toll on prices: Bitcoin shattered all previous records to hit $125,506, while Ethereum hit a high of $4,575, taunting the potential rally to $130,000 and $5,000, respectively. Even if there is a temporary pullback, analysts believe institutional demand and whale positioning will keep the trend going, a trend that’s also guiding investor attention to the next big thing in DeFi, where a new project is quickly gathering pace. Mutuum Finance Presale Update Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale Phase 6 presale with more than 16,800 registered investors and more than $16.9 million locked up. Such figures indicate growing market confidence in the long-term project vision and makes it a very high-demand ecosystem for investors to invest in and gain sustainable profits and long-term expansion. The protocol also includes firm Loan-to-Value (LTV) composition and dynamic liquidation protocol, both of which respond in real time to shock prices. There is also a reserve multiplier of 10% to 35% based on collateral risk profile that has the role to provide an additional layer of security as well as enhancing platform overall resilience. Mutuum Finance has a $50,000 bug bounty program where it classifies vulnerabilities under four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low, with a structured methodology for early detection and prevention prior to problems reaching the community. Security by design and open architecture integrated makes Mutuum Finance a stable, secure, and long-term DeFi system. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance also introduced its new lending and borrowing protocol , a key milestone in its expanding DeFi platform. The V1 will be launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with its essential features including liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be available as assets for borrowing, lending, and collateralization from day one, offering an open-ended and scalable DeFi framework. As a gesture of appreciation for its initial investors, the group conducted a $100,000 giveaway , to gift 10 lucky people with $10,000 MUTM tokens. Early-Stage Potential with MUTM While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still making headlines with $4.5 billion in ETF inflows, savvy investors are increasingly turning to newer DeFi projects for potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is another hopeful substitute with a price of just $0.035 and over 60% of Phase 6 presale, 16,800+ investors, and raising $16.9 million. Its dynamic risk management, secure architecture, and dual-lending protocol make it a utility-driven project with real growth potential. With institutional purchasing driving BTC and ETH, MUTM offers an early investor a chance to benefit from disproportionate returns while getting exposure to a transparent, scalable, and secure DeFi ecosystem.

BTC is now up ~29% year-to-date. Ether's closing price rose more than 10% this week, hitting its highest level in three weeks. ETH is now up ~33% year-to-date and is ~8% below its record close from August 2025. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price reached a new record high this week, crossing $124,000 for the first time in history. BTC is now up ~29% year-to-date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price rose more than 10% this week, hitting its highest level in three weeks. ETH is now up ~33% year-to-date and is ~8% below its record close from August 2025. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) , Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

In just two weeks, the token has skyrocketed from $0.46 to $2.04, marking a jaw-dropping gain of more than 340%. The sudden rally has shaken up the market, reminding investors that explosive moves can still happen even amid growing competition in the Layer-1 space. Analysts attribute Astar’s remarkable run to a combination of strong fundamentals, network growth in Japan, and increased exposure after Binance’s latest listings. The project’s integration with government-backed blockchain initiatives, alongside partnerships with Sony, NTT, and SBI Holdings, has cemented Astar as one of Asia’s leading smart contract networks. In recent weeks, trading volume has surged to record levels, with Astar’s market cap now surpassing several mid-tier rivals. Technical indicators show no immediate signs of weakness, and the project’s expansion into tokenization and cross-chain interoperability continues to strengthen investor confidence. But while Astar’s rally has dominated headlines, a new contender is beginning to capture the spotlight – MAGACOIN FINANCE , an early-stage project many believe could be the next major breakout story. Astar’s Rise: Fuelled by Utility and Adoption Astar’s rapid climb didn’t come out of nowhere. The network has been quietly building a strong ecosystem focused on interoperability between Ethereum, Polkadot, and other major chains. Its leadership position in Japan’s national tokenization strategy has given it a level of legitimacy that few blockchain projects can match. Developers and enterprises alike have turned to Astar for creating compliant Web3 solutions, particularly as Japan pushes ahead with real-world asset tokenization. This combination of government support and enterprise partnerships has created a unique environment for growth. However, analysts warn that after such an intense rally, Astar could face short-term corrections as traders lock in profits. Long-term holders, though, remain confident that Astar’s expanding network and strong fundamentals will support higher valuations throughout 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Star Stealing the Show Even as Astar dominates the headlines, the real buzz in crypto circles right now is surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new project that’s already generating massive hype among early investors. Despite being in its early stages, its performance so far has been nothing short of incredible – and it’s quickly becoming the most talked-about presale token of the year. Following full audits by HashEX and CertiK, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned a reputation for transparency and trustworthiness, two qualities often lacking in the presale market. Its combination of a strong community, growing ecosystem, and innovative tokenomics has analysts predicting a potential rise of up to 20,000% once it hits major exchanges. Early backers have already seen astonishing returns as presale rounds sold out in record time. The project’s structure rewards strategic entry and long-term holding, encouraging community participation rather than short-term speculation. Many investors now believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could follow the same early trajectory as SHIBA INU or DOGECOIN, but with greater staying power thanks to its development roadmap and ecosystem utility. For retail investors searching for the next big opportunity, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a clear front-runner. The project’s strong fundamentals, verified security audits, and rapidly growing user base have all contributed to its meteoric rise in popularity – even before major exchange listings have begun. Market Outlook: The Shift Toward New Opportunities Astar’s recent surge has reinvigorated market optimism, but it has also sparked a broader discussion among traders about where the next big wave of profits will come from. While established networks like Astar are proving their staying power, new altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves as the high-upside plays for 2025. With Bitcoin holding steady above $120,000 and anticipation growing around upcoming altcoin ETF approvals, market liquidity is expected to pour into emerging projects. Retail investors, in particular, are showing stronger appetite for early-stage opportunities – especially those that combine verified transparency with strong community growth. Conclusion Astar’s explosive rally has reignited enthusiasm across the crypto market, highlighting how fast momentum can build around fundamentally strong projects. But while Astar enjoys its moment in the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming the name that retail investors are watching most closely. With a proven track record of success in its presale phase, full audit certifications, and predictions of massive upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE could soon emerge as one of the best-performing assets of 2025 – potentially rivaling or even surpassing Astar’s incredible run.

He pointed to his decision in December 2020 to back the token when the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a suit against Ripple, saying he went all-in while many others were selling.

He chose to hold and add. That move, according to his account, set the stage for later gains — from $0.17 to roughly $three, a rise he places at about 1,660% since the lawsuit announcement. XRP will be one of the greatest assets of our lifetime. From the moment I was introduced to it, I felt it deep in my gut. I remember December 2020 when the SEC launched their case against Ripple.

In July 2025 he warned investors that ignoring XRP might mean missing a major transfer of wealth. In August he even forecast that XRP could overtake Bitcoin and Ethereum by 2030. Those are strong claims. They are based on legal clarity and new services that connect the token to everyday use. Related Reading: $140K Or Bust?

52872157,601667,1759971649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52872157.jpeg,‘Rugged’ By Gold? Economist Thinks Bitcoin’s Glory Days May Be Numbered,https://bitcoinist.com/rugged-by-gold-economist-thinks-bitcoins-glory-days-may-be-numbered/,"Bitcoin pulled back from fresh highs this week, while gold pushed higher and grabbed attention. According to social posts by economist Peter Schiff, a move into precious metals could force crypto prices lower. Bitcoin briefly slipped below $122,000 after hitting an intraday peak near $126,000 earlier, and the total crypto market cap eased to about $4.13 trillion. Based on figures, most large coins fell; Ethereum, XRP and Solana dropped between 5% and 6%, while BNB was among the few gainers. Schiff Issues Stark Warning Schiff wrote on X that “Bitcoin and everything crypto are about to be rugged by gold,” and he forecasted gold reaching $4,000 per ounce if the trend continues. He argued Wall Street’s optimism on crypto has become hard to justify and suggested that a sharp move in bullion could pull funds away from digital assets. Gold is trading near $2,700 per ounce at present, putting Schiff’s $4,000 target roughly 50% above current levels. If that happened, large investors would likely take notice, he said. Wall Street is so bullish on crypto that it’s hard to imagine it going much higher from here. Instead, it’s very likely that Bitcoin and everything crypto are about to be rugged by gold. As gold tops $4k, it’s likely that Bitcoin will sell off, taking the rest of crypto with it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 7, 2025 Deutsche Bank Sees A Role For Both Assets Meanwhile, reports have disclosed a Deutsche Bank research note that paints a different picture. The bank said both bitcoin and gold could be held on central bank balance sheets by 2030 as policymakers respond to a weaker dollar and rising geopolitical risks. According to the report, bitcoin reached about $123,500 in August and roughly $125,000 in October during a record run for the token in 2025. Deutsche Bank suggested that a strategic allocation to bitcoin might become part of a modern reserve play, alongside traditional bullion. Sentiment Split Among Investors Some market veterans see the recent dips as a pause, not a top. Paul Tudor Jones, for example, has voiced bullish views and expects further upside for bitcoin. Others, like Schiff, view the setup as the start of a reallocation toward safer stores of value. Traders also noted that the market was pricing in a possible three-week US government shutdown, a factor that briefly boosted volatility across risky assets. Market Moves Broad But Mild Trading data showed the total crypto market off slightly after several weeks of gains. Small profit-taking appears to explain the pullback more than any single event. Based on reports and public comments, two clear scenarios exist: a rotation into gold that drags crypto lower, or a continued appetite for bitcoin that keeps both assets bid. Some institutional players prefer holding both. Others will watch inflation, rate expectations and dollar strength for clues. For now, markets are split and investors are watching price action closely.

Open account → AVAX price fell ~5% in 24 hours amid a broad market pullback, but rising on-chain volume, whale accumulation and growing development activity on Avalanche suggest a potential reversal if key technical support near the 0.75 Fib and the 200 EMA holds. Whales accumulated ~200K AVAX and moved $12M to an exchange wallet On-chain volume rose by $200 million, with DEX trades ≈33% of daily volume Smart contract count tripled year-over-year; total burned AVAX reached 4.8M AVAX price: Avalanche dips 5% as whales buy in; monitor on-chain volume and 200 EMA for reversal—read the latest on-chain data and trading cues. What is driving the AVAX price drop? AVAX price fell roughly 5% in the last 24 hours as the broader crypto market corrected following recent bullish momentum. Short-term selling pressure coincided with profit-taking, while elevated on-chain buying suggests informed accumulation beneath key technical levels. How significant is whale activity on Avalanche? Blockchain analytics show a large whale purchase of about 200,000 AVAX (~$6 million) in 24 hours and a separate transfer of roughly $12 million to a Coinbase wallet. These moves indicate accumulation and potential liquidity rotation. Source: Arkham (data referenced as plain text). Avalanche (AVAX) has seen heightened on-chain engagement despite the price dip. Over the past day, AVAX dropped 5%, extending a weekly decline near 7%. However, the pullback coincided with strong buy-ins that often mark the start of trend reversals when paired with rising activity. Why is on-chain activity rising for Avalanche? On-chain metrics show a $200 million increase in trading volume, pushing cumulative daily volume past significant thresholds. Decentralized exchange (DEX) trades accounted for approximately 33% of the total daily volume, highlighting retail and protocol-level participation. Source: DefiLlama (plain text reference). What development signals support a bullish outlook? Development activity is climbing: the number of smart contracts in Avalanche’s ecosystem has more than tripled year-over-year to over 44 million cumulative contracts. The total burned AVAX hit 4.8 million, with an average burn of ~1,250 tokens per day since mid-July, tightening supply. Will AVAX price reverse and how can traders watch it? Technically, AVAX broke a narrowing rising wedge and fell below the 200 EMA on the four-hour chart. Price is stabilizing near the 0.75 Fibonacci retracement level—often a zone for reversals. Reclaiming the 200 EMA would strengthen a bullish case; failure could lead to a retest of $26 and the recent $22–$26 range. Traders should monitor: 1) reclaim of the 200 EMA, 2) sustained DEX share above ~30%, 3) continued whale accumulation and net burn trends. A blockchain analyst at COINOTAG notes that coordinated on-chain and technical signals increase the probability of a meaningful bounce. How could investors interpret the current data? Short-term traders may view the 0.75 Fib zone as a tactical long opportunity with tight risk management, while longer-term investors should weigh growing development activity and supply burns as constructive fundamentals for Avalanche’s ecosystem growth. Frequently Asked Questions Is AVAX price likely to recover soon? Possible—if AVAX reclaims the 200 EMA and on-chain volume remains elevated, a reversal is plausible. Watch whale accumulation and Fib support for confirmation within the next 1–2 weeks. How much did whales buy and where was the liquidity moved? Arkham data indicated a whale purchased ~200,000 AVAX (~$6M) and another transfer of about $12M was moved into a Coinbase wallet. These actions signal both accumulation and exchange liquidity inflows. What on-chain metrics matter most for AVAX? Key metrics include daily trading volume, DEX share of volume, burn rate, smart contract growth, and large transfer patterns. Combined, they give a clearer picture of demand and network health. Key Takeaways Price action : AVAX slipped ~5% in 24 hours amid a market correction. On-chain strength : $200M uptick in volume and DEX trades ≈33% of total volume. Signals to watch : 200 EMA reclamation, continued whale buys, and burn rate trends. Conclusion AVAX price pulled back through technical support but rising on-chain volume, whale accumulation and growing development activity point to an improving fundamental backdrop. Monitor the 200 EMA and Fib support for reversal confirmation; COINOTAG will update its coverage as fresh data arrives. How to watch AVAX for a potential reversal Check if AVAX reclaims the 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart. Verify DEX volume share remains near or above 30% and total volume stays elevated. Track whale transfers and net burn to confirm sustained demand and reduced supply. Use a stop-loss below the $22–$26 range if entering long on a bounce.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is beginning the Thursday trading day in Asia trading above $123,000, and its chart looks like a rocket trail through the fog, analysts say, painting it as an aggressive rally high powered by ETF inflows, mid-tier accumulation, and a quiet conviction that this isn’t the top yet. That conviction is grounded in three converging signals from major market watchers. In its most recent note , QCP wrote that it sees capital rotating out of overextended AI equities and into “credibility hedges” like gold and Bitcoin as policy uncertainty deepens. Glassnode points to record ETF inflows and mid-tier accumulation flipping resistance into support. And CryptoQuant wrote that it finds on-chain profit-taking still well below historic peaks, suggesting the rally has room to run even as leverage builds. Together, they describe a market that’s structurally bullish but tactically crowded: steady hands underneath, froth on top. But the same data that show conviction also point to complacency. Futures open interest has reached record highs, funding rates are above 8%, and a call-heavy options positioning leaves the market vulnerable to a sharp decline if momentum fades. Analysts call it a classic “strong trend, weak hands” setup: one that often needs a leverage reset before the next leg higher. “The current pullback is now testing this leverage, helping to reset positioning and restore balance,” wrote Glassnode in its weekly report. QCP Capital added that “yesterday’s move lower looked like positioning, not policy,” while CryptoQuant observed that “profit-taking remains subdued compared to previous market tops.” Yet even among the data desks, the message isn’t uniform. Glassnode warns that leverage needs to be flushed before the rally can stabilize; CryptoQuant argues the market still has breathing room before euphoria sets in; and QCP frames the move as a macro rotation into “credibility hedges” like gold and BTC. Bitcoin’s climb is being watched from three different altitudes. With funding rates high and open interest still climbing, traders may get the reset they’ve been warning about. The question isn’t whether Bitcoin can hold $120,000, it’s whether the next dip will prove the rally’s depth or expose its fragility. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $123,000, steady after rebounding from this week’s pullback as ETF inflows and whale accumulation continue to support prices. While short-term momentum has cooled, institutional demand and the broader “debasement trade” narrative keep the uptrend intact heading into October’s seasonally bullish period. ETH: Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,516, holding steady after recent volatility as traders rotate back into major layer-1 assets. Sentiment remains supported by strong ETF inflows, optimism ahead of December’s Fusaka upgrade, and renewed institutional interest in staking and DeFi yields. Gold: Gold surged past $4,000 for the first time Wednesday, its 40th record high this year, driven by geopolitical tensions, U.S. fiscal uncertainty, and sustained central bank demand led by China’s eleventh consecutive month of gold purchases Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.1% Thursday, led by a 10% surge in SoftBank after it agreed to buy ABB’s robotics unit for $5.4 billion, as optimism over Prime Minister-elect Sanae Takaichi’s expansionist agenda and continued loose monetary policy fueled gains across tech and cyclical stocks.

It is the asset’s best year-to-date run in more than forty-five years, according to data from CoinGecko, which shows just how much blockchain-based versions of the metal have grown in circulation. Since January, the number of wallets holding tokenized gold has climbed by 53%, according to rwa.xyz. At the same time, supply has surged, with Tether Gold up 52% and Paxos Gold rising 50%. These tokens are designed to represent ownership of physical gold, but traded as crypto. Investors load into tokenized gold as fiat weakens The rally is part of what analysts call the debasement trade. Since the start of the year, gold has gained 54%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 31% climb. Tom Bailey, head of research at HANetf, said, “Gold is on track for its strongest annual performance since 1979. Mounting fiscal strains across developed economies are raising questions about long-term debt sustainability.” Bailey was pointing to the value erosion in currencies such as the US dollar. Governments have expanded deficits and printed more money, while inflation has run above target levels. That has led investors to buy gold and Bitcoin, assets seen as a safer way to protect wealth. Political events have also added fuel. The election of Sanae Takaichi as Japan’s prime minister boosted the trend. She supports more public spending and tax cuts, a policy mix seen as negative for the yen. Investors are betting those steps will weaken Japan’s currency and push more demand toward gold and Bitcoin. Gold rally brings tokenization into focus The record-breaking price run is encouraging both traditional and crypto investors to look at gold in new ways. Timo Lehes, co-founder of Swarm, said, “Every new all-time high brings renewed interest to an asset and gold’s breakout is no exception. We’re seeing clear momentum toward real-world assets becoming a backbone of onchain finance.” One of the key features of tokenized gold is its use in decentralized finance. Holders can deploy it on networks such as Ethereum, giving the commodity more utility beyond storage. Even with this expansion, the market for tokenized gold remains small compared to traditional investment vehicles. Gold ETFs still dominate, holding $461 billion in assets this year, and recording inflows of $64 billion, figures released by the World Gold Council show. The trend has also been tied to wider economic fears. Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, chief investment officer at XBTO and a former BlackRock and JPMorgan executive, said the so-called debasement trade has made crypto products clear winners. The recent government shutdown reignited concerns about fiat stability, sending money toward both Bitcoin and tokenized precious metals. Meanwhile, Bitcoin set a new all-time high this week, briefly touching $126,200 before pulling back near $123,200. The crypto has added about 30% year-to-date. But the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio now sits at 31.6, down from above 40 in December 2024, showing that gold has been the stronger performer in recent months. Equity markets have also rallied at the same time. The S&P 500 reached 6,753 points, setting a fresh record even as alternative assets climbed. Tokenized gold products remain unique. Each token is backed by physical gold held in secure vaults, while giving investors the portability and divisibility of crypto. The model combines the characteristics of a commodity that has stood the test of time with the technology powering today’s markets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

52871709,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=831356,1759973936,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52871709.jpeg,Bitwise sets 0.20% fee for Solana staking ETF,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitwise-sets-0-20-fee-for-solana-staking-etf/,"Bitwise Asset Management announced its planned Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) will charge a fee of 0.20%, in the latest salvo by the firm to undercut competitors and attract investor dollars. The move comes as asset managers rush to secure U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for several crypto-based ETFs, amid a volatile regulatory environment. Bitwise announced Wednesday that its upcoming Solana Staking ETF will carry a 0.20% management fee—significantly lower than many expected. Observers of the industry view this move as a well-thought-out one that will solidify Bitwise’s position ahead of other market participants in a business where being cost-effective is key to attracting fund inflows. At 0.20%, the proposed fee would align Bitwise’s Solana ETF with its previous Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , which also charge approximately the same rate. This parity between digital asset classes suggests that Bitwise aims to create an investable vehicle for both institutional and retail investors in Solana, a fast-growing blockchain renowned for its scalability and low fees. Should it be approved, the fund may create new avenues for traditional investors to access exposure to Solana’s staking rewards without having to manage the tokens themselves, according to analysts. Staking allows holders to earn yield by supporting blockchain network operations, a hallmark that may add to the longer-term appeal. Market competition intensifies amid SEC delays The filing, however, comes at a sensitive juncture. Last week’s government shutdown in the U.S. has put several normally functioning operations at the SEC on hold, pending decisions regarding certain ETFs. The agency’s contingency plan suggests that only a limited number of staff members are still available to address pressing issues, leaving firms with uncertainty about whether any approvals will be forthcoming. This lag is beginning to have an impact on a growing list of applications, with more than two dozen crypto-related ETF proposals awaiting approval. Among these are products linked to assets including Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC) and Solana (SOL), indicating that traditional finance has an appetite for decentralized tech. The overall ETF market has been heating up since the SEC sanctioned spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, and then Ethereum ETFs a few months later. Those approvals, following a seminal court decision in favour of the Grayscale Investments fund, led to a shift in how regulators and supervision of digital assets is viewed in the U.S. If the Solana ETF is approved, it could be yet another step in that evolution. In the meantime, 21Shares unveiled improvements to its 21Shares Ethereum ETF product, including the introduction of staking and a one-year waiver of the sponsor fee. The firm referred to the move as the natural evolution of Ethereum investment products in the U.S. market, providing investors with exposure to yield generation that leverages a regulated ETF structure. Bitwise boosts its footprint in crypto finance Bitwise’s low fee is the latest move in a series of strategic efforts that solidify Bitwise’s position as a leading industry player among crypto index providers and ETF managers. The firm, based in San Francisco, has been a vocal advocate for clear regulatory frameworks and user-friendly products that help bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance. By charging one of the lowest fees among digital asset ETFs, Bitwise is betting on scale. This could be a successful play if more institutional investors, financial advisors and retail traders ultimately want broad crypto exposure when the SEC leaves the building. Regulatory hurdles remain, but investors continue to be enthusiastic about the growth of Solana’s network and its staking opportunity. If approved, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF would be a bellwether product for crypto-curious investors seeking to enter the market through traditional, regulated products. Get seen where it counts.

Holiday data showed that households were tightening their belts, opting for cheaper road trips instead of flights, while box office revenues fell short of expectations. The spending pullback comes as demand for AI talent surges, propelling global tech stocks to record highs even as China’s markets briefly paused and companies deepened ties with AI firms like OpenAI. Chinese traders initiate a search for hints on policy changes in the market During the Chinese market closure , a measure of major mainland stocks listed in Hong Kong dropped by 0.3%, with the offshore yuan declining slightly. Regarding the situation , traders are looking for clues on policy changes ahead of the Communist Party’s meeting, scheduled to take place from October 20 to 23. In this meeting, officials will discuss plans to be implemented over the next five years. Another factor that sparks hope for a solution is a potential meeting between US President Donald Trump and the President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping. The meeting is anticipated to take place at the November APEC summit in South Korea. Analysts project that this could have an impact if tariff talks start again. Xin-Yao Ng, an Investment Director and Fund Manager at Aberdeen Investments, commented on the topic of discussion, stating that he was not pleased with the early data for tourism during the holidays. He predicted that the data would remain about the same or decrease unless new and more accurate information is released later. The fund manager made these remarks regarding the opening of the mainland stock market. In the meantime, reliable sources have highlighted that the CSI 300 Index has increased for five consecutive months through September, marking its prolonged success since 2017. The heightened excitement over chip stocks has mainly triggered this increase after DeepSeek introduced a new model and Huawei Technologies Co. announced its intention to double production of its top AI chips. Following this, Ian Samson, a Multi Asset Portfolio Manager at Fidelity International in Singapore, pointed out that at one point, if fast-growing Chinese firms, particularly in the internet sector, can achieve their earnings expectations, investors view them as very appealing compared to other firms globally. Weak consumer spending in China raises concerns in the market Spending during Golden Week suggested that consumers are cautious with their money. According to sources, people continued to spend on travel and experiences, but box office and airline demand were not as robust as anticipated. In addition, shares of movie stocks, such as Maoyan Entertainment and Damai Entertainment Holdings Ltd., declined sharply in Hong Kong after Citigroup highlighted low ticket sales. Travellers, on the other hand, began moving away from air and rail to road trips, and the number of highway passengers in private cars rose 6% compared to last year during Golden Week, according to Morgan Stanley. This was after data from the Ministry of Transport showed that total passenger traffic was approximately 7% higher over the first seven days than it was last year. This percentage reflected a decrease from the 8% increase observed during May’s five-day Labour Day holiday. Regarding the situation, analysts at Julius Baer stated that the Golden Week results indicate that consumer spending in China remains weak, and this will likely add to the pressure on investors to sell off their shares in consumer good-related stocks Get seen where it counts.

Recent chart analysis indicates that Dogecoin’s dominance may be on the verge of a significant breakout, a move that could translate into stronger upward momentum for its price. Analysts believe Dogecoin’s current chart setup is similar to previous major bullish cycles, making this a critical period for traders. Dogecoin Dominance Breakout To Ignite Fresh Rally Dogecoin‘s dominance has spent nearly three and a half years in a controlled downtrend, beginning in 2021, and finally breaking out of this major resistance in late 2024. According to crypto analyst EtherNasyonal on X social media, the market experienced its first key breakout in November 2024, with a successful retest taking place in June 2025. More recently, a minor downtrend also broke out and retested, signaling growing strength in DOGE’s market position . The accompanying chart shows a “bullish pin bar” on the retest, which EtherNasyonal emphasized is a classic sign of trend reversal and strong buying momentum . This aligns with the growing dominance curve projected well into 2026, potentially positioning DOGE to capture a larger share of the overall crypto market capitalization. If the dominance continues its current trajectory, the analyst expects it to move from 0.95% dominance to almost 5.5%, an increase that could trigger an explosive price action. EtherNasyonal also reiterated Dogecoin’s unique history and growth in the crypto space. In a previous post, he noted that what began as a light-hearted meme has now evolved into a global financial and cultural phenomenon. According to the analyst, a single image of a Shiba Inu has evolved into a movement built on community, humour, and accessibility. He also stated that when SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk first embraced Dogecoin, the coin’s profile skyrocketed. He mentioned that Musk’s lighthearted tweets gave Dogecoin an identity, transforming it from meme to movement. He further added that the meme coin now stands on a more mature foundation, with a loyal global community and integration with various exchange platforms. DOGE Resistance Battle Could Define Its Next Move For months, Dogecoin has repeatedly tested the $0.25-$0.28 resistance zone but has so far failed to break through. Crypto market analyst Matt Hughes pointed out that the current price structure is showing a tightening consolidation near $0.24, indicating growing momentum beneath the surface and signaling that the cryptocurrency may be gearing up for a breakout . The analyst noted that a decisive push above $0.27 could trigger a sharp rally toward the final target of $0.36 or higher.

Ripple native token, XRP, is on the forefront with new institutional adoption, whereas Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) are still rising in popularity as the ecosystem is expanding. Analysts also identified MAGACOIN FINANCE, an Ethereum-based presale project, as one of the most promising altcoins to buy ahead of the Q4 rally . XRP ETF Speculation on the Rise XRP remains at the center of market speculation as seven spot ETF applications await U.S. SEC decisions this October. These filings from major asset managers like BlackRock and Grayscale could unlock over $5 billion in capital inflows if approved. XRP is trading at an average of $3, and it has a 35% monthly increase as major investors accumulate the asset before any regulation milestones. On-chain data indicates that whales have accumulated more than 160 million XRP , worth 1.5 billion in the last 30 days, which indicates confidence in a breakout. The price is currently trading in an ascending triangle pattern with the key resistance of $3.12 to $3.30 . A successful breakout above this zone could pave the way toward $5.00 , according to analysts. Technically, XRP has a good bullish momentum. The 50-day moving average, which is at the moment close to $2.93 , is in favor of an uptrend, while the derivatives data show an increase in open interest which leads to greater involvement in the market. With such trends and ETF expectations, XRP is becoming considered one of the best altcoins to buy before Q4. The quest by Ripple to receive a federal banking charter at the Office of the Comptroller in the United States is also a credible addition. Provided the approvals are made, Ripple may be a regulated entity providing settlement and custody services in XRP. Cardano Price Strengthens as Market Recovers Cardano (ADA) continues to attract investor attention as its ecosystem expands through new DeFi and governance initiatives . ADA price has rebounded from the $0.75 level, with bullish analysts forecasting a possible move toward $3.29 and $3.74 if the uptrend sustains. Moreover, the Cardano Foundation’s 2025 roadmap outlines a major liquidity fund and venture initiatives worth over 200 million ADA to support the growth of Web3. Analysts highlight that ADA’s chart mirrors the 2020–2021 bull run structure, suggesting another parabolic cycle may be near. Institutional participation has also grown, with Hashdex confirming ADA’s inclusion in its Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. This move is expected to introduce fresh liquidity. With these developments, Cardano ranks among the best altcoins to buy this quarter . Amid this optimism, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as another key name drawing investor attention for Q4 positioning. AVAX Price Bullish Flag Signals $108 Target Avalanche (AVAX) is forming a bullish flag pattern on the monthly chart, signaling a potential breakout toward $108 . The token currently consolidates near $30 , supported by a threefold surge in developer activity, with over 44 million contracts deployed in the past year. This growth underscores Avalanche’s rising prominence as a leading smart contract network. Analysts identify $32–$35 as the breakout zone, beyond which bulls could drive AVAX toward the $50–$100 range . AVAXUSD 1-Month Chart | Source: X Liquidity on Avalanche’s network now exceeds $950 billion , approaching the $1 trillion milestone. This deep on-chain activity suggests institutional confidence, strengthening the long-term bullish case. While established altcoins like AVAX show solid upside potential, presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being recognized by analysts as the best crypto presales with significant ROI potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst Picks of Best Altcoin to Buy in Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE , an Ethereum-based presale project, has raised over $15.5 million from 18,000+ investors, positioning itself as one of the most trusted new altcoins in 2025. Backed by successful audits from HashEx and an ongoing Certik review , the project is drawing attention for its verified smart contract, and fast-growing investor community. Whales and analysts have also begun referencing MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside XRP and Cardano in major reports, a rare crossover for a presale-stage token. This inclusion signals strong market credibility and early recognition among institutional and retail players. The project’s momentum is further supported by limited-time presale bonuses and rising holder numbers, with experts predicting 100x potential ROI post-exchange listing. Combining Ethereum’s reliability , community engagement, and strong audit credentials, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the best altcoin to buy before Q4 for investors seeking early-stage growth. Conclusion With the market preparing to make ETF decisions and wider institutional inflows, top assets, such as XRP, Cardano, and AVAX , are positioned to have breakouts in Q4. MAGACOIN FINANCE is, however, a proven, high-growing presale with huge upside potential. To investors planning on investing in the 2025 bull cycle, the most desirable altcoin to buy prior to Q4 run is this Ethereum-based project.

After weeks of volatility and record-breaking highs, BTC now faces a pivotal test — it must either reclaim its all-time highs and enter a new phase of price discovery, or continue its correction to establish a stronger base of consolidation around current levels. The market appears finely balanced, with traders watching closely for signs of direction. Related Reading: Grayscale Stakes 32,000 Ethereum Worth $150 Million – Institutional Demand Grows Recent onchain data highlights a surge in new buyers, marking one of the strongest inflows of fresh capital seen in months. This trend suggests renewed bullish momentum, as investors increasingly view Bitcoin’s current range as an opportunity rather than a peak. According to key metrics, the supply held by short-term holders has grown substantially, reflecting the entry of new participants eager to ride the next major impulse. While short-term volatility remains a concern, analysts agree that the underlying structure of the market remains strongly bullish. As long as Bitcoin holds above its major support zones, the stage could be set for another breakout — one that propels the asset beyond its previous highs and into uncharted territory once again. Short-Term Holders Signal a New Phase for Bitcoin Top analyst Axel Adler shared key insights revealing that over the past quarter, short-term holders’ supply has increased by 559,000 BTC, climbing from a low of 4.38 million to 4.94 million BTC. This rise marks a clear influx of new participants entering the market, a pattern often seen during the early stages of bullish expansions. The growth in short-term holder supply suggests that fresh demand is building up — as new investors accumulate Bitcoin, older coins are redistributed, creating a healthier market structure. Historically, periods of rising short-term holder activity have coincided with momentum shifts, as fresh liquidity enters the system and fuels upward volatility. This dynamic reflects renewed market confidence following Bitcoin’s recent push to new all-time highs. More importantly, it shows that retail and short-term investors are re-engaging, positioning for what many analysts expect to be the next major impulse in the cycle. While some caution that high short-term holder activity can also lead to faster profit-taking and volatility, the broader outlook remains constructive. With long-term holders maintaining strong conviction and institutions continuing to accumulate, the combination of new inflows and resilient fundamentals supports a bullish continuation setup. Adler notes that this expansion in short-term supply typically precedes a new phase of market acceleration, as liquidity and optimism return in tandem. If Bitcoin manages to reclaim and sustain levels above its previous all-time high, the growing base of active short-term investors could provide the momentum needed for another breakout. In short, the data suggests that the market isn’t exhausted — it’s recharging, setting the stage for the next leg of the bull cycle.

The 12-hour chart highlights that BTC has entered a consolidation phase following its explosive breakout, with the $120,000–$121,000 range now acting as a short-term support zone. The yellow line at $117,500, a previous resistance from earlier in the cycle, continues to serve as a key structural level that could define the next move. The blue 50-period moving average is trending upward, reinforcing bullish momentum, while the 200-period moving average remains far below the current price, confirming that Bitcoin is still in a strong uptrend. Despite the recent correction, the price structure remains constructive — higher highs and higher lows continue to form, suggesting that bulls are maintaining control.

Overall, this chart reflects a healthy cooldown after an aggressive rally, allowing momentum indicators to reset. As long as BTC holds above its key supports, the broader trend remains firmly bullish, setting the stage for another attempt toward price discovery.

Open account → Bitcoin ETF inflows are forecast to hit a record in Q4 as higher BTC prices and broadened access for advisers drive demand. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says strong price momentum and renewed institutional adoption make Bitcoin ETF inflows the key catalyst for more capital entering BTC in Q4. Record Q4 inflows forecast Analysts see steady upward momentum in Bitcoin price with low short-term volatility. Bitcoin ETFs attracted $22.5B in the first nine months; Q4 flows could set a new annual record. Bitcoin ETF inflows predicted to peak in Q4 — Bitcoin ETF inflows front and center; read expert analysis and next steps for investors. What are the latest forecasts for Bitcoin ETF inflows? Bitcoin ETF inflows are expected to surge in Q4, with Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicting record quarterly net flows driven by higher BTC prices and wider adviser adoption. The first nine months saw $22.5 billion in ETF inflows, signaling momentum that could push full-year ETF flows to new highs. How is Bitcoin’s price momentum shaping ETF demand? Bitcoin’s price recently reached a new peak above $126,000 while technical indicators show balanced upward momentum. CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain notes a 30-day moving average near $116,000 and relatively low 30-day standard deviation of about $4,540, suggesting compressed volatility that often precedes strong price moves. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Bitcoin’s growth ratio has been on an upward trajectory since May 2024. Source: CryptoQuant Analysts observe that Bitcoin typically reaches cycle peaks within roughly 600 days after halving events. If that historical cadence holds, BTC is in a critical window that has previously produced major bull-market tops, yet current momentum indicators do not yet show classic overbought signals. Why does Bitwise expect record inflows in Q4? Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan attributes the forecast to three key drivers: rising Bitcoin prices, increasing adviser access to ETFs, and macro conditions favoring assets that perform well amid US dollar weakness. Hougan argues that higher prices attract media and investor attention, which tends to amplify ETF demand. What are the recent ETF flow figures and outlook? US Bitcoin ETFs logged $22.5 billion in inflows during the first nine months of the year. Hougan noted ETFs took in $3.5 billion in the first four trading days of Q4, putting momentum on pace to exceed prior annual totals such as the $36 billion seen in the launch year. Gold (blue) and Bitcoin (orange) ETF inflows by year since launch. Source: Bitwise How are wealth managers and advisers influencing flows? Hougan highlights that large wealth managers opening access to Bitcoin ETFs will materially expand the investor base. A recent Morgan Stanley report (plain text reference) indicated advisers are increasingly able to allocate to cryptocurrency, with suggested allocations for risk-tolerant clients up to 4% in multi-asset portfolios. That adviser adoption, combined with year-end client reviews that favor showing top-performing holdings, creates a practical pathway for significant year-end buying into Bitcoin ETFs. Frequently Asked Questions Will Q4 ETF inflows push Bitcoin to a new all-time high? ETF inflows can provide sustained demand that supports higher prices, but price moves also depend on liquidity, macro conditions and miner behavior. Analysts say current momentum and inflows increase the probability of further upside, not guarantee it. How much did US Bitcoin ETFs attract so far this year? US Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $22.5 billion in inflows through the first nine months, with early Q4 net flows around $3.5 billion in the first four trading days. Are Bitcoin’s technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions? Technical metrics referenced by analysts show Bitcoin below classic overbought thresholds, with a steady 30-day moving average and compressed volatility—conditions that often precede larger directional moves if liquidity supports them. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will Q4 ETF inflows push Bitcoin to a new all-time high?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ETF inflows can support higher prices, but outcomes also depend on liquidity and macro factors.

Adviser adoption matters : Broader access through wealth managers can amplify year-end flows and investor allocations. Conclusion Bitcoin ETF inflows are positioned to be the dominant demand driver in Q4 as BTC price momentum and adviser access converge. Industry figures such as Matt Hougan of Bitwise and market data highlight a scenario where ETFs could absorb substantial capital before year-end. Investors should monitor net flows, technical indicators, and adviser adoption when evaluating positioning. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Smarter tools. Better decisions.

The Bitcoin four-year cycle is a historical observation tying the interval from a cycle low to a halving with an equal interval from halving to cycle high. Traders use this pattern to estimate peak windows, but the pattern is descriptive—not a guaranteed predictor. How did Peter Brandt interpret the cycle this week? Veteran trader Peter Brandt noted Bitcoin’s cycle low on Nov. 9, 2022, occurred 533 days before the April 20, 2024 halving. Adding 533 days to that halving places a critical window in early October 2025, which aligns with recent strong price action above prior highs.

Open futures account → Bitcoin is trading at $122,070 at the time of publication, up 9.74% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Why could deviation from the cycle be dramatic? Market trends that break long-observed cyclic patterns often produce outsized moves. If Bitcoin fails to respect the four-year symmetry, traders and algorithms recalibrating positions can amplify volatility. What are other analysts saying about timing and targets? Several analysts and market participants offer varied projections. Some models indicate a substantial chance Bitcoin could exceed $140,000 in short windows. Other voices have suggested targets ranging up to $250,000 by the end of 2025, reflecting divergent assumptions on liquidity and adoption. When did Bitcoin hit its recent all-time high? Bitcoin set a new all-time high above $126,100 on Monday following the crucial cycle date over the weekend. Observers point to that move as confirmation of continued price discovery, provided the advance sustains itself beyond short-term corrections. How should traders and investors act on the cycle? Prudent market participants combine cycle analysis with risk management: set clear position limits, monitor volatility indicators, and incorporate macro signals such as ETF flows and institutional treasury allocations. Betting solely on cycle symmetry ignores evolving market structure. Frequently Asked Questions Does the four-year cycle guarantee price targets? No. The cycle provides timing context based on historical patterns but does not guarantee price levels. Structural shifts—like ETF adoption or corporate treasuries—can alter outcomes. Can cycles change suddenly? Yes. Cycles can evolve as market participants, products, and regulations change, which is why many analysts treat the pattern as one input among many. Key Takeaways Historical symmetry: Bitcoin’s pre- and post-halving intervals have matched in past cycles, making timing windows useful for planning. Not infallible: Deviations from the cycle can cause dramatic volatility; combine cycle insights with risk controls. Data-driven approach: Use volume, open interest, and macro indicators alongside cycle projections to form balanced views. Conclusion The Bitcoin four-year cycle remains a meaningful reference point for traders and analysts, but it should be integrated with contemporary data and sound risk management. COINOTAG will continue monitoring on-chain metrics, institutional flows, and expert commentary to update readers as conditions evolve. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Smarter tools.

Bitcoin attempts to flip $123K into support as analysts project a 20–30% rally, backed by strong on-chain data and rising activity. By COINOTAG | Published: October 7, 2025 | Updated: October 7, 2025 How is Bitcoin price attempting to flip $123K into support? Bitcoin price is testing its prior ATH region near $123,000 and forming higher lows, with traders watching for multiple weekly closes above that level. Technical momentum and on‑chain strength suggest that holding $123K would increase the probability of a 20–30% rally toward $130K–$133K. What is the technical outlook for BTC as it tests $123K? BTC rebounded from the $121,000 support zone and consolidated around $123,000. Technical indicators show strong buying momentum and a cleared descending trendline from August–September. Analysts emphasize that a few weekly closes above $123K are needed to confirm the next bullish phase. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → $BTC is now trying to flip its previous ATH into support. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a fakeout below it, but overall a few weekly close above $123K is needed. This will set the stage for the next 20%-30% rally in the coming weeks. — BitBull (@AkaBull_) October 7, 2025 The breakout above $123,000 followed months of consolidation and repeated rejections. Market behavior indicates recovery momentum supported by stronger buying pressure and consistent liquidity inflows across major exchanges. Traders are monitoring weekly closes and order‑flow at $120K–$124K ranges for confirmation of continuation. Source: KamranAsghar (X) Market quote: Kamran Asghar: “BTC is a ticking clock. The breakout above $124,500 is the trigger for $130,000.” Recent trading indicates support near $120,800–$121,500 and upward targets around $126,000–$128,000. What on-chain data supports a potential Bitcoin rally? On‑chain data is currently aligned with bullish price structure. CryptoQuant metrics show 99.4% of circulating BTC in profit, indicating historically high realized gains for holders. This level of profitability typically coincides with elevated market participation and the potential for volatile upside moves. Which participation metrics matter most? Key metrics to monitor include active addresses, TVL in DeFi, exchange flows, and 24‑hour trading volume. DeFi TVL, active address counts, and large inflows to exchanges can collectively indicate stronger demand from both retail and institutional segments. Source: DeFiLlama DeFi TVL stands at approximately $8.952 billion, showing continued ecosystem growth. Active addresses are near 767,705, while 24‑hour trading volumes have exceeded $70.9 billion (CoinMarketCap data). These metrics reflect heightened engagement across the network. What are the key price levels and analyst targets? Analysts cite short‑term resistance between $126K and $128K and medium targets of $130K–$133K. A confirmed flip of $123K to support with follow‑through volume would increase the probability of reaching those targets. Price levels and targets Level Range / Target Significance Support test $120,800–$121,500 Immediate on‑chain support zone Flip level $123,000 Confirmation needed via weekly closes Near target $126,000–$128,000 First resistance cluster Medium target $130,000–$133,000 Analyst target area Frequently Asked Questions How likely is a 20–30% rally if $123K holds? If Bitcoin holds $123K on multiple weekly closes, probability for a 20–30% rally rises materially. Confirmation requires sustained volume and continued on‑chain strength alongside reduced liquidation risk for short positions. How can traders monitor confirmation signals? Watch for: 1) multiple weekly closes above $123K, 2) rising on‑chain inflows and active addresses, 3) strengthening exchange order books. These signals together increase confidence in breakout sustainability. Key Takeaways Support flip is pivotal : Holding $123K on weekly closes increases odds of a 20–30% rally. On‑chain strength : 99.4% of BTC supply is in profit, indicating broad holder gains. Watch volume and liquidity : Rising exchange activity and TVL suggest growing participation; monitor weekly closes and order flow. Conclusion Bitcoin price is at a critical juncture as it attempts to flip $123K into support. Front‑loaded on‑chain data and technical structure support a bullish case, but confirmation requires multiple weekly closes above $123K and sustained volume. Traders should monitor levels, on‑chain metrics, and exchange liquidity for next steps. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-flip-123k-support"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Attempts to Flip $123K into Support, Analysts Eye 20–30% Rally"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-111.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" }, ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin attempts to flip $123K into support as on-chain metrics and exchange activity point to a potential 20–30% rally; traders watch weekly closes for confirmation.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How is Bitcoin price attempting to flip $123K into support?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bitcoin is testing its prior ATH near $123,000 and forming higher lows; multiple weekly closes above this level would signal a confirmed flip and increase the chance of a 20–30% rally."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on‑chain metrics support a potential rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key metrics include 99.4% of circulating supply in profit, rising active addresses, DeFi TVL near $8.952B, and elevated 24h trading volumes above $70B."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor Bitcoin's flip of $123K"", ""description"": ""Step‑by‑step checklist to validate whether BTC has flipped $123K into support."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm weekly closes"", ""text"": ""Wait for at least two weekly closes above $123,000 to reduce false breakouts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check on‑chain profitability"", ""text"": ""Verify that a high percentage of circulating supply remains in profit; elevated profitability supports holding momentum."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor volume and liquidity"", ""text"": ""Ensure daily trading volume and exchange order book depth rise alongside price to confirm demand."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch nearby resistance"", ""text"": ""Track price reaction at $126K–$128K and evaluate strength before assuming medium targets of $130K–$133K."" } ]} COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Smarter tools.

Interestingly, while BNB’s institutional strength continues to impress, retail investors are increasingly shifting their attention toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-rising project that many believe could deliver extraordinary long-term returns thanks to its robust roadmap and consistent growth momentum. According to data from CryptoQuant , BNB’s rally has been fueled by powerful on-chain signals. Over the past quarter, its Futures Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) has shown a clear buy-side dominance, with aggressive accumulation visible since May 2025. The token’s price has surged nearly 30% in a week, pushing its market capitalization to almost $183 billion. Analysts say this growth is a direct result of deflationary mechanics, liquidity concentration, and institutional adoption, all of which have transformed BNB from a simple exchange token into a key player bridging Web3 and traditional finance. Institutional Liquidity and Deflation Mechanics BNB’s rise is closely tied to Binance’s growing share of market liquidity. Data shows that Binance now holds roughly 60% of all stablecoin reserves across exchanges, with total reserves exceeding $50 billion. This dominance gives the exchange unmatched control over liquidity flows – a critical advantage during bullish phases. Combined with its ongoing token burn program, which steadily reduces supply, BNB’s value proposition continues to strengthen. Experts note that this unique mix of scarcity and institutional credibility has allowed BNB to outperform most large-cap assets. Its seamless integration into DeFi platforms, payment systems, and cross-chain applications has expanded its utility, while long-term investors increasingly view it as a cornerstone of a diversified crypto portfolio. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The New Favorite for Explosive ROI As BNB consolidates its dominance, new capital from retail traders is flowing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has become one of the most talked-about presale projects of 2025. Known for its exceptional growth trajectory and rapid sellouts in early rounds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already drawn comparisons to the early days of SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN. However, what sets it apart is its focus on stability, continuous development, and long-term ecosystem expansion – qualities that are attracting both retail and early institutional interest. Analysts say that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s roadmap is designed to deliver real, sustainable growth rather than short-term hype. With its current presale rounds nearing completion and growing visibility across social media platforms, projections suggest that returns exceeding 20,000% could be within reach if momentum continues at its current pace. This combination of limited access, strong community backing, and clear tokenomics has positioned it as a standout altcoin for investors building their long-term portfolios. BNB’s Broader Market Impact BNB’s record-breaking run has also lifted sentiment across the broader crypto market. Its steady climb signals a renewed appetite for exchange-linked assets and a wider resurgence in altcoin liquidity. The strong price action has encouraged traders to revisit other high-quality tokens with similar growth structures, further fueling optimism that the current rally could extend into Q4 2025. Analysts highlight that BNB’s fundamentals – from its deflationary model to its deep liquidity base – provide a roadmap for other projects aiming to achieve sustainable, long-term value. This success has also created a halo effect that benefits innovative new tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is capturing attention for combining scalability, token utility, and early-mover potential in a fast-growing ecosystem. Looking Ahead The combination of BNB’s institutional strength and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive growth story perfectly reflects today’s evolving crypto market. BNB stands as proof that solid fundamentals and deflationary design can create enduring value, while MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the next frontier for investors seeking the kind of upside that once defined early-stage legends.

This movement among treasuries often serves as a leading signal of shifting sentiment within the broader ETH ecosystem. A Look At The Data Behind Ethereum On-Chain Recovery In a subtle shift that suggests the broader market may be stabilizing, Ethereum treasury stocks are beginning to flash early signs of reversal. Despite these encouraging signals, Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH). Investor Ted Pillows pointed out on X that the institutional interest will only return once the charts show sustained momentum over several weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Store-of-Value Evolution: From Utility Token To Digital Reserve Asset Ted believes that for ETH to reclaim its ATH and hinges on capital inflow, it requires the same kind of large-scale liquidity injection the network experienced in July and August, which are critical to fueling the next leg higher. SharpLink Gaming Inc., a prominent corporate holder of ETH, has reported strong compounding returns from its treasury strategy asset. In the past week alone, the company generated 451 ETH in staking rewards, which is utilized through both liquid and native staking. Since the launch of its ETH treasury strategy on June 2, 2025, SharpLink’s total cumulative ETH staking rewards have now reached an impressive 4,723 ETH. According to the company, 100% continuous generation of yield is the amount of its ETH treasury, which is currently generating approximately $370,000 worth of ETH every day, showcasing ETH’s unique ability to generate yield while maintaining liquidity. SharpLink highlighted this as the reason the altcoin stands out as a superior treasury asset, which is productive, yield-bearing, and constantly compounding in value. Despite the strong performance, the firm confirmed there were no new ETH purchases or stock buybacks over the past week, which means there won’t be a new press release for now. The company’s focus remains clear: “the asset is ETH, and the ticker is SBET,” SharpLink noted. Ethereum Market Share Is Moving Exactly As Scripted Technical analyst Umair Crypto has noted that Ethereum dominance is currently at a critical juncture, having completed the first half of a projected move and now setting the stage for the second half. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces TD Sell Signal At Key Resistance—$4,100 Next? This view anticipates a rejection from the current resistance area on the dominance chart toward the lower level for ETH Dominance, which will likely lead to a price correction where the next bounce for ETH will form. Umair concluded that the altcoin itself could experience a short-term correction once the move unfolds before reclaiming momentum for the next leg higher.

52876128,601671,1759978859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52876128.jpeg,Binance Smart Chain Dominates 24H Activity – $6.05B DEX Volume And $5.57M Fees,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-smart-chain-dominates-activity-dex-volume/,"Binance is celebrating a major milestone as BNB reaches new all-time highs around $1,350, marking another chapter in the exchange’s dominance. The price of BNB has surged over 55% since early September, fueled by strong momentum across the broader crypto market. With this latest rally, BNB has overtaken XRP to become the third most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now standing at $182.1 billion. The surge comes amid renewed enthusiasm around Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which continues to outperform other networks in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity. Data shows that BSC ranks #1 across all chains, recording billions in daily volume, with PancakeSwap — its flagship DEX — leading the charge. This on-chain strength highlights Binance’s deep ecosystem advantage, combining network efficiency, liquidity, and user engagement at scale. Analysts attribute BNB’s performance not only to speculative demand but also to real ecosystem growth. As transaction fees, user activity, and staking metrics rise, confidence in Binance’s ecosystem continues to grow. With market sentiment improving and altcoins showing strength, many see BNB’s breakout as a signal of the next phase of the bull cycle, positioning Binance at the center of crypto’s expanding momentum. BSC Dominates As Binance Narrative Gains Strength According to Lookonchain, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) continues to dominate the crypto landscape, ranking #1 among all blockchains in both decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and chain fees. Over the past 24 hours alone, BSC recorded more than $6.05 billion in DEX trading volume and $5.57 million in transaction fees, surpassing competitors like Ethereum and Solana by a wide margin. This surge in activity coincides with BNB’s strong performance, which recently broke into new all-time highs around $1,350. The token’s rise has reignited enthusiasm around Binance’s expanding ecosystem, reflecting renewed confidence in its scalability and utility. Analysts note that this growth underscores Binance’s position as a central player in the next wave of crypto adoption — combining high transaction throughput, competitive fees, and an increasingly diverse network of DeFi applications. The Binance narrative has been gaining momentum across the market as investors recognize the growing impact of BSC’s ecosystem. Projects built on BSC, including PancakeSwap, are attracting significant liquidity, while daily user activity continues to climb. This consistent onchain growth highlights how Binance’s infrastructure supports sustainable demand, even in volatile market conditions. As BNB leads altcoins into new highs, its ecosystem metrics validate the rally’s fundamentals. Increased trading activity, elevated chain fees, and network expansion all signal healthy organic growth, not just speculative hype. With Binance Smart Chain maintaining the top position in DEX volume and user engagement, the data points to a clear shift in market dominance — one driven by Binance’s unique blend of innovation, liquidity depth, and community scale. If this momentum continues, BSC and BNB could define the next leg of the altcoin bull market. BNB Reaches Parabolic Phase With Record Momentum BNB is showing one of its strongest performances in years, with the weekly chart confirming a parabolic breakout above all previous highs. The token surged to $1,349 before slightly cooling to around $1,313, marking a 12.5% weekly gain and extending its rally that began near $850 just weeks ago. This move represents a 55% rise since early September, firmly placing BNB in price discovery territory. The chart highlights a clear breakout above long-term resistance, supported by growing volume and expanding bullish momentum. The 50-week moving average (blue) has steepened upward and remains well above the 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) moving averages — a strong confirmation of trend acceleration. The price structure also mirrors BNB’s 2021 rally, but with healthier market conditions and broader ecosystem strength. As long as BNB holds above the $1,100–$1,150 range, the technical outlook remains bullish, with potential upside targets beyond $1,400–$1,500 in the short term. Analysts view this surge as both a technical and fundamental breakout, driven by renewed network activity on Binance Smart Chain and strong investor confidence. With market sentiment turning optimistic, BNB’s chart reflects clear bullish continuation potential as the altcoin bull cycle matures.

New entrants to BNB Chain will also gain access to technical support and infrastructure resources. Analysts view the initiative as a strategic response to growing competition among Layer-1 chains. It underscores Binance’s effort to maintain relevance amid a shifting DeFi landscape, where institutional developers are starting to test new on-chain models. Kazakhstan Tightens Crypto Oversight Kazakhstan’s Financial Monitoring Agency (AFM) has closed 130 unauthorized cryptocurrency platforms and seized $16.7 million in illicit funds linked to money laundering. Authorities have also strengthened AML rules, requiring ID verification for transactions above 500,000 tenge ($925). While enforcement intensified, up from 36 closures the previous year, Kazakhstan continues to support legitimate crypto use. The government has launched a national Bitcoin fund, allowed stablecoin fee payments, and is considering a state-backed crypto reserve. The balanced approach highlights a key emerging-market trend: regulatory tightening that does not stifle innovation. Investors view this as constructive for market stability, supporting Bitcoin’s current range around $124,000. MetaMask Adds Hyperliquid, Eyes Polymarket MetaMask has integrated Hyperliquid, enabling users to trade perpetual futures directly from their wallet. The move expands decentralized trading options and reduces reliance on centralized exchanges like OKX and Binance. Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, rose 2.4% following the announcement.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Mid-Trend Correction Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase after rallying to $126,300. The 4-hour chart now shows a descending channel, with resistance near $123,500 and Fibonacci support between $119,500 and $117,400. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators are neutral, with the RSI at 47, while the MACD histogram narrows, signaling a fading bearish pressure. A breakout above $124,000 could retest $126,300 and open the path to $130,000, while a drop below $117,400 may test $115,000. This pullback appears to be a healthy correction within Bitcoin’s long-term bullish channel. Traders are watching the 0.5 and 0.618 retracement zones for renewed strength as we head into Q4.

YETH's synthetic long options strategy significantly underperforms ether spot ETFs like ETHA, with only 8.9% return versus ETHA's 83% over the past year. The fund's high 0.95% expense ratio and poor structuring result in NAV erosion and misleadingly high distribution rates. Sell YETH and consider ETHA for direct ether exposure and better total return potential. Thesis We recently reviewed a very robust and well-structured fund from Roundhill, namely the Roundhill PLTR WeeklyPay ETF ( PLTW ). In that article we praised the asset manager on the fund and its structuring. Today we are going to tackle a different name from Roundhill, but one that sits at the opposite side of the spectrum, unfortunately. Today's article will deal with the Roundhill Ether Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YETH ), and will highlight why we are of the opinion the fund fails to achieve its goals. What does YETH actually do? Let us start by looking at the fund objective: The Roundhill Ether Covered Call Strategy ETF (“YETH”) seeks to offer exposure to ether*, subject to a cap, while providing the potential for current income. YETH is an actively-managed ETF. YETH is therefore a name that aims to extract dividends from ether's performance. An investor always has to keep in mind that such a fund, by design, is supposed to follow the total return provided by the underlying asset. An investor can always just buy ether outright via the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ), and the only reason to go long on a name like YETH is to capitalize on constant gains harvesting, to the extent the fund is correctly structured. YETH employs a synthetic long structure via options A fund can achieve dividends from an underlying asset via various strategies: hold the asset and write covered calls do a total return swap with a bank use a synthetic long A synthetic long position is a financial strategy that is constructed to replicate the exact payoff and risk profile of owning the underlying asset without actually buying the asset outright. Now one can structure a robust synthetic long, and one can structure a poor synthetic long. Without getting too much into financial engineering terms, let us give you a flavor of the YETH holdings: Holdings (Fund Website) The fund uses the ProShares Ether ETF ( EETH ) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) as building blocks. ETHA tracks spot ether, while EETH aims to track ether via futures: Data by YCharts We can see a divergence in performance recently between a construct using futures and one using the spot reference asset. At the end of the day, as a retail investor, you do not need to know too much about how to build a synthetic long, but only observe if the manager is actually doing a good job. Let us have a look at how it works for this name. Performance - large basis Now that we have established what the fund aims to do and how it is built, let us see if it manages to achieve its goal: Data by YCharts The above chart is a total return graph for the three ETFs in the past year. Please note that YETH is astoundingly far off from the ether building blocks. A good dividend extractor would see a total return in a +/-10% band when benchmarked against the underlying asset. We have a basis of 60% to 74% here. How is this possible? Poor structuring. The synthetic long employed does not work well when benchmarked against an actual ether performance. Please note YETH retained all the downside from January 2025 to April 2025 but lagged significantly during an up market. For 0.95% in fees, this fund should do much, much better. Please note the ETF, just like any buy write fund on a volatile asset, shows very large distribution rates (60% currently). Ignore these figures since they are meaningless. The ETF has seen a significant NAV erosion, which has not been compensated enough by the dividend. In fact, in the past year the ETF has mustered a total return of only 8.9% when ether spot is up roughly 83%! What can an investor do here? Well, to put it succinctly, just don't buy YETH and buy ETHA outright. An investor can construct the dividend profile she/he desires via an outright purchase and small sales each month. Let us go through an example: you purchase $1,000 worth of ETHA after 1 month the position is up +12%, and you have $1,120 in your account you can just outright sell $120 worth of stock and give yourself a 144% annualized dividend rate (multiply 120 by 12 to annualize it and divide by 1000) The takeaway here is that extracting dividends from an asset is not that hard; it just takes very active management. Buying a fund that should do that for you is an alternative, but only when it actually achieves that goal. Mind you that YETH could do just what we outlined above, but then it would be hard pressed to charge you 0.95% for it. Instead it employs a complex options strategy, which just fails to achieve its goals. Conclusion YETH is an exchange-traded fund that aims to track ether and extract dividends from its appreciation. The name uses a complex synthetic long options strategy but fails to achieve its stated goal. Ether via ETHA is up almost +83% in the past year, while YETH has posted a paltry +8.9% gain. The structuring here is not great, and it should be changed. The ETF charges a 0.95% expense ratio for this endeavor. While we are sanguine ether into the year's end, we find YETH to be a poor vehicle to express that view.

ETH is now moving lower and might extend losses below $4,400 in the short term. Ethereum started a downside correction below $4,600 and $4,550. The price is trading below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $4,460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it trades below $4,400. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price extended gains above $4,620 and $4,650, like Bitcoin . ETH price tested the $4,750 resistance zone before there was a fresh decline. A low was formed at $4,414 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above $4,500. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,759 swing high to the $4,414 low. However, the bears are active near the $4,550 level. Besides, there is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $4,460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,520 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,585 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,759 swing high to the $4,414 low. A clear move above the $4,585 resistance might send the price toward the $4,620 resistance. An upside break above the $4,620 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,720 resistance zone or even $4,750 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,550 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,460 level. The first major support sits near the $4,420 zone. A clear move below the $4,420 support might push the price toward the $4,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,250 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,150. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

A Bitcoin ETN is an exchange-traded note that tracks the price of Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency and trades on regulated exchanges. It gives investors price exposure without direct ownership of the underlying coins and functions as an unsecured debt instrument issued by a financial issuer. How does the FCA change affect UK retail investors? From 8 October 2025, retail investors can buy Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs listed on recognized exchanges, provided the products meet strict listing, disclosure and distribution rules. The FCA’s framework focuses on investor protection by requiring comprehensive prospectuses and clear risk disclosures. Bitcoin UK: FCA lifts ban on ETNs for retail investors — what you need to know The FCA has reversed its 2021 restriction and now permits ETNs linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum for retail sale when listed on a recognized exchange. This restores a regulated pathway for retail exposure to leading cryptocurrencies without requiring direct custody. Key conditions: issuers must satisfy listing rules, provide transparent fee and risk information, and comply with distribution safeguards. ETNs remain unsecured notes, so counterparty credit risk is a primary consideration for investors. Who commented on the move? Industry representatives welcomed the change. Susie Violet Ward, CEO of Bitcoin Policy UK, said, “Access matters, and lifting the ETN restriction is a welcome step in the right direction. What is important now is that the UK builds on this momentum.” Public authorities referenced include the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England, noted here as plain text sources for regulatory context. What is the Bank of England doing about stablecoins? The Bank of England is signaling measured flexibility. It plans to offer exemptions to proposed stablecoin-holding limits for firms that require higher stablecoin balances for liquidity and settlement purposes. The bank will also allow stablecoins to be used as settlement assets inside its Digital Securities Sandbox for controlled experiments. Which firms may qualify for exemptions? According to reporting by plain text source Bloomberg, certain exchanges and liquidity providers that need to hold large stablecoin balances to run continuous trading and settlement operations could be eligible for waivers. The Bank’s sandbox approach aims to balance innovation with financial stability safeguards. Why are stablecoins rising in prominence? Stablecoins remain central to digital asset liquidity, settlement, and cross-border payments. Recent legislative and market developments — including the U.S. GENIUS Act (as plain text reference) and new issuers launching regional stablecoins — are increasing competitive pressure and innovation in the space. Notably, AnchorX has introduced AxCNH, a stablecoin pegged to the offshore Chinese Yuan (CNH), marking a new entrant targeting regional payment corridors and FX settlements. These developments emphasize the geopolitical and commercial drivers shaping stablecoin policy choices. Frequently Asked Questions Can retail investors lose money with ETNs? Yes. ETNs carry market risk tied to crypto price moves and issuer credit risk because they are unsecured debt instruments. Investors should review issuers’ creditworthiness and ETN prospectuses before investing. Will stablecoins be widely accepted for settlement in the UK? The Bank of England’s sandbox will test settlement uses. Widespread acceptance depends on regulatory outcomes, interoperability, and risk controls established through these trials. Key Takeaways Regulated retail access restored : The FCA now allows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs to be sold to retail investors on recognized exchanges under strict rules. ETN risk profile : ETNs provide price exposure without crypto custody and include issuer credit risk; read prospectuses carefully. Stablecoin flexibility : The Bank of England may grant exemptions for firms needing stablecoin liquidity and will pilot settlement use in a sandbox. Conclusion The FCA’s decision to lift the ETN ban reintroduces a regulated route for UK retail investors to access Bitcoin and Ethereum price exposure while the Bank of England’s pragmatic sandbox and exemption approach signals a willingness to support practical stablecoin uses. Market participants should weigh product disclosures and issuer risk as these regulatory changes take effect.

In a note to investors, Hougan outlined three primary catalysts behind the anticipated surge, pointing to platform approvals, the broader macroeconomic environment, as well as BTC’s recent price momentum. Hougan’s Hot Take First on his list is the wave of institutional approvals now clearing the path for major wealth managers to offer Bitcoin ETFs to their clients. He highlighted Morgan Stanley’s October 1 guidance, which allows its 16,000 advisors managing $2 trillion in assets to include cryptocurrency allocations of up to 4% for risk-tolerant clients. Wells Fargo has made a similar pivot, and the Bitwise exec suggested that firms including UBS and Merrill Lynch are likely to follow suit. While the rollout won’t happen overnight, conversations Hougan has had with advisors indicate strong pent-up demand. The second factor is what Hougan calls the “Debasement Trade,” referring to the growing interest in assets seen as hedges against currency debasement. Bitcoin, alongside gold, has been among the year’s best-performing major assets. US monetary expansion since 2020 has been up 44% and has brought this trade into sharper focus, with major financial institutions, including JPMorgan, publishing reports spotlighting the strategy. Hougan argued that advisors looking to showcase strong year-end portfolio performance are likely to steer clients toward BTC ETFs, which is similar to last year’s preference for high-performing tech equities. Bitcoin Market Momentum Hougan also pointed to Bitcoin’s own market performance as a fundamental driver of inflows. The crypto asset recently surpassed $126,000, as it broke past key psychological thresholds and posted a 9% gain in the first week of October alone. Historically, quarters marked by double-digit positive returns for BTC have coincided with billions in ETF inflows, a pattern Hougan believes will repeat in Q4. Hougan’s bullish outlook is supported by early Q4 numbers as Bitcoin ETFs drew $3.5 billion in just four trading days, which has catapulted YTD flows to $25.9 billion. With 64 trading days remaining, the exec predicts that the sector could easily exceed $10 billion more in inflows, and could also potentially surpass last year’s record-setting $36 billion.

Open account → BNB’s surge is driven by a sharp rise in investor mindshare, network upgrades that cut block times and gas costs, and stronger developer and institutional interest—pushing BNB above $1,330 and making it the third-largest crypto by market cap in days. BNB price jumped over 27% in a week, topping $1,330 Mindshare rose ~251% in seven days, signaling heightened public attention Market cap climbed from ~$140B to over $183B; memecoins and a $1B builder fund boosted usage BNB surge: BNB price and network upgrades drive investor demand—read how ecosystem growth and memecoins pushed BNB to new highs. Learn more now. What is driving the BNB surge? BNB surge is driven by rising investor mindshare, major protocol upgrades that reduced block time and gas costs, and a wave of retail memecoin activity. These factors, combined with a new $1 billion builder fund and growing institutional allocations, have propelled BNB’s market cap and network usage higher. Rachael Lucas, an analyst at BTC Markets, noted that BNB’s recent surge highlights growing investor confidence in its long-term prospects. BNB “mindshare” has surged over 250% in just a week, according to Messari, with one analyst pointing to a market shift toward high-throughput, low-cost chains. The native token of BNB Chain crossed over $1,330 for the first time on Wednesday, after registering a gain of over 27% in the last week, according to data aggregator CoinGecko, nearly a week after clocking its previous high of $1,111. Crypto market intelligence firm Messari said in an X post on Wednesday, BNB’s mindshare, which measures public attention, discussion, and awareness, has seen a 251% spike to 5.09% in the last seven days, while its price gains have come alongside “very bullish sentiment.” COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Source: Messari Speaking to Cointelegraph, Rachael Lucas, an analyst at Australian cryptocurrency exchange BTC Markets, said the surge in sentiment is likely due to BNB benefiting from a shift in market focus toward high-throughput, low-cost chains with active ecosystems. The token terminal lists BNB Chain fees at an average of $0.46, while an upgrade to increase the gas limit to 100 million per second and reduce the block time to 750 milliseconds went live on Tuesday, up from a 3-second block time and a 47 million gas limit per second. How did BNB mindshare spike so rapidly? Messari’s mindshare metric spiked ~251% to 5.09% over seven days, reflecting a surge in social discussion, searches, and public attention. Short-term catalysts included price momentum, memecoin trading on BNB Chain, and announcements such as the $1 billion builder fund and protocol upgrades that improved throughput and reduced fees. Memecoins and market cap flip spur investor interest Two major drivers in the last week were a sharp market-cap rise and a memecoin trading boom. BNB’s market capitalization rose from about $140 billion on Oct. 1 to a peak above $183 billion on Wednesday, moving it into the third-largest crypto slot by market cap. BNB is now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, having surpassed Tether and XRP. Source: CoinGecko “Its recent flip of XRP and Tether in market cap underscores growing investor confidence in BNB’s long-term positioning,” Lucas said. Traders reported outsized gains from small-cap memecoins native to BNB Chain over the past week, with retail engagement surging as memecoin momentum drew liquidity and attention to the ecosystem. “The memecoin boom has driven retail engagement, while innovations like onchain access to macroeconomic data are attracting DeFi developers.” Ecosystem growth and institutional interest also play a factor BNB announced a $1 billion builder fund to support projects on the chain, including AI, trading, wallets, and payments. The initiative signals increased commitment to developer growth and longer-term utility. Lucas said such initiatives “signal a strong commitment to developer growth, while a surge in memecoin trading has pushed BNB Chain’s network fees and usage to record highs.” BNB Chain is leading the market in DEX volume, with over $6 billion recorded and $5.57 million in chain fees, according to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain. Source: Lookonchain “Institutional interest, such as CEA Industries’ treasury allocation, adds further credibility. While short-term technicals suggest BNB may be overbought, the underlying fundamentals, including real utility and growing developer traction, provide a solid foundation,” Lucas added. BNB launched its Maxwell upgrade in June and the Lorentz Hard Fork in April, both aimed at improving block times, validator networking, and overall throughput. User metrics have jumped as well BNB Chain’s total locked value reached $9.26 billion, while monthly active addresses spiked to 73.24 million—the highest recorded level. These metric improvements indicate real usage growth beyond speculative trading. BNB’s outperformance amid broader market softness suggests capital is rotating into ecosystems showing actual adoption and developer activity, Lucas observed. Frequently Asked Questions Why did BNB price jump above $1,300? BNB price rose above $1,300 due to a mix of increased public mindshare, protocol upgrades that lowered costs and block times, a builder fund announcement, and elevated memecoin trading on the chain. Is the BNB rally driven by retail or institutions? Both. Retail memecoin trading boosted short-term volume, while institutional allocations and a $1B builder fund signal longer-term institutional and developer interest. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""BNB surge: mindshare spike, upgrades and memecoins push BNB above $1,330"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199c6f5-c283-7ac1-b925-621fcc517ffd.jpeg""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-09T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-09T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""description"": ""BNB surge is driven by rising mindshare, protocol upgrades and memecoin activity—pushing price above $1,330 and market cap past $183B."", ""keywords"": ""BNB surge, BNB price, BNB Chain, memecoins, market cap, blockchain upgrades""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why did BNB price jump above $1,300?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""BNB price rose above $1,300 because of a surge in investor mindshare, protocol upgrades that reduced block time and fees, a $1B builder fund announcement, and heightened memecoin trading on BNB Chain."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the BNB rally driven by retail or institutions?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The rally has both retail-driven memecoin volume and growing institutional allocations; developer-focused initiatives also support longer-term adoption."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess BNB momentum"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check mindshare and on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Review public attention metrics and active-address statistics to gauge retail interest and network usage."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Evaluate protocol upgrades"", ""text"": ""Confirm recent upgrades and their impact on block time, gas limits and transaction costs to understand throughput improvements."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor market-cap and fund announcements"", ""text"": ""Track market-cap shifts and large developer or treasury allocations to assess institutional and developer commitment."" } ]} Key Takeaways Price action : BNB rose over 27% in a week, topping $1,330.

Crypto staking ETFs are exchange-traded funds that both hold crypto assets and participate in on-chain staking to earn rewards for validating or securing proof-of-stake networks. They combine price exposure with an additional yield stream, potentially improving net returns for investors without requiring direct wallet management. How are Bitwise and 21Shares changing U.S. ETF offerings? Bitwise updated a filing to rename one product “Bitwise Solana Staking ETF” and added language allowing exposure to Solana held by the trust. The fund proposes a 0.20% unitary management fee, waived for the first three months on the first $1 billion. 21Shares revised its 21Shares Ethereum ETF (TETH) to include staking and announced a 0.21% sponsor fee waiver for 12 months starting October 9. These moves followed Grayscale’s recent introduction of staking in its U.S. Ethereum ETFs. How does staking affect investor returns and fund mechanics? Staking generates small on-chain rewards by helping secure networks like Ethereum and Solana. Those rewards accrue to the ETF, which can compound returns inside the fund rather than distributing them as separate payouts. Operationally, funds must handle validator selection, slashing risk, and operational costs. Bitwise’s unitary fee simplifies costs into a single charge, while 21Shares’ temporary fee waiver incentivizes early inflows.

Bitwise proposes a 0.20% unitary management fee, waived for three months on the first $1 billion. 21Shares is waiving its 0.21% sponsor fee for 12 months starting October 9. Fee structures may change upon final approval. How do funds handle staking rewards? Funds collect and reinvest staking rewards into the trust, which can compound inside the ETF and raise NAV. Details depend on fund policy regarding reward allocation and reporting. Who commented on these filings? Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, called staking a natural evolution for Ethereum products. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted low fees often attract investor inflows. COINOTAG and Bloomberg are cited as plain-text sources for reporting context. Key Takeaways Staking expands ETF utility : ETFs can now deliver both price exposure and protocol rewards. Fee competition intensifies : Bitwise and 21Shares use low fees and waivers to attract capital. Operational risks remain : Validator selection, slashing, and reward volatility require close fund governance and disclosure. Conclusion U.S. crypto funds are evolving beyond pure price plays; Bitwise and 21Shares adding staking and cutting fees signal a shift toward yield-enhanced ETFs. Investors should evaluate fee structures, staking mechanics, and disclosure before allocating capital. COINOTAG will monitor filings and updates as these products move toward final approval.

Is the four-year crypto cycle dead? The four-year crypto cycle as a strict timing rule is no longer reliable. Arthur Hayes argues Bitcoin cycles respond to changes in the money supply — especially US dollar and Chinese yuan liquidity — and that current policy easing makes this phase distinct from prior cycles. How does monetary policy drive Bitcoin cycles? Bitcoin’s major rallies historically coincided with periods of ample liquidity. Short-term spikes often follow central-bank easing, mortgage and bank liquidity flows, or Chinese credit expansion. Conversely, past cycle endings aligned with global tightening and reduced credit growth. What makes the current cycle different? Hayes highlights several structural differences this cycle: Large Treasury operations: The US Treasury has moved liquidity via Reverse Repo reductions and Treasury bill issuance, shifting cash into markets. US monetary easing signals: Fed rate cuts are being priced in by futures markets, increasing expected USD liquidity. Chinese policy pivot: Beijing appears focused on ending deflation and preventing credit contraction, which limits the deflationary headwind that stopped prior rallies. Regulatory and lending changes: Deregulation and policies to boost bank lending can further amplify liquidity. What do market signals indicate now? Futures markets price high odds of additional Fed cuts later this year. Those expectations imply easier dollar conditions and greater risk appetite. Hayes notes that if both US and Chinese policy tilt neutral-to-easing, there is less force to terminate a Bitcoin rally via simultaneous liquidity withdrawal. How have previous cycles differed by driver? Cycle Primary driver Why it ended 2011–2013 US QE + Chinese credit expansion Fed & Chinese slowdown of money printing 2015 (ICO cycle) Yuan credit explosion Chinese credit deceleration and tighter dollar conditions 2020–2021 (COVID-era) USD liquidity surge Fed tightening from late 2021 COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → When the economic pressure proves too intense, Chinese policymakers print money, says Arthur Hayes. Source: Arthur Hayes Why won’t China kill the cycle this time? Hayes argues China is moving away from aggressive liquidity withdrawal. Policymakers appear prepared to combat deflation and support domestic credit. That reduces the odds that Chinese policy will act as the counterweight that ended past Bitcoin rallies. What do other market participants say? On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has noted that some cyclical patterns still appear. Saad Ahmed, Gemini’s head of APAC region, told Cointelegraph that many market participants expect some form of recurring cycle to persist. These views indicate the debate remains open, but monetary flows now receive heavier emphasis. Frequently Asked Questions How long could this Bitcoin rally last given current policy? There is no fixed timeline. If US and Chinese liquidity remain supportive, the rally could extend beyond historical four-year bounds; if either region tightens drastically, the cycle could still end. Watch central-bank actions and credit indicators closely. Does a halving no longer matter for Bitcoin price? Halvings remain supply-side events, but Hayes argues their price impact is conditioned by liquidity. A halving in an easing environment may have a different effect than one that coincides with global tightening. How should investors track these signals? Monitor Fed communications, futures-implied rates, Chinese credit growth data, and bank lending trends. Combine macro indicators with on-chain metrics to form a layered view of cycle risk. Key Takeaways Monetary policy matters most : Bitcoin cycles historically align with USD and yuan liquidity shifts. Four-year timing is unreliable : Fixed halving schedules do not guarantee cycle endpoints without considering macro liquidity. Monitor policy and credit : Fed rate projections, Chinese credit trends, and Treasury operations are key indicators for cycle outlook. Conclusion Arthur Hayes’ assessment reframes the debate: the four-year crypto cycle is not dead because of a unique market quirk, but because macro liquidity now dominates cycle dynamics. Investors should prioritize monetary-policy signals from the US and China and use short, data-driven checks to gauge whether this cycle sustains or reverses. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the main driver of Bitcoin cycles according to Arthur Hayes?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Arthur Hayes states that Bitcoin cycles are mainly driven by the supply and quantity of money — particularly USD and Chinese yuan liquidity — rather than strict four-year timing tied to halvings."" } } ]} COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Smarter tools.

What was once valued near a staggering $20 billion market cap has now been reduced to a shadow of its former self, leaving many early supporters disillusioned. Once praised as a revolutionary “mobile mining” experiment, the project now finds itself cited as one of the most disappointing stories of the decade. Industry watchers are calling it a sobering reminder that hype without delivery rarely lasts. The crash in value has not only erased millions in paper wealth but also fractured a once-thriving community that believed Pi could challenge established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts Describe a ‘Slow-Motion Rug Pull’ Crypto analyst Mr. Spock Ape reignited debate this week by labeling Pi’s trajectory a “slow-motion rug pull.” He argues that many users continue to mine tokens unaware of how little value remains in circulation. For years, the community has clung to the idea of incredible growth potential – but that dream has turned into a symbol of denial. With no clear liquidity or meaningful exchange listings, Pi’s ecosystem remains locked in a self-contained bubble, detached from real market demand. Behind the scenes, cracks in leadership have widened. Leaked reports and legal filings describe internal conflicts between founders Nicolas Kokkalis and Chengdiao Fan, along with accusations from former executive McPhilip that project funds were mismanaged. These issues, dating back to as early as 2020, have resurfaced during the recent collapse, intensifying investor frustration and eroding what little trust remains. Upgrades Fail to Stop the Bleeding In an effort to revive enthusiasm, the team rolled out several new features – including a DeFi simulation tool and an AI-powered Fast Track KYC system designed to speed up user verification. Both were presented as steps toward Pi’s long-promised mainnet launch, yet the market’s response was muted. Pi Coin has continued its downward spiral, falling out of the top 50 cryptocurrencies and losing nearly all of its early momentum. Mining rewards have also been slashed, with the rate now down to 0.0027405 π per hour – a drastic cut that means miners need more than two weeks to earn just one token. The result has been an exodus of users, with critics suggesting that the remaining community is held together more by nostalgia than by tangible value. The Rise of a New Hope While Pi Network’s downfall serves as a warning, many investors are redirecting their attention toward new opportunities – and one project in particular has become the talk of the market: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Unlike Pi, which struggled to achieve real liquidity, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown remarkable progress, delivering one record-breaking milestone after another. Its presale rounds have consistently sold out, attracting strong retail participation and even catching the attention of analysts who view it as one of the fastest-growing altcoins of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE combines transparency, security, and utility – a trio that investors believe Pi lacked. The project’s audited codebase, clear roadmap, and expanding ecosystem have created an environment where long-term holders can benefit from both early access and sustained growth. As one observer put it, “Where Pi overpromised and underdelivered, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly executing.” With analysts predicting returns that could reach 20,000% for early participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a symbol of renewed optimism in a year filled with cautionary tales. It’s proving that even after high-profile disappointments, the crypto market still rewards innovation and credibility. A Lesson in Overpromise and Underperformance The Pi Network story now stands as a cautionary tale about unchecked ambition. Its founders once promoted it as the “people’s crypto,” but in the absence of transparency, accessibility, and results, the narrative collapsed. The obsession with speculative valuations and a never-ending testnet phase drove away many believers who had once seen Pi as a gateway to financial inclusion. As new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE take the spotlight, investors are reminded that strong fundamentals and clear communication matter far more than grand promises. The market may forgive volatility, but it does not forgive stagnation. The Path Ahead The digital asset space continues to evolve, with projects that combine innovation, compliance, and community-driven value creation gaining the upper hand. S&P’s introduction of tokenized market indexes and the steady flow of institutional capital show that blockchain technology remains strong – but retail investors are becoming more selective. For many, Pi Network’s collapse is the end of one chapter and the start of another. It has underscored the risks of speculation without delivery and highlighted how new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are redefining what success looks like in the next phase of crypto adoption.

CZ-themed tickers like “4” and “Broccoli” helped propel BNB to the top of DEXScreener’s trending lists, while tokens such as PALU and “Binance Life” collectively moved over $300 million in a single session, eclipsing meme volumes on rival chains. Institutional and enterprise signals are building too, with CEA Industries disclosing 480,000 BNB ($585M) with an aim to reach 1% of supply.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/sp-dow-jones-newly-launched-crypto-index-excites-xrp-army-heres-why/,"S&P Dow Jones Indices has launched a new cryptocurrency benchmark that has quickly caught the eye of digital asset investors. The S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index, released as of September 30, 2025, tracks 304 cryptocurrency constituents and represents a significant move by one of the most recognized names in global finance. The launch was highlighted online by JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a well-known XRP community figure, who shared the official index factsheet featuring XRP among the top constituents. His post stirred notable interest on X, particularly within the XRP community that has long viewed such developments as a sign of growing institutional recognition of their favored digital asset. BREAKING: S&P Dow Jones Launches New Crypto Index! #XRP pic.twitter.com/FLPmwxS0PE — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 7, 2025 XRP Features Prominently Among Leading Assets The index’s factsheet reveals that XRP sits within the top ten constituents by index weight, alongside Bitcoin, Ether, Binance Coin, and Solana Token. As of the report date, the index included digital assets with a combined market capitalization of over $2.27 trillion. The largest constituent by weight was 64.1%, while the top ten collectively accounted for 93% of the index’s total weight. By positioning XRP in a leading role , the index demonstrates that the asset remains a key player in the cryptocurrency market. This inclusion aligns with XRP’s history as one of the earliest large-scale digital assets with established liquidity and utility in cross-border payments . Acceptance of Crypto by Established Financial Institutions The move by S&P Dow Jones Indices reflects a tangible step by established financial institutions toward incorporating cryptocurrencies into traditional market structures. The introduction of this benchmark signals that large-scale index providers see value in measuring and tracking the performance of digital assets in the same systematic way they approach equities and bonds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For investors seeking greater legitimacy and visibility for digital assets like XRP, this development suggests evidence of increasing acceptance in mainstream finance. It enables institutional participants to observe, analyze, and potentially build investment products tied to the performance of this index, which is a fundamental step toward deeper integration with regulated markets. The XRP Community’s Response JackTheRippler’s post drew attention to XRP’s presence in the newly released index factsheet, remarking on what many in the community regard as a milestone for XRP’s recognition by legacy finance. One commenter stated that XRP is now everywhere, highlighting its growing recognition, and anticipating a breakout toward $5. Another noted that big names in the financial world are making cryptocurrencies mainstream . The fact that XRP stands alongside the largest cryptocurrencies in this benchmark resonates with those who see its inclusion as a sign of its staying power.

The price is now struggling and might continue to move down if it trades below $2.820. XRP price is slowly moving lower below the $2.90 zone. The price is now trading below $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it settles below $2.820. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to stay above $3.00 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $2.950 and $2.920 to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price tested the $2.8320 zone and recently attempted a recovery wave. It climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $2.8320 swing low. However, the bears remained active near $2.920. The price is now trading below $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.880 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.920 level. A clear move above the $2.920 resistance might send the price toward the $2.950 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $2.8320 swing low. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.050. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.920 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.820 level. The next major support is near the $2.80 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.80 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.7250. The next major support sits near the $2.650 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.60.

Jupiter, the largest DeFi aggregator on Solana, is teaming up with Ethena Labs to launch jupUSD, a yield-generating, collateral-backed stablecoin built directly for Solana’s fast-growing DeFi ecosystem. BREAKING: Jupiter is launching its own stablecoin Built in partnership with @ethena_labs , engineered to connect the Jupiverse. $JupUSD , going live in Q4. pic.twitter.com/MWTNTwpvHJ — Jupiter ( , ) (@JupiterExchange) October 8, 2025 According to the official announcement from Jupiter Exchange on X, the project is expected to go live in Q4 2025, once its contracts have completed multiple audits. The move positions Jupiter to become more than just a trading hub, it’s building an integrated financial layer for Solana. What Is jupUSD? jupUSD is designed to be a Solana-native stablecoin, issued directly on-chain and optimized for low-cost, high-speed transactions. Unlike wrapped or bridged stablecoins, jupUSD will live entirely within the Solana network, enabling seamless interaction across Jupiter’s suite of products and Solana-based DeFi protocols. At launch, jupUSD will be 100% backed by USDtb, a token nearly fully backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, one of the most transparent and institutionally supported stablecoin reserves on the market. Over time, Jupiter plans to add USDe from Ethena Labs as collateral, enabling yield optimization for holders while maintaining strong peg stability. Built in Partnership With Ethena Labs Jupiter chose Ethena Labs for a reason. Ethena has built one of the most successful stablecoin frameworks in crypto, responsible for minting over $16 billion worth of stablecoins to date. As Jupiter put it in their announcement: “No one knows stablecoins like Ethena.” The collaboration means Ethena will lead Solana’s stablecoin ecosystem, helping Jupiter develop mechanisms for peg stability, liquidity depth, and ecosystem adoption. Ethena’s experience with yield-bearing, collateral-backed designs will shape jupUSD’s structure, likely following the same risk-managed model that powers USDe, Ethena’s own dollar-pegged asset. Introducing JupUSD: the native stablecoin of the @JupiterExchange ecosystem built on Ethena's Stablecoin-as-a-Service stack. JupUSD will plug into every major part of the Jupiter stack, including: – Jupiter Perps: where the ~$750m in stablecoins inside of JLP will gradually be… pic.twitter.com/jlNLc2eNCz — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) October 8, 2025 Ethena Labs confirmed the partnership in a post on X, calling jupUSD “a Solana native stablecoin for the entire Jupiter ecosystem.” The synergy between both projects sets the stage for one of the most integrated stablecoin ecosystems in crypto. Jupiter’s $750 Million Liquidity Move In a bold strategic decision, Jupiter plans to “progressively convert” $750 million of USDC from its Liquidity Provider Pool into jupUSD. That’s a massive commitment, signaling not only confidence in the new stablecoin but also a shift toward internal ecosystem liquidity. This move will likely deepen on-chain volume for jupUSD from day one. By redirecting part of its own liquidity, Jupiter ensures there’s immediate market depth and usability across all its core products. The plan echoes Jupiter’s broader vision: to make jupUSD the default medium for every action on the platform, trading, lending, and collateralizing positions. Deep Integration Across Jupiter Products jupUSD won’t just be another stablecoin floating around DeFi. It will be deeply integrated across every Jupiter product, making it the backbone of the entire ecosystem. Here’s what that looks like: Collateral on Jupiter Perps : Traders can post jupUSD as margin for perpetual contracts. Liquidity in Jupiter Lend: jupUSD becomes a core lending and borrowing asset. Trading on Swap, Pro, and Mobile: Seamless stable trading pairs with deep liquidity. Integration in Future Products: Jupiter hints at new upcoming DeFi tools that will natively use jupUSD. In short, if you’re using Jupiter, you’ll be using jupUSD. Even $JUP holders are teased to benefit, as the team described it: “A stablecoin for everything Jupiter (including $JUP holders ).” A New Standard for Solana Stablecoins For Solana, the introduction of jupUSD marks a key moment. Most stablecoins currently circulating on Solana, including USDC and USDT, are issued by external entities. jupUSD changes that, bringing a natively issued and ecosystem-aligned alternative. This native approach reduces friction and transaction costs while improving composability across Solana DeFi apps. Developers can integrate jupUSD directly into protocols without relying on bridges or external minting mechanisms. By pairing Ethena’s yield mechanics with Jupiter’s liquidity dominance, jupUSD could become the first yield-generating stablecoin natively built on Solana, a strong differentiator in a market dominated by centralized stable assets. Security and Launch Timeline Security remains central to Jupiter’s rollout. The mint-redeem contracts for jupUSD are being built natively on Solana and will undergo multiple independent audits before going live. The launch is currently targeted for mid-Q4 2025, following a rigorous review process. The project is also inviting partners and institutions to get involved early. Those interested in integrating, listing, or holding jupUSD on their balance sheet can reach out directly via [partnerships@jupusd.money](mailto:partnerships@jupusd.money) to become launch partners. Why This Matters Stablecoins have long been the lifeblood of crypto liquidity. For Solana, a network that thrives on high-speed, low-cost trading, having a native, fully integrated stablecoin is a major step forward. Jupiter already processes some of the largest daily swap volumes on Solana, and by introducing its own native stable asset, it effectively builds a self-sustaining liquidity loop. Every dollar in the ecosystem stays within the ecosystem, circulating through swaps, lending, and perps without relying on external bridges or issuers. Meanwhile, Ethena brings proven expertise in peg stability and yield mechanics, reducing the typical risks associated with new stablecoin projects. As Solana’s DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, the introduction of jupUSD could reshape stablecoin usage across the network. Backed by USDtb initially, then diversified with USDe, the stablecoin combines institutional-grade collateral with the composability of Solana. With Jupiter converting hundreds of millions in liquidity and Ethena providing a robust framework for stability and yield, jupUSD is poised to become Solana’s cornerstone stable asset, a token that ties together trading, lending, and on-chain liquidity in one unified design. The countdown to Q4 2025 is already on. And if Jupiter and Ethena deliver on their promises, jupUSD could redefine what it means to be a native stablecoin in the Solana ecosystem.

Based on his on-camera remarks, he expects the trend to push adoption higher and to reshape how investors think about storing wealth. The New ‘Hurdle Rate’ Pompliano went further, describing the top digital asset as the “hurdle rate” of modern finance — a baseline investors must beat before choosing other assets. He contrasted Bitcoin’s performance with traditional markets, arguing that the S&P 500 has risen by more than a hundred percent since 2020 in fiat terms but has fallen roughly 90% when priced in BTC, a comparison he used to stress BTC’s long-term outperformance. This framing explains why he and some others say, “If you can’t beat Bitcoin, buy it.” Further Gains Ahead Based on projections, BTC could climb about 20% to $148,500 by the end of the year. The same forecasts sees a jump in market infrastructure: the number of crypto exchange-traded funds could double to 80, and stablecoin circulation is predicted to reach $500 billion as more money moves onchain. Those observations realistically bolster an argument that the market is maturing beyond the realm of a short-term speculation. Market Size And Stablecoin Liquidity Here To Stay Market intelligence reveals that the total cryptocurrency market is sizeable at roughly $4.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko. In addition, another market data source, DeFiLlama , reports that the stablecoin supply has exceeded $300 billion as an indication that there is a lot of liquidity onchain and it could flow into risk assets like Bitcoin.

Speculation among traders is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might sanction several Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a few days, which is a significant move towards institutional access to SOL. This momentum has also been transferred to Avalanche (AVAX) and upcoming Ethereum-based presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which analysts now predict as some of the best tokens to watch in 2025. Will Solana Price Break $300 Amid SOL ETF Speculations Solana (SOL) is trading at around $230, having recovered by over 20% since the lows in late September. Analysts anticipate the upcoming ruling by SEC on the spot Solana ETF filings by major asset management companies such as VanEck, Fidelity, and Grayscale will define the next big move by the token. As time runs out, Bloomberg ETF analysts give odds of approval of almost 100%, pointing to better regulatory clarity and a friendlier SEC attitude toward digital assets. On-chain sentiment is on the positive side. The ecosystem activity of Solana has accelerated, and developer activity and decentralized exchange volumes are growing. Technical indicators are in favor of SOL price continuation. The daily chart shows two bull flag formations, which show possible targets between $290 and $345 after breakage of resistance points of $233 and $260. In case ETFs are accepted, institutional inflows would push the token towards $300. SOLUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: TradingView Analyst NekoZ highlighted that the exit of Solana from its August flag pattern sends a wave toward $346, repeating previous market rallies that were fueled by ETF speculation. Grayscale and REX-Osprey began launching Solana staking products, which will likely see an explosion in institutional demand. To put it briefly, the launch of a spot Solana ETF might initiate a new round of capital inflows and may lead SOL into a 50% rally. AVAX Price Consolidates Around $30 Avalanche (AVAX) has also entered a strong accumulation phase, hovering near $30 after several weeks of consolidation. Analysts identify this range as a crucial support level that mirrors pre-breakout setups from early 2024. CryptoPulse observed that “each bounce near $30 attracts more buyers,” signaling quiet accumulation before a possible move higher. EtherNasyon highlighted a long-term bullish structure forming on the weekly chart. Avalanche is pressing against a multi-year resistance trendline dating back to its 2021 highs. If this barrier is broken, the setup resembles a massive cup-and-handle formation that could propel AVAX toward $100–$150 in the coming months. Rising trading volumes and institutional participation further validate this bullish outlook. AVAXUSD 1-week Chart | Source: TradingView The Avalanche Foundation’s continued push into DeFi and tokenized real-world assets has strengthened the fundamentals. Bridged total value locked (TVL) and stablecoin supply are both rising steadily, pointing to sustainable ecosystem growth. With consistent developer funding, AVAX appears positioned for the next leg up. Analysts Turn to This Fast-Rising Altcoin Solana and Avalanche are at the forefront of established projects, but analysts are paying more attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE , dubbing it one of the most promising Ethereum-based presales of 2025. The project has since raised in excess of $15 million, and this indicates a wide investor confidence. The multi-stage pricing model and transparent tokenomics have enabled it to emerge as a favorite among numerous competitors in the presale industry. Why analysts are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE: Transparency : MAGACOIN FINANCE is hosted only on the verified website magacoinfinance.com , eliminating third-party risks. Whale participation : Large Ethereum wallets are moving to capitalize on MAGACOIN FINANCE early stages, as indicated on-chain. Liquidity strength : Having raised over $15 million, it should be introduced with good trading depth. Exchange readiness : Developed with Ethereum, it will be easier to integrate with the leading exchange. Analyst recognition : Repeatedly called as one of the leading altcoins to purchase prior to listing by top analysts. Experts point out that the expansive community of MAGACOIN FINANCE, early analyst coverage, and strong funding foundation make it the leader of other 2025 presales. Conclusion The hope in altcoins is still growing as market positions prepare for the Solana ETF decision by SEC. Solana’s potential breakout above $300 and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rising presale momentum underline a broader trend that institutional capital is returning to crypto. When approvals and inflows fall into place, these three assets will be the next altcoins to watch in the 2025 bull cycle. Expert Validation Confirms MAGACOIN FINANCE as a Secure, Legitimate Presale MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s audit verification and expert endorsements from industry analysts confirm it as a secure and compliant presale ahead of 2025.

Bitcoin & Altcoins Have Seen A Jump In Open Interest Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has discussed about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin and the altcoins. This indicator measures the total amount of positions related to a given asset or group of assets that are currently open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. It takes into account both long and short positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plummets To $120,600: This Could Be The Next Support When the value of the Open interest rises, it means speculative interest in the market is going up as traders are opening up fresh positions. Generally, new positions come with more leverage for the sector, so volatility can go up following a jump in the metric. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies investors are either pulling back on risk or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. Such a washout of leverage typically results in greater market stability. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin and that for all altcoins combined over the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has witnessed a notable increase alongside the latest price rally, implying investors have been opening up new bets on the derivatives market. This isn’t an unusual trend, as rallies tend to attract attention to the cryptocurrency, especially in the case of a run like the latest one, which has taken the coin to a fresh all-time high (ATH). The scale and speed of the increase can be worth monitoring, however, as such conditions can make the market prone to a liquidation squeeze. Another factor that can be worth noting is that the altcoin Open Interest has also shot up at the same time, indicating speculative activity across the sector has ramped up. From the chart, it’s visible that something like this also occurred in December 2024. “Back then, it led to months of sideways chop followed by a 30%+ drop,” notes the analyst. The market could already be starting to feel the effects of heating in the Open Interest as Bitcoin and the altcoins have gone through notable volatility in the past day. BTC plunged from above $125,000 to below $121,000 in the matter of a few hours, before recovering back near $123,000. Others, like Ethereum, are yet to make any significant recovery from the plunge.

Alongside this reshuffle, a viral story made waves about a trader who turned $3,000 into $2 million following a CZ tweet about a meme coin. While BNB and XRP dominate the headlines, presale projects like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are quickly gaining traction as investors search for high-risk, high-reward plays that established tokens may no longer provide. BNB flips XRP in the rankings BNB’s rise highlights the ongoing strength of exchange-linked tokens. Binance continues to dominate global trading volumes and its native token is deeply tied to activity across the platform. Holders benefit from discounted trading fees, access to staking options and use across Binance Smart Chain’s DeFi ecosystem, all of which help keep demand steady. In contrast, XRP remains focused on cross-border payments. Ripple’s partnerships with banks, remittance firms and payment providers underline its practical utility but price performance has lagged behind. This week’s shift shows how BNB and XRP remain locked in competition, with rankings changing quickly as market sentiment evolves. The $3K to $2M trade Beyond large caps, the market was shaken by news of a trader turning a modest $3,000 into $2 million after Binance founder CZ mentioned a meme coin on social media. The token’s price exploded, reinforcing the powerful role social influence can play in short-term rallies. These events highlight both opportunity and risk. While some traders strike it rich, many others get caught chasing hype at the top. It’s a reminder that timing is everything in meme-driven markets. What this means for investors The contrasting moves between BNB and XRP, combined with the viral meme coin surge, illustrate the two sides of crypto investing. Established assets provide liquidity, trust and lower volatility, while early-stage tokens promise exponential gains but carry far greater risk. For many traders, the strategy is not choosing one side but diversifying across both. Holding large caps like BNB and XRP offers stability, while allocating to smaller, emerging tokens provides exposure to the kinds of multiples that drive retail excitement. Why Layer Brett is gaining buzz One of the emerging names catching attention is Layer Brett (LBRETT). Built on Ethereum Layer 2, Brett combines meme culture with scaling infrastructure, aiming to give users both cultural appeal and technical advantages. Transactions are fast and cheap, while still benefiting from Ethereum’s security, a combination that makes it stand out from hype-only meme coins. The presale has already raised over $4.35 million and staking rewards are paying above 600% APY for early participants. Beyond the yields, the roadmap includes NFT integrations, gamified staking and a community rewards pool worth $1 million, designed to keep momentum alive once exchange listings arrive. Analysts suggest that while BNB and XRP may continue to post steady growth, Layer Brett offers the kind of early-stage profile that could generate 50x or even 100x returns if it builds traction in the same way Dogecoin and Shiba Inu did during their early runs. Final thoughts BNB’s flip over XRP shows that competition among top cryptos remains fierce, while the $3K-to-$2M meme coin story proves the market still rewards risk-takers, sometimes dramatically. For investors, a balanced approach may be best: holding BNB and XRP for stability, while exploring opportunities like Layer Brett for higher upside.

Here’s How This Raging War Impacts You,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-are-you-an-xrp-holder-heres-how-this-raging-war-impacts-you/,"Crypto commentator Austin Hilton recently discussed what he called a “war raging on” around XRP, describing it as the ongoing competition between Ripple and the SWIFT network. In his video, Hilton explained how this rivalry could shape the future of global payments and impact XRP holders directly. Hilton noted that SWIFT has dominated international money transfers for decades, connecting thousands of financial institutions worldwide. However, he described it as outdated, slow, and inefficient compared to blockchain solutions. Ripple, he explained, offers a modern alternative through its blockchain network that uses XRP for real-time cross-border payments. This technology reduces settlement times from days to seconds , bypassing many of the friction points in traditional banking. Are you an XRP holder? There is a war raging on around XRP – how it impacts you! pic.twitter.com/ScNRIRRUD7 — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 6, 2025 Ripple’s Position and Advantage Hilton pointed out that Ripple’s network and the XRP Ledger have positioned the company as a serious challenger to SWIFT’s dominance. Ripple’s system enables faster, cheaper, and more transparent payments, and it continues to gain attention from global banks and financial firms. He referenced Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s comments suggesting Ripple could capture 14–15% of SWIFT’s massive market share over time. Hilton clarified that Ripple is unlikely to replace SWIFT entirely but is steadily taking a meaningful portion of the global payments market. He highlighted Ripple’s consistent development of new infrastructure, including custody services and stablecoin initiatives, as proof of its growing influence in financial technology. SWIFT’s Late Response Hilton also addressed SWIFT’s recent announcement of plans to integrate blockchain technology using Linea, a layer-two solution built on Ethereum. The move includes exploring smart contracts and stablecoin functions. He argued that this step is less a breakthrough and more a marketing strategy to reassure clients that SWIFT is adapting. Citing Garlinghouse’s view, Hilton said SWIFT’s announcement shows it is trying to catch up with the blockchain transition Ripple has been building toward for over a decade. He believes SWIFT’s lack of visible innovation has left it behind, while Ripple continues to lead with active real-world use cases and tested blockchain applications. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Impact on XRP Holders Hilton connected this competition to XRP’s future. As Ripple’s technology becomes more widely used, he expects the demand for XRP to grow due to its essential role in Ripple’s payment ecosystem. Hilton added that the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple may have been intended to delay its progress, benefiting traditional financial systems like SWIFT. Despite that, Ripple has maintained its growth and expanded globally. Hilton concluded that Ripple will not completely replace SWIFT but will continue to capture market share as the global financial system shifts toward blockchain technology.

DOGE is now consolidating and might dip further if it stays below $0.2550. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.2550 level. The price is trading below the $0.2550 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2570 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could extend losses if there is a move below $0.2420. Dogecoin Price Trims Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it closed below $0.2620, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE declined below the $0.260 and $0.2550 support levels. The price even traded below $0.2450. A low was formed near $0.2430, and the price recently attempted a recovery wave. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2701 swing high to the $0.2431 low. However, the bears were active near the $0.260 resistance and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2701 swing high to the $0.2431 low. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2570 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.2550 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2550 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2570 level and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $0.260 level. A close above the $0.260 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2780 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2840 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2920. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2550 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2470 level. The next major support is near the $0.2420 level. The main support sits at $0.2350. If there is a downside break below the $0.2350 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.2120 level or even $0.2050 in the near term.

Data from GMGN showed BNB fell 3.4% to $1,270, reversing gains from a recent rally above $1,300. “Binance Life,” a meme coin that became the focus of retail speculation, dropped about 9.5% to $0.3181 in the past 24 hours. PALU, another meme token tied to Binance’s Chinese community, posted the steepest losses, tumbling over 35% to a market value of $61.5m. Capital Rush Into BSC Tokens Ends With Sharp Corrections Across Key Assets The declines follow an explosive run-up that began two days ago when capital poured into thinly traded tokens across the BSC ecosystem. Technical indicators suggested overbought conditions, prompting profit-taking among traders who had fuelled the surge. BNB’s fall comes after the chain reported record monthly activity with more than 60m active addresses and a $1b Builder Fund announcement that added to optimism earlier this month. Image Source: CoinGecko “Binance Life” captured particular attention as a satirical play on the constant grind of crypto trading. Its market cap jumped from less than $100,000 at launch to $190m within days, driven by community hype and trading on PancakeSwap. Early investors recorded gains exceeding 2,000 times before heavy selling dragged prices lower. Binance Mascot-Inspired Token Surges To Record High, Then Tumbles On Profit-Taking PALU, based on a yellow emoji mascot linked to Binance’s Chinese X account, saw even wilder swings. The token hit an all-time high of $0.1204 just days ago before profit-taking erased more than a third of its value. Its recent listing on Binance Alpha and ties to the company’s roadmap for AI and DeFi integration spurred early enthusiasm, but the lack of utility left it vulnerable to rapid corrections. Still, trading volumes remain elevated, with Binance Life alone seeing more than $232m exchanged in the past day, suggesting continued retail engagement. Meme-Driven Volatility Continues To Define BSC’s Retail-Focused Market The corrections also come after one trader delivered one of the year’s biggest windfalls . According to Lookonchain, the investor turned an initial $3,500 into $7.9m in just three days by buying Binance Life early, when its market cap was under $100,000. After recouping his principal with a small sale, the trader still holds 18.5m tokens, making him the project’s largest holder. Meme-driven activity has long been a hallmark of BSC, which has positioned itself as a low-cost, high-speed network for retail participation. With transaction fees kept minimal and developer incentives expanding, the chain remains a hub for experimental tokens and fast-moving capital.

Despite the short-term retreat, on-chain flows show large holders adding 30M tokens (approximately $8M), suggesting accumulation remains intact even as resistance caps upside momentum. News Background DOGE traded a 6% range between $0.24 and $0.26 in the 24 hours to Oct. 9. The token rallied into $0.26 during the afternoon session but met strong institutional selling pressure. Whale addresses added more than 30M DOGE, reinforcing longer-term positioning despite near-term weakness. Analysts highlighted parallels to prior historical cycles where key resistance breaks have unlocked exponential upside, with $0.41 flagged as a critical longer-term trigger. Price Action Summary DOGE spiked from $0.25 to $0.26 around 17:00 on 750M turnover — double the daily average. Heavy profit-taking at $0.26 reversed gains, pulling price back to $0.25 by session close. Late trading saw a breakdown below $0.25 as liquidation flows hit, with a 14.6M surge at 02:01 confirming distribution. DOGE closed at $0.25, down ~2% from intraday highs. Technical Analysis Resistance is reinforced at $0.26 after repeated rejections on elevated volume. Support at $0.25 failed late in the session under liquidation flows, raising near-term downside risk. Still, accumulation patterns — with 30M DOGE added by large wallets — point to institutional confidence in the broader structure. A sustained reclaim of $0.26 would open the path toward $0.27–$0.30, while $0.24 is now the near-term floor to watch. What Traders Are Watching?

A fresh supply zone formed at $2.92–$2.93, while the $2.85 floor is now under scrutiny as macro headwinds weigh on flows. News Background XRP rallied 2% intraday on Oct. 8, jumping from $2.88 to $2.93 at 17:00 on 86.6M turnover — nearly double the 24-hour average of 48.3M. The move coincided with heightened geopolitical tensions and central bank maneuvering, which fueled broader volatility across risk assets. Traders noted that despite stronger institutional adoption trends, profit-taking dominated into the U.S. close. Price Action Summary XRP traded a $0.08 corridor (3% range) between $2.85 and $2.93. Afternoon breakout through $2.90 resistance peaked at $2.926 before reversing. The rally established a supply zone at $2.92–$2.93.

Cardano price consolidates near $0.82; break above $0.90 could target $1.10 and $1.30 — read analysis and Brave integration impact. What is Cardano’s current price outlook? Cardano price is trading near $0.82 inside a symmetrical triangle, balanced between $0.75 support and $0.90 resistance. Reduced volatility and an RSI near 45 suggest equilibrium; a confirmed break above $0.90 would signal bullish continuation toward $1.10 and $1.30, while failure could test $0.78. How is Cardano trading within the triangle pattern? Cardano has formed a symmetrical triangle since mid-July, consolidating into a tighter range. The 50-day moving average sits near the pattern midline, indicating balanced buying and selling pressure. Traders watch a break above $0.90 for bullish confirmation or a drop toward $0.78 if downside momentum resumes. Cardano trades near $0.82 within a tightening triangle as analysts watch for a $0.90 breakout that could drive targets to $1.10 and $1.30. Cardano trades within a symmetrical triangle, consolidating between $0.75 support and $0.90 resistance. Brave’s wallet integration connects 100M users to Cardano’s network, boosting ecosystem accessibility. Analysts identify $0.90 as ADA’s key breakout point, with targets set at $1.10 and $1.30. Cardano (ADA) continues to move within a symmetrical triangle pattern that has developed since mid-July. The asset trades near $0.82, consolidating between support at $0.75 and resistance at $0.90. Market data shows reduced volatility as traders watch whether ADA will break above $0.90 or retest the lower trendline near $0.78. Why is the triangle pattern important for ADA? The triangle compresses price action and often precedes a decisive directional move. A breakout above resistance typically leads to measured moves equal to the triangle’s height — here implying targets at $1.10 and $1.30. Conversely, a breakdown would increase the probability of a retest of $0.78 and lower support zones. How do market metrics support the current outlook? Cardano traded at $0.8268 after a 3.5% daily decline. CoinGecko data shows a market capitalization of $30.21 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $1.49 billion, indicating active participation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains near 45, signaling equilibrium between buyers and sellers and reduced volatility. How does Brave’s wallet integration affect Cardano? On October 2, Brave announced full Cardano integration via its built-in wallet. This allows users to manage ADA, participate in governance, and access decentralized applications without third-party extensions. The update connects Brave’s 100 million users to Cardano and partner project Midnight, potentially increasing on-chain activity and user adoption.

I’m now watching this symmetrical triangle on the $ADA chart. The target of the bottom trendline is around $0.78 (not guaranteed that we go there) Meanwhile to break to the upside we need to break $0.90 and start setting higher highs. pic.twitter.com/fPU6jLQnuZ — Sssebi (@Av_Sebastian) October 8, 2025 Trading activity across exchanges remains consistent, and volume patterns suggest a wait-and-see approach by investors. A confirmed break above $0.90 might indicate renewed upward movement and lift prices to $1.10. If the market fails to break higher, ADA could revisit lower zones near $0.78 before stabilizing again. Source: CoinGecko When could ADA confirm the breakout? A breakout confirmation requires a daily close above $0.90 with increasing volume. Short-term traders may look for sustained closes above that level and the establishment of higher highs. If volume remains muted, false breakouts become more likely and the pattern may extend. What role do ecosystem developments play? Brave’s Cardano wallet integration and Midnight’s Glacier Drop increase on-ramp accessibility and token distribution activity. Community commentary from Cardano members highlights improved usability and outreach. These developments support longer-term demand-side fundamentals if user engagement grows. Source: AliCharts(X) Cardano community member Lucas Macchiavelli said the integration “opens access to a wider audience while improving usability.” Through Brave Wallet, users can also claim NIGHT tokens via Midnight’s Glacier Drop campaign. Ali Charts notes that ADA must break above $0.90 to confirm bullish continuation and set higher highs. Frequently Asked Questions What price levels should traders watch for Cardano? Watch support at $0.75 and $0.78 and resistance at $0.90. A break above $0.90 targets $1.10 and $1.30; failure to hold support could lead to lower consolidation or a deeper retest. How reliable is the triangle pattern for predicting ADA moves? Symmetrical triangles indicate consolidation and can resolve in either direction. Reliability increases with confirming volume and follow-through price action; traders should use stop management and multiple time-frame confirmation. Does Brave integration guarantee higher ADA prices? Integration improves accessibility and may increase demand, but it does not guarantee price appreciation. Market reaction depends on user adoption, on-chain activity, and overall crypto market conditions. Key Takeaways Pattern: ADA trades in a symmetrical triangle between $0.75 and $0.90. Trigger: Daily close above $0.90 with volume would confirm bullish targets at $1.10 and $1.30. Risk: Failure to break higher may retest $0.78; use risk management and watch volume. Conclusion Cardano price faces a pivotal moment as it consolidates near $0.82 inside a tightening triangle. Breakout above $0.90 would validate bullish extension to $1.10–$1.30, while a breakdown increases downside risk toward $0.78. Monitor volume, on-chain activity, and ecosystem integrations for confirmation.

New tax rules also enable crypto ETNs to be included in pension schemes and ISAs. Meanwhile, in the US, Representative Bryan Steil confirmed that the CLARITY Act is still on track despite the ongoing government shutdown. Steil is optimistic that lawmakers could still pass the bill once operations resume. Crypto ETNs Return to UK The United Kingdom officially lifted its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). This is a huge toward the mainstream integration of digital assets in the country’s financial markets. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced on Wednesday that retail investors can now access crypto ETNs through FCA-approved exchanges, which is a reversal from a restriction that was in place since January of 2021. Crypto ETNs are debt-based financial instruments that allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly owning the underlying assets. These products trade like traditional securities, with the crypto held securely by regulated custodians. Announcement from the FCA The FCA said the decision was made thanks to the market’s growing maturity and the regulator’s better understanding of digital asset products. “Since we restricted retail access to crypto ETNs, the market has evolved, and products have become more mainstream and better understood,” said David Geale, the FCA’s executive director of payments and digital finance. “In light of this, we’re providing consumers with more choice, while ensuring there are protections in place.” When the FCA first imposed the ban in 2021, it pointed to the risks associated with crypto volatility, market manipulation, and a lack of legitimate investment need. However, the tone shifted after the UK government moved to establish a clearer and more inclusive framework for digital assets. The regulator explained that while crypto ETNs are now available to retail investors, its separate ban on crypto derivatives is still in force, as they are still seen as too risky for the general public. The government also introduced new tax rules for crypto ETNs. Starting Oct. 8, these products can be included in registered pension schemes, and from April 2026, they will also be eligible for Stocks & Shares Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), giving UK citizens tax-efficient options to invest in crypto-linked products. Part of a statement from the UK Government A report by IG Group forecasts that the UK crypto market could expand by up to 20% after this regulatory shift. The firm’s research found that 30% of UK adults would consider investing in crypto via ETNs, largely because of the perceived safety and regulatory oversight these products provide. CLARITY Act Still on Track In the US, Wisconsin Representative Bryan Steil reassured people that Republicans still plan to pass the CLARITY Act — the crypto market structure bill — before 2026, despite the ongoing US government shutdown. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Steil said the timeline for establishing clearer regulations for the digital asset industry is still on track. He is optimistic that once the shutdown ends, lawmakers could “hit the ground running” and move the bill forward in the Senate. Steil is one of the original cosponsors of the CLARITY Act, and explained that if the Senate adopts the House version of the bill as its base text, there is still a real chance it could be signed into law by the end of the year. CNBC interview with Representative Bryan Steil His comments came as the Senate failed to pass a stopgap funding measure, which extended the government shutdown to its eighth day. The lapse in funding forced many federal agencies to scale back operations, furlough employees, and disrupt air travel, raising concerns about the impact on financial regulators and pending crypto-related decisions. The House passed its version of the CLARITY Act in July as part of the Republican-led “crypto week,” to create a comprehensive framework for digital assets and provide what lawmakers called “regulatory clarity” for the industry. However, progress slowed after the bill reached the Senate, where Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis previously pledged that the banking committee will vote on related legislation by the end of September. Those plans were delayed thanks to political gridlock. During the shutdown, Congress is still in session and lawmakers are also still to be paid, but legislative activity has been severely limited. Speaker Mike Johnson said the House will not reconvene until the Senate passes a bill to reopen the government. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is operating with “an extremely limited number of staff” under a contingency plan from August. Reviews of cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications are likely paused, though the SEC’s electronic systems are functional for filings. While Steil is confident that bipartisan cooperation could still bring the CLARITY Act across the finish line, the shutdown added some uncertainty to the timeline.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-09 05:30:00

The Polymarket CEO's post drew attention because XRP, currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in free circulation, was delisted.

Open account → BitMine Kerrisdale report: BitMine shares swung after short seller Kerrisdale accused the company of dilutive stock issuance and an unsustainable Ether-accumulation strategy, noting NAV opacity and slowing ETH-per-share growth. Investors reacted with volatility while shares ultimately closed slightly higher. Short-seller claim: BitMine’s strategy is unsustainable Stock issuance and at-market raises have pressured investor sentiment and narrowed the premium to NAV. BitMine holds roughly 2.83 million ETH (reported figure), a key point behind valuation debates. BitMine Kerrisdale report: Kerrisdale says BitMine’s ETH strategy and share issuance undercut value; read the firm’s market impact and investor takeaways. What is the Kerrisdale report saying about BitMine? BitMine Kerrisdale report alleges the company’s strategy of selling stock to buy Ether dilutes shareholders and has reduced the premium to net asset value. The short seller highlights rapid at-market raises, slowing ETH-per-share growth, and reduced transparency around NAV as core concerns. How did BitMine shares react to Kerrisdale’s claims? Shares ranged from a day low near $57.41 to an intraday above $60, closing up 1.35% at $60 and ticking higher after hours. Price swings reflected immediate investor uncertainty, with volatility driven by the short report and subsequent market reassessment of BitMine’s token-per-share math and issuance pace. BitMine stock saw major swings after the Ether treasury firm caught the ire of short seller Kerrisdale, which issued a scathing report on the company. BitMine Immersion Technologies is a Bitcoin miner that shifted strategy in 2025 to amass large Ether holdings and position itself as a crypto-treasury public company. Kerrisdale Capital’s short report argues that BitMine’s model—issuing equity at or near market prices to buy ETH—creates dilution and erodes the premium investors pay above the token value. Kerrisdale estimates BitMine’s token-per-share at about 9 ETH per 1,000 shares and cites the company’s reported 2.83 million ETH holding (a reported figure equating to an implied multi-billion dollar position). The short seller also flagged a fall in BitMine’s premium to multiple-of-NAV (mNAV) from roughly 2.0x in August to about 1.2x by September, per its analysis. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → BitMine’s share price saw significant swings on Tuesday after Kerrisdale’s short seller report. Source: Google Finance Why does Kerrisdale criticize BitMine’s stock issuance? Kerrisdale claims BitMine raised roughly $10 billion over three months via at-market share sales, which it says conditioned investors to expect supply following rallies. The report called a recent $365 million offering a “discounted giveaway,” arguing the firm prioritized short-term cash over long-term credibility. How does Kerrisdale compare BitMine to other crypto treasury companies? The report places BitMine among dozens of crypto treasury firms buying tokens to attract attention, but it singles BitMine out for aggressive equity issuance and opaque NAV reporting. Kerrisdale contrasts BitMine’s leadership visibility with high-profile figures in other firms, asserting that name recognition alone is insufficient to sustain a premium. Source: Kerrisdale Capital Frequently Asked Questions How much Ether does BitMine reportedly hold? BitMine is reported to hold approximately 2.83 million ETH, a figure Kerrisdale used to calculate token-per-share metrics and to critique the company’s valuation relative to its crypto holdings. Is Kerrisdale betting against Ethereum itself? No. Kerrisdale frames the short as a bet against BitMine’s premium and issuance strategy, not a negative view on Ethereum’s underlying fundamentals. The report suggests investors can acquire ETH directly or through ETFs with lower friction. Key Takeaways Short-seller trigger : Kerrisdale’s report accused BitMine of dilutive equity raises and opaque NAV reporting, prompting volatility. Market response : Shares fell intraday but closed modestly higher, indicating mixed investor sentiment.

Open account → The SEC innovation exemption is a proposed conditional exemptive relief framework that aims to give crypto developers and digital asset firms clear, time-limited regulatory permission to test products in the U.S., replacing ad hoc enforcement and enabling compliant innovation under defined guardrails. Creates a conditional, time-limited exemption for crypto projects to operate while complying with rules. Seeks to replace ad hoc enforcement with defined rulemaking and regulatory clarity for DeFi and token issuances. Expected rulemaking launch by end of 2025; announced by SEC Chair Paul Atkins at a New York industry event. innovation exemption: Learn how the SEC’s proposed framework offers conditional relief for crypto firms—read the summary and next steps for projects. What is the SEC innovation exemption? The SEC innovation exemption is a proposed framework offering conditional exemptive relief to crypto developers and digital asset firms. It is designed to provide legal clarity for experimental tokens, DeFi protocols, and on-chain capital raising by replacing case-by-case enforcement with formal rulemaking and defined compliance requirements. How will the innovation exemption work in practice? The plan, announced by SEC Chair Paul Atkins on October 8 at a Futures and Derivatives Law Report event, directs staff to develop a “conditional exemptive relief framework.” It aims to allow controlled testing and market access under specified conditions, timelines, and reporting obligations. Rulemaking is expected to begin by the end of 2025. Why is this significant for crypto projects? Front-loading regulatory clarity reduces legal uncertainty, encouraging entrepreneurship and investment. Projects that previously operated in gray areas could gain temporary legal cover while meeting disclosure, custody, and investor-protection requirements. This shift can accelerate compliant innovation and mainstream adoption. What has Paul Atkins done so far on crypto policy? Since his April 2025 appointment, Chair Paul Atkins launched “Project Crypto” to modernize securities laws for digital assets. He has guided staff memos on issuance, custody, and trading and has publicly signaled that most tokens are not securities, emphasizing on-chain capital raising and “super-app” trading platforms. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sec-innovation-exemption-atkins"" }, ""headline"": ""SEC Chair Paul Atkins Proposes 'Innovation Exemption' to Support Crypto Development"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T12:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""The SEC innovation exemption is a proposed conditional framework to give crypto developers legal clarity while enabling compliant experimentation in the U.S."", ""keywords"": ""innovation exemption, SEC innovation exemption, Paul Atkins, crypto regulation, digital assets""} When did Atkins announce the plan and what did he say? Atkins announced the initiative on October 8 at a legal industry event in New York. He said, “I have confidence [that the SEC] will be able to do it. [The exemption] is one of the top priorities…because I want to be welcoming to innovators and have them feel like they can do something here in the United States.” How does this fit with other U.S. crypto moves? The announcement complements broader shifts: Project Crypto, staff guidance on custody and issuance, and public support for stablecoin legislation. Policymakers are also discussing bigger proposals such as a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, showing renewed institutional interest in clearer crypto policy at the federal level. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How crypto projects should prepare for the SEC innovation exemption"", ""description"": ""Steps to align projects for potential conditional exemptive relief under the SEC innovation exemption."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Review token design and governance"", ""text"": ""Assess token economic design and on-chain governance to align with investor-protection principles."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Strengthen custody and disclosures"", ""text"": ""Prepare transparent custody arrangements and standardized disclosures that meet regulatory expectations."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Document testing plans"", ""text"": ""Create time-limited pilot plans, reporting schedules, and safety checks for conditional testing."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 4, ""name"": ""Engage compliance counsel"", ""text"": ""Consult legal and compliance experts to map operations to the exemption’s anticipated guardrails."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 5, ""name"": ""Monitor rulemaking"", ""text"": ""Track SEC announcements and prepare to submit comments during the rulemaking period expected in late 2025."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the purpose of the innovation exemption?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The purpose is to provide conditional, time-limited relief so crypto projects can test and operate in a compliant manner, replacing uncertain enforcement with clear regulatory rules."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When will the SEC begin rulemaking for the exemption?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The SEC plans to kick off the rulemaking process by the end of 2025, according to Chair Paul Atkins’ announcement."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who announced the innovation exemption?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""SEC Chair Paul Atkins announced the initiative during a Futures and Derivatives Law Report event in New York."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How will the innovation exemption affect DeFi protocols? It should offer conditional compliance pathways for DeFi protocols, allowing limited, supervised operation while projects meet disclosure and risk-mitigation requirements. The framework aims to protect users while enabling experimentation. Can projects expect immediate legal safety under the exemption? No. The exemption is expected to be conditional and time-limited. Projects must meet specific criteria and reporting obligations to qualify for relief and should not assume blanket immunity from enforcement. Key Takeaways Defined temporary relief : The innovation exemption creates a structured, conditional pathway for testing crypto products. Regulatory clarity : Atkins’ initiative shifts the SEC from ad hoc enforcement toward formal rulemaking expected by late 2025. Action items for projects : Review token design, strengthen custody and disclosures, document pilot plans, and consult compliance counsel. Conclusion The SEC innovation exemption, announced by Chair Paul Atkins, signals a major regulatory shift toward enabling compliant crypto innovation in the U.S. Projects should prepare now by tightening governance, disclosures, and pilot controls. Expect formal rulemaking by the end of 2025 and plan engagement during the public comment process with COINOTAG monitoring developments.

According to market analyst Paul Bennett, the cryptocurrency is poised to transform bearish pressure into a renewed bullish momentum, signaling potential upside for traders and long-term holders alike. Currently trading at $2.85, XRP is hovering just below a critical psychological and technical breakout level of $3. Bennett notes that surpassing this threshold could trigger a wave of buying interest, potentially propelling the coin toward new highs. He emphasizes that the market’s recent consolidation phase may have laid the foundation for a decisive upward move, as selling pressure eases and investor confidence begins to rebuild. Technical indicators bolster a cautiously optimistic outlook for XRP. The RSI is climbing from oversold levels, signaling room for momentum, while moving averages show the asset nearing a key support zone, setting the stage for a potential breakout if conditions align. As a result, Bennett highlights that XRP’s near-term outlook is strengthened by rising institutional interest and expanding use in cross-border payments. Backed by real-world utility and supportive technical signals, the coin is poised to attract investors seeking high-potential opportunities after summer’s market shake-ups. North Korean Hackers Swipe Over $2 Billion in Crypto in 2025, Bybit Hit Tops the List North Korean-linked hackers have escalated their digital heists to unprecedented levels, reportedly stealing more than $2 billion (£1.5 billion) in cryptocurrency so far this year, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. This staggering figure not only dwarfs previous annual thefts linked to the nation but also signals the growing sophistication and audacity of cybercrime in the crypto space. Elliptic reports that February’s Bybit breach alone , where hackers stole around $1.45 billion, accounts for the majority of 2025’s crypto losses. This record-setting heist is the largest in history, eclipsing all previous high-profile attacks and marking a pivotal moment in digital asset security. As high-profile crypto hacks rattle the market, exchanges face pressure to strengthen security and monitor suspicious activity, while investors grow wary, raising concerns about the sector’s long-term stability amid escalating geopolitical tensions. Therefore, as digital currencies go mainstream, robust security is crucial. This year’s $2 billion theft by North Korean hackers underscores that while crypto offers huge rewards, it remains a high-risk space demanding relentless security vigilance. Conclusion XRP sits at a vital point. Strengthening technical signals and improving investor sentiment suggest it could flip recent bearish pressure into a bullish surge. As a result, a break above the $3 resistance may trigger a notable upward run, positioning XRP as a key market mover. Meanwhile, the unprecedented $2 billion theft by North Korean hackers in 2025 underscores the vulnerabilities that still exist within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Bitwise Solana Staking ETF is an amended US ETF filing that adds a staking feature and sets an annual management fee of 0.20%. This fee matters because it places Bitwise in a competitive mid-range that historically drives inflows when combined with clean tracking and physical backing. How does Bitwise’s fee compare to other Solana ETF offerings? Bitwise’s 0.20% fee is lower than many active staking ETFs (for example, a 0.75% debut fee reported for an earlier Solana staking ETF) and sits close to the competitive band of 0.15%–0.25% seen among several crypto ETF issuers. Lower fees often correlate with higher inflows, especially for ETFs with reliable tracking and spot backing. Asset manager Bitwise amended its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to add staking and set the 0.20% fee. ETF analyst commentary has framed the move as an aggressive competitive strategy designed to capture market share early.

Open futures account → Solana is up 6.11% over the past 30 days, trading at $227 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Why is staking important for Solana ETFs? Staking enables an ETF to capture staking rewards from the underlying Proof-of-Stake protocol, which can improve net returns to investors if rewards are efficiently collected and distributed. The Bitwise filing explicitly includes staking, signalling an intent to offer yield-enhanced exposure to spot Solana. How might tracking and physical backing affect investor decisions? Tracking accuracy and physical backing are key E-E-A-T signals for ETF selection. Bitwise states the ETF is 100% physically backed by spot Solana, which can reduce tracking error versus synthetic or futures-based approaches. Analysts have noted that funds with cleaner tracking and lower fees typically attract larger flows.

Historically, lower fees have a strong record of drawing investor assets. Industry analysts cited in public commentary suggest Bitwise’s 0.20% may prompt rivals to lower fees or match staking features to remain competitive. Key Takeaways Competitive fee: Bitwise set a 0.20% annual fee, positioning the ETF attractively against peers. Staking included: The filing adds staking to capture Proof-of-Stake rewards, potentially improving net returns. Tracking & flows: Physical backing and low fees typically help reduce tracking error and attract inflows.

The asset is currently trading at a level 92% above its long-term 200-week moving average, which is currently $2,400, according to DeFi Report founder Michael Nadeau on Wednesday. In the last bull market cycle, ETH peaked at just above $4,870 on Nov. 10, trading 492% over its long-term moving average. Running various scenarios based on this moving technical indicator provides some interesting price predictions. If the asset trades at just 200% above the 200-week MA, it will reach $7,300. At 400% above the long-term moving average, it will be above $12,000, which is only 170% above current levels. Ether has already gained more than that since its dip below $1,500 in April. Volatile Path to Five Figures Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has predicted a super cycle leading to five-figure Ether prices, but the path to that will be extremely volatile. Ether plummeted 94% from its 2018 peak and surrendered 80% of its value in 2022, so another sharp downturn isn’t just possible, it’s probable. The analysis provided a “base case” where ETH trades 250% above its 200 WMA, which puts it at a cycle top of $8,500. This aligns with realized price reaching $3,000, which would put ETH at $8,700, assuming a ratio of 2.9. If Ether gets to 35% of Bitcoin’s market cap (it is currently 23.4%) and BTC reaches $150,000 this cycle, it would put prices at $8,600, the analyst said. Ethereum is repeating 2021, observed another popular trader on Wednesday. Back then, reclaiming the previous all-time highs “triggered a +250% explosion,” he said before adding: “Now, ETH is testing the same level again. Same structure. Same energy. Only difference this time? ETFs and institutions are in the mix.” Earlier this week, Grayscale launched the first Ether staking ETF in the US, and digital asset treasuries have accumulated 4.7% of the entire supply in just a few months. ETHEREUM IS REPEATING 2021. Back then, reclaiming the previous ATH triggered a +250% explosion. Now, $ETH is testing the same level again. Same structure. Same energy. Only difference this time? ETFs and institutions are in the mix. pic.twitter.com/Tp9A4ipZgY — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) October 8, 2025 ETH Price Outlook Ether is still consolidating, trading within a range-bound channel that formed in early August. From an intraday high above $4,500 in late trading on Wednesday, the asset has dipped back toward $4,400 in early trading in Asia on Thursday. With sideways trading now lasting two months, the asset appears coiled and ready for a breakout, and all indicators suggest it will move into price discovery as the bull market is not over yet.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is leading the pack with a bold move from CleanCore Solutions, a company that just snapped up a massive treasury stake. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is similarly dreaming of another magical run like 2021 while PEPE recent price actions scream a potential upward price trajectory. And then there’s Layer Brett (LBRETT), the fresh-faced contender blending meme charm with smart tech upgrades. Currently at a presale price of $0.0058, Layer Brett is at a point where investors can invest at a low price and recoup tremendous gains. DOGE: CleanCore’s Treasury Boost Ignites $0.35 Breakout DOGE is roaring back, trading around $0.25 after CleanCore Solutions amassed 710 million DOGE worth $174 million hitting 71% of its 1 billion token target. This institutional push, plus the first U.S. spot DOGE ETF launch in September, has spiked volume to about $2.5 billion daily. Dogecoin price predictions are bullish: Analysts see $0.538 average for 2025. A Dogecoin price prediction whispers of fresh highs if this treasury momentum keeps building, turning skeptics into believers. Shiba Inu: Whales Accumulate as Reserves Drop, $0.000023 Target in Sight Shiba Inu (SHIB) is staging a comeback around $0.0000121, with whales snapping up millions amid crashing exchange reserves signaling HODLing. SHIB Layer 2 growth now at 300+ dApps boosts utility. Community hype around a potential ETF and Q4 seasonality adds fuel to SHIB. Generally, the vibe is one of quiet defiance mixed with rising hope. Whales are quietly stacking bags while exchange supplies dwindle, painting a picture of holders who remember the days when SHIB turned a few bucks into fortunes and refuse to let go. Pepe: Meme Frenzy Builds, $0.00001542 Rally Ahead Pepe is primed for a surge at $0.00000918, with 70% monthly gains tying into the meme resurgence as Bitcoin stabilizes. PEPE’s 420 trillion supply and frog meme appeal drive $1.33 billion daily volume, up 312% YTD, fueled by listings on OKX DEX and cross-chain hype. Market analysts forecast a $0.00001542 average for 2025 and $0.000012 by mid-month 2026. But it increasingly appears that PEPE true speculative days are over. Layer Brett: L2 Meme Powerhouse Eyes 100x From Presale Layer Brett (LBRETT), the Ethereum L2 meme sensation, is skyrocketing in presale at $0.0058, raising $4.3 million with 600%+ APY staking drawing whales. Its 10 billion supply, NFT drops, gamified staking, and Solana/BSC bridges blend virality with utility, outpacing SHIB’s early path. Here are why Layer Brett may outperform DOGE, SHIB and PEPE Layer Brett runs on Ethereum’s Layer 2, delivering fast transactions (under a second) and tiny fees ($0.0001), making it practical for trading. At $0.0058 in presale, Layer brett small market cap offers 100x upside. DOGE’s $36 billion cap and SHIB’s $7 billion cap make 2x-3x gains realistic but cap their moonshot potential. PEPE $3.8 billion cap allows bigger swings, but its lack of utility risks quick crashes Layer Brett social buzz: 10,000 Telegram members, 25,000 TikTok followers, and a $1 million giveaway, mirrors PEPE past frenzy. Conclusion The meme coin frenzy of October 2025 is more than just tokens. It is about real fundamentals. Cleancore investment into DOGE hike up dogecoin price prediction, Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem strength and Pepe cross chain hype. But Layer Brett (LBRETT) stands out as the best to buy, blending meme magic with real tech to promise massive gains. Don’t miss Layer Brett’s presale—stake now for the meme coin edge.

52880022,602013,1759989605,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Solana Market Analysis: $2.8B Revenue Milestone Fuels Bullish Case Despite Recent Pullback,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-analysis-2b-revenue-milestone-fuels-bullish/,"Solana (SOL) slipped to $221 at press time, down 3.9% in the last 24 hours after failing to hold above $230. The move follows a quick retrace from this week’s $238 high and a break below the 100-hour MA near $225. Near term, traders are watching $218–$212 as the first support band (deeper bids near $210–$215), while $230–$235 caps rebounds, with a heavier $245–$250 supply zone above. If bulls reclaim $230 on strong volume, momentum could re-target $245; a daily close below $212 risks a slide toward $200. Despite the dip, SOL continues to print higher-lows on the multi-week trend, keeping the broader uptrend viable. $2.8B Annual Solana Revenue Supports Fundamental Strength Beyond price, Solana’s fundamentals are flashing green. A new analyst report tallies $2.85 billion in annualized on-chain revenue over the past year, $240 million per month on average, peaking at $616 million in January during the memecoin frenzy. Trading platforms are the flywheel, contributing 30% ($1.12B), with apps like Photon and Axiom at times generating $260M in a single month. Thanks to sub-$0.01 fees and high throughput, Solana’s revenue run-rate has outpaced Ethereum’s early-cycle trajectory and coincides with 1.2–1.5 million daily active addresses. DeFi metrics back the story; $13B TVL, 6x YoY growth in stablecoin volumes, and >$500M in tokenized RWA activity signal of durable, non-speculative usage. Upcoming performance upgrades (e.g., Firedancer) aim for dramatic latency and throughput gains, reinforcing the network’s moat for high-frequency DeFi. Institutional Access, SOL ETFs, and the Q4 Setup Institutional participation is also expanding on multiple fronts. Public balance sheets reportedly hold $4B in SOL, while staking-enabled trust products and pending U.S. spot SOL ETF applications (from issuers including Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and Bitwise) could unlock the next leg of demand. Several filings face October deadlines, and prediction markets handicap a very high probability of approval by year-end. In the near term, price may remain choppy as leverage resets across crypto, but Solana’s revenue scale, user growth, and pipeline of upgrades provide a sturdy backdrop. For traders, the roadmap is straightforward: hold $218–$212 to preserve the bullish structure; flip $230, then $245, to revive momentum. For long-term investors, the multi-billion-dollar revenue milestone and rising institutional rails keep the $300+ debate alive once risk appetite returns.

While short-term retracement appears likely, the broader market structure remains bullish. This correction could serve as a healthy reset before Bitcoin gathers momentum for its next major wave, with $150,000 standing as the next target. Heatmap Reveals Key Gaps In Bitcoin’s Support Levels ZYN, a prominent crypto analyst, recently posted an update on X highlighting a key observation from Bitcoin’s cost basis heatmap. The analyst noted that there’s limited support between the $121,000 and $120,000 levels, creating a fragile zone that Bitcoin could easily slip through if selling pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Top? Top Trader Warns Of Brutal $98,000 Liquidity Sweep Below that, ZYN pointed out a major area of interest around $117,000, where approximately 190,000 BTC had been previously purchased. This accumulation zone reflects a strong base of recent buyers and could serve as a critical level where market participants step in to absorb any downside pressure. If Bitcoin does pull back toward $117,000, the analyst believes it could set the stage for renewed accumulation rather than a deeper correction. Historically, retracements into strong support levels like this have provided fuel for the next leg higher as both existing and new investors take advantage of lower entry points. Summing up, ZYN emphasized that while Bitcoin lacks meaningful cushioning around $121,000, a solid foundation appears to be forming at $117,000. BTC Struggles To Hold Above All-Time High Zone In a recent market update, Crypto Candy observed that BTC once again struggled to maintain momentum above its ATH resistance zone between $123,000 and $124,000. The level has proven to be a tough barrier, with price attempts above it quickly met by selling pressure. As a result, BTC failed to close and sustain above this critical area, leading to a retracement that aligns with earlier expectations outlined in their analysis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicator: Why 600,000 Transactions Threshold Matters Most Presently, this short-term correction is viewed as part of a natural and healthy market cycle, not a signal of weakness. The analyst noted that if the current momentum persists, Bitcoin could dip toward the $116,000–$118,000 region before finding strong support. This range is viewed as a potential accumulation zone where buying interest could re-emerge, setting the stage for renewed bullish momentum. Despite the pullback, the broader outlook remains optimistic. Crypto Candy reaffirmed a psychological long-term target of $150,000 for Bitcoin, suggesting that the current price action is merely a temporary pause before the next leg higher.

According to Standard Chartered Bank, the next three years could see over $1 trillion shift from traditional bank deposits into stablecoins, marking one of the largest re-allocations of capital in modern history. For developing economies struggling with currency instability and capital restrictions, stablecoins are quickly becoming the digital equivalent of the U.S. dollar – a safe, liquid, and globally accessible form of savings. But while this trend poses major challenges for traditional banks, it could also open enormous doors for next-generation blockchain ecosystems like MAGACOIN FINANCE. A Trillion-Dollar Shake-Up Standard Chartered’s analysts Geoffrey Kendrick and Madhur Jha describe this migration as a “digital dollarization wave.” Backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries and redeemable 1:1, stablecoins now function as digital checking accounts for millions of users seeking stability, not speculation. The bank estimates that by 2028, the global stablecoin market could exceed $2 trillion, with two-thirds of those holdings based in emerging markets. That implies over $1.2 trillion in digital savings – mostly from countries like Turkey, Egypt, India, and Brazil – flowing into blockchain networks that support stablecoin ecosystems. Under the U.S. GENIUS Act, compliant stablecoins can no longer pay interest, yet their appeal continues to surge. As the report notes, for many households and businesses, the “return of capital matters more than the return on capital.” Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Perfectly Positioned While traditional banks brace for deposit flight, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands to thrive in this environment. The project’s expanding network, already backed by $16 million in funding, has built a digital framework designed to benefit directly from the stablecoin boom. Here’s how: Cross-Stablecoin Integration: MAGACOIN FINANCE is developing a multi-asset layer that allows users to interact seamlessly with different stablecoins within its ecosystem. As the global flow of stablecoin capital accelerates, MAGACOIN’s infrastructure could become a liquidity bridge for retail and institutional users moving funds between ecosystems. On-Chain Savings and Payments: As billions migrate away from banks, users will seek decentralized platforms that provide secure, low-cost alternatives to traditional deposits. With its upcoming payment layer and wallet integrations, MAGACOIN FINANCE can capture this growing demand for blockchain-based transactions. Global Accessibility: Emerging-market users increasingly rely on stablecoins to protect their savings from local inflation and capital controls. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s cross-border design and user-friendly interface give it a unique advantage in onboarding these new digital-dollar users. Ecosystem Expansion: The team’s roadmap includes partnerships with DeFi and fintech platforms aiming to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). This could allow stablecoin capital entering MAGACOIN’s ecosystem to be redeployed into yield-bearing digital instruments – creating a self-sustaining financial loop. A Turning Point for Global Finance The trillion-dollar shift projected by Standard Chartered signals more than just a change in banking habits – it’s the beginning of a digital monetary era. While many emerging-market banks could lose deposits, they might also find new roles as custodians or on-ramps for stablecoin liquidity. Governments are already experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and instant payment systems, but private networks remain ahead of the curve. With global stablecoin circulation already above $300 billion, the move toward tokenized finance seems irreversible. And that’s where projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE have a head start – agile enough to adapt, decentralized enough to grow, and bold enough to capture the new flow of digital wealth. Conclusion As the global economy transitions toward blockchain-based finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself not just as another altcoin, but as a core liquidity hub for the next era of digital money. Its funding surge past $16 million underscores growing confidence from early investors, while its ecosystem expansion mirrors the broader adoption wave led by stablecoins. In a world where financial power is shifting from traditional banks to decentralized protocols, MAGACOIN FINANCE could emerge as one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trillion-dollar transformation. The stablecoin era has only just begun – and MAGACOIN FINANCE looks ready to ride the front of that wave.

The company will acquire Solana once it meets market capitalization and regulatory requirements, said Joseph Chee, who leads the SOL treasury strategy. In an interview with Hong Kong Economic Times , Chee noted that Hong Kong will be its second listing location. “We will come here as soon as possible, perhaps within six months,” he said. Joseph Chee acquired Helius, a healthcare tech company, transforming it into a DAT. Last month, the firm secured $500 million to build a Solana treasury focused on acquiring SOL. Chee founded Summer Capital and served as the head of investment banking, Asia at UBS. Success of a DAT Relies on Technically Sound Currency: Zhu Junwei Zhu Junwei, former head of UBS Investment Banking Asia, who currently serves as the executive chairman of Helius Solana Company (HSDT), proposed the goal of acquiring 5% Solana. He said that the DAT companies can continuously increase the value of each token. “DAT is a bridge, an infrastructure that guides the flow of funds,” Junwei added. He referred to the continuous issuance and market entry of DATs as a “flywheel,” noting that DAT’s stock prices generally trade at a premium to their net asset value (NAV). Crypto treasury firms generally purchase digital assets, raising capital through common stock, convertible bonds, preferred stock, and even call options. Further, Junwei believes that the success of a DAT relies on a “technically sound currency” and a “strong management team.” “However, not all DAT companies can perfectly replicate or outperform cryptocurrencies,” he stated. “For example, Metaplanet, a Bitcoin DAT listed in Japan, saw its share price rise fourfold from May to June this year, but has since halved in recent months, with its performance clearly deviating from Bitcoin.” Solana DAT company Helius stated that the company aims to acquire at least 5% of Solana and pointed out that as long as the market capitalization and regulatory requirements are met, the second listing location will be Hong Kong, or within 6 months. https://t.co/Wl5kvlGx9u … — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 9, 2025 Market Awareness of Solana is Currently ‘Low’ Relatively, a very few DAT firms are accumulating Solana. Recently, Brera Holdings PLC announced a $300 million private placement to establish Solmate, a Solana-based DAT and crypto infrastructure company. Despite ‘low’ market awareness for Solana, the crypto’s processing power has surpassed Ethereum , with over 1,500 transactions per second, says Junwei. Besides, Helius Solana Company has partnered with the Solana Foundation to develop in-depth ecosystem-level collaboration in Asia. “DATs need to confront Wall Street, be able to clearly explain and analyze data in their language, and earn their trust,” Junwei added.

Bitcoin ETF inflows driving BTC demand; watch $117k support and rising leverage for short-term risk — read key levels and action items now. What is driving Bitcoin’s rally and ETF inflows? Bitcoin ETF inflows and rising futures volumes are the primary drivers of the recent BTC rally, signaling strong institutional demand that has pushed nearly all circulating supply into profit. Exchange and onchain data show accelerated capital flows, but analysts warn that higher leverage and funding rates raise short‑term risk. How much of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit and why does it matter? Onchain analytics report that about 97% of Bitcoin supply is currently in profit, indicating broad unrealized gains among holders. High profit ratios commonly precede consolidation as investors realize gains, which can temporarily slow momentum even as long‑term demand remains intact. How vulnerable is Bitcoin to a pullback and where are key support levels? Cost basis distribution analysis highlights structural support concentrated between $121,000–$120,000 , with materially stronger support near $117,000 where roughly 190,000 BTC were last acquired. A pullback into this region would likely see renewed buyer interest defending profitable entry zones. Support zones and estimated BTC holdings Support Zone Significance Approx.

Spot ETF inflows represent direct institutional allocation to BTC that can be persistent and price‑supportive. Concurrently, surging futures volumes and elevated funding rates indicate increased leverage, which can amplify moves and trigger rapid deleveraging during corrections. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap shows support around $117k.

ETF inflows increase demand and can support higher prices over time, but rapid inflows paired with high leverage may increase volatility and the likelihood of abrupt corrections. What metrics should I watch for signs of a sell‑off? Monitor funding rates, futures open interest, cost‑basis clusters, and net ETF flows. Sudden spikes in funding or rapid withdrawals from leverage instruments typically precede sharper drops. Key Takeaways Institutional demand : Spot ETF inflows and futures volumes are major drivers of the current rally. Support levels : $117k is the primary support zone with material BTC cost basis; $120k–$121k is secondary. Risk management : Rising leverage and funding rates increase short‑term fragility—monitor metrics and set risk limits. Conclusion Bitcoin ETF inflows have propelled BTC into a broad profit state and reinforced institutional participation, but elevated leverage and crowded positioning create short‑term risk. Traders should watch the $117k cost‑basis zone, funding rates, and flow metrics for signs of stabilization before committing new capital. Publication: COINOTAG — Updated: 2025-10-09.

What’s Happening?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-old-coins-are-moving-in-massively-whats-happening/,"A new on-chain analysis by crypto analyst StephIsCrypto has revealed a major shift in XRP holder behavior. According to data from Santiment, XRP’s “Age Consumed” metric has experienced a dramatic spike — indicating that long-term holders have started moving coins that have been dormant for a considerable period. The chart posted by the analyst shows two distinct surges in activity, one around August 31, 2025, and another on October 2, 2025. Each event coincided with notable movements in XRP’s market price. The latest spike aligns with a rise in XRP’s price above the 2.97 mark, suggesting that long-term investors may have taken advantage of recent price strength to move or sell their holdings. BREAKING: LONG-TERM $XRP HOLDERS START SELLING. THE AGE CONSUMED METRIC SPIKED SHARPLY, SHOWING OLD COINS MOVING AFTER LONG INACTIVITY. pic.twitter.com/yKV4T3r0b1 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 6, 2025 Understanding the “Age Consumed” Metric The “Age Consumed” indicator is a key metric in blockchain analytics. It measures the number of previously idle tokens that are now being transferred, multiplying the number of tokens by the time they have remained inactive. A spike in this metric often implies that long-term holders are suddenly active again, which can precede significant price movements or signal a change in sentiment among investors. In the chart shared by StephIsCrypto, the first major spike occurred at the end of August, followed by a short-term price recovery. The most recent increase in early October appears more substantial, both in magnitude and in timing, as it coincides with XRP’s brief upward movement. This pattern suggests that long-dormant wallets may have been reactivated during the rally, potentially as part of a profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing strategy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Sentiment X user Jo, commenting on the post, observed that the movement of old coins could reflect a shift in market sentiment. This interpretation aligns with how age consumption spikes are typically analyzed across the crypto market. When older coins begin to move after a long period of inactivity, it may suggest that some holders anticipate a change in market direction or wish to leverage improved liquidity and prices. For XRP , this may represent the beginning of a new phase in investor behavior, particularly if long-term holders are reducing exposure while shorter-term traders accumulate. The effect of such transitions can vary — while some see it as a sign of approaching selling pressure, others interpret it as a redistribution of coins that could create a stronger base for future market activity. While it remains too early to determine the long-term impact of this shift, the timing and scale of the age-consumed spike suggest that XRP’s next market phase could be influenced heavily by actions of these long-term holders. Whether this leads to increased selling or signals confidence returning to the market will depend on how prices respond in the coming weeks.

The new feature will allow merchants to accept BTC payments and automatically allocate a portion of their sales to Bitcoin. As of November 10, Square merchants will have the option to accept Bitcoin and convert up to half of their daily takings into BTC. Through Square’s existing dashboard, sellers will manage their built-in Bitcoin wallet to store, trade, or withdraw their holdings. However, the option is available to U.S. sellers, except those based in New York, with no international access currently. The firm is also waiving all processing fees until 2026; after this period, a 1% transaction fee will apply starting January 1, 2027. Block’s Suter said its apps can help make Bitcoin a practical, everyday currency Block’s Head of Bitcoin Product, Miles Suter, commented on the new feature : “We’re making Bitcoin payments as seamless as card payments while giving small businesses access to financial management tools that, until now, have been exclusive to the largest corporations.” The company plays on both sides by running Square and Cash App, which will greatly benefit it in eventually making Bitcoin a usable, everyday currency and preparing merchants for the future, he added. Following the announcement, Shares of NYSE-listed Block (XYZ) rose 2.6% on Wednesday, according to data from Yahoo Finance. With Square’s platform supporting over 4 million merchants, the initiative could be a major boost for mainstream crypto adoption. In line with that goal, Block said Square Bitcoin is designed to help small businesses adapt to the growing use of Bitcoin in payments, describing the initiative as “Simplifying Bitcoin for Main Street.” The firm had earlier revealed its intention to launch the service by 2026, a step that aligns with Block Inc.’s broader crypto roadmap and CEO Jack Dorsey’s long-held vision for Bitcoin. Dorsey had earlier added Bitcoin trading and payments features to Cash App, Block’s peer-to-peer payment platform, and has led initiatives to build an open-source Bitcoin mining system aimed at lowering energy costs. Currently, Block Inc. ranks 13th among public Bitcoin holders, with 8,692 BTC recorded on its balance sheet, according to industry reports. U.S. crypto payment use is projected to increase by 82% between 2024 and 2026 Cryptocurrency payments are gaining renewed attention as U.S. regulations become more supportive and digital assets gain broader legitimacy. According to research cited by Square from eMarketer, U.S. crypto payment use is forecast to jump 82% between 2024 and 2026. A new YouGov poll also revealed that consumers in the U.S. and the U.K. are increasingly viewing payments as one of the primary practical uses for cryptocurrency. It also suggested that AI innovations could boost adoption as financial functions become integrated into emerging tools. It aligns with the broader industry shift toward AI agents conducting cryptocurrency transactions mainly via stablecoins. Google has introduced its new Agent Payments Protocol . At the same time, PayPal is broadening its crypto payment features, now enabling users to transfer Bitcoin, Ether, and its dollar-backed stablecoin, PYUSD, directly between accounts.

JD’s post presented a historical comparison of XRP’s monthly price movements, drawing attention to a pattern he believes could repeat under specific conditions. The chart showcased long-term consolidation phases, previous breakouts, and a significant crash that followed a sharp rally in 2017. The analyst emphasized that investors should focus on XRP’s price action rather than external influences such as market sentiment or promotional narratives. JD pointed out that XRP is approaching a key resistance level on the monthly chart, highlighting the price of $3.022 as the decisive point that must be surpassed on a monthly closing basis for what he described as the next major upward move. $XRP – Monthly update for everyone! The level to break on month close is $3.022, then MOON before RUG PULL CRASH! Block all News, HYPE & ""NOISE"" that keeps Dumb Money poor in a FULL-BLOWN BULL MARKET RT for updates! I'm using Dumb Money as EXIT LIQUIDITY AGAIN lol! … pic.twitter.com/igvLxvVXb4 — JD (@jaydee_757) October 7, 2025 The Analyst’s Warning to Investors In his post, JD advised traders to ignore external distractions such as news, hype, and online chatter, warning that these factors often disadvantage less experienced investors during strong market conditions. He also revealed his personal strategy of using “dumb money” investors as exit liquidity . JD has consistently criticized these dumb money investors , who don’t have a proper profit-taking strategy, claiming to know what they hold and failing to see the cycles and patterns in the crypto market. The chart itself illustrated a scenario JD anticipates, where a breakout above $3.022 could potentially lead to a massive rally before a move he described as a “rug pull crash.” The chart also contained annotations referencing the historical 95% drop that followed XRP’s previous rally, a reminder of the asset’s volatility, which could repeat in the current cycle. Where XRP Could Be Headed JD’s update positions the $3.022 threshold as a pivotal marker for XRP. While he did not provide a specific price target beyond this level, the suggestion of a rapid advance followed by a sharp decline shows his view that a major move could occur if the asset overcomes this resistance. The analyst’s emphasis on timing the market exit also reflects his belief that a surge could be temporary. Investors seeking to profit from the current cycle must adopt proper profit-taking strategies before JD’s anticipated 95% drop. The historical data shown in the chart plays a significant role in his argument, as past market behavior serves as the foundation for his outlook that XRP’s present consolidation might mirror prior cycles, which saw swift gains and equally rapid corrections.

Open account → Bitwise has amended its US Solana ETF filing to add staking and set an annual management fee of 0.20%, positioning the offering as a competitively priced, physically backed Solana staking ETF with strong inflow potential versus higher-fee alternatives. 0.20% annual fee on Bitwise Solana Staking ETF Physically backed Solana with a staking feature and mid-range fee compared with peers. Industry reaction highlights fee competition; tracking and inflows will determine market success. Solana ETF: Bitwise files a 0.20% Solana Staking ETF with physical backing and staking — read expert analysis, fee comparison, and inflow outlook now. Bitwise is seemingly already moving to undercut other issuers with its Solana Staking ETF, proposing an annual fee of just 0.20%. Asset manager Bitwise amended its US filing to propose a Solana Staking ETF with a 0.20% annual management fee and a staking feature. ETF analysts say the fee signals likely fee competition among issuers and could boost inflows if tracking and custody are robust. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Solana is up 6.11% over the past 30 days, trading at $227 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap What is Bitwise’s proposed Solana Staking ETF? Bitwise’s proposed Solana ETF is a US-registered exchange-traded fund that would be physically backed by spot Solana (SOL) and include an on-chain staking feature, with an annual management fee of 0.20%. The filing updates the original application to add staking and to set the fee level. How does the 0.20% fee compare to other crypto ETFs? The 0.20% fee sits in the mid-range for crypto ETFs, where fees typically span 0.15%–0.75%. For context, the first Solana staking ETF listed (REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, SSK) charges 0.75% and had $12 million of inflows on debut. Lower fees historically attract more assets under management (AUM), especially for retail and institutional allocation decisions. Why does staking matter for a Solana ETF? Staking adds potential yield by participating in network validation, which can be shared with ETF holders after fees. A staking-enabled ETF can differentiate on total return versus a pure spot ETF, but it also requires robust custody, validator selection, and operational transparency to manage slashing and reward distribution risks. What are the market and analyst reactions? ETF analysts noted the low fee as a deliberate competitive move. Analyst comments described the 0.20% fee as an aggressive pricing tactic likely intended to capture flows early. Observers also contrasted Bitwise’s filing with SSK’s higher fee and noted reported tracking issues with some competing products. When could approval and launches occur? Industry forecasts have suggested possible approvals for staking-enabled Solana ETFs in the weeks following filings. Exact SEC timelines remain uncertain; approval windows depend on regulatory review, operational readiness, and any additional information requests from regulators. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitwise-solana-staking-etf"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitwise Files 0.20% Solana Staking ETF — Fee, Tracking and Inflow Outlook"", ""description"": ""Bitwise amends its Solana ETF filing to include staking and sets a 0.20% management fee.

Lower fees reduce drag on returns and can attract both retail and institutional capital. For long-term holders, a 0.20% fee materially improves net performance versus higher-fee alternatives over multi-year horizons. Will staking change Solana ETF returns? Yes. Staking can add incremental yield to total returns, but net benefit depends on the fee structure, validator performance, and any operational costs associated with staking. Key Takeaways Fee advantage : Bitwise’s 0.20% positions the ETF competitively versus higher-fee staking products. Product design : Physical backing plus staking can boost total return but requires reliable custody and validator management. Market view : Fee competition may drive inflows; tracking accuracy and operational transparency will be key differentiators. Conclusion Bitwise’s amended Solana ETF filing, with its 0.20% fee and staking feature, signals intensified fee competition in the Solana ETF market. Investors should weigh fee savings against tracking, custody, and staking execution when evaluating offerings. Monitor filings and regulatory updates for final approvals and product launches.

Published: 2025-10-08 | Updated: 2025-10-08 | Author: COINOTAG Editorial What is driving Bitcoin’s record rally? Bitcoin record rally is being driven by subdued profit-taking, concentrated institutional options positioning and strong long-term holder conviction, according to on-chain metrics and derivatives activity. These signals suggest the move is backed by structural demand rather than outsized retail speculation. How much profit has been realized recently and what does it mean? Realized profits over the past 30 days total roughly $30 billion, down from a July peak of $63 billion and well under the March and December highs of $78 billion and $99 billion respectively. Lower realized profit suggests limited wholesale selling pressure and a lower probability of an immediate cycle top. Recent realized profit comparisons Period Realized Profits (USD) Last 30 days $30 billion July peak $63 billion March market top $78 billion December market top $99 billion Why do derivatives metrics matter for the rally? Derivatives reveal where sophisticated participants place risk. Concentration in $120,000–$140,000 call options—with the $120,000 strike showing highest open interest—indicates institutional bets on materially higher prices. Market maker gamma is low, which limits forced hedging and reduces volatility from small price moves. What are long-term holders signaling? Long-term holders show realized profit margins around 129%, well below prior exhaustion thresholds near 300%. This suggests patient ownership and lower probability of mass distribution. When long-term holders maintain large unrealized gains without selling, it creates a structural floor supporting higher prices. How resilient is support and what are key technical levels? The derivatives landscape highlights $110,000 as a meaningful support level, while clustered call strikes between $120,000 and $140,000 form a target zone that could trigger accelerated buying if breached. These levels are widely discussed among institutional desks and derivatives researchers. Frequently Asked Questions Is the Bitcoin rally driven by retail or institutions? Current on-chain and derivatives data point toward institutional-driven flows and long-term holder conviction more than a retail-driven speculative surge. Concentrated option positioning and low realized profit-taking back this view. Will profit-taking end the rally? Not immediately. Profit-taking remains muted relative to prior cycle peaks, reducing the odds of an abrupt top. Sustained selling would require a sharp rise in realized profits and a spike in distribution by long-term holders. Key Takeaways Muted profit-taking : Realized gains (~$30B) are well below earlier cycle peaks, suggesting constrained selling. Institutional option bets : Heavy concentration in $120K–$140K calls indicates bullish institutional positioning. Long-term holder support : Realized profit margins (~129%) remain under exhaustion thresholds, implying durable holding behavior. Conclusion Bitcoin’s record rally appears structurally supported by on-chain metrics and derivatives positioning rather than speculative froth. While no outcome is certain, current signals favor continued momentum into the fourth quarter. Monitor realized profit flows, option concentration and long-term holder behavior for the clearest gauges of sustainability. Sources: CryptoQuant weekly report, GreeksLive research and market desk commentary (referenced as plain text). How to assess Bitcoin rally sustainability? Check realized profit trends (30-day realized gains) for signs of heavy distribution. Review options open interest by strike to identify institutional target zones. Monitor market-maker gamma and funding rates for hidden fragility.

Despite the criticism and claims of stock dilution, BitMine’s shares closed up 1.35%. Kerrisdale’s report criticized BitMine’s strategy of selling stock to purchase Ether (ETH) and grow its tokens-per-share metric, arguing that the approach no longer justifies the company’s premium valuation. The firm said BitMine’s market value is now converging with the underlying value of its crypto holdings, diminishing its appeal to investors. BitMine Becomes World’s Largest Public Ethereum Holder BitMine, once a traditional Bitcoin miner, pivoted earlier this year to become the world’s largest public holder of Ethereum, amassing billions worth of ETH . Kerrisdale estimated that BitMine’s balance sheet holds about nine ETH per 1,000 shares, but warned that “the playbook of issuing shares to buy tokens has reached its limit.” Despite the scathing critique, BitMine’s stock managed to close 1.35% higher at $60, recovering from an early 5% dip to $57.41. Shares rose another 0.4% after hours. Kerrisdale, known for targeting overvalued crypto-related firms, has previously shorted Riot Platforms and Strategy (Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-buying firm). Riot dismissed Kerrisdale’s findings as “unsound,” while Strategy ignored the report, with Saylor continuing to champion the firm’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy. In its latest note, Kerrisdale accused BitMine of excessive stock dilution, pointing to $10 billion in new share offerings over the past three months. “Every rally is met with more supply,” it said, describing the company’s $365 million September raise as “a discounted giveaway disguised as a premium deal.” $BMNR’s premium has been sliding lower and lower, and will probably continue bleeding until it’s at NAV or below. The lower it goes, the slower the ETH-per-share accretion, until it collapses below 1. MNav is ~1.4x today, with 40%+ downside 5/9 — Kerrisdale Capital (@KerrisdaleCap) October 8, 2025 The report also took aim at executive chairman Tom Lee, saying that while his reputation brings visibility, “he lacks the cult-like magnetism of Michael Saylor.” It added that BitMine’s model “needs scarcity, charisma, and innovation — none of which it currently offers.” Kerrisdale concluded that its short position is “not a bet against Ethereum, but against the notion that investors should pay a premium for exposure they could easily replicate.” “If you want ETH,” the firm wrote, “just buy it directly, stake it, or invest through one of the new ETFs. BitMine’s middleman pitch has run its course.” Institutions and ETFs Now Hold 12.5M ETH Institutional demand for Ethereum is hitting new highs, with treasury firms and exchange-traded funds now holding over 12.48 million ETH, roughly 10.31% of the network’s total supply . According to data from StrategicETHReserve, corporate treasuries hold about 5.66 million ETH (4.68% of supply), while spot Ethereum ETFs have amassed another 6.81 million ETH (5.63%). The figures underscore a growing shift among institutions toward Ethereum as a productive asset, mirroring the corporate Bitcoin accumulation trend seen in recent years. October saw US-listed spot Ether ETFs record net inflows of $621.4 million, more than doubling September’s $285.7 million, per SoSoValue. In August, inflows peaked at $3.9 billion, suggesting a sustained appetite for Ethereum exposure. One standout example is SharpLink Gaming, which revealed this week it now holds 839,000 ETH with no debt on its balance sheet.

Binance Coin Becomes Third-Largest Cryptocurrency The recent momentum has been particularly noteworthy, as the BNB price eyes to turn the $1,300 mark as its new support for further upside movements, retracing only 2% from its peak after its record-breaking rally on Tuesday. This minimal pullback signals a lack of sustained selling pressure and suggests that further upside potential remains on the horizon. If this trend continues, analysts are eyeing new price targets for BNB.

This has been in part, attributed to CEA Industries Inc., which recently announced it has acquired over $600 million worth of BNB, holding 480,000 tokens at an average cost of $860 each. CEA’s ambition to become a major player in the BNB ecosystem, is also highlighted on its roadmap with plans to own 1% of the total Binance Coin supply by the end of the year. David Namdar, CEO of CEA Industries, commented on the recent surge, stating, “BNB’s all-time highs are a clear validation that the global markets are waking up to the inherent value, credibility, scale, and utility of both the asset and underlying ecosystem.” The company’s CEO further emphasized that Binance Coin should be viewed not merely as a token, but as a central component of a “highly integrated network.” BNB Price Eyes Fibonacci Targets Of $1,486 And $1,983 Market expert Lark Davis has also added to the growing bullish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency’s rally on social media site X (formerly Twitter), noting that BNB is now firmly in price discovery mode, which could lead to further significant gains as the anticipated demand continues to grow. Related Reading: XRP Price Under Pressure: These Key Levels Hold The Fate Of A New Record Or A Drop Below $2 According to the expert’s analysis, the next major Fibonacci targets for the BNB price are set at $1,486 for the 2.618 level and $1,983 for the 3.618 level, indicating a strong possibility for continued upward momentum. This implies that if this scenario plays out, the coming days of months could see additional increases for the BNB price of 14% and a major 52% in the case of breaching $1,900.

But after a decade of experimentation, the market seems to be coming full circle. People are asking a simple question again: what’s real here? That question is what Avalon X (AVLX) is trying to answer. The project is now in the spotlight because it plans to combine the blockchain world with real estate, which is a field that people have both loved and hated since it is hard to get into. Avalon X promises to make it feasible for people who never thought they could afford property to own it by linking digital tokens to real estate. The Avalon X team can be joined for a live AMA on Friday, October 10th on their official X channel. For most people, owning property has always been a goal, but it’s a long way off. It’s not easy to get in because prices are going up, banks have strict rules, and geography. Avalon X’s approach gets around these problems by turning real estate into digital tokens. Instead of owning an entire property, investors can be partial investors, which are represented by the AVLX coins. People who possess those tokens can invest in real-world value without the hassles of traditional real estate. It’s a notion that is becoming more popular around the world. Tokenization lets you own a piece of real estate anywhere in the world without borders. Real Value, Not Hype, Is What We’re Building On Avalon X’s message is very different from the fast-paced, hype-heavy world of crypto. The team talks about its long-term goals on its website. These goals include fairness, sustainability, and openness, which are three qualities that have been missing from this business for a long time. The platform will check and log every property on-chain. That means investors can see and confirm that their tokens are linked to real assets that are protected by law. It’s a new way of doing things in a sector that has been slammed for selling fake goods and making promises it can’t keep. The actual point of Avalon X is to remind the crypto community that new ideas don’t have to hurt their credibility. Community and Rewards Done Differently Avalon X isn’t relying solely on its technology to build interest. It’s also leaning into community engagement, much like early crypto projects did. The team recently launched a $1 million AVLX token giveaway and even put a luxury townhouse up for grabs. The prize will be a fully deeded townhouse located within the gated Eco Avalon development. Eco Avalon Townhouse Giveaway In addition to these giveaways, Avalon X is offering a referral program that rewards participants with a 10% bonus on every friend referred and 10 extra entries for the giveaways above. That kind of promotion might sound flashy, but it fits the project’s spirit. The idea isn’t just to hand out tokens — it’s to give people a taste of what real-world rewards look like in a blockchain system. Avalon X’s campaigns tie directly to physical value instead of empty promises. By joining forces with Grupo Avalon , a well-established real estate developer managing nearly $1 billion in projects, Avalon X is proving that it’s not just talking about change. It’s actually building it, one project at a time. Avalon X is just days away from a major price increase with the official website showcasing a countdown to stage 2. To connect with the community ahead of this milestone, the Avalon X team will host a live AMA session on Friday, October 10th. Community members are encouraged to submit their questions in advance through the linked Google Form for a chance to have them answered live during the event. The Bigger Picture: RWAs Are Changing Crypto Real-world asset (RWA) projects like Avalon X will shape the next big evolution in blockchain. Instead of purely digital speculation, they’re blending the crypto world with tangible assets — gold, government bonds, and, in Avalon X’s case, real estate. Analysts see RWAs as one of the few crypto sectors with genuine staying power. They bring something stable to an otherwise volatile market. And because they can be regulated and audited, they also appeal to traditional investors who’ve been cautious about diving into crypto. The AVLX’s launch timing couldn’t be better. The conversation about utility is louder than ever. People are ready for blockchain that does something, not just promises something. Looking Forward The Avalon X roadmap shows plans for big things ahead. The initiative wants to grow its real estate portfolio, offer staking rewards based on property income, and work with partners around the world to make tokenized real estate easier to access. AVLX is changing what “ownership” means in the digital age. It’s not just about having tokens; it’s about owning a piece of the globe. The initiative is a bridge between two realms that have always seemed far apart: blockchain and bricks. That bridge could be what brings trust back to an industry that really needs it.

52882438,601457,1759993250,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52882438.jpeg,Bitcoin Smart Money: Glassnode Reveals How Large Traders Timed The Pullback,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-smart-money-reveals-large-timed-pullback/,"Data from Glassnode has revealed how the large Bitcoin traders showed expert timing in the derivatives market during the market reversal. Bitcoin Large Traders Have Shifted To A Net Short Bias In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the large Bitcoin traders behaved during the latest pullback in the cryptocurrency’s price. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the BTC Long/Short Bias , a metric tracking the difference between long and short positions opened by the large investors on derivatives exchanges, over the past couple of months. From the graph, it’s visible that the Long/Short Bias has mostly been at a slight negative level for Bitcoin during the last few weeks, indicating that the large traders have just leaned toward short positioning. When BTC set its initial all-time high (ATH) above $125,000 on Saturday, however, the indicator assumed a small positive value, implying there was a slight bias toward a bullish sentiment among derivatives users. Interestingly, this same behavior wasn’t seen during the second ATH break above $126,000 on Monday. In fact, the whales behaved in the completely opposite manner: the Long/Short Bias saw a plunge deep into the negative territory. “The shift to a net short bias suggests profit-taking on longs alongside new short positioning,” notes the analytics firm. Thus, it would seem that the large traders were anticipating a price pullback after the price top, so they started moving in advance. The Long/Short Bias only saw a further decline when Tuesday’s fast crash below $121,000 took place. Now, the metric is sitting at a value of -4,416.20 BTC, which means bearish bets outweigh bullish ones by more than 4,400 tokens. It now remains to be seen how sentiment among the Bitcoin whales will develop in the coming days. Another shift from smart money could potentially foreshadow another shift for the asset’s price as well, given the latest pattern. In some other news, the recent Bitcoin price surge has meant that Percent Supply in Profit has broken into an extreme territory, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post . As displayed in the above chart, the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit broke above 95% when it crossed the $117,000 level during the rally. Naturally, the metric later went on to reach 100% as BTC set a new ATH, since everyone is in the green whenever the cryptocurrency explores new price levels. Historically, the metric being above 95% has often indicated overheated conditions for BTC. As the analytics firm explains, such a high value is “a hallmark of Euphoria phases, where widespread profitability often fuels accelerated profit-taking and rising market risk.” BTC Price Bitcoin has shown some recovery during the past day as its price has returned to the $123,000 mark.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Large Traders|Bitcoin Smart Money|btc|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 07:00:50

In an X post on Oct. 9, Coplan suggested a $POLY token could eventually rank among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The tease comes as Polymarket continues to gain traction as a go-to platform for betting on real-world events, from elections and sports to macroeconomic outcomes. Polymarket Previously Teased Airdrop To Reward Active Users This is not the first time the company has hinted at a potential token. Last November, Polymarket teased the prospect of a user airdrop that could reward participants who redeemed winning bets with further incentives. Such moves have fueled expectations that a launch may not be far off. $BTC $ETH $BNB $SOL $POLY https://t.co/HmMobU6nBh — Shayne Coplan (@shayne_coplan) October 8, 2025 Meanwhile, CoinDesk reported in July that the platform had weighed either issuing its own stablecoin or striking a revenue-sharing deal with Circle. Both options reflect Polymarket’s ambition to strengthen its business model and expand beyond traditional trading fees. Record Wagers Elevated Platform To Global Attention Founded in 2020, Polymarket has quickly become one of the largest crypto-native prediction markets. It saw explosive growth during the 2024 US presidential election, when more than $3.6b was wagered on the outcome. The surge cemented its position as a unique venue for traders seeking exposure to political and cultural events through blockchain-based contracts. On Wednesday, Coplan revealed that Polymarket had raised $205m in two previously undisclosed funding rounds . The first, worth $55m, was completed in 2024 at a $350m valuation and led by Blockchain Capital. The second, in 2025, was far larger at $150m and led by Founders Fund, valuing the company at $1.2b. Together, the rounds brought Polymarket’s total raised capital to nearly $279m before its recent deal with Intercontinental Exchange. That ICE investment, worth $2b , was announced this week and propelled Coplan into the global billionaire ranks. It also marked one of the most significant validations of prediction markets from a major financial institution. ICE Backing Strengthens Case For Domestic Relaunch After Four-Year Ban The billionaire milestone adds momentum to Polymarket’s preparations for a return to the US market. The firm has been restricted since 2021, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission forced it to block American users due to regulatory concerns. With ICE’s backing and ongoing regulatory work, Polymarket aims to relaunch domestically after nearly four years. For Coplan, the token tease adds another layer of intrigue at a time when investor appetite for prediction markets is soaring. If launched, a POLY token could give users a direct stake in the platform’s success and further align incentives across its fast-growing community.

Open account → Solana price is showing clear bullish momentum: rising OBV, a defended support near $200 and a tightening resistance at $250–$255 create a breakout setup that could target $275–$300 on a volume-driven move, while failure below $200 risks a pullback to $175–$180. OBV confirms accumulation: On-Balance Volume at 91.81M supports sustained buying pressure within a rising price channel. Key breakout zone: $250–$255 resistance with measured targets to $275–$300; invalidation under $200 opens deeper retracement risk. Technical catalysts: cup-and-handle, 1.618 Fibonacci target near $425 and a forming golden cross on the monthly chart. Solana price shows bullish breakout potential with rising OBV and $200 support — watch $250–$255 resistance for confirmation. Read the full technical outlook and trade scenarios. What is the current Solana price outlook? Solana price is in a bullish structure, supported by rising On-Balance Volume and a well-defined rising channel between $200 support and $250 resistance. A confirmed breakout above $250–$255 on higher volume could target $275–$300; loss of $200 would suggest a deeper pullback to $175–$180. How does On-Balance Volume (OBV) validate the move? OBV at 91.81M shows steady accumulation, indicating demand is supporting price increases rather than short-lived speculation. When OBV trends with price in an ascending parallel channel, breakouts backed by volume are more reliable. IncomeSharks highlighted this OBV alignment as a key validation metric. What breakout scenarios should traders watch? Watch the $250–$255 resistance: a decisive close above this zone with increased volume would point to targets between $275 and $300. If momentum stalls and the $200 lower boundary is lost, expect a retracement toward $175–$180. The narrowing range signals a high-probability directional move soon. COINOTAG recommends • Exchange signup Clear control for futures Sizing, stops, and scenario planning tools. Open futures account → Source: IncomeSharks on X Why does the rising channel matter for long-term strength? The rising channel encapsulates consistent higher highs and higher lows since mid-year, showing trend resilience. Buyers repeatedly defended the lower boundary around $200, suggesting strong conviction. Volume metrics and OBV alignment imply most upward moves are demand-driven, improving the odds for a sustainable rally if resistance yields. What are the longer-term technical targets? Analyst Lark Davis identifies a cup-and-handle pattern on the monthly chart and cites a 1.618 Fibonacci extension targeting approximately $425. A forming monthly golden cross on the MACD adds further technical support for extended upside if macro factors remain favorable. How could market catalysts affect the outlook? Potential institutional catalysts such as a Solana ETF approval would likely add structural demand, amplifying any technical breakout. Conversely, negative macro liquidity events or token-specific regulatory headwinds would increase downside risk. These scenarios are factored into the $275–$300 bullish target versus $175–$180 downside case. Frequently Asked Questions What is the key support level for Solana right now? Key support is near $200; a sustained break below this level would invalidate the current bullish channel and could lead to retracement toward $175–$180. When will a Solana breakout be confirmed? A confirmed breakout occurs on a daily close above $250–$255 accompanied by higher-than-average volume and expanding OBV, which indicates genuine buying pressure. Key Takeaways OBV validates accumulation : 91.81M OBV aligns with price strength, supporting bullish scenarios. Critical levels : Support at $200; resistance and breakout trigger at $250–$255. Targets and risks : Measured upside to $275–$300 (extension to $425 on monthly targets); downside risk to $175–$180 if support fails. Conclusion Solana price displays a credible bullish setup, with rising OBV and a contained rising channel framing clear trade levels. Traders should watch $250–$255 for breakout confirmation and monitor volume and OBV for validation.

Open account → BNB chain is pursuing an ecosystem overhaul led by YZi Labs’ new $1B Builder Fund to attract DeFi, AI, tokenization and DeSci projects. The move aims to broaden utility beyond memecoins by funding builders, improving infrastructure, and leveraging BNB’s large user base and recent network upgrades. YZi Labs launches $1B Builder Fund to accelerate BNB ecosystem development Fund targets DeFi, AI, tokenization and DeSci founders to diversify on-chain activity BNB posted top weekly DEX volume ($16B) vs Solana’s $15B; Maxwell Hardfork cut block times to 0.75s BNB chain overhaul: YZi Labs’ $1B Builder Fund to fund DeFi, AI and tokenization builders — learn what it means for BNB adoption and price action. What is driving the BNB chain ecosystem overhaul? BNB chain overhaul stems from YZi Labs’ announcement of a $1B Builder Fund and recent protocol upgrades that reduced block times and fees. The initiative seeks to diversify on-chain activity beyond memecoins by funding builders in DeFi, AI, tokenization and decentralized science. How will YZi Labs’ $1B Builder Fund affect BNB development? The fund supplies early capital and resources to founders building on BNB, prioritizing projects that address real-world pain points. YZi Labs—led by Ella Zhang—cited the chain’s 460 million user reach and improved performance as key advantages for founders. The fund targets DeFi, AI, tokenization and DeSci startups. Expected outcomes include increased protocol deployments, developer hires, and more sustainable dApp product cycles. Authority signals: Network performance data and developer-activity metrics referenced from Santiment and DeFiLlama (sources cited as plain text). Why is the timing significant for BNB? The announcement followed BNB’s new all-time high and a memecoin-driven surge that pushed weekly DEX volume higher than competitors. The Maxwell Hardfork in May reduced block times to 0.75 seconds and lowered fees to approximately 0.05 Gwei, improving user experience and throughput. Can BNB sustain momentum and reach $1.5K? If on-chain traction and developer activity continue, BNB defending $1K could open the path to $1.5K. This outlook depends on sustained product launches, meaningful user retention, and the Builder Fund directing capital to projects that increase real utility. Ready to rival Solana? BNB’s recent surge in memecoin activity and DEX volume ($16B this week) surpassed Solana’s $15B, highlighting short-term outperformance. However, critics warn the ecosystem risks being perceived as primarily speculative unless new projects solve tangible problems. Community voices—including pseudonymous commentators—acknowledge the chain’s capacity to launch tokens rapidly but emphasize the need for long-term product roadmaps. Developer Activity dipped after May but recovered in late September, indicating cyclical development patterns rather than a uniform decline.

Improved throughput and lower fees make the chain attractive for high-frequency and low-cost applications. Source: Santiment Comparisons show BNB’s Developer Activity surged earlier in 2025, eased in Q4, and recovered in late September. That volatility highlights the importance of sustained funding and developer support to maintain growth. Source: Santiment DEX-volume metrics for the week show BNB at $16B and Solana at $15B, with DeFiLlama and TradingView providing baseline data (sources cited as plain text). Source: DeFiLlama If traction continues and BNB holds $1K, a $1.5K target becomes plausible, though contingent on project-level adoption and macro market conditions. Source: BNB/USDT, TradingView Frequently Asked Questions How can builders apply to YZi Labs’ Builder Fund? YZi Labs will accept applications and founder outreach through its official channels; builders should prepare concise pitch decks highlighting product-market fit, team, and tokenomics. Prioritize solutions that reduce friction for users on the BNB chain. What network changes improved BNB performance? The Maxwell Hardfork reduced block times to 0.75 seconds and lowered typical gas fees to approximately 0.05 Gwei, enhancing throughput and lowering user costs for microtransactions and high-frequency dApps. Does stronger DEX volume guarantee long-term growth? High DEX volume signals short-term activity but not guaranteed long-term value. Sustainable growth requires products that retain users, ongoing developer activity, and diversified on-chain use cases beyond speculative token trading. Key Takeaways Builder Fund launch : YZi Labs’ $1B fund aims to diversify BNB by funding DeFi, AI, tokenization and DeSci projects. Infrastructure upgrades : Maxwell Hardfork cut block times to 0.75s and lowered fees, improving developer and user experience. Market outlook : If traction continues and BNB holds $1K, the $1.5K target is plausible; success depends on developer outputs and sustained adoption. Conclusion BNB chain’s ecosystem overhaul—backed by YZi Labs’ $1B Builder Fund and recent protocol upgrades—seeks to reposition the network from memecoin-driven activity to diversified, product-focused growth. Continued developer support, measurable product launches, and sustained user retention will determine whether BNB translates short-term traction into long-term adoption. COINOTAG will monitor fund deployment and on-chain metrics for updates.

New use cases mean those tokens may become usable, despite previous regulatory concerns. Privacy tokens like RAIL and ZEC are rallying again, as the tech is becoming relevant once again. Railgun gained attention after Ethereum announced a new privacy cluster with varied confidentiality projects. ZCash recently reiterated the ‘privacy is normal’ slogan, which aims to lead at accepting verified, but non-transparent transactions. Privacy is Normal. https://t.co/txbjTp8jRb — Zcash 🛡️ (@Zcash) October 8, 2025 The recent trend extended the gains of ZEC from its previous rally. ZEC recently peaked at $179.46, and is currently at the $173 level. The privacy coin is now trading at levels not seen since December 2021. ZEC had its own private rally, as traders remembered the long-running project. In the past, ZEC has held several minor recoveries, though remaining far from its initial valuation in the thousands. The coin aimed at competing with BTC, though in the end it turned into a niche asset, with some limitations to being represented on exchanges. Privacy coins have also added unveiling technology for interacting with exchanges, removing their main obstacle to trading. Additionally, decentralized activity may offer more cross-chain opportunities for permissionless or totally anonymous activity. While most privacy coins and tokens are in the green, for now only the top assets are showing dramatic rallies. Monero (XMR) also rose alongside the general market trend, trading above $336. Why is ZEC making a return? ZEC already completed a 300% rally to a new price range. This time around, the expansion was not just a random market move. ZCash privacy technology was trying to remain relevant, instead of a regulatory burden. Recently, the Zashi wallet was also added on the Solana app store. ZEC gained representation through the ZCash Trust for accredited investors, showing acceptance of privacy assets. Additionally, ZEC was added to ThorSwap, adding a layer of interoperability. Now, it is possible to swap between ZEC, BTC , and ETH, without unnecessary traces. Institutions are also paying more attention to privacy technology, to avoid harmful surveillance. On-chain data may be transparent, but institutions are already trying to protect their wallets. The expansion of treasury companies also calls for veiled transfers and wallets. RAIL grows to one-year high Following the renewed interest in privacy technology, the native token of the Railgun mixer expanded to a one-year high. RAIL went vertical as the privacy coin narrative returned, with additional attention from the Ethereum Foundation. | Source: CoinGecko . RAIL traded at $2.76, reaching levels not seen since the spring of 2022. Previously, RAIL had short-term rallies above $2, based on general market recoveries. In the year to date, the RAIL market cap expanded by over 400% from the lows in May. The Railgun project has been the focus of Vitalik Buterin’s donations, with up to $5M in total donations over the years. Buterin himself has used Railgun, while advocating for veiled transactions. Railgun vets transactions and can check for blacklist wallets, unlike TornadoCash, which has no barriers to usage.

According to him, the current bull market could last much longer because of loose monetary policy. His opinion goes against long-held beliefs in crypto markets and changes the story from mechanical timing to macro-driven momentum. Hayes Fires the Four-Year Cycle Myth: Liquid Money Is King In a new essay titled “Long Live the King!” published recently on his Substack, Hayes claimed that many traders have been wrongly applying a rigid four-year template to Bitcoin’s cycles, even with the global monetary environment changing. According to him, past peaks coincided with tightening in dollar and yuan credit, not just halving schedules. He also suggested that current conditions are dissimilar enough to break the pattern. The crypto entrepreneur pointed to the U.S. Treasury’s decision to issue more Treasury bills and drain about $2.5 trillion from the Fed’s Reverse Repo program as a backdoor liquidity injection into markets. Further, he highlighted that the Federal Reserve has resumed cutting interest rates, despite inflation still above target, and that two cuts later this year are now priced in by futures markets. In criticizing cycle devotees, Hayes called out the blind application of historical rhythm, saying: “traders wish to apply the pattern … without understanding why it worked in the past.” The market watcher maintained that the interplay of money quantity and cost, primarily in USD and yuan, remains the real driver. Reactions in the market have been mixed. Some analysts, like Raoul Paul, continue to see echoes of past cycle structure, even suggesting they may become more extended . Others are more cautious: veteran trader Peter Brandt warns that if Bitcoin breaks from the four-year cycle, it may provoke “dramatic” price action. Historical Context, Counterarguments, and What Lies Ahead To understand Hayes’s thesis, one must revisit the three full Bitcoin cycles to date. In the 2009–2013 phase, excessive credit growth from the U.S. and China reversed, choking off momentum for a while. During 2013–2017, Hayes ascribes much of the boom to China’s credit expansion rather than pure USD flows, and the subsequent deceleration precipitated the decline. The COVID era also saw torrents of USD liquidity overwhelm Chinese restraint, with that too ending when the Fed began tightening in late 2021, with BTC peaking in April that year. The former BitMEX executive now argues that the next phase is different: while China may not be the primary engine, its pivot away from deflation may act as a floor for global credit dynamics and remove a key counterbalance to U.S. liquidity. In his eyes, the world is entering a regime in which cheaper money and greater supply can fuel further upside in Bitcoin. That said, skeptics point out that economic risks such as recession, banking stress, and inflation overshoot might upend the liquidity narrative.

The launch allows qualified participants, including asset managers and corporate treasuries, to earn staking rewards while supporting network security in compliance with financial regulations. As part of this collaboration, AMINA clients can receive up to 15% in staking rewards. This rate combines AMINA’s base yield with an additional incentive from the foundation. The move expands the bank’s existing POL custody and trading services, giving institutions a compliant path to participate in blockchain infrastructure relied on by firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton for their tokenization efforts. Myles Harrison, AMINA’s chief product officer, said the service bridges traditional finance with “the networks that matter.” AMINA Bank (previously known as SEBA Bank) holds a license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”), and also has nods to offer crypto services from regulators in Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron called the development a sign that institutions “aren’t just buying tokens anymore — they want to participate.” Polygon, an Ethereum overlay blockchain which processes transactions for less than a cent and settles them in under five seconds, has become one of the main networks for on-chain finance. It now hosts over $1 billion in tokenized real-world assets and nearly $3 billion in stablecoin value.

Over the past month, wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP offloaded 440 million tokens. This drop is gaining attention as XRP hovers near a key price level. Large Holders Reduce Exposure In the last 30 days, whales holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP reduced their collective balance from around 6.95 billion to 6.51 billion XRP. This change was shared by analyst Ali Martinez, based on on-chain data. During this time, XRP’s price has fallen by 5% over the week and 1% in the last 24 hours. The price traded at $2.83 at press time. The steady decline in whale holdings aligns with the drop in price, suggesting that the sell pressure may have influenced the market. Meanwhile, there were few pauses in this activity. Most of the movement appears consistent, pointing to a clear trend of reduced exposure. Large holders often adjust their positions in response to wider market signals or when locking in gains. $2.80 Becomes a Key Support Zone The price level of $2.80 has drawn attention due to high transaction volume in this range. Around 2.48 billion XRP changed hands at $2.80, making it the largest zone of realized value. This number accounts for almost 4% of the total supply. Notably, this type of buying activity suggests that many holders entered the market at or near this level. If the price stays near $2.80, many may choose to hold or add more, creating a base for price stability. Buying interest often grows around these levels when the market turns uncertain. If the price drops below $2.80, holders could begin to sell. This may lead to short-term losses for many and result in higher trading activity. “ $2.80 is the most important support level for $XRP ,” said Ali in a recent post, pointing to the weight of activity around this zone. Source: Ali Martinez/X Watching Short-Term Price Points Crypto analyst CRYPTOWZRD said that XRP’s price action shows mixed signals. A daily close above $2.89 is being watched as a short-term bullish sign. If the price holds, it may present a long entry. A move above $3 could lead to an upward move toward $3.1320. If XRP fails to hold $2.89, the price could remain flat. “We now need to wait for the market to get the next healthy trade opportunity,” the analyst noted. The daily chart also shows that XRP is testing a trendline. A breakout above $3.15 could open the door for a move toward $3.65 or a possible high. Until then, traders remain on alert for price direction.

Currently, the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as property, meaning each transaction, no matter how small, could trigger a capital gains report. This has long been viewed as a barrier to using Bitcoin for daily purchases. Lummis’s proposal aims to simplify this process and promote broader cryptocurrency adoption. As she finalizes her plans, analysts advise investors to monitor new legislative developments, particularly regarding the de minimis exemption threshold, inflation adjustments, and the timeline for when these changes may take effect. These factors will ultimately determine how many routine Bitcoin payments can bypass capital gains reporting. Senator Lummis’ new Bitcoin-related initiative raises controversy Individuals in the crypto space have received Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin initiative to remove taxes on small Bitcoin transactions with mixed reactions, as analysts highlight that this change could significantly affect how regular users engage with Bitcoin. Some have acknowledged these efforts as wonderful news for regular Bitcoin users, comparing how small purchases will be handled to buying a coffee with sats. They further highlighted that Senator Lummis is a strong supporter of Bitcoin, citing her efforts for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to them, her recent plan for Bitcoin will make the cryptocurrency a real currency, rather than just a speculative investment. On the other hand, some have raised concerns about Lummis’ plan, arguing that an approach focused solely on Bitcoin is unhealthy for the US crypto market. Based on their argument, this leaves out many individuals in the industry who utilize other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Litecoin, DASH and Dogecoin, to make payments. According to them, these individuals should also have the opportunity to get tax breaks on their daily transactions. “How about no capital gains in countries outside the US, such as Dubai or Singapore?” Some asked. Notably, Lummis has introduced several Bitcoin-related regulations, including the BITCOIN Act. This act seeks to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning the US as a global leader in crypto. Regarding the senator’s recent plans for Bitcoin, a reliable source has highlighted that this initiative might entice more individuals to use Bitcoin by reducing financial strain for small transactions, making it more appealing for retail traders and investors. These efforts might also impact the price of Bitcoin in the near future. Crypto analysts have also commented on the discussion, noting that eliminating taxes on small Bitcoin transactions could increase trading volume and liquidity for BTC pairs. According to their research, tax costs kept many small investors away from spot markets on platforms like Binance or Coinbase in the past. With this new initiative, eliminating these taxes may encourage more frequent trading. Still, there are risks associated with this initiative, including possible opposition from regulators, among others. Lummis asserts that funding for a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will commence anytime Apart from working on eliminating taxes on small Bitcoin transactions, Lummis made a significant announcement that funding for a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will commence at any moment . Her remarks triggered a heated debate in Washington over how swiftly the Treasury might launch the plan. Interestingly, this discussion was raised even before Congress finalized legislation. Although several draft bills are still winding their way through Congress, Lummis’s statement suggests that the Treasury Department might have the power, or at least gain support from politicians, to start preparing infrastructure or funding before formal legislation is enacted. In an X post , the US Senator acknowledged that creating laws is tough, and they are still pushing towards passage. However, with the help of President Trump, Lummis asserted that the acquisition of funds for aN SBR can begin at any time. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

But while Bitcoin (BTC) is grabbing the headlines with its October pump, the real opportunity for investors lies elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol for the next generation, is in Phase 6 of presale, at a low price of just $0.035, and already more than 60% sold out, indicating robust early demand. Mutuum Finance provides a fully audited dual-lending system for practical and scalable financial solutions. As Bitcoin momentum gains steam, Mutuum Finance is perfectly positioned to catch the market’s next wave of growth, offering investors exponential upside potential based on real DeFi innovation. Bitcoin Breaks Records as October Rally Accelerates Bitcoin (BTC) has again become the market’s main event, breaking price records as the total crypto market capitalization hits $4.24 trillion. A string of Federal Reserve policy changes and strong demand for ETFs has driven this rally, triggering new investor sentiment and driving the October rally. Analysts say, with seasonal trends now in play, Bitcoin is set to enter price discovery mode shortly, clearing the way for significant gains. While BTC momentum continues to make headlines, investors seeking early-stage exposure with real-world utility and asymmetric upside potential are increasingly turning to emerging DeFi projects, a category in which Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a standout coin. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to draw interest as presale Phase 6 continues to gather lots of momentum. Interest from investors remains robust, with over 16,800 investors investing over $17 million, an indication that confidence in the project’s long-term outlook and future in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space continues to grow. Mutuum Finance protocol is constructed on the basis of dynamic Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and live liquidation factors that are updated in real time based on market conditions. This dynamic aspect allows for active hedging of volatility, thereby making the protocol more resilient to volatile market conditions. Next-Generation Lending and Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced that it is going to launch its innovative lending and borrowing protocol . The protocol’s first version 1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, the first to launch with it a full suite of core features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. The protocol will be supported by ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateralization from day one, offering users a high-speed, efficient, and scalable DeFi experience. Reserve multipliers also help to offer the system an additional layer of security, ranging from 10% to low-risk assets and 35% to risk assets, as an additional layer of protection from the markets. MUTM collateral management is designed to realize optimum borrowing capacity and aggregate capital efficiency by synergetic utilization of the correlated assets. Collectively, these mechanisms minimize insolvency risk while delivering a safe, stable, and sustainable DeFi lending experience. The Next DeFi Opportunity This October Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a leading DeFi project, having raised over $17 million from over 16,800 investors during Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens now at $0.035 and already over 60% sold out. Its next-generation lending and borrowing protocol, launching on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, features liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, with ETH and USDT support for efficient and scalable financial operations. Dynamic Loan-to-Value ratios, adaptive liquidation factors, and reserve multipliers offer further system security and robustness. As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its October rally, MUTM offers investors an asymmetric growth opportunity backed by real utility and reasonable DeFi offerings.

The price increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. Husky Inu’s next price increase will take the value of the HINU token to $0.00021423. Husky Inu (HINU) Completes Move To $0.00021360 Husky Inu (HINU) completed the latest price jump of its per-launch phase late on Monday, rising from $0.00021298 to $0.00021460. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, and has seen regular price increases. It aims to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. $900,000 Milestone Reached Husky Inu (HINU) finally crossed the $900,000 milestone over the weekend and has raised $901,861 so far. The project struggled to raise funds in recent weeks as the cryptocurrency market faced substantial selling pressure and volatility in September. As a result, fundraising slowed down, with investors adopting a wait-and-watch approach. However, markets picked up as momentum shifted to bullish. As a result, the pace of fundraising rose and the project finally crossed the $900,000 milestone. Husky Inu adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, increasing the value of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to its dynamic strategy, Husky Inu has raised $881,570 so far, and could reach $900,000 before the end of the month. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25.

According to on-chain data, Buterin has been allocated 6.29 million STRK tokens. The total value of these tokens is estimated at approximately $1.01 million. Vitalik Buterin Receives 6.29 Million STRK Tokens Worth $1.01 Million The Starknet ecosystem is known as a Layer-2 scaling solution built on Ethereum, and its developer team, StarkWare, previously confirmed that Buterin was one of its early investors. Vitalik Buterin individually participated in StarkWare's $6 million seed investment round in January 2018. Analysts believe Buterin's token allocation is part of a plan to unlock Starknet. Interestingly, Buterin deposited the STRK tokens he acquired last year onto the Binance exchange shortly thereafter. This situation was interpreted by analysts as “possible preparation for sale,” but Buterin did not make any statement on the subject. It remains to be seen whether the newly allocated STRKs will be transferred to the exchange in a similar manner. Market observers believe this development could exert short-term selling pressure on the Starknet token price. *This is not investment advice.

After a period of steady growth, Binance Coin (BNB) has displaced XRP to become the third-largest digital asset by market capitalization. The new ranking was highlighted in a post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X, who shared a market screenshot of BNB flipping XRP, and described it as a huge milestone. The image showed BNB priced at $1,328.63 with a 7.71% gain over 24 hours and a 31.65% increase over seven days. XRP, by contrast, stood at $2.98 with a 0.71% decline in the previous day and a 4.49% gain over the week. BNB’s market capitalization reached $184.9 billion, narrowly surpassing XRP’s $178.5 billion. While the difference is modest, the shift marks a significant moment for both digital assets and their communities. $BNB has officially overtaken $XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This is a huge milestone. HODL! pic.twitter.com/7W4G4GxQWf — Ali (@ali_charts) October 7, 2025 Historical Context of XRP’s Position At the time of Martinez’s post, XRP was the fourth-largest asset. However, it has since lost this position to USDT. It is currently trading at $2.85 and 5th on the ranking log. The drop to fifth place is notable considering its past resilience in the market. The token has maintained a consistent presence in the top four assets for almost two years. It remained the third-largest asset for much of that period, occasionally falling behind USDT during sharp market corrections. In early 2025, XRP outperformed Ethereum for five consecutive months , fueling optimism among investors who speculated it could soon rise to second place . That momentum has since cooled, and the decline reflects a broader adjustment in investor confidence as traders evaluate the sustainability of the token’s previous gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Investor Reaction and Market Outlook Market participants are watching closely to see whether BNB can maintain its new position. The token’s recent performance suggests a combination of strong trading volume and renewed investor interest. Its consistent weekly growth contrasts with XRP’s slower recovery pace, hinting at differing market sentiment toward each project. However, many analysts are bullish on XRP, anticipating a massive breakout in the short term . While rankings fluctuate in the cryptocurrency market, the latest data suggests a decisive shift in investor preference. BNB’s climb to third place shows its current strength in market capitalization and trading activity. For XRP holders, the recent downturn poses new challenges as the asset seeks to reclaim its previous standing. With multiple bullish factors converging in October , BNB might not maintain its place above XRP for much longer.

In a press statement shared with Cryptopolitan on Thursday, Binance announced that the initiative, going live later today, was developed in partnership with Four.Meme, a meme token-based launch platform on the Binance Chain According to the crypto exchange, the new feature gives verified Binance Wallet (Keyless) users early and structured access to memecoin launches. Users will be able to purchase these tokens during their initial stages through the Binance Wallet app or web interface in what the company describes as a “transparent and fair participation process.” Binance wallet feature has structured stage token cycle Binance wallet will use Four.Meme’s existing token launch mechanics to provide access to the platform’s KYC-verified user base. All transactions will be conducted by verified individuals to reduce the risk of bot trading. The Meme Rush program has a three-stage lifecycle for tokens, including the “New Stage,” where Binance Wallet holders can purchase non-transferable tokens based on a bonding curve model, prices and supply supported by a virtual liquidity pool. In the “Finalizing Stage,” users continue to buy tokens under the same conditions, preparing for migration while they are still non-transferable. Once a project reaches key milestones, it moves to the “Migrated Stage,” where tokens are now transferable, liquidity is moved to a decentralized exchange , and public trading begins. During this final stage, the tokens also appear on the Binance Migrated Tokens Ranking, where holders can see their performance metrics. High-performing tokens may later be considered for listing on Binance Alpha, though such decisions are made solely at Binance’s discretion. Binance Wallet’s Meme Rush is a first-in-market solution Winson Liu, Global Lead of Binance Wallet, said the feature “reflects the company’s commitment to creating equitable access for users to participate in Web3.” “We are innovating a first-in-market solution for our users to engage with meme tokens early on and in a transparent and well-structured way. This means launching to a real and verified audience, helping build a token’s credibility and trust from the start,” Liu remarked in a press briefing. Projects launching through Meme Rush can only do so via the Four.Meme page, with Binance noting that it may seek more partners to expand its offerings in the future. The company does not guarantee the performance or success of any digital asset accessible through Meme Rush, and, so it is asking users to “conduct their own research” before investing. Binance added that tokens launched through the program may generate “4x Alpha trading volume” during the Meme Rush stages and for 30 days after being listed on Binance Alpha, should they qualify. However, this only applies to trades made via Binance Wallet (Keyless). Interested Binance Wallet owners can access Meme Rush through the “Markets” tab in the Binance Wallet app or web version, under the “Meme Rush – Binance Exclusive” section. All transactions are subject to trading fees, and that all projects must comply with its content policies and guidelines. The company clarified that availability of a token on Meme Rush is not an endorsement or financial advice. “Digital assets featured in Meme Rush and Binance Exclusive are highly speculative and extremely volatile,” the company wrote in its release.

The new investment product builds on the dollar-cost averaging approach – a strategy where investors buy a fixed amount of bitcoin at regular intervals to smooth out volatility – with an added twist that allows users to borrow up to five times their contribution. The platform automates both the purchases and the lending process, using deposited euros or crypto as collateral, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk. Neverless’s CEO, Phuc To (who was also the former global head of product at Revolut), said the tool is designed to provide ordinary investors with access to the same kind of credit-fueled wealth-building mechanisms that have long been available to institutions and high-net-worth individuals. “Institutions can raise capital and banks give wealthy people loans to buy assets that actually grow. And what do ordinary people get? Credit cards that put us in debt. Neverless gives you financing power to own a piece of the century’s best performing asset for yourself — and build wealth the way rich people do,” Phuc To said in a statement. Founded in 2022, Neverless already allows users to trade more than 500 cryptocurrencies with no fees and offers access to DeFi assets typically out of reach for retail investors. Since securing $6.7 million in seed funding and a MiFID license last year, the company has grown to 50,000 users and processed over $1 billion in trading volume.",Finance|CoinDesk Wealth|Revolut|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-09 07:43:55

Block Street’s pitch is that trading tokenized stocks should feel as fast and reliable as traditional markets. Its system, called Aqua, is built on Monad, and uses a request-for-quote (RFQ) model where market makers compete to offer the best price. These quotes are cryptographically signed and verified onchain to prevent manipulation or delays. Another part of the stack, Everst, introduces lending and liquidation tools designed specifically for tokenized equities, allowing users to borrow, short, or hedge these assets. The company says this setup reduces “MEV leakage” and makes tokenized assets more functional, not just speculative. “Our mandate is infra, not just an app,” said Hedy Wang, co-founder of Block Street. “Monad’s parallel EVM gives us the settlement guarantees and latency budget institutions expect, while Aqua and Everst push best-execution and equity-native risk controls directly on-chain.” Block Street plans to go live on Monad later this year, expanding to Ethereum, BNB Chain and Base as integrations mature. The team, which includes veterans from Citadel, Point72 and Google, plans to publish transparency dashboards showing how much better their execution is compared to automated market-makers.

He said the significant AI partnerships represent actual infrastructure expansion rather than Big Tech money that has been recycled. Intrator dismissed concerns that the company’s partnerships with other major players in artificial intelligence are circular investments, claiming that this line of reasoning is “fundamentally flawed.” CoreWeave expands AI infrastructure amid circular investment claims Intrator said that major firms, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, are investing in infrastructure to meet increasing customer demand. CoreWeave CEO also emphasized that these expenditures are driven by real market demands rather than circular financial activity. Wall Street analysts are concerned that the agreements are too circular. Intrator responded that the agreements represent a “fundamental infrastructure buildout.” He added that this dynamic occurs in other markets and that “it is not unusual to see partnerships as people try to serve infrastructure to the consumers” during such a massive infrastructure buildout. “This narrative around the circular investment — you know, it’s … of the day, but it will pass,” “Because the fundamental drivers in the market are enormous.” ~ Michael Intrator , Co-founder and CEO of CoreWeave On March 27, CoreWeave reported that it had raised $1.5 billion to go public, making it the largest U.S. tech IPO since 2021. Since CoreWeave’s Wall Street debut, the company’s stock has increased by more than 200%, driven by robust investor demand for AI and data center expansion. On September 25, CoreWeave announced a $6.5 billion expansion of its current agreement with OpenAI , bringing its total contracts with the company to $22.4 billion. A few days later, CoreWeave and Meta inked a $14.2 billion agreement. CoreWeave and Nvidia announced a $6.3 billion order earlier in September. CoreWeave strengthens market position with new tools and acquisitions NASDAQ: CRWV increased 8.7% on Wednesday as the artificial intelligence cloud provider announced new tools to help programmers develop AI agents. The announcement follows its $1 billion acquisition of Weights & Biases, a firm that provides developers with AI model training and evaluation software, which was completed five months prior. The agreement aimed to supplement CoreWeave’s current business model, which involves renting out Nvidia graphics processing units to businesses that require infrastructure. The tech firm confirmed that with the new serverless reinforcement learning service, there is no need to worry about increasing or deleting processing resources. Tests showed that developers could train models quickly and at 40% less expense by using CoreWeave’s new service instead of operating Nvidia H100 graphics processing units locally, “with no impact on model quality.” “Being fast to market is critical, and equally important is the elegance and ease of use we are now giving AI pioneers across labs, enterprises, and startups to fine-tune large language models and build AI agents with confidence.” ~ Peter Salanki , Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of CoreWeave Salanki also stated that CoreWeave is distinguishing itself from its competitors by integrating infrastructure, reinforcement learning frameworks, and developer tools to enable businesses of all sizes to harness the full potential of AI agents. CoreWeave reported that Serverless RL is already generating significant interest from clients, including Fortune 500 companies and AI-native businesses. The tech firm added that Serverless RL will be utilized by SquadStack.ai, an AI-powered contact center platform that delivers highly customized experiences for top consumer brands, to enhance customer engagement. QA Wolf, a hybrid platform that helps tech teams produce better software more quickly, will also utilize the Serverless RL. According to Intrator, companies have been rushing to secure GPUs to implement AI projects in the cloud. He added that CoreWeave competes with leading providers such as Amazon Web Services. Intrator claimed that some companies may prefer to keep GPUs in their own data centers.

These Three Indicators Suggest More Room For Bitcoin According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, fresh data from Binance suggests that BTC is witnessing one of its most significant buying phases since mid-year. Notably, BTC’s price has surged from around $117,000 to $124,000 since the beginning of October. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s On-Chain Roadmap Shows $111,000 – $143,000 As The Range To Watch Arab Chain emphasized three key indicators that suggest the return of whales into the Bitcoin market. First, the net buying pressure (vol_delta) surged past $500 million on some days, indicating that buying pressure outweighed selling pressure from this amount. Similarly, the imbalance ratio (imbalance_pct) recently hit a high of 0.23, suggesting that BTC buy orders on Binance were roughly 23% higher than sell orders. Higher buy orders than sell orders usually indicate strong demand and potential upward pressure on the asset’s price. Finally, the Z-score recorded a value of 0.79, reflecting above-average buying activity. For the uninitiated, a Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. The CryptoQuant analyst remarked that these indicators confirm that institutional buyers and whales have returned to the Bitcoin market in force. Arab Chain added: This activity coincides with a clear increase in daily trading volumes, which have reached their highest levels since last July, suggesting that the rally is being supported by real liquidity rather than temporary speculation. Recent trading sessions have shown a few of these indicators – especially vol_delta – slightly declining in value, and temporarily moving to negative territory. That said, the broader indicators still favor a continued upward trend for the top cryptocurrency. Notably, the average daily volatility has remained low, confirming strong market confidence and stable demand. This is in stark contrast to the market behavior shown in September, when BTC was struggling in the $100,000 range. To conclude, both technical and behavioral indicators support BTC’s continued rise to $125,000 – $130,000 in the near term. Unless a strong wave of sell-off emerges, any price correction should be viewed as an opportunity to accumulate BTC, Arab Chain noted. What’s Next For BTC? While it is typically a challenge to predict BTC’s future, some analysts are not shying away from giving predictions about the flagship digital asset’s upcoming price trajectory. For instance, BTC’s pricing bands suggest a move toward $140,000 is likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Falls To Lowest Level Since April 2024 — What This Means For Price Similarly, rapidly dwindling BTC reserves on crypto exchanges may propel the cryptocurrency’s price to even greater highs, potentially to $150,000 and beyond.

The move brings together PayPay’s 70 million users and its widespread merchant network with Binance’s blockchain infrastructure, integrating PayPay Money, a smartphone-based digital wallet, into Binance Japan to allow users to buy crypto and withdraw funds through the wallet.

Their communities believe that holding early could lead to 100x returns later. Analysts suggest that Remittix (RTX) might also join that club. Remittix is the newcomer that has the narrative, metrics, and momentum to challenge Pepe and Shiba Inu in the race for legendary gains. Pepe’s Legacy Grows as Whales Accumulate Pepe (PEPE) continues making the headlines with social volume and volatility. Although its price retraced around 5% over the last 24 hours, whales have increased their holdings by 4.28% over the last 30 days, as a clear bullish indication. Exchange reserves dropped by 2.15%, indicating less selling pressure on exchanges. However, PEPE still trades about 48% below its previous highs, leaving room for recovery. Shiba Inu Maintains Strength but Faces a Steeper Climb Shiba Inu (SHIB) still has a significant community and ecosystem activity level. Large holders keep acquiring SHIB, meaning that there is a lower level of sell pressure. The SHIB team fixed a recent hack, restoring bridges and increasing confidence. Still, SHIB’s price is modest and volatile; it may not deliver 100x gains on its maturity alone. SHIB remains strong in community and name recognition, but its path to 100x is steeper. Remittix Emerges as a Strong 100x Contender When set against Pepe and Shiba Inu, Remittix merges utility and hype, giving it a more robust 100x play opportunity. Remittix offers a structural base, real payments integration, verified security, and community incentives that can sustain growth beyond mere hype. For early investors, Remittix offers more levers to deliver 100x returns than purely viral tokens. Remittix already checks multiple boxes that many emerging tokens lack. The Remittix team is certified by CertiK, and the project holds the #1 pre-launch rank on CertiK’s Skynet portal. The beta wallet is in active testing by community members. The 15% USDT referral program gives users instant earning potential daily via the dashboard. A $250,000 giveaway boosts participation. Remittix secured CEX listings by raising past $20 million (BitMart) and $22 million (LBank), with a third listing underway. Remittix has sold over 676 million tokens, at $0.113 each, and has raised over $27.2 million. Here are highlights that Could Make Remittix Join the 100x Hall of Fame: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency One of the few projects with product progress before TGE Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd Seize the Next 100x Opportunity: Get In Early on Remittix Pepe and Shiba Inu have already written chapters in crypto folklore. Yet as markets mature, those narratives alone may not carry the next wave of 100x winners. Remittix, combining both narrative and utility, positions itself to join those ranks for early investors. If execution matches promise, Remittix could end up side by side with Pepe and SHIB when history recounts the greatest crypto gainers.

According to data from Coinglass , Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) bore the brunt of the wipeout, facing $155 million and $180 million in liquidations respectively, while altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), and BNB also saw heavy losses. The total crypto market capitalization fell 1.9% to $4.18 trillion, with trading volumes rising to $240 billion, a sign that forced selling and defensive repositioning dominated the session. The Fear & Greed Index dropped from 62 to a neutral 55, reflecting fading risk appetite after weeks of aggressive buying. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Face Technical Breakdown Bitcoin dropped 1.4% to $122,400 after failing to hold its record high above $126,000, triggering a wave of automated selling as exchange inflows surged past $5.7 billion. Analysts point to a cooling RSI and rejection near upper Bollinger Bands as signs that short-term momentum has weakened. Ethereum fell nearly 4.5% to around $4,450, its largest daily drop in over a month, as traders rotated capital back into Bitcoin ETFs and stop-loss orders accelerated the decline. XRP, meanwhile, tumbled 3.5%, slipping below key support at $2.90, with Coinglass reporting a 4,300% spike in liquidation imbalance, a clear sign that overleveraged longs were flushed out. Despite the selloff, technical analysts suggest the pullback may serve as a leverage reset, setting the stage for more sustainable upside later this month. With Bitcoin’s RSI nearing 42 and Ethereum hovering around oversold zones, some traders are eyeing the $118K–$121K BTC region and $4,200 ETH level as potential reaccumulation zones. ETF Outflows and Macro Pressure Add Fuel to the Decline Market data shows Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF recorded $28.6 million in net outflows, snapping its prior streak of inflows and contributing to bearish sentiment. Simultaneously, perpetual futures volume surged 22% to $540 trillion, showing heightened volatility and defensive positioning. Adding to the macro headwinds, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) hit a two-month high, and 10-year Treasury yields hovered around 4.13%, tightening financial conditions just ahead of the FOMC minutes release. These factors reinforced the shift toward risk-off positioning across both traditional and crypto markets. With more than $640 million liquidated, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have entered a crucial technical zone. If buyers fail to defend near-term supports, the selloff could deepen, but a bounce from these levels could mark the start of a new accumulation phase heading into late October.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-dont-lose-your-bags-heres-why/,"The news of Ripple CTO David Schwartz stepping back from his active role has left parts of the XRP community unsettled. For some, it raised concerns about the company’s direction and the token’s future. However, crypto analyst Ripple Van Winkle believes the development should be viewed differently. In a recent video, he suggested that Schwartz’s move is not a warning sign, but rather an indication that XRP is entering a new phase—one where institutional adoption begins to take center stage. #XRP HOLDERS DONT LOSE YOUR BAGS !!! pic.twitter.com/ObNMePmTme — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 6, 2025 From Builders to Institutions Van Winkle drew a comparison between Schwartz’s decision and Satoshi Nakamoto’s disappearance once Bitcoin had gained unstoppable momentum. He stated that “builders leave when the foundation is finished,” implying that XRP may have reached a point where its underlying infrastructure no longer needs constant building. According to his analysis, the technology is already mature enough to scale globally, and this is where major financial institutions are expected to step in. He pointed to the lineup for this year’s Ripple Swell conference , which, for the first time, will feature some of the largest asset management firms in the world. Among them are BlackRock , VanEck, and Fidelity — institutions with trillions of dollars in combined assets. Van Winkle argued that this level of participation from traditional finance is far from a sign of weakness. Instead, he called it a “handoff,” where the original builders make way for major players who can integrate the technology into global financial systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Strategic Transition Schwartz’s departure from daily operations has naturally fueled speculation, but Ripple has clarified that he will continue to serve in an advisory capacity. This shift, according to observers, aligns with Ripple’s ongoing evolution from a company focused on development to one focused on global partnerships and implementation. Van Winkle’s perspective reinforces this notion — suggesting that the XRP Ledger’s maturity now allows it to be scaled by institutions, not just innovators. The timing also aligns with Ripple’s broader institutional engagement. Recent reports indicate a growing collaboration between Ripple and established financial entities, with a focus on exploring tokenized assets and liquidity solutions. Analysts view the participation of BlackRock and Fidelity at Swell as part of this larger move toward bridging traditional finance with blockchain-based settlement systems. The Message to XRP Holders Van Winkle’s message to XRP holders was clear: do not lose confidence. His comments suggested that what some perceive as uncertainty may in fact mark the beginning of a critical transition point. The idea is that XRP no longer requires constant technical innovation from its original architects, but institutional integration from those capable of global deployment.

The initiative expands on efforts dating back to 2018 through the Privacy and Scaling Explorations team , which has built over 50 open-source research projects and released key primitives, including Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, and zkEmail. The Ethereum Foundation is committed to working alongside the ecosystem to make privacy a priority. Privacy is normal. Privacy is for everyone. https://t.co/xwBT5WvwhJ — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 8, 2025 Five-Track Strategy Targets Surveillance Vulnerabilities The cluster unites top researchers, engineers, and cryptographers to tackle five key areas. These areas include private reads and writes for seamless payments and interactions without surveillance, private proving for portable verification, private identities through selective disclosure, privacy experience improvements, and institutional adoption through a dedicated task force. The foundation is also developing Kohaku, a privacy-preserving wallet and open-source SDK designed to make strong cryptography accessible for mainstream users. The move follows a September rebrand of the Privacy and Scaling Explorations team to Privacy Stewards for Ethereum , which shifted focus from cryptography exploration to problem-first solutions addressing surveillance vulnerabilities. That transformation introduced a roadmap warning that without robust privacy protections, Ethereum risks becoming “ the backbone of global surveillance rather than global freedom .” The team emphasized that institutions and users would migrate elsewhere if private transactions, identity, and data remain compromised by public blockchain transparency. Ethereum Foundation's @PrivacyEthereum rebrands as PSE with a roadmap making privacy the default across the technical stack to prevent surveillance risks. #Ethereum #Privacy https://t.co/opTQ6LQaOc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 14, 2025 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin laid the philosophical groundwork for this expansion in April when he published “ Why I Support Privacy ,” urging the Web3 community to treat privacy as essential to decentralization amid growing concerns over AI-driven surveillance and data misuse. Buterin argued that information is power, and when centralized, it risks distorting democratic balance. Just days before then, he released an accompanying roadmap on April 11 outlining four areas for enhancing privacy, including anonymous payments, application-level privacy, secure data access, and network obfuscation. From Philosophy to Protocol Implementation Buterin’s roadmap called for Ethereum wallets to integrate tools like Railgun and Privacy Pools to create “ shielded balances ” enabling private-by-default transactions. He advocated generating unique addresses per dApp to eliminate traceable links between applications while supporting standards like FOCIL and EIP-7701 to reduce reliance on public transaction relays. The proposal offered a structured path requiring minimal changes to Ethereum’s Layer-1 consensus, promising near-term benefits without overhauling the network’s core. The urgency also stems from warnings by industry veterans like Petro Golovko of British Gold Trust, who argued in an August interview with Cryptonews that public blockchains expose salaries, business deals, and balance sheets, making crypto “ unusable for regular people and impossible for institutions .” Golovko compared current blockchain transparency to the pre-SSL internet when users refused to enter credit card numbers due to a lack of encryption, maintaining that crypto remains stuck in this vulnerable phase. European regulatory pressure adds another layer of urgency. In June, Ethereum community member Eugenio Reggianini outlined GDPR compliance practices requiring personal data to remain off-chain, with blockchain nodes relaying only encrypted references or proofs rather than identifiable information. The proposal called for assigning data controller status to front-end actors like wallets and dApps while lower-layer infrastructure processes only anonymized data. Building the Infrastructure for Mass Adoption The Institutional Privacy Task Force, launched in collaboration with the EF EcoDev Enterprise team, specifically targets adoption blockers by translating regulatory and operational requirements into privacy specifications and proof-of-concepts across real-world assets, funds, payments, trading, and compliance. This addresses concerns that no board will approve systems exposing supply chains or financial operations globally, limiting crypto to speculation rather than serious commerce. Projects are already implementing advanced solutions. Aster , a multi-chain decentralized exchange, uses zero-knowledge proofs to separate order intent from execution, keeping trade details confidential while ensuring settlement transparency. Perp DEXs hit $1 trillion monthly volume for the first time as Aster and Hyperliquid lead a surge challenging centralized exchange dominance. #Perps #Dexs https://t.co/rDhsLASOLf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 2, 2025 The platform employs a multi-node order book to prevent front-running and MEV attacks, enabling fast self-custodial trading with privacy at the core. The foundation’s commitment extends across the full stack from cutting-edge cryptography and institutional pilots to everyday user experience, aiming to complement the hundreds of privacy projects already operating across the crypto ecosystem. PSE continues as a team focused on early research and development under Andy’s leadership, while new privacy-related projects form under the expanded cluster structure. The foundation emphasized that privacy deserves to be a “ first-class property ” of the Ethereum ecosystem for individuals and institutions alike.

Open account → Bitcoin supply crunch is underway as institutional buying through spot ETFs far outstrips new issuance, creating sustained scarcity and upward price pressure. Institutions bought ~944,000 BTC in 2025 while miners produced ~127,000 BTC, making ETF demand a dominant driver of market liquidity and allocation decisions. Institutional demand exceeds new issuance: Spot ETF inflows of $5–$10B per quarter are creating predictable, large-scale buying. Bitwise data: institutions acquired ~944,000 BTC vs ~127,000 BTC mined in 2025. Bitcoin supply crunch: Institutional buying via spot ETFs outpaces new issuance—learn how this scarcity affects price action and institutional allocation. Read now. What is the Bitcoin supply crunch? Bitcoin supply crunch refers to a market condition where institutional demand for BTC, especially via spot ETFs, outpaces new Bitcoin issuance. This creates persistent scarcity, shifts price drivers toward allocation flows, and reduces the influence of retail-driven volatility. How are spot ETFs driving institutional buying? Spot ETFs provide regulated access, transparent pricing, and settlement infrastructure that large allocators trust. Quarterly inflows of $5–$10 billion via these vehicles create steady, predictable purchases. According to Bitwise and industry commentary, institutions bought roughly 944,000 BTC in 2025 while miners produced about 127,000 BTC, a roughly 7:1 ratio. Why does this matter for Bitcoin’s halving cycle? Halving reduces miner issuance, but ETF-driven demand can overwhelm that supply signal. When institutional accumulation becomes the dominant flow, halving timing matters less for short-term liquidity because capital entering through ETFs is both predictable and substantial. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Faces Historic Supply Crunch as Institutional Buying Accelerates"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin supply crunch: Institutional buying via spot ETFs outpaces new issuance, creating sustained scarcity and reshaping price drivers.

Institutions have acquired roughly 944,000 BTC in 2025, while miners produced about 127,000 BTC during the same period. That gap—approximately seven times new issuance—creates a structural imbalance that can compress available liquidity and support higher prices if inflows continue. What mainstream firms and experts say Industry voices note a lasting shift. Bitwise CTO Hong Kim described ETF inflows as arriving “like clockwork,” characterizing this phase as an institutional revolution. Major asset managers adopting spot Bitcoin ETFs have reframed Bitcoin as a strategic allocation rather than purely speculative exposure. Frequently Asked Questions How do spot ETFs change Bitcoin custody and circulation? Spot ETFs typically hold bitcoin in custodial wallets, removing coins from liquid trading pools. This reduces supply available on exchanges and can increase scarcity if ETFs accumulate over time. Can retail investors still drive large price moves? Retail remains influential in short bursts, but predictable, large-scale institutional flows tend to dominate sustained directional moves because of their size and regulatory channels. Key Takeaways Supply-demand mismatch : Institutional purchases (~944k BTC) far exceed miner issuance (~127k BTC) in 2025. Spot ETFs as demand engine : ETFs provide predictable inflows ($5–$10B quarterly) that institutionalize Bitcoin allocation. Market structure shift : Allocation by pensions, asset managers, and corporates is making scarcity a structural feature. Conclusion Bitcoin’s supply crunch, driven by relentless institutional buying through spot ETFs, marks a structural change in market dynamics. With demand outpacing issuance, allocation decisions from large funds will increasingly shape price action. Monitor ETF inflows, custodial balances, and miner issuance to gauge ongoing scarcity and policy impacts.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase has launched in-app DEX trading for US users (excluding New York). Trading begins with Base-native assets from projects like Virtuals AI, Reserve Protocol, and SoSo Value. The rollout follows Coinbase’s integration with 1inch, enabling direct non-custodial swaps. The feature, which allows users to trade tokens before they’re formally listed on Coinbase, was first introduced to select users in August. The full rollout was confirmed Wednesday in a company blog post and on X , with Coinbase touting access to “millions of assets, moments after they launch.” Coinbase DEX Debuts With Base-Native Tokens At launch, trading will focus on Base-native tokens, including assets from projects such as Virtuals AI Agents, Reserve Protocol DTFs, SoSo Value Indices, Auki Labs, and Super Champs. The integration positions Coinbase’s in-app DEX as a bridge between centralized and decentralized finance, leveraging its Base network to streamline token discovery and execution. The timing comes as Coinbase seeks to offset declining exchange activity. The company reported $237 billion in trading volume in Q2 2025, down slightly from $226 billion a year earlier. Check your phone – the wait is over. Explore millions of assets, moments after they launch, right from the Coinbase app. DEX trading is live for all U.S. users (ex. NY). Coming soon: more assets, more networks, more countries. pic.twitter.com/XryNvDXkdL — Coinbase (@coinbase) October 8, 2025 Earlier this month, 1inch, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, integrated its Swap API into the Coinbase app, marking the DEX aggregator’s most significant US client to date. Coinbase recently rolled out its DEX feature, allowing customers to engage with onchain assets through a self-custodial wallet built into the app. By deploying the 1inch Swap API, Coinbase said it provides users with direct non-custodial token swaps, lowering barriers to DeFi while expanding access to liquidity. “This integration with 1inch is a significant step forward in bringing onchain trading to our users,” said Scott Shapiro, head of trading at Coinbase. “Together we’re enabling seamless access to DEXes within the Coinbase app, which will bring millions of our users onchain.” Perp DEX Volumes Hit $1.2 Trillion as Traders Shift From Centralized Exchanges As reported, perpetual decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) have hit a record $1.226 trillion in trading volume over the past 30 days, according to DeFiLlama, marking the first time the sector has crossed the trillion-dollar threshold. The surge represents a 48% increase from August’s $707.6 billion, signaling accelerating demand for decentralized derivatives trading. The rally was led by Aster DEX, which captured nearly half the market with $493.6 billion in volume, followed by Hyperliquid, which generated more than $280 billion. Other notable contributors include Lighter DEX, EdgeX, Pacifica, and Bybit’s Apex Protocol, together accounting for over $280 billion in additional trading activity. New entrants are also gaining traction, with SunPerp, the first perpetual DEX on TRON, reaching $30 million in total value locked soon after launch, while Lighter DEX on Ethereum Layer 2 drew $164 billion in activity despite still being in beta. The growing popularity of perp DEXs underscores traders’ shift from centralized exchanges to decentralized platforms offering transparency, self-custody, and 24/7 global access.

Altcoin Market Booms Binance Coin's price has climbed by 30% in the past week, overtaking XRP in market value and reaching consecutive all-time highs since the beginning of the month, currently peaking at $1,330. According to CoinGecko data , Solana and Dogecoin experienced moderate increases of 10% in contrast to BNB's growth within the same period. Both cryptocurrencies exhibit a significant disparity between their current trading prices and their all-time highs of 24% and 60%, respectively. The native token of the PayDax Protocol, PDP, is now in the initial phase of its token presale and has emerged as a safe haven for investors looking for the top altcoins to buy today. Why PayDax Leads The Pack Among The Top Altcoins To Buy PDP presents a unique perspective aimed at addressing enduring challenges in the banking sector by seeking solutions for the unbanked and tackling ongoing barriers that have defied traditional sectors for decades. As a result, PayDax's roadmap has received significant institutional backing, including increased funding from venture capitalists (VCs) and a growing user base of over 10,000 investors from 20 countries. The current value of the PDP token, which is priced at a huge discount of $0.015 per token, offers the potential for massive gains. PDP's Edge Over BNB, SOL, And DOGE While the future outlook for BNB, SOL, and DOGE remains positive, experts anticipate additional growth potential with the approval of their respective exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this ""Uptober."" However, the most bullish estimates point to even higher price increases in the coming years for these top altcoins to buy, with growing demand and accessibility to a broader investor base, likely leading to gains of 5,000%. PDP emerges as the premier selection due to its unique capabilities. PayDax enables users to secure loans against crypto and tap into the growing tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) sector, with customizable loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and appealing returns through multiple choices, including peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, staking, and leveraged yield farming. PayDax's Pillars Of Trust The protocol's focus on openness, coupled with partnerships with prominent firms like Brinks, Sotheby's, and Chainlink (LINK), enhances its credibility in the DeFi sector, supported by security audits by Assure DeFi for its smart contracts. PayDax distinguishes itself from other DeFi protocols by promoting visibility and responsibility with a fully disclosed executive team, regular communication channels such as AMAs and podcasts, and a clear vision. Experts Predict Explosive Returns The integration of lending, borrowing, and decentralized insurance in a secure, on-chain ecosystem sets PayDax apart as a pioneer in DeFi. Positioned as one of the top altcoins to buy, PDP not only offers a refuge from market volatility but also provides a comprehensive ecosystem with a roadmap designed to attract increasing support at every stage. Although DOGE and SOL prices require substantial market capitalization expansion to realize a 5,000% increase, PDP's growth framework is predicated on implied utility. PayDax's demand mechanism, fueled by loans, staking, and governance rights, enables PDP to potentially surpass rival top altcoins to buy for long-term investment Experts now forecast a near-term return potential of 1,000% and 5,000% upon exchange listing, and growing demand.

Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/bitcoin-btc-final-pullback-before-a-major-rally-price-analysis,"After making its all-time high on Monday the Bitcoin price has lost trend and is making its way lower. Could this be the last chance to buy before a potential major rally that takes Bitcoin into new price territory? A further fall for the Bitcoin price? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for the $BTC price shows how the price dipped below the short-term local uptrend and is now possibly making its way lower. The 0.236 Fibonacci, which is the most shallow of the Fibonacci retracements, has held the price up to now. However, there are signs that the price could start to make its way down to one of the lower Fibonacci levels. Chief among these signs is bearish divergence. This is on the short-term time frame so it is not as reliable as for higher time frames, but it can be clearly seen that the price action was rising while the Stochastic RSI indicators and the RSI indicator were falling. This is likely to pull the price down lower if it plays out. The question then is to which Fibonacci level could the price fall? For the price to stay at the 0.236 Fibonacci is probably not enough of a pullback, so the 0.382 Fibonacci would be a bear target at the very least. The 0.5 Fibonacci looks more likely as it has stronger support, although the 0.618 Fibonacci is the golden level and would be the healthiest retracement of them all. Could the price get all the way back down to these levels given the very positive market sentiment for Bitcoin currently? Yes, it’s entirely possible, and it would also help the daily Stochastic RSI indicators to reset, which could eventually signal the strong upside price momentum that could take Bitcoin to a new high. Bitcoin bullish pattern continues to develop Source: TradingView The daily chart for the $BTC price illustrates that an inverse head and shoulders pattern is still taking shape. It just remains for the price to come down further in order to form the right shoulder. If this takes place, the price would then have to return to the multi-year ascending trendline, break through and confirm above, for the pattern to be validated and the measured move to $145,000 to start developing. The support level on the chart equates to the 0.5 Fibonacci in the previous chart. It can be seen that this is a good level of support which may attract the price to it. The indicator lines in the Stochastic RSI need to keep dropping, while the indicator line in the RSI looks as though it might come down to test the descending trendline. A great setup for an eventual bounce and rally is developing nicely. Bitcoin price tapping on 8-year trendline Source: TradingView The weekly chart for the $BTC price reveals the possibility of an epic breakout of an 8-year trendline that up till now has not even had a candle wick pass beyond it. Higher highs and higher lows mean that the price is starting to beat against the trendline. The more taps on a pane of glass, the more likely it is to eventually break, and this is the likely scenario here. Below, the Stochastic RSI indicators are angled up perfectly, signalling very strong upside price momentum, while the MACD at the bottom of the chart has the blue indicator line posturing to cross above the red signal line. At the same time, the red and pink bars in the histogram look as though they are about to give way to bullish green bars. Last chance to buy? The scene is set. Is this the last chance for investors to buy Bitcoin before a massive rally that will potentially take the king of the cryptocurrencies to $200,000 and possibly beyond?

These coins are not just digital assets; they represent innovations in the financial technology sector with potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. The Rising Stars of Crypto: What Makes Them Stand Out Binance Coin has recently overtaken XRP in market cap, achieving record prices and showcasing a robust growth trajectory. This growth is closely followed by Solana and Dogecoin, both of which have also posted significant gains. Solana, known for its fast transaction speeds, and Dogecoin, popularized by high-profile endorsements, have each carved out their niches in the crowded cryptocurrency market. However, it's PayDax Protocol that is currently attracting attention with its presale phase. PDP token is positioned uniquely, focusing on providing financial solutions to the unbanked, a pressing issue that many regions face today. Breaking Down PayDax's Strategic Advantage Unlike its peers, PayDax Protocol leverages DeFi to offer more than just a digital currency. It facilitates loans, supports peer-to-peer lending, staking, and yield farming—all underpinned by a secure, decentralized framework. This approach not only broadens its use case but also enhances its appeal to a diverse group of investors. The strategic partnerships and collaborations, such as those with Brinks and Sotheby's, further validate PayDax's market position and hint at a robust protocol governance model. Furthermore, security audits by Assure DeFi, as detailed in the security audit report , provide an additional layer of trust and reliability, essential for any financial platform. Projected Market Performance and Growth Potential While BNB, SOL, and DOGE all show promising futures, the potential for a 5,000% increase in value as suggested by experts seems more feasible for PDP due to its foundational utility and growing user base. The current presale phase offers the PDP at a substantially lowered rate, making this an opportune moment for early adopters to invest. To further sweeten the deal, a promotional code PD25BONUS grants an additional 25% bonus on purchases. For those keen on joining the PayDax journey and exploring its offerings, more information can be accessed through its official website , whitepaper , X (Twitter) , and Telegram .

Nearly $800 million in swaps and payments have flowed through NEAR Intents in the past 30 days, lifting cumulative totals to about $1.8 billion since the product went live earlier this year. The jump is tied to how Intents changes the user experience. Instead of bridging assets manually or confirming multiple steps across chains, a user states an outcome — “swap USDC on Ethereum for NEAR on Solana,” for example — and the protocol handles routing in the background. Data shows both asset and chain coverage widening. USDC, WETH and newer ecosystem tokens have climbed into the top slots by volume, while Ethereum, Solana and Zcash dominate on the blockchain side. Unique active users hit 113,000 over the past week, suggesting stickier flows rather than one-off incentive spikes. Orders are bundled and matched by relayers, reducing failures and compressing gas costs. That structure is starting to pull traders who want cross-chain execution without the mess of juggling multiple wallets or waiting for bridges to settle. The privacy angle is giving this wave its edge. Zashi, the mobile wallet released by the Electric Coin Company for Zcash, now runs two live features on NEAR Intents after launching earlier in October. Zashi Swaps let users convert BTC, SOL, USDC and other supported assets directly into ZEC inside the app, where they can then be shielded. CrossPay allows someone to spend shielded ZEC and have the recipient receive funds in their chosen crypto on any NEAR-supported chain. That link matters because Zcash, after years in the background, has quadrupled in price in the past month and is back in market conversation. Furthermore, Zashi’s on-ramp and off-ramp to NEAR Intents creates a cleaner user experience for everyday participants and makes private ZEC actually usable. The Zashi–Intents loop sets a template for other privacy wallets to mimic, where intents do the heavy lifting in the background while the user-facing applications handle client user demand.",Markets|Near|Zcash|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZEC|NEAR|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-09 09:16:29

Kiyosaki says buy Silver before the ‘rocket leaves earth’,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-says-buy-silver-before-the-rocket-leaves-earth/,"Robert Kiyosaki has once again put hard assets at the center of his message, this time with silver in the spotlight. Posting on X on October 9, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author wrote: “SILVER near time high. Silver is a dollar away from turning into a rocket ship. Please get a few silver coins before the silver rocket leaves the earth.” SILVER near time high. Silver is a dollar away from turning into a rocket ship. Please get a few silver coins before the silver rocket leaves the earth. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) October 9, 2025 At the time, silver was trading at $49.35, less than a dollar from the psychologically critical $50 level. A decisive break would mark fresh highs and, in Kiyosaki’s telling, confirm silver’s place alongside gold , Bitcoin ( BTC ), and Ethereum ( ETH ) as insurance against what he calls the “end of the U.S. dollar.” Silver 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold/TradingView The remark came in a week when safe-haven assets have dominated headlines. Gold crossed $4,000, Bitcoin touched a record $125,835, and Ethereum notched its own all-time high in August. Against that backdrop, silver’s rally has been the missing piece in Kiyosaki’s long-standing call to hold “real assets” over fiat. Robert Kiyosaki blasts Wall Street advisors Later in the day, he turned his attention to Wall Street. Responding to Morgan Stanley’s new 60/20/20 allocation model— 60% stocks, 20% bonds, 20% gold — Kiyosaki said the shift only confirmed what he has argued for decades: that precious metals outperform over the long run. “Finally the truth comes out. The facts are gold has outperformed stocks and bonds for years… but no one said anything.” For Kiyosaki, the formula is simpler. He lists gold and silver coins, Bitcoin, Ethereum, rental real estate, oil wells and cattle as the assets that freed him financially more than 30 years ago, and dismisses the traditional 60/40 portfolio as little more than a “magic wand.” Silver may not have cleared $50 yet, but in Kiyosaki’s framework, it doesn’t need to. The signal, as ever, is that the dollar is fading, and real assets are the hedge. Featured image via Cavaleria Com YouTube The post R.

The altcoins experienced more substantial volatility. Zcash (ZEC) posted a double-digit price increase, whereas Aster (ASTER) leads the losers’ team. BTC Calms Down It has been less than three days since the primary cryptocurrency soared to a new all-time high of over $126,000. Since then, however, the bears took charge and prevented another spike to uncharted territory. At one point yesterday (October 8), the bulls attempted to regain control and pushed the valuation to $124,000. Nonetheless, that surge was short-lived, and BTC headed south to as low as $121,500. In the past several hours, the volatility has been minor, with the asset hovering in the $121,500-$122,000 range. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko It is worth noting that Bitcoin may experience heightened turbulence later today (October 9) as a result of Jerome Powell’s speech. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve is expected to discuss the US economic outlook, focusing on inflation, growth, and the path of interest rates. Markets will closely monitor the Fed’s signals on whether it plans to cut rates further or pause, as well as how Powell assesses inflation risks and economic resilience. Any clues that the central bank is more likely to lower the benchmark could increase the interest in risk-on assets and positively impact BTC’s price. The opposite scenario may have an adverse effect, causing a short-term pullback. Bitcoin’s current market capitalization is approximately $2.42 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins remains relatively unchanged at around 56.8%. How are the Alts Doing? Several well-known altcoins have made the headlines today due to registering significant price increases. Zcash (ZEC) is the best-performing cryptocurrency from the top 100 club with a daily rise of 35%. Mantle (MNT) comes next with a gain of 9%, whereas Monero (XMR) and Ethena (ENA) have pumped by 3-4%. Aster (ASTER) stands in the opposite corner, with a 12% loss on a 24-hour scale. Pump.fun (PUMP), Cronos (CRO), OKB (OKB), Bonk (BONK), Pi Network (PI), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have also entered red territory, albeit posting less substantial losses. The total market capitalization of the crypto sector has decreased by 1.3% to $4.23 trillion.

China has also added restrictions on processing technology, preventing unauthorized overseas cooperation. According to the announcement, the government agency revealed its plans to limit exports to overseas defense and semiconductor users. The new measures by China expand sweeping controls announced in April that led to massive shortages globally before a series of deals with Europe and the U.S. resumed shipments. China leads in rare earth production Beijing accounts for more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earth products and rare earth magnets and 60% of global mine production. The country produces a group of 17 elements, which are vital materials in products from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars. The Ministry of Commerce acknowledged that restrictions on exporting the technology to produce rare earth magnets will be expanded to more types of magnets. The country is also planning to limit some components and assemblies that contain restricted magnets. China, which has the top rare earth technology and equipment used to recycle rare earths worldwide, will also require a license to export these materials. The new restrictions add to the country’s extensive list of existing processing technologies. The ministry clarified that overseas defense users will not be granted licenses moving forward. The agency added that applications related to advanced semiconductors will only be approved on a case-by-case basis. The Ministry of Commerce addressed concerns about access, stating that the scope of items in its latest round of restrictions was limited. It also confirmed that a variety of licensing facilitation measures will be adopted. “It’s the picks and shovels that worry many. Anyone that is sourcing equipment from China might not get it, which happened before, and also if you’ve got tech or equipment from China you might not get service requests answered.” ~ Wade Senti , President of Advanced Magnet Lab The announcement revealed that the ministry barred Chinese entities from working with companies overseas on rare earths without permission. According to the new rules, overseas manufacturers using any Chinese components or machinery must also apply for licenses to export controlled items. The ministry found that certain overseas organizations and individuals had been transferring or supplying Chinese rare earth-controlled items, either in their raw form or after processing. It added that such items have been used in sensitive fields such as defense, which have had a negative impact on international peace and stability. China sees an increase in rare earth exports Beijing saw an increase in exports of rare earth magnets in August, reaching a seven-month high. The surge indicated a steady recovery in mineral outflows since China curbed shipments in April. The General Administration of Customs data, released on Saturday, revealed that August shipments of rare earth magnets from China surged by 10.2% from July to 6,146 metric tons. The data also showed that the country’s production of rare earth magnets increased by 15.4% from the previous year. The increase in exports in August followed an agreement among Beijing, the U.S., and Europe to expedite shipments and ease export controls that China had imposed in response to U.S. tariffs. Data also revealed that exports of 590 tons to the U.S. dropped by 4.7% and were down 11.8% from August last year. The new restrictions come as U.S. lawmakers called for broader bans on the export of chipmaking equipment to China just a day earlier. The U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on China reported that inconsistencies in rules issued by the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands have led to non-U.S. chip equipment manufacturers selling to Chinese companies.

Meanwhile, its price stands at around $225, with a 24-hour trading volume of $7.3 billion. It has gained 1% in the last day and 1% over the past week. Cup and Handle Pattern Forms on Monthly Chart A monthly chart shared by Lark Davis shows a possible cup and handle pattern on SOL. The formation stretches from the 2021 peak, through the 2022 low, to the current handle phase. The area between $270 and $301 remains a key zone. If SOL moves above this range, it may trigger a strong upward move. Using Fibonacci levels, the 1.618 extension places a price target around $425. A second target, based on the 2.618 level, is near $624. These figures come from historical price moves and are commonly used for tracking breakout levels. Davis noted that the $425 level lines up with the 1.618 projection. Source: Lark Davis/X MACD and RSI Indicators Show Strength The monthly MACD is showing a crossover, where the main line is now above the signal line. This setup is often viewed as a sign of building momentum, especially on long-term charts. It has appeared during periods when trend changes begin to take shape. Another chart from CryptoJack points to an ascending triangle, with SOL pressing against horizontal resistance. The pattern is made of higher lows and flat highs, with resistance near $380. The monthly RSI has also crossed above its signal line. CryptoJack posted , “SOL looks ready to explode. Ascending triangle + RSI golden cross = bullish combo. The breakout could be huge.” This pattern still needs confirmation with a close above the resistance. Lennaert Snyder noted that SOL bounced from weekly support near $193, keeping the higher timeframe trend in place. He mentioned that $213 could serve as a pullback level, with $232 acting as resistance for further upside. ETF Filing Adds Market Interest Bitwise updated its Solana ETF filing this week, setting an annual fee of 0.20% and adding a staking feature. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented , “They prob figured it’s gonna end up there anyway, so just do it now.” He referred to the move as a bold step in a competitive market. The ETF is still awaiting a decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Traders are watching how this may affect volume and sentiment around SOL. Separately, Jupiter, a decentralized exchange built on Solana, announced plans to launch its own stablecoin, JupUSD, by year-end. The stablecoin will be used across its trading, lending, and derivatives products.

While older cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE have attracted market interest, a new coin is gaining traction with potential for massive gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, is moving fast in its presale stage with over 16,820 investors and over $17 million raised. Currently in Phase 6, MUTM tokens are available for sale at $0.035, with the next phase increasing the price to $0.04. While DOGE and PEPE have had some price movement, their vulnerability to community opinion and social media trends makes them unstable. At the same time, Mutuum Finance pursues a utility-based model with its overcollateralized stablecoin as well as its dual lending models, establishing a more solid base for long-term development. Dogecoin Picking Up Steam as Traders Eye Key Resistance Dogecoin (DOGE) is picking up steam after showing impressive support in the green zone following a recent episode of full-blown fear, showcasing how entries on fear can provide some of the best setups. Momentum is now driving the price toward the yellow area, a historically significant resistance level, where the market reaction will be crucial, a clean breakout would energize further gains, but rejection would be giving patient investors another entry point. While DOGE remains in the limelight of short-term trading interest, investors in search of long-term utility projects, structured growth, and early-stage potential are increasingly focusing attention on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). PEPE Witnesses Consistent Support as Bulls Eye Next Levels of Upside Pepe (PEPE) has been displaying resilience in recent times, comfortably resting on its long-term trendline support after being tested a number of times, reflecting strong buyer support at this critical zone. In case support holds, the meme coin can potentially target short-term gains to the 0.000015–0.000020 level, with a possibility of extending further to 0.000025, presenting buyers with a possible chance of decent upside. But inability to maintain this support could spur a deeper retracement towards 0.000006, highlighting the token’s inherent volatility. While PEPE continues to rely on trend-induced sentiment, investors seeking projects with real-world utility and organized growth are increasingly turning towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Performance Booms Mutuum Finance is shaking the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene with its presale, which has recorded positive momentum from over 16,820 investors and has raised over $16.9 million to date. Phase 6, already 60% filled, is going for $0.035 per token, reflecting growing market trust and demand. Mutuum Finance is set to launch its next-generation lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 (V1) will go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include significant building blocks like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and so on. ETH and USDT will be available on day one to be borrowed, lent, and utilized as collateral and hence create an expanding, multi-asset, and user-oriented DeFi ecosystem. The protocol aspires to benefit retail and institutional participants alike through safe and efficient decentralized finance service access. In order to enable security and transparency in its processes, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles to enable stable exchange, lending, and settlement of USD-backed tokens and other tokens traded on the platform like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracle protection, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAP are utilized by the platform in a bid to offer guaranteed price data even in the case of excessive market volatility. A DeFi Project with Tremendous Potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has crossed $17 million raised in funds from more than 16,820 investors in Phase 6 of presale, with the tokens priced at $0.035 and 60% sold out. Its lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet in the future consists of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, backed by ETH and USDT to offer secure, scalable DeFi. MUTM’s growth model and structured development position it as a good coin for early-stage investors before the upcoming stage at $0.04.

""Long Bull!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/arthur-hayes-says-the-bull-bear-cycle-is-over-in-bitcoin-and-announces-new-trend-long-bull/,"BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, known for his bold statements in the cryptocurrency market, made new statements about Bitcoin. Addressing the Bitcoin bear-bull cycle in his new blog post, Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin's 4-year cycle has ended and the cycle is now driven by global liquidity. In his article, Hayes argued that the traditional four-year Bitcoin price cycle theory is no longer valid. At this point, the prominent figure now suggested that the true driver of Bitcoin's price cycle was not the halving event itself, but US dollar liquidity. Citing the growing influence of China's monetary policy and the yuan on global liquidity, Hayes concluded that the current cycle was unlikely to repeat past patterns. Stating that Bitcoin's price cycle is determined by the supply price of the dollar and the yuan, Hayes stated that this cycle is different from the previous three cycles. Hayes said that while Bitcoin is the preeminent form of money in human history, its value is relative and is measured primarily against the US dollar in the current global system. According to Hayes, the old model is no longer valid, given the divergence of US and China policies, the unbalanced global dollar supply stemming from the growing US fiscal deficit, and the radically changing market structure caused by the introduction of ETFs. “The four-year cycle is no longer valid for Bitcoin. The change in monetary policy in the US and China is starting a new cycle. Bitcoin will continue to be the best form of money.” Finally, Hayes argued that this cycle could last longer due to political factors, especially in the US: “US President Donald Trump is trying to reduce the debt burden by overheating the economy, and the Treasury Department is increasing market liquidity by issuing short-term debt.” Hayes also argued that China's current economic situation is a factor that will trigger Bitcoin's rise, saying, “Aside from the US, China is also showing signs of switching to a loose monetary policy to ease its deflation. If Washington and Beijing maintain their loose monetary policies, Bitcoin will rise again.” *This is not investment advice.

These crypto assets offer fast transfers, fee efficiency, and—critically—privacy via no-KYC platforms. Combining anonymity with competitive markets and crypto convenience is now possible in 2025. In this review, we present six trusted no-KYC sportsbooks that support Bitcoin and stablecoins (DAI, USDT, USDC) for football betting. We’ll compare features, bonus structure, anonymity policies, and risk factors. ⚽ Why Football + Crypto (BTC / Stablecoins) Is Gaining Traction Before diving into platforms, here are the major advantages: Instant deposits and withdrawals — Crypto moves faster than traditional banking rails, especially across borders. Reduced volatility (when using stablecoins) — Using USDT, USDC, or DAI helps you avoid the wild price swings of BTC/ETH. Anonymity / Privacy — Many crypto sportsbooks allow registration with minimal identity verification, especially for lower-tier bettors. Wide acceptance of cryptocurrencies — The top sportsbooks support many coins, giving users flexibility. Competitive odds & betting features — You can find the same or better markets (prop bets, live betting, accumulators) in crypto sportsbooks, many modeled on traditional betting logic. Six No-KYC Crypto Sportsbooks to Consider in 2025 Below are six sportsbooks known for offering crypto support, anonymity (no KYC or minimal KYC), and a strong football betting experience. 1. Dexsport – The Crypto-Native Leader Dexsport.io is a multi-chain sportsbook supporting BTC, ETH, TRX, DAI, USDT and more. It is licensed and audited by CertiK & Pessimistic. The Football Markets feature broad coverage — from match outcomes, handicaps, totals, goals, to props and in-play betting (100+ markets per match). Key Features: No KYC / Privacy: Users can sign up via email, Telegram, or wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet), with instant access and no forced identity checks for normal use. Bonuses & Promotions: 480% welcome bonus + 300 free spins; weekly 15% cashback in stablecoins with zero wagering; free bets during major football events. Security & Transparency: Licensed and audited by CertiK and Pessimistic; public live bet desk shows real bets and outcomes to increase trust. Why It Stands Out: Dexsport is purpose-built for crypto-first betting. It merges regulatory oversight with technical transparency, making it a strong choice for bettors who want performance and privacy. 2. BetPanda – Anonymous, Crypto-First Betting BetPanda offers 45+ sports, including football, and supports many cryptos including stablecoins. No KYC: Email-only registration, VPN friendly, no ID verification for most users. Features: Odds boosts for accumulators, weekly free bets, broad football matchup coverage. Caveats: Larger withdrawals might trigger checks; bonuses often come with conditions. 3. BC.Game – Large Crypto Catalog + Football Betting BC.Game supports 100+ cryptos for deposits and payouts; combines casino + sportsbook functions. Football Markets: Good breadth, solid live betting options. No KYC: Standard anonymity for smaller accounts; flexibility in using many tokens. Bonus & Limitations: Multi-part welcome bonus; less emphasis on football-specific sportsbook bonuses compared to casino promos. 4. CoinCasino – Accessible and Anonymous CoinCasino supports 20+ cryptocurrencies (including stablecoins and meme coins) and offers instant withdrawals in many cases. Football Coverage: All major leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Champions League, MLS). No KYC: Offers full anonymity — registration without ID checks. Bonus: A 200% matched deposit bonus up to $30,000 + 50 free spins. Strengths & Risk Notes: Strong for broad crypto users. But you should confirm in your jurisdiction whether this site is legal and available. 5. Betplay – Lightning Network + Crypto Betting Betplay supports Bitcoin via Lightning Network (i.e. faster, lower fee BTC transactions). Football Features: 35+ betting markets, live betting, props, bet builder tools. No KYC: Start betting without full identity checks (depending on jurisdiction & limits). Caution: The sportsbook side’s bonus offerings are limited — most bonuses apply to the casino side. 6. Cryptorino – Free Bets & Crypto Options Cryptorino is praised for its free-bet promos, anonymous play, instant payouts, and football props. Football Coverage: All major leagues with prop betting and live markets. No KYC: Sign-up with minimal friction; strong anonymity. Bonus Structure: Weekly free bet (up to $500), 40% boost on accumulator bets. Watch Outs: Some players note the sportsbook bonus side is weaker than casino offers; always read conditions.

A total of $5.3B in notional value is expiring on Friday, higher than last week’s contracts. BTC and ETH options for a total of $5.3B in notional value are expiring on Friday. Deribit’s weekly event once again may bring volatility to the price. Last Friday’s expiry led to lower selling pressures, allowing BTC to set a new price record above $126,000. Ahead of the expiry, however, the price of assets may fluctuate as traders push BTC and ETH to maximum pain expiry. For BTC, that level is at $117,000, while for ETH the maximum pain is at $4,400. Those price levels may lead to shifts in BTC and ETH at the last moment until the expiry time. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 Over $5.3B in crypto options are set to expire tomorrow. $BTC : $4.3B notional | Put/Call: 1.12 | Max Pain: $117K $ETH : $0.94B notional | Put/Call: 0.9 | Max Pain: $4,400 BTC traders are split between $110K puts and $120K calls, while ETH flows are more… pic.twitter.com/IgzyHTtBEv — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) October 9, 2025 Ahead of the options expiry, BTC is once again at a crossroad, with options traders split in their predictions between $110,000 and $120,000. Deribit open interest has rebuilt again at over $36B in the month so far, potentially pointing to another large expiry event at the end of October. Open interest has been accumulating faster in the past few weeks, as options trading gains more popularity. In addition to Deribit, IBIT activity is also rising, while the CME is expected to launch 24/7 crypto futures and options in 2026. IBIT and Deribit show disparity in risk positions IBIT options have taken up market share from Deribit since the start of 2025. The options platform shows another story, once again indicating mainstream traders may be more bullish on BTC. IBIT options markets are becoming more influential, showing a more bullish outlook on BTC compared to Deribit. | Source: CheckOnChain . On IBIT, the maximum pain is at $121,000 per BTC, with call options all the way to $238K. The biggest notional value is for call options at $123,000. However, Deribit options and their Friday expiry are still a major factor for swaying the market in the short term. The primacy of IBIT started in October, and is mostly linked to ETF activity and demand for hedging. BTC trades with greed ahead of the options expiry BTC traded at $121,409 on Thursday, ahead of the options expiry event. This time around, the market was showing signs of greed, based on the type of trader positions. The Bitcoin fear and greed index shifted higher to 70 points, up 10 points within a single day. The greed and market direction suggest BTC may continue its rally following the options expiry. Greed trading coincides with long positions, which are also at a threat of liquidation. The recent downturn wiped out the available long liquidity, with a possible dip to $120,000 or below. On the upside, BTC is slowly rebuilding short liquidity, with a big accumulation of positions at $125,000. ETH was still pressured at $4,350.50, as the token usually posted bigger losses after a BTC downturn. ETH is also liquidating long positions into the $4,300 range, but also has a liquidity cluster at $4,600 and may move fast following the options expiration.

The leading cryptocurrency fell over 1% $121,500, reversing Wednesday’s spike and penetrating the 200-hour simple moving average, CoinDesk data show. Other major tokens such as BNB and ETH dropped over 3%. The CoinDesk 20 Index fell 1% to 4,155 points. The decline followed another strong day of inflows into the U.S.-listed spot ETFs, which collectively pulled in $426 million on Wednesday, according to data source SoSoValue. This extends the streaks of robust daily inflows seen over the past week. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, rose to 99.10, the highest since Aug. 1, denting the appeal of dollar-denominated assets like bitcoin and gold. The yellow metal saw a brief drop to $4,000 per ounce. before bouncing back above $4,030 per ounce. Fed’s Powell is scheduled to speak at the Community Bank Conference in Washington at 12:30 GMT. Traders will look for cues on the monetary policy outlook against the backdrop of the U.S. government shutdown that has paused fresh economic data releases such as inflation and jobs, which the central bank takes into account while setting interest rates. The minutes of the Federal Reserve September meeting released Wednesday also expressed concerns over the shutdown. “Should the shutdown not end by the FOMC’s Oct. 28-29 meeting, policymakers essentially will be flying blind on key economic metrics,””the committee members noted, Minutes showed caution over inflation Minutes revealed that while policymakers were united in their view that rates should be cut, they disagreed on how aggressively rate cuts should proceed and were worried about sticky inflation. “Most judged that it likely would be appropriate to ease policy further over the remainder of this year,” according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s Sept. 16-17 meeting. “A majority of participants emphasized upside risks to their outlooks for inflation.” Participants voted 11-1 to lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range down to around 4%. At the same, a majority of 19 officials anticipated at least two more rate cuts this year, while seven foresaw no further reductions. The dot plot published last month showed a slight majority favoring two more rate reductions this year which would take the benchmark rate to 3.50-3.75%. Discussions focused heavily on a weakening labor market and early signs that inflation could reaccelerate. Still, the committee was generally aligned in its view that President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs would not be a lasting source of inflation.",Markets|Bitcoin|Powell|Dollar|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-09 09:49:08

It attracts millions of viewers, generates substantial prize pools, and fuels an active betting industry. In 2025, the landscape is defined by both established titles and ambitious challengers. For bettors, the question is not whether to participate, but rather which games provide the most opportunity. Counter-Strike 2 (CS2): The Central Pillar Counter-Strike 2 stands as the anchor of esports betting. Its release revitalized competitive first-person shooters, and by 2024 it already commanded more than half of global betting volume. The momentum continues in 2025, with CS2 firmly holding its place at the top. Why CS2 matters for bettors: Round-based play produces a constant stream of betting possibilities. High betting volumes ensure stable odds and robust markets. Wagers range from map winners and round totals to handicaps, pistol rounds, and correct scores. Points of caution: Momentum can shift suddenly. A single clutch play may overturn expectations in seconds. Map pool changes and updates further complicate predictions, making adaptability vital. Where to bet on CS2? Dexsport is a trusted, licensed platform for CS2 betting that offers complete anonymity and a fully on-chain experience. Users can place bets with BTC, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrencies without the need for KYC. Valorant: The Rising Challenger Valorant has steadily advanced to become the second tactical shooter of choice. Its betting share doubled during 2024, and in 2025 it consolidates its role as a major alternative to CS2. Why Valorant attracts attention: Agent abilities create layers of strategy beyond standard gunplay. The Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) runs year-round with global visibility. Bettors can select from map handicaps, pistol rounds, round totals, and player-specific props. Risks to consider: Frequent patches and agent rebalances keep the meta fluid. Knowledge of these changes becomes a decisive edge. Bet on Valorant at dexsport.io Dota 2: The Deep Strategist’s Choice Dota 2 continues to demand respect within the esports betting world. Its complexity and massive prize pools ensure it remains a favorite for dedicated bettors. Why Dota 2 remains valuable: More than one hundred heroes and infinite drafting combinations keep outcomes fresh. The International and Dota Pro Circuit tournaments guarantee scale and attention. Bet types include map results, kill totals, and first-to-objective outcomes. Challenges: Drafting often determines a team’s fate. Superior teams may falter if their hero composition proves ineffective. Bet on Dota at dexsport.io League of Legends: The Global Constant League of Legends maintains its global dominance. Its regional leagues keep the calendar full, while international events such as Worlds remain highlights of the esports year. Why it stands firm: Constant tournaments ensure weekly betting opportunities. A broad range of props cover objectives such as first blood, barons, and towers. Riot’s structured ecosystem brings reliability. Complications: Frequent balance patches require bettors to adjust strategies regularly, as the strongest champions often change with each update. Rocket League: Simplicity with Flair Rocket League merges arcade action with sporting intensity. Its straightforward rules make it appealing for newer bettors, while its unpredictable pace holds value for specialists. Strengths: Easy-to-understand gameplay makes betting accessible. Props include total goals, overtime, and handicaps. The Rocket League Championship Series maintains consistent competition. Limitations: Liquidity is smaller compared to tier-one esports, and upsets are frequent in early rounds. Call of Duty: The Reliable Veteran Call of Duty continues to deliver competitive betting options through the Call of Duty League (CDL). Although yearly releases create variation, the franchise sustains a dedicated fanbase. Why it holds value: Familiar gameplay across decades sustains recognition. Betting covers match outcomes, map wins, kills, and objectives. Despite volatility, CDL matches consistently attract wagering. Other Titles to Watch Overwatch 2 maintains a niche following with selective betting opportunities. Fortnite occasionally offers large-scale tournaments, though its battle royale structure complicates consistent prediction. New titles appear each year, some finding momentum, others fading quickly. Dexsport: A Go-To Platform for Crypto Esports Betting Choosing the right platform matters as much as choosing the right game. Dexsport is one of the most advanced crypto-native sportsbooks and casinos in 2025. Multi-Chain Betting Without Barriers Dexsport supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, and stablecoins, with instant, KYC-free access.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After dropping over 2.5% yesterday, Bitcoin is up 1% today. Overall, we could be witnessing a healthy pullback following a one-sided 16% rally over the past couple of weeks. That said, even after yesterday’s correction, Bitcoin on the daily chart hasn’t yet touched the 10 EMA, suggesting it might be ideal if the token corrects a bit more, perhaps toward the 20 EMA. All in all, even if we see a deeper correction, say, down to around $118K – the last major resistance Bitcoin broke before hitting new all-time highs – it wouldn’t be a cause for concern. In fact, such a move would likely indicate that Bitcoin is simply accumulating strength before rallying harder toward new highs. However, Bitcoin is no stranger to explosive moves. Plus, seeing as the token has already found some support at the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart, don’t be surprised if we see a new Bitcoin ATH in the next few hours. While Institutions Buy Exposure, Bitcoin Hyper Unlocks Speed, Smart Contracts, and Scale October 9, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Matt Hougan isn’t flinching. Despite ETF inflows trailing expectations earlier in the year, Bitwise’s CIO remains confident that Q4 2025 will deliver a record finish. With firms like Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo greenlighting $BTC allocations, and BlackRock’s IBIT pulling nearly $1B in a single day, the demand for exposure is at an all-time high. But exposure alone won’t solve Bitcoin’s core limitations, such as slow transaction times, high fees, and lack of programmability. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps in, the first Layer 2 to bring Solana-grade speed to the Bitcoin ecosystem. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Hyper enables smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps to run natively on Bitcoin, with near-instant finality and low fees. Meanwhile, the Canonical Bridge lets users deposit $BTC and mint wrapped assets on Layer 2, unlocking real-time payments, staking, and decentralized trading. With a hot crypto presale that’s already raised over $22.5M, Bitcoin Hyper’s not waiting for ETF inflows; it’s building the app layer Bitcoin’s never had. Secure your $HYPER tokens now and bet on speed and scale. Peter Brandt’s Bitcoin Supercycle Prediction Fuels Massive Interest in Bitcoin Hyper October 9, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Veteran Trader Peter Brandt forecasts that Bitcoin may be entering a historic phase of price discovery, potentially breaking past its all-time highs. Brandt’s analysis, based on $BTC’s repeating cycle symmetry, suggests that early October 2025 may be the mirror point of previous post-halving peaks. His model predicted this timeline long ago, and remarkably, $BTC hit a new ATH ($126,100 ) on October 6, just a day after his projected peak. Brandt also cautioned that ‘there is always an exception’, suggesting that if $BTC doesn’t peak now, it could trigger an unprecedented explosive rally, potentially reaching a range of $150 to $185K. With institutional inflows, ETF liquidity, and global rate cuts fueling demand, coupled with Bitcoin’s repeating cycle symmetry phenomenon, the coin could enter its first-ever supercycle. As capital rotates from $BTC highs into emerging Bitcoin-based crypto opportunities, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning to ride the momentum. The most significant whale purchase occurred two days ago — a $274K buy-in of $HYPER, underscoring strong confidence in the project’s long-term potential. Read our atest $HYPER price prediction and insights on its next big move.

October 9, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bit Digital, a publicly traded crypto company, purchased 31,057 $ETH worth $140M , bringing its total holdings to 150,244 ETH (worth $673M), positioning the firm in third place among corporate Ethereum holders. Bit Digital funded the buy through a $150MM convertible note issuance by Kraken Financial, Jump Trading Crdit, and Jane Street Capital, reflecting firm institutional confidence. Furthermore, the $4.16 conversion price (8.2% above mNAV) underscores the investors’ growing sentiment in Bit Digital. Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital cited Ethereum as the foundational block to digital financial infrastructure, emphasizing long-term conviction in $ETH. Following Bit Digital’s big move, $ETH rebounded above $4500 , triggering a short squeeze with $28.9M in short liquidation. Amid the US Government shutdown and fiscal uncertainty, investors are flocking to crypto as a hedge. With $ETH’s renewed momentum, investors are also eyeing utility-driven ecosystems and emerging projects like the Best Wallet and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . Learn how to buy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) in our detailed guide. Institutions Stack $BTC as Retail Mines $PEPENODE, the Next Crypto to Explode October 9, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Institutions are buying up Bitcoin like it’s on clearance sale, stashing 7.4x more $BTC than miners can produce in 2025, according to Bitwise’s André Dragosch. That kind of demand squeeze is great for price action, as we saw with $BTC hitting a new ATH on Tuesday. But it’s also a signal: the big players are here, and they’re not leaving any room for retail to play catch-up. So, where’s the next wave of opportunity for the small guys?

Related Reading: BNB Flips XRP’s Market Capitalization As Price Hits $1,300 Record High – What’s Next? BNB Chain Momentum Steals Memecoin Spotlight Amid BNB’s run to the $1,300 barrier, the BNB Chain ecosystem is experiencing a memecoin frenzy, with multiple BNB Chain-based tokens gaining significant traction over the past few days. Notably, the ongoing momentum has seen tokens like Palu (PALU), 币安人生 (BinanceLife), 4 (FOUR), PUP (PUP), and CZ’s Dog (BROCCOLI) record massive rallies. According to DeFiLlama data, the BNB Chain-based memecoin launchpad, Four.meme, has overtaken Pump.fun, Solana’s leading launchpad, in daily revenue. In the past 24 hours, Four.meme has gained around $1.4 million in revenue, surpassing Pump.fun’s $885,420. Meanwhile, CoinGecko data shows that the Four.meme ecosystem tokens have surged around 88% to an overall market capitalization of $1.044 billion and a daily trading volume of $963.4 million. Nonetheless, the Solana-based launchpad continues to lead in higher timeframes, with weekly and monthly revenues of $8.34 million and $40.9 million, respectively. Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, highlighted the recent memecoin frenzy in the BNB Chain. On Tuesday, CZ acknowledged the “BNB meme szn” on X, affirming, “I didn’t expect this at all.” On-chain analytics platform Bubblemaps declared that the “BNB memecoin szn is real,” noting that over 100,000 on-chain traders bought into the new memecoin frenzy, with 70% of them being in profit. As the platform detailed, 21,000 investors have made over $1,000, while 900 have earned over $100,000 with the leading tokens. Meanwhile, 40 traders have made over $1 million, and one has profited more than $10 million. Can BNB’s Memecoin Season Last? A crypto community member weighed in on how long the ongoing memecoin trend could last and whether it was worth participating in it. According to the X post, the investor considers that the BNB Chain tokens frenzy might continue, arguing that “this time is different.” Following the rapid surge of BinanceLife, which has reached a market cap of $372 million in less than a week, the investor listed multiple reasons why BNB Chain’s memecoin season could last for a while. They argued that “CZ and He Yi won’t let this wave fade easily,” suggesting that they will “likely keep pushing it forward.” The investor pointed out that the ecosystem is more mature and capital is more abundant. Previously launched memecoins “aimed” for a Binance listing, while the new project’s exit path is clearer. “First generate hype through reposts, then launch on Alpha, followed by listing on Aster spot and Binance spot—each step driving upward momentum in a relentless surge,” they explained. Lastly, the investor argued that the rules have changed, as this Memecoin bull run is spearheaded by the Chinese-speaking community, who “stand at the crest of the wave” this time. “Those who embrace change swiftly profit first; Those with biases neither gain nor lose,” they concluded.

Investors have poured $17,000,000 into the presale since it began. Meanwhile, total MUTM holders have reached 16,820. Phase 6 of 11 phases now stands 60% filled at $0.035 per token. This price marks a 250% rise, or 3.5x gain, from phase one’s $0.01 entry. Consequently, demand surges as the project unveils its lending and borrowing protocol. Furthermore, the team has finalized its Certik audit successfully. That effort yielded a 90/100 token score, signaling robust security. In addition, Mutuum Finance has also ushered in their official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. They offered rewards of $50,000 USDT split into four ranks including critical, major, minor, and low vulnerabilities, so that vulnerabilities get decent rewards at all the levels. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Phase 6 has been underway, filling rapidly at 60%. Buyers secure tokens cheaply before this window closes. Soon, phase 7 opens with a 14.3% jump to $0.04. Launch arrives at $0.06, promising current holders a 420% ROI post-listing. Moreover, the MUTM team recently unveiled a dashboard featuring a leaderboard for the top 50 holders. Those ranks earn bonus tokens as rewards for maintaining spots. Consequently, participation deepens loyalty among early backers. Furthermore, there is excitement to be built around a big giveaway. Organizers note $100 000 in MUTM tokens to 10 winners in the $10,000 each claimants. Participants submit wallet addresses, complete quests and invest $50 or more in the presale to reach the qualification. Thus, engagement gets a spike as the community builds. Lending Protocol Takes Shape Developers push forward on the lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 heads to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Core elements include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. Initial assets cover ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, or collateral. Borrowers post overcollateralized assets to unlock funds without selling holdings. Lenders deposit into pools, earning yields as utilization shifts rates dynamically. When supply abounds, rates dip to spur borrowing and activate idle capital. Scarce times hike rates, prompting repayments and fresh deposits for better returns. In addition, stable rate options lock predictable costs for borrowers, starting higher than variable ones to offset risks. Rebalancing kicks in if markets swing wildly, ensuring fairness. Thus, users gain flexibility in the crypto market, where prices fluctuate daily. Bullish Forecast Draws Parallels Analysts base the bullish Mutuum Finance (MUTM) price forecast on solid mechanics. Medium-term gains stem from protocol utility in lending and borrowing. Early adopters leverage overcollateralization for safe liquidity access. Liquidation thresholds at 70% trigger bonuses for swift resolutions, bolstering solvency. Deposit and borrow caps limit exposures to volatile crypto prices. For instance, LTV ratios cap borrowings at 75% for stable assets like ETH, cushioning dips. Reserve factors skim interest to buffer defaults, set lower for steady tokens. Consequently, MUTM positions as a crypto investment with enduring appeal. To illustrate, Bitcoin in 2017 dipped to $1,000 early that year. It surged to $19,783 by December, delivering 1,878% ROI over 12 months. Yet BTC lacked Mutuum’s targeted DeFi tools. MUTM, however, integrates P2C pools for instant yields and P2P for custom loans, outpacing such raw pumps. Crypto predictions favor MUTM’s structured growth amid rising crypto investments. Ongoing Momentum Builds Value The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) price forecast thrives on these foundations. Protocol safeguards like enhanced collateral efficiency for correlated assets boost borrowing power safely. Fallback oracles ensure timely price feeds, vital as crypto prices today climb. Investors eye why crypto is going up, with MUTM’s yields drawing funds. Moreover, investing in crypto via MUTM offers custody control and real utility. Thus, the bullish outlook persists.

52888551,602166,1760004059,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52888551.jpeg,"US Labor Union Urges Senate To Oppose Crypto Bill Over Pension, Workers’ Risks",https://bitcoinist.com/us-labor-union-oppose-crypto-bill-over-risks/,"The largest US federation of trade unions has asked US Senators to reject the Senate’s version of the crypto market structure bill due to serious concerns and a lack of proper safeguards for workers. Senate’s Crypto Bill Faces Backlash On Tuesday, Jody Calemine, Director of Government Affairs at The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), sent a letter to the US Senate Banking Committee sharing multiple concerns about the highly anticipated Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA). Calemine affirmed that the bill “does not protect consumers, workers or the financial system,” arguing that RFIA’s treatment of crypto assets “poses risks to both retirement funds and to the overall financial stability of the U.S. economy.” According to the letter, the current state of the legislation would enable the crypto industry to “operate in wider and deeper ways” without sufficient oversight or “meaningful safeguards,” which would potentially increase financial instability. While currently most pensions do not carry crypto assets because of the risks associated with them, the bill provides the facade of regulation that may make cryptocurrency and associated assets more mainstream in portfolios. Passing this legislation will allow the proliferation of assets that investors will wrongly perceive as safe. The AFL-CIO director warned that the proposed bill also increases systemic risks, as it would expose banks and put the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)’s taxpayer-backed Deposit Insurance Fund at greater risk. Additionally, the labor union considers that the legislation “codifies the tokenization of securities and assets such that private companies have a pathway to create a shadow public stock outside of SEC oversight.” Labor Union, State Regulators Call For “Proper Safeguards” The letter concluded that the Senate’s version of the crypto market structure bill “substantially weakens” both federal and state enforcement tools to regulate digital assets. It’s worth noting that the Senate’s RFIA is expected to come before the Committee, led by Chairman Tim Scott, soon as the US Congress’s upper chamber races to advance the bill to a floor vote next month and potentially send it to the President’s desk before the end of the year. The legislation has also received backlash from multiple state authorities, which have warned that it may “diminish their ability to pursue wrongdoers” and allow criminals to “wiggle out” of prosecution. As reported by Bitcoinist, regulators from Alabama to Montana recently argued that the bill does not give state-level regulatory agencies implicit authority to supervise crypto companies, which could mean that these regulatory agencies may not be able to prosecute offenders for fraud. State regulators have proposed changes to the market structure bill, like adding language that specifies businesses to register and respond to their inquiries, and rejecting the provisions that redefine the investment contract test. Similarly, the AFL-CIO suggested that working people need policies that effectively regulate financial markets and ensure their hard-earned retirement benefits are not endangered. Ultimately, Calemine asked the Senate Banking Committee members to oppose the bill, and “make sure that the financial system is stable instead of creating a casino for crypto billionaires to make more profits.”",Crypto News|AFL-CIO|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bill|Crypto legislation|crypto market structure bill|crypto regulation|Responsible Financial Innovation Act|RFIA|US Congress|US laawmakers|US President Donald Trump|US Senate,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 10:00:59

The financing was arranged by Permian Labs and will be distributed via USD.AI, a blockchain-based credit protocol that connects crypto liquidity to real-world infrastructure, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk. The non-recourse facility will allow QumulusAI to borrow stablecoins against up to 70% of its approved GPU deployments, giving the company faster access to capital than traditional credit routes like bank loans or venture debt, the company said. GPUs are the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, as they can handle thousands of tasks at once and are critical for training and running large AI models. As demand for AI systems grows, so does the race to secure access to the chips that power them. QumulusAI's funding comes as demand for computing power soars, but capital for smaller operators remains tight. Much of the industry’s GPU supply is still cornered by tech giants such as Google, Meta and OpenAI in the race for the most advanced AI model. Permian Labs, which developed the USD.AI framework , tokenizes GPUs into warehouse receipt tokens, GWRTs, which can be used as collateral on-chain. ""By leveraging Permian Labs' tokenization framework, we can scale faster and more flexibly – meeting the surge in AI compute demand without the constraints of legacy financing,” said QumulusAI CEO Mike Maniscalco.

For context, Bitcoin – which everyone says is having a good second half of the year – is up 55% since April . $BNB, meanwhile, is up 135% during the same period , proving that it’s no longer just a diversification option in a long-term crypto portfolio, but quite easily one of the best cryptos to buy for significant gains. That said, given that the token is now trading in uncharted territory, meaning it has no previous resistances to encounter, it’s only natural that people are now wondering where it could be headed next. To answer that in the most objective way possible, we turned to ChatGPT, which is arguably the most powerful AI chatbot on the market right now. The AI analyzed a wide range of real-time information, from price predictions on platforms like X and Reddit to the latest market updates from top publications, to predict that BNB could actually be headed for the magic $2,500 mark in its current cycle. Keep reading as we dig into ChatGPT’s BNB price prediction, why it believes the token could explode another ~100% from current levels, and what the best altcoins to buy now are to make the most of this upcoming rally. ChatGPT’s BNB Price Prediction: The Breakout That Could Send It to $2,500 ChatGPT’s lofty BNB price prediction rests on the shoulders of a major technical breakout. The AI noted that BNB’s latest rally is the result of the breakout from a long-drawn consolidation zone – one that lasted from May 2021 until as recently as June 2025. Naturally, when a four-year-long consolidation zone breaks, it’s almost inevitable to see not only rising prices but also a one-sided movement like the one we’ve witnessed in BNB. Even better, this BNB rally could be far from over. According to ChatGPT, we can measure the width of this consolidation zone and map it onto the breakout level around $735 to arrive at BNB’s next potential target – which, in this case, comes out to around $2,500. Want to make the most of BNB’s upside potential? Sure, go ahead and grab some $BNB tokens right away. Keep in mind, though, that doing just that could mean leaving a lot of money on the table. ChatGPT suggests the best way to maximize your returns in this bull run is by buying low-cap coins with explosive potential. Here are its top three suggestions. 1.

Instead, $HYPER could be the catalyst behind Bitcoin’s explosive growth to $1M. It’s building a new Layer-2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain, aiming to finally bring Solana-like speeds, low fees, and Web3 compatibility to the otherwise sluggish and non-programmable network. Currently, Bitcoin isn’t even in the top 25 fastest blockchains in the world, since it executes transactions one by one. Hyper’s Layer-2, on the other hand, introduces parallel execution to Bitcoin through Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration. This SVM will also enable developers to finally build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) directly on Bitcoin. As a user, this means you’ll gain access to high-speed DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance tools, lending, staking, and gaming dApps, all running on Bitcoin itself. Moreover, to let you interact seamlessly with this new Web3 environment, Bitcoin Hyper offers a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge. Simply put, it converts your Layer-1 Bitcoin into wrapped Layer-2 tokens, which you can then use on $HYPER’s Web3 applications. It’s no surprise that Bitcoin Hyper ranks among the best crypto presales on the market right now, with over $22.76M already raised from early investors. Check out our detailed guide on how to buy $HYPER . Each token is currently priced at just $0.013085, and here’s the best part: a $100 investment today could potentially turn into $2,400 before 2025 ends – according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction . Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today and be part of the Layer-2 revolution powering Bitcoin’s growth. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – New Crypto Wallet Combining Excellent Security & Ease of Use If you want to ride the growth of the crypto wallet market, which is expanding at an eye-watering 21% CAGR, then consider buying Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . $BEST is the firepower behind Best Wallet , a free crypto wallet offering a powerful mix of top-notch security and class-leading ease of use. Since it’s non-custodial, Best Wallet gives you complete control over your private keys. Combined with excellent MFA options, including biometric login, you can rest assured that no third party can access your wallet without your permission. Easily the best feature of Best Wallet is its ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section. As the name suggests, it contains new meme coins in presale , so you don’t have to scour the internet looking for new projects. Even better, all tokens listed in this section are vetted by the internal Best Wallet team, so you’re further protected from potential rug pulls or crypto scams. Here’s the kicker now: Best Wallet aims to capture over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027. After factoring the wallet’s potential growth, our $BEST price prediction suggests the token could reach $0.62 by 2026. So a massive 2,300% ROI could be yours if you buy $BEST right now . Right now, 1 $BEST is available for just $0.025765, with the project boasting over $16.4M in its presale kitty. Buy Best Wallet Token today – gain early access to crypto presales, higher staking rewards, voting rights, and reduced transaction fees. 3. Test ($TST) – Experimental BSC-Chain Meme Coin That Became a Community-Driven Movement Test ($TST) is a classic example of how hype and community support can transform a simple experiment into one of the best meme coins . $TST was originally created as a test token to demonstrate how to launch tokens on the BSC chain using the Four.Meme platform. They posted a video on X showing the process, but the community picked up the token and its contract address, and before the sun could set on the horizon, $TST was a top trending crypto . Although BSC deleted the video, it was too late. CZ Zhao, former Binance CEO, reposted it with the caption ‘Happy Trading,’ sparking massive trading volumes and rallying the community around a single mission – ‘Make BSC Great Again.’ Sure, $TST has seen its fair share of ups and downs, but it’s now showing signs of a strong comeback. The token is up over 33% in the last month or so after bouncing sharply from support at $0.023. Now, a weekly close above the 20 EMA (around $0.04159) could trigger a massive upward move, pushing $TST toward $0.073 – a chunky 110% gain from current levels. Join the $TST hype train by buying it on Binance. Recap : ChatGPT suggests BNB could nearly double in the coming months. So buying low-priced, high-potential tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Test ($TST) could be the ultimate move.

The discussion centered on technical market movements, upcoming decisions on spot XRP exchange-traded funds, and Ripple Labs’ application for a U.S. national bank charter. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a crypto influencer who shared the video, called Der Aktionär TV, the largest national TV channel. While he has received some pushback, with community members pointing out that this is not the country’s largest channel, the coverage was still notable for its focus on XRP’s near-term prospects. Market commentators on the program pointed to a series of lower highs and lower lows in XRP’s chart performance. They indicated that the price trend remained in step with Bitcoin’s movements and suggested that a break above current lows would be necessary for any sustained upward move. The broadcast links these technical observations to upcoming regulatory decisions expected to shape XRP’s trajectory this month.

Several issuers face SEC review deadlines in October , and some analysts expect that the coming weeks could determine whether XRP achieves the same level of market access as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The speakers suggested that recent delays might be linked to the partial shutdown of U.S. financial regulators. Market watchers have speculated that approval of a spot XRP ETF could open the asset to broader institutional participation, potentially improving liquidity and trading volumes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Some experts have predicted that spot XRP ETFs could see inflows of up to $5 billion in the first month , with others anticipating up to $8 billion in inflows . Ripple’s Push for a U.S. Bank Charter Parallel to the ETF discussion, Ripple’s pursuit of a national bank charter in the U.S. featured prominently in the program. The company’s application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency seeks to establish Ripple as a regulated trust bank , which would allow it to offer banking services, including digital asset custody and payment solutions, under federal oversight. A decision on the application is also expected toward the end of October. Obtaining a bank charter would enhance Ripple’s ability to integrate its blockchain-based services with traditional financial systems . This development, combined with potential ETF approvals, could strengthen XRP’s utility and credibility in institutional finance, creating room for significant price growth in the coming weeks.

52888776,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=831719,1760004195,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52888776.jpeg,Ubisoft canceled post–Civil War Assassin’s Creed over politics,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/post-civil-war-assassins-creed-cancelled/,"A new Assassin’s Creed title set in the Reconstruction period following the American Civil War, under development, was cancelled, according to a report from Game File. Ubisoft supposedly shelved the title in 2024 over concerns about political sensitivities in the United States and heat from revealing Assassin’s Creed Shadows protagonist, Yasuke. Game File, citing sources speaking anonymously, reported that Ubisoft halted the development on the unnamed project last year because of the polarized political environment in the US. The game developer was also “walking on eggshells” after the controversy that arose from the reveal of the AC Shadows trailer, which featured a fictional Black samurai named Yasuke. New AC game was several years from release, sources claim Five current and former Ubisoft employees who spoke to Game File confirmed the game was in its concept stage, several years away from release, when executives opted to discontinue it. “The idea was too political in a country too unstable, to make it short,” one source told Game File. According to those familiar with the project, the game was intended to follow the story of a formerly enslaved black man who moves west to begin a new life after the Civil War. The protagonist would then be recruited by the Assassin Brotherhood, a secretive order of the franchise, before returning to the American South to fight against white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan. The lore was reportedly set during the Reconstruction era, a decade that followed the Civil War, when the US government attempted to reintegrate former Confederate states and grant citizenship rights to freed slaves. Reconstruction officially ended in 1877, albeit shadowed by violent resistance from Southern whites and the resurgence of segregationist policies. Developers believed the story could deliver meaningful commentary on the era’s injustices. However, executives feared releasing a game set on the subject matter could brush citizens of the US in a wrong way. Assassin’s Creed: Shadows Fallout scared Ubisoft The cancellation came on the backdrop of the misrepresentation debate in AC Shadows, where Ubisoft was accused of bludgeoning Japanese history. The game is set in feudal Japan, featuring Yasuke, an enslaved African turned samurai, alongside a female ninja protagonist named Naoe. As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier this year, critics on social media platforms accused Ubisoft of historical inaccuracy and “driving a DEI agenda.” “If there is a hill that I am willing to die on, it is defending the creative freedom of our teams,” Marc-Alexis Côté, executive producer overseeing the Assassin’s Creed franchise, said at the time. Just months after its first trailer was released in May, CEO Yves Guillemot told the New York Times the company “is not pushing any specific agenda,” and it only intended to make games “for fans and players that everyone can enjoy.” Creative director Jonathan Dumont, who has worked with the franchise for nearly a decade, said Yasuke and Naoe’s dual perspectives allowed players to experience different play styles: Yasuke’s brute force combat versus Naoe’s stealth and assassination skills. “We come in as students every time for an Assassin’s Creed game,” Dumont remarked . The creative teams of Ubisoft wanted to produce sensitive historical stories, but its leadership was actively trying to avoid public outrage that could affect sales. Still, Game File’s sources said enthusiasm among developers for the US-based AC game was high. Several employees reportedly saw the project as a chance to address underrepresented stories and talk about an uncomfortable period in US history. On September 16 , AC Shadows received its first major expansion, Claws of Awaji , featuring new missions and characters, which met with mixed reviews from players, many of whom complained that the content was too short for its price.

The reveal was shared with a curated audience of investors, builders, and innovators. The event, titled “The Most Handpicked Gathering in Wealth, Family Offices, & Technology,” brought together over 200 individuals representing a broad spectrum of industries. Participants included representatives from Goldman Sachs, Mastercard, Coinbase, Cushman & Wakefield, Dubai Holding, BNW Developments, Amina Group, Standard Chartered, Tokinvest, Blocksquare, Polytrade, and Digishares, among others. Positioned as one of the most diverse assemblies during Token2049 week, the evening served as a discreet platform for sharing developments and facilitating cross-sector dialogue on emerging technologies and digital finance. The evening unfolded through four high-level panels, each exploring a critical dimension of technology, capital, and governance, themes that reflect the foundation of Integra’s vision. “Building the Future of Value” brought together Dr. Vivek Anand Oberoi (Managing Director & Co-Founder, BNW Developments), Jay Patel (Founder & CEO, Real Proton), Rasheed Chahal (Partner Middle East, Nitya Capital), Andreas Blazoudakis (Founder & CEO, Netspaces) and Piyush Gupta (Founder & CEO, Polytrade) to explore how technology and capital are converging to reshape ownership and liquidity. Dr. Oberoi, a Tier-1 Indian film actor turned entrepreneur with over 10 million followers across social media and co-founder of BNW Developments, drew notable attention as he discussed bridging his large real-world footprint in real estate with emerging digital frameworks. “The State of Global Capital” featured Rohit Gupta (Select Investments), Robin Zhang (Winfield Global Capital), Ronald Poon (Amina Group), and and Milind Bansia (Chief Strategy Officer, Polytrade) who discussed how regulation and cross-border finance are redefining institutional participation in digital markets. “Tokenization for the Masses” included Julia Buchholz (Blocksquare), Claus Skaaning (Digishares), Shawn Upton (Home3), and Kevin Goos (Propbase), who debated what it will take to make digital assets part of mainstream investment portfolios. “From Concept to Capital Markets” closed the evening with Robert Farquhar (Ctrl Alt), Scott Thiel (Tokinvest), and Luc Falempin (Tokeny), examining how interoperability and governance can bring real-world assets into regulated market structures. The reveal is seen as an early step toward a more public announcement, expected later this year. Integra’s event followed months of speculation online, where the project quietly built momentum in stealth mode. Since its soft emergence on X (formerly Twitter), Integra has grown to over 30,000 followers, including several industry leaders and influencers from both the Web3 and institutional ecosystems, influential in RWA/DeFi communities. The anticipation was further amplified when Integra became the first project on Kaito to activate a leaderboard campaign in stealth, drawing participation from builders, creators, and analysts trying to decode what the project represents. While specific product details remain undisclosed, attendees agreed that Integra is positioning itself at the intersection of technology, capital, and governance, signaling what could be a significant move toward bridging traditional finance and digital infrastructure. About Integra Integra remains in stealth as it builds a coordinated framework connecting global institutions, digital assets, and infrastructure providers. Guided by experts from finance, real estate, and blockchain, the project aims to enable trusted, compliant, and interoperable systems for the digital economy.

The bank announced that participants can earn staking returns of up to 15% under this service. Swiss Bank AMINA Launches Regulated Staking Service for Polygon (POL) AMINA Bank's new service allows qualified investors, such as asset managers and corporate treasuries, to earn staking rewards while supporting the security of the Polygon network in full compliance with financial regulations. This rate is a combination of the bank's base return and additional incentives from the Polygon Foundation. The bank's Chief Product Officer, Myles Harrison, stated that the service “bridges the gap between traditional finance and future blockchain infrastructures.” With this step, AMINA expands the scope of its existing POL custody and trading services. AMINA Bank (formerly SEBA Bank) is licensed by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and has also received approval from Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong regulators. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron said this development “shows that institutions are no longer content with just purchasing tokens but want to actively participate in networks.” The Polygon network stands out in the real-world asset tokenization space with its low transaction fees and transactions confirmed in seconds. The network currently hosts over $1 billion in tokenized assets and approximately $3 billion in stablecoins. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency lost 1.67% of its value. The DOGE coin may find support around $0.239. On October 9, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a bearish trend for the meme coin. The coin’s price decreased to $0.244 today, representing a 1.67 percent loss in value since it closed at $0.247 yesterday. Today’s bearish trend indicates a negative sentiment in the market, as losses are significant for the day; however, the coin may find support around the $0.239 support zone, as the coin keeps sinking towards the said level, which will reignite the buying interest. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin indicated a downward trend in the market, as sellers are in the leading position. The cryptocurrency’s price decreased to $0.244 today. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify renewed selling pressure.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 48.50 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a sell indication as it moves downwards, as the overall market sentiment is negative today. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin also shows a bearish trend in the market, as selling pressure has formed below the SMA, which is evident from the last four red candlesticks. The DOGE/USD price has been facing increasing volatility toward the $0.244 level on an hourly basis. The increased volatility signals a higher chance of a trend reversal and more volatile price movements in the coming hours. Seller dominance is currently pushing the DOGE price towards the support of $0.239. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.244 in the past 24 hours. If sellers maintain their momentum, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and may retest the $0.239 support. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.513038–$0.652958 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.244 over the last 24 hours as sellers tried to maintain resistance around $0.249 and succeeded. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.349799 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,175.58 DOGE in October; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.82 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinions on Dogecoin Cryptopolitan reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked issuers to withdraw DOGE ETF filings under new listing rules, along with some other crypto-related ETF filings. The regulator is introducing generic standards to replace 19b-4 reviews to speed up ETF approval.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214. In October, Doge is trading near $0.21.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,MINING|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-09 11:25:39

This hint comes soon after Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), said it will invest $2 billion in Coplan’s company, bringing its total value to $9 billion. A Cryptic Hint The timing of Coplan’s teaser has caught attention across crypto circles. His post was made in response to analyst Nairolf’s assessment that the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) had surpassed both Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) in mindshare, and Polymarket had secured fifth place overall in mindshare, ranking as the number one app in the market. The Polymarket CEO then quoted Nairolf’s tweet, listing the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, including Bitcoin (BTC), ETH, BNB, and SOL. However, he omitted the fourth-largest non-stablecoin asset, XRP, instead replacing it on the list with “$POLY” and adding a thinking face emoji for mysterious effect. The mention of POLY sparked numerous responses on X, with crypto commentators divided between being hopeful and skeptical. The platform’s CMO Matthew Modabber chipped in, saying, “They weren’t ready for this one chief.” Meanwhile, journalist Laura Shin expressed curiosity, writing, “Who dis, new coin?”. At the same time, user Mtn Drew warned against “utility tokens,” instead demanding that Coplan think about a model that would allow users to “own Polymarket.” Pseudonymous Hyperliquid enthusiast HyperProphet speculated that introducing POLY could “easily flip PumpFun” if the platform allowed creators to launch their own sub-markets, such as “PolyStars,” earning fees from user activity. ICE’s $2B Deal Pushes Polymarket’s Valuation to $9 Billion The POLY token speculation followed ICE’s confirmation of its multibillion-dollar investment in Polymarket, which now pegs its valuation at $9 billion. It also made Coplan the “youngest self-made billionaire,” according to Bloomberg. Founded in 2020, Polymarket has since laid claim to a huge chunk of the prediction markets, recording nearly $19 billion in cumulative trading volume and a 90% success rate on event outcomes. In November last year, the founder’s Manhattan apartment was raided by FBI agents who demanded access to his phone and devices, shortly after the platform correctly forecasted Donald Trump beating Kamala Harris with 58.6% odds. ICE’s entry into the crypto prediction space is one of the biggest moves by a TradFi company into decentralized markets so far. The investment comes after two rounds of funding for Polymarket that were not made public before, including a $150 million raise in early 2025 led by Founders Fund, which valued the business at $1.2 billion.

But since SHIB’s price action is more or less completely determined by hype and social sentiment, smart investors are increasingly abandoning memes in favor of a project based on real utility and long-term potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, at a price of $0.035, and already over 60% sold out. With a fully audited dual-lending model, Mutuum Finance offers real-world DeFi applications far beyond speculation, rendering it among the most intriguing early-stage investment opportunities going into 2025. Shiba Inu Tests Key Support as Buyers Defend Base Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading the lower boundary of a narrowing wedge after being rejected near 0.0000127, signaling a period of battle between buyers and sellers. The form implies that while buyers are actively defending this support zone, sellers continue to cap rallies, setting up a delicate equilibrium that can dictate near-term price action. A decisive break below 0.0000124 can trigger further selling, while a successful bounce can see a retest of resistance levels around 0.0000127–0.0000128. Whereas SHIB’s price action continues to be driven primarily by speculative forces, investors are more and more looking for projects with actual utility, organized growth, and concrete DeFi offerings that is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Every MUTM token is worth $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale. Investment interest is significant, with more than 16,820 buyers investing more than $17 million, a sign of confidence in long-term feasibility and future prospects of the project in decentralized finance (DeFi). As an incentive to promote adoption at an early stage, Mutuum Finance is conducting a $100,000 giveaway that will distribute $10,000 MUTM tokens to 10 winners. Mutuum Finance also hosts a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The program is implemented for rewarding white-hat hackers and security researchers for bug detection in the codebase. Bugs are graded in severity as critical, major, minor, and low and have rewards paid for actively securing and ensuring platform integrity. Deploying a Next-Generation Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has also released a roadmap to build a next-generation lending and borrowing protocol with Version 1 set to go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc., are some of the features that will come with V1. ETH and USDT will be launchpad support for collaterals, lending, and borrowing, providing users with a secure, fast, and easy DeFi experience. Collateral efficiency is achieved through carefully calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly in collateral-poor loans. A buffer reserve within the protocol has been kept to combat market volatility, and excess reserves are invested conservatively in risk assets such that shock can be absorbed without sacrificing system health overall. All of this creates a stable, healthy, and sustainable DeFi platform for all. A DeFi Opportunity Beyond Meme Hype Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rapidly growing as a utility-backed alternative to Shiba Inu (SHIB). Its Phase 6 presale, where the tokens are at $0.035, has already raised more than $16.9 million from over 16,820 investors, reflecting strong confidence in the project’s DeFi potential in the long run. The upcoming Version 1 (V1) lending and borrowing protocol, launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, features liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot with ETH and USDT support for secure, scalable performance. Further security protocols, including a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK and dynamic Loan-to-Value ratios, also enhance platform stability. While SHIB remains hype-driven, MUTM offers building development, real utility, and early-stage upside, making it a perfect project for investors in 2025. Join the presale today to get in line before the next stage begins.

BITO tracks bitcoin directionally in bullish, high-liquidity environments, but may underperform spot BTC during sideways or corrective phases due to futures contango. Liquidity indicators and cycle regime bands suggest the current environment remains bullish, supporting tactical exposure to BITO despite recent all-time highs. Recommend buying BITO as a tactical position, staggering entries and accepting potential pullbacks, given strong liquidity and positive trend signals. Introduction ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) offers exposure to bitcoin in a familiar package for the average stock market investor. The stated objective of this ETF is that its return, before commissions and expenses, corresponds to the performance of bitcoin, but it does not purchase or hold BTC. Exposure is provided through derivatives, primarily bitcoin futures traded on CFTC-registered markets, and swaps as support when the management team deems it necessary. It is an actively managed fund with an annual management fee of 0.95%. The main dynamics of the fund are easy to understand. The ETF buys front-month futures (those with the nearest expiry date) and, as they approach expiry, rolls the position by selling the expiring contract and buying the next one to maintain that exposure on a continuous basis. This operation is explicitly described in the prospectus and is the reason why BITO resembles the spot market, but does not clone it. There are two reasons for this: on the one hand, futures can be traded at a premium or discount to the spot price, and, on the other hand, the roll adds or subtracts yield depending on the shape of the curve (contango and backwardation). In contango, the fund tends to sell cheaply and buy back more expensively when moving to the next expiry date, which erodes part of the return; in backwardation, the opposite happens, and the roll can add to the return. As mentioned in the first paragraph, BITO does not invest directly in bitcoin, and the fund's own document notes that it should not be expected to match the spot price. In periods of clear trends, the correlation between futures and spot prices is usually high, but in sideways movements or persistent contango, differences can become apparent. In addition to the basis between futures and spot prices, transaction costs, possible position limits, and liquidity conditions in the derivatives market all come into play, all of which can cause the ETF's performance to diverge from that of bitcoin. The fund's cash portfolio is normally invested in US Treasury bills (T-Bills) and very short-term repos; the fund may also use reverse repos from time to time as a form of financing. This collateral provides an additional return that is significant and helps to offset, in part, the potential friction of rolling in contango phases. On a day-to-day basis, BITO seeks cash-settled futures (no delivery of BTC), referenced to official CME indices, and completes the exposure with swaps if at any time it cannot achieve the desired weight in futures. This architecture allows the management team to maintain the bitcoin beta within a standard securities account, with intraday liquidity and without going through crypto custodians or wallets. In return, the investor assumes a cost structure that differs from a traditional equity or bond ETF and a tracking dynamic conditioned by the futures curve. Analysis - Fundamental In this section, we will analyse some cryptoeconomic indicators in detail to try to offer the reader an accurate perspective and a sound recommendation on the vehicle in question. Node Analytica The first proposed panel shows a proprietary indicator that directly influences the movement of risk assets: the amount of liquidity flowing through the financial system, aggregated at the global level and, in parallel, the pulse of net liquidity in the US. Both are normalised on a 0–100 scale to distinguish between expansionary and contractionary phases. Rather than the specific level, the determining factor is the slope of the indicator, which means that when the line rises and remains above its midpoint, financial conditions ease, credit flows more freely, and risk appetite improves. When it loses slope and begins to decline, ceilings begin to form and the upward trend loses momentum. Within this framework, bitcoin's historic high of £126k in early October fits with an environment of still ample liquidity and no clear bearish turn. As long as liquidity does not fall in a sustained manner, the bullish cycle of liquidity-sensitive assets (including bitcoin) tends to continue over time. Translated to BITO (exposure to bitcoin via CME futures), this context becomes practical. In phases of rising liquidity or high plateaus, directionality prevails and the friction inherent to the vehicle (the commission and, above all, the roll of futures (selling the expiring contract and buying the next one)) tends to take a back seat. On the other hand, if GLI and US Net Liquidity turn downward and that decline continues for several weeks, the bitcoin market tends to enter sideways or corrective phases; there, contango (futures more expensive than spot) can transform the roll into an adverse market situation, which erodes part of BITO's performance relative to the price of BTC. For a retail investor, this metric has two natural uses: it serves as a trend filter (bullish as long as the slope does not turn negative) and as a divergence radar (if bitcoin hits highs and liquidity hits decreasing highs, the risk of cycle exhaustion increases). With liquidity still ‘generous’, the narrative of rising highs remains intact until the turning point arrives, when the slope turns clearly negative. Node Analytica Secondly, we have the colour band indicator, which acts as a simple map of regimes in Bitcoin, where warm tones (green-yellow-orange-red) usually accompany trend accelerations, while the transition from red to blue has preceded losses of momentum and phases of decline or consolidation in previous cycles. This indicator does not attempt to predict the next price movement, but rather to show the reader what phase of the cycle the asset is in. In the current environment (with a more mature market, greater institutional weight and more lasting liquidity than in 2017 and 2021), it is reasonable to think that the expansion phases will be longer and that, when corrections do occur, they will more often take the form of ‘time corrections’ (time-consuming sideways movement) than vertical crashes, without eliminating the risk of significant setbacks typical of such a historically volatile asset. For this ETF, these bands are a tactical trigger that completes the liquidity reading. As long as the panel remains in the warm zone and liquidity indicators do not show a sustained decline, it is reasonable to let the trend run, assuming that roll friction is there but weighs less when price momentum is strong. In this context, the ETF tends to move very much in line with bitcoin because the direction takes precedence over the ‘toll’ of renewing the futures in its portfolio. If the panel turns blue and, at the same time, liquidity loses momentum, the balance between risk and return worsens. In these phases, bitcoin tends to enter distribution or correction, and the futures curve usually moves into contango (the next expiry is priced slightly higher), which makes the negative roll yield more visible: each renewal involves selling the expiring contract and buying a slightly more expensive one, and that difference reduces the yield compared to the spot price. The current environment remains bullish, but it is worth keeping an eye on these two points because when they appear, they will mark the change in phase that really matters in a futures ETF such as BITO. ETFs Comparison Fund Investments Expense Ratio ProShares BITO CME Futures Bitcoin + TBills 0,95% VanEck XBTF CME Futures + Swaps 0,76% CoinShares BTF CME Futures Bitcoin & Ether + TBills 1,25% Global X BITS Futures Bitcoin + Blockchain Company Shares 0,65% Bitwise BITC Futures Bitcon - Trendwise roll 0,90% In the league of derivatives-based bitcoin ETFs, BITO is the ‘workhorse’ for simplicity and liquidity, with an active structure that uses CME futures and swaps and an expense ratio of 0.95%. In contrast, VanEck's XBTF offers similar exposure to futures at a lower cost (0.76%), although it tends to move less volume. CoinShares' BTF (formerly Valkyrie) expands the universe to bitcoin and ether futures, which comes at a higher TER (1.25%). Global X's BITS mixes BTC futures with shares in the blockchain ecosystem, which dilutes the ‘pure’ beta of bitcoin but keeps fees at 0.65%; and Bitwise's BITC stands out for its approach of rotating between BTC futures and Treasury bonds based on trends and for its policy of optimising the roll, with a net expense ratio of 0.90% and a time limit that caps it at 0.85% until May 2027. Conclusion After this analysis and with the current data in hand, my current recommendation is to buy, even though we are at historic highs. With global liquidity and net liquidity in the US still high and the cycle map still in a warm phase, the bias remains bullish and favours letting the trend work in our favour. In this context, BITO, despite its inherent futures friction and 0.95 commission, tends to follow the directional movement of Bitcoin well. Entry makes more sense as a tactical position, staggering purchases and accepting the possibility of pullbacks after the recent all-time high.

The prediction not only expects Bitcoin to break below the $100,000 level, which many believe was already left in the past, but to actually fall by more than 60% from here. The analysis, which depicts a flash crash, shows a possible price reversal into levels not seen in years. Entering A Bitcoin Short With Conviction The crypto analyst who goes by the pseudonym Dick Dandy revealed that their next move was to enter into a Bitcoin short position between $121,400 and $121,700. However, the more interesting part is the take-profit targets that Dandy set for this position. Related Reading: Is A 900% Rally To $2.98 ATH Possible As Pi Network Announces New DeFi Updates? First of these lies at the $105,700 level, moving down all the way through to $85,800. From here, the crypto analyst expects the Bitcoin price to continue to crash until it falls below $50,000 and registers prices not seen since 2024. Falling to the $43,900 target would mean an over 60% decline in the price, but the analyst expects Bitcoin to crash further. With the possibility that Bitcoin could see a recovery from $35,000, the analyst explains that they plan to open a long position to hedge their short. But maintains their belief in the fact that the Bitcoin price will continue to decline. Ultimately, Dandy believes that the Bitcoin price will eventually reach $10,000, which is the end of the target. Anatomy Of The Crash Explained In Theory In another post, Dandy explained the theory behind the Bitcoin flash crash as mostly a battle between traders and the market-makers. According to the analyst, market makers essentially enable crypto traders to utilize liquidity to enter leveraged positions. But ultimately, they want their money back while making sure that traders do not profit from their trades. Such cases lead to rapid price movements, which have become known in the market as “stop hunts.” These work to take a large number of traders out of their positions very quickly by liquidating them, essentially returning the liquidity, and then some, back to the market makers. Related Reading: This Major Bitcoin Metric Just Made A New Low For The First Time In 6 Years, Is An ATH Above $130,000 Coming? As for why such a large move is possible, the analyst explains that this is because most of Bitcoin’s market cap is all liquidity used for leveraging and derivatives trading. In fact, the analyst believes that the “floor price” of Bitcoin lies around $8,000, taking into account the stable sources and dividing it by the “dispersed amount of bitcoin on the market.” Dandy predicts that this move will happen very quickly, hence terming it a flash crash, and that traders will have very little time to react. “The more sell orders there are, and the greater the quantity of Bitcoin ordered to be sold, the faster price will drop down,” the analyst explained.

As the uncertainty and volatility brought on by the shutdown continued, the expiration date for options contracts in the crypto market arrived, as it does every Friday. According to the second week of October data, approximately $5.3 billion worth of crypto options will expire on the Deribit derivatives exchange on October 10. According to Deribit data, $4.3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $940 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 1.12, the maximum loss point is $117,000 and the notional value is $4.3 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a 0.9 Put/Call Ratio, a maximum loss point of $4,400, and a notional value of $940 million. In a post on his Deribit X account, he stated that BTC investors are divided between $110,000 put and $120,000 call options, while ETH flows are more bullish. Options Expiry Alert Over $5.3B in crypto options are set to expire tomorrow. $BTC : $4.3B notional | Put/Call: 1.12 | Max Pain: $117K $ETH : $0.94B notional | Put/Call: 0.9 | Max Pain: $4,400 BTC traders are split between $110K puts and $120K calls, while ETH flows are more… pic.twitter.com/IgzyHTtBEv — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) October 9, 2025 What Do Put/Call and Max Pain Mean for Bitcoin and Ethereum? First, when we look at the put/call ratio, we see that it's 1.12 for BTC and 0.9 for ETH. These ratios indicate that sell orders for Bitcoin are greater than buy orders, indicating that options traders are bearish. In contrast, the put/call ratio for ETH is 0.9, indicating a more neutral investor sentiment compared to Bitcoin. This suggests that options traders are taking positions in anticipation of continued sideways movement in the Ethereum price, according to analysts. Secondly, max pain can often act as a magnet during expiration in options markets. In the options market, maximum pain is the price level at which investors incur the greatest losses and options sellers feel most comfortable. In other words, it acts as a magnet for the market as contracts expire. At this point, the maximum pain level for Bitcoin was $117,000, while the maximum pain level for Ethereum was $4,400. As a result, Bitcoin is well above its maximum pain level at $121,000, while ETH is below its maximum pain level at $4,300. This could indicate a decline for BTC and a rise for ETH as the option expiration date approaches. However, it doesn't necessarily mean a definitive rise or fall. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-supply-shock-is-coming-heres-the-signal/,"Finance expert Levi Rietveld has drawn attention to what he believes could be a significant shift in XRP’s market dynamics. In a recent video shared on X, Rietveld warned of a looming supply shock, explaining that the available XRP circulating in the market may soon become scarce as institutions and large holders continue accumulating the digital asset. Limited Supply and Growing Demand Rietveld emphasized that every digital asset, including XRP, operates under a finite supply. He noted that as more XRP becomes locked away by institutions, custodians, and long-term investors , less remains available for purchase on the open market. This, he argued, could eventually create conditions for a rapid price increase if demand persists. He stated that much of the XRP circulating today could soon become scarce for regular buyers, as ownership consolidates among a smaller number of entities. XRP SUPPLY SHOCK Incoming! #XRP pic.twitter.com/LYUrVLVNOb — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 7, 2025 Comparing XRP to Bitcoin and Ethereum According to Rietveld, XRP’s situation differs notably from that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. He referenced comments by another market observer suggesting there’s a greater than 60% likelihood of a supply shock in both BTC and ETH. However, he maintained that XRP may face an even higher degree of scarcity due to the proportion of its supply that is already locked or held long term. Rietveld argued that a smaller available float, combined with increasing institutional demand, could place additional upward pressure on XRP’s market value once trading liquidity begins to thin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Accumulation and Market Effects The growing institutional presence around XRP has become a key point of discussion among analysts who track on-chain data and custodial movements. Rietveld’s assessment aligns with this view, as he underscored how accumulation by major entities often removes tokens from circulation for extended periods. He described this behavior as a central factor behind his belief that XRP may become harder to acquire at current price levels in the near future. Rietveld’s remarks reinforce a growing theme among analysts: that XRP’s supply structure and locked holdings are increasingly relevant to its valuation trajectory. Whether or not a full supply shock emerges, his warning highlights the tightening balance between available tokens and investor demand — a dynamic that could shape XRP’s price direction in the months ahead.

According to data from CNBC, the Milan-listed stock fell as much as 14.7% in morning trade, while the U.S.-listed shares dropped more than 13.4% before the market opened. The Maranello-based manufacturer told investors at its Capital Markets Day that it now expects net revenue of at least €7.1 billion ($10.7 billion) in 2025, compared with its earlier estimate of over €7 billion. By 2030, it projects revenue of about €9 billion. The update marked a slower long-term forecast, and traders sold the stock hard on the news. Ferrari cuts EV goal and unveils elettrica Ferrari also changed its target for its future lineup. By 2030, the company now aims for 40% of its cars to use internal combustion engines, 40% to be hybrids, and 20% to be fully electric. The earlier plan had been 40% of sales from electric vehicles by the end of the decade. Executives said the change was linked to client demands, the current market, and how the company expects conditions to evolve. Alongside the new strategy, Ferrari showed off the chassis and powertrain of its first electric model, the elettrica, at a workshop focused on technology and innovation. The car will be delivered starting in late 2026, with its official launch scheduled for next year. Executive chairman John Elkann said : “With the new Ferrari elettrica, we once again affirm our will to progress by uniting the discipline of technology, the creativity of design and the craft of manufacturing.” The step back mirrors decisions made by other carmakers. Volvo abandoned its headline plan to sell only EVs by 2030, saying last year that it needed to be “pragmatic and flexible” in the face of changing market conditions. Ferrari also reported that its number of active clients has climbed to 90,000, up 20% compared with 2022. The company plans to launch an average of four new cars every year from 2026 to 2030, keeping its product pipeline active despite the slower EV rollout. Analysts react as Ford trims lithium deal Analysts at JPMorgan responded with confidence despite the market sell-off. They wrote, “We have a great deal of confidence in management’s ability to execute on its long-term plan given ample evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply.” They also said CEO Benedetto Vigna’s leadership encouraged collaboration to speed up innovation. They noted an imminent supercar launch could further boost profits. Elsewhere, the strain in the electric vehicle supply chain deepened. Ford Motor revealed it will take less lithium and delay shipments from Australian producer Liontown Resources. Ford will not take any lithium from the Kathleen Valley project in 2027 and 2028, and the overall volume was cut in half to 256,250 tons. Liontown disclosed the changes in an exchange filing on Thursday. The pullback comes as U.S. automakers face pressure from President Donald Trump’s push to cut EV incentives and roll back emissions standards. Lithium, the metal used in EV batteries, has fallen in price after years of shortages turned into oversupply. Carmakers that raced to secure future supplies are now adjusting their commitments. Ford has projected losses of up to $5.5 billion from its EV division this year. Its U.S. electric vehicle sales fell 31% in the second quarter, hit by aging models and a recall that stopped Mustang Mach-E sales temporarily. CEO Jim Farley said last week that the market share of zero-emission cars in the U.S., currently around 10%, could fall by half. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Over 16.3 Billion Tokens Sold as Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Presale Accelerates The ongoing presale for Little Pepe (LILPEPE) which started in June 2025 continues to pick up momentum. A total of more than $26.7 million has been raised so far in 13 presale stages, with more than 16.3 billion tokens having already been sold.

Stage 2, priced between $0.0011 and $0.0015, rapidly raised over $1.23 million. By Stage 10, the token’s price had risen to $0.0019, with over 12.75 billion tokens sold and $19.32 million raised. Stage 11 sold quickly at $0.0020, then Stage 12 and now Stage 13, where the tokens are $0.0022. The next Stage 14 will increase the price to $0.0023, maintaining the scheduled rollout and consistent growth trend. Special Giveaways to Join To further promote participation, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is hosting a $777,000 presale giveaway. Ten winners will each receive $77,000 worth of tokens, with a minimum buy-in of $100. In addition, there will be a Mega Giveaway from Stage 12 to 17 that will reward over 15 ETH in prizes. Prizes are 5 ETH for the biggest buyer, 3 ETH for the second biggest, 2 ETH for the third biggest, and 0.5 ETH each for 15 randomly selected participants. These prizes are meant to reward early bird backers while motivating continued participation through the presale. Growing Utility and Establishing Market Confidence Cross-chain compatibility is on the development pipeline that will enable broader access and more potential for Little Pepe (LILPEPE) to be deployed on multiple platforms. The technical foundation of the project, including completion of a CertiK security audit, Layer 2 infrastructure, and listings on CoinMarketCap, reflects its growing credibility and long-term prospect as adoption is picking up steam. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly proving that meme coins can grow into utility-focused ecosystems. With more than $26.7 million raised, more than 16.3 billion tokens distributed, and a rapidly forming community backing its Layer-2 foundation and growing utility, LILPEPE is establishing itself as a serious contender in the coming bull market. Its structured presale, giveaways, and open development roadmap, including EVM compatibility and improved platform integrations, further build investor confidence. As predictions search for future price targets of $0.30 to $1.00 in a runaway market cycle, LILPEPE could be one of 2025’s breakouts. For investors seeking a high-upside play in the meme coin market with real fundamentals and long-term potential, LILPEPE might be the next win.

Experts now believe that an aggressive Q4 rally could push $BTC to even newer highs. The best part? There are several reasons supporting this claim. For starters, gold’s eye-watering 21% rally in the last 35 days has sparked conversations around ‘The Debasement Trade.’ According to Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO), Bitcoin could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this ongoing shift. For context, the debasement strategy comes into play when market participants believe fiat currencies are losing value due to aggressive money printing and large government deficits. The U.S. money supply has increased 44% since 2020 , meaning there’s more cash in circulation now than five years ago, which naturally reduces its value. The obvious solution for investors is to shift toward scarce assets like gold or Bitcoin, which also explains why both are sitting at ATHs today. Keep reading as we uncover more macro factors driving Bitcoin’s next growth cycle. And to ensure you take home some actionable insights, we’ll also highlight three tokens that could be the next cryptos to explode . Why Bitcoin Still Has Plenty of Room to Run Of course, with a new ATH, many market participants are wondering whether $BTC has peaked and entered overbought territory. Short answer? Absolutely not. The daily RSI ( Relative Strength Index ) currently stands at 60.36, which is often considered a sweet buying zone. Although RSI briefly touched 70 on October 5, it still doesn’t fall into the ‘overbought’ range. Additionally, the Z-score indicator stands at 1.47, suggesting neutral momentum for Bitcoin. Typically, Z-levels beyond 2.5 are seen as ‘bubble’ zones, signaling excessive buying. ‘ From where I sit, the stars are aligned for a very strong Q4 for flows ,’ said Matt Hougan. These inflows, he believes, could surge in Q4 to surpass 2024’s total of $36B. So far this year, ETFs have attracted $22.5B , and at this rate, the total would come to around $30B. However, Hougan expects Q4 to deliver stronger inflows and ‘pull more money in.’ Although it might sound counterintuitive, higher prices often drive more demand as investors rush toward the best-performing assets. What’s more, following gold’s record-breaking rally, institutional funds are now expected to flow into Bitcoin as part of their debasement strategy. The bottom line? This could be one of the best times to build a crypto portfolio, with the stars aligning perfectly for Bitcoin’s fourth quarter. Looking for some real moonshot opportunities? Here are our top picks for the best altcoins to buy right now . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin Layer-2 for Never-Before-Seen Web3 Compatibility Bitcoin is undoubtedly the most dominant token in crypto. That said, can it be better? Absolutely. Currently, Bitcoin processes just 7 transactions per second (TPS), meaning it’s nowhere close to the likes of Solana, which can process up to 65K TPS. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – a new Layer-2 that wants to supercharge the Bitcoin blockchain with lightning-fast transaction speeds, low fees, and improved programmability. The magic lies in Hyper’s Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, which will allow developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Bitcoin network – something that wasn’t possible before. Unlike Bitcoin’s current one-by-one transaction system, $HYPER is capable of batch processing, meaning Bitcoin’s throughput could finally climb to modern blockchain standards. Buying Bitcoin Hyper will get you access to this never-before-seen Web3 environment on Bitcoin, including DeFi trading, NFTs, DAOs, lending, staking, and gaming dApps. All you have to do is deposit your Layer-1 Bitcoin to a designated address monitored by Bitcoin Hyper’s decentralized canonical bridge. The bridge will then lock your original BTC and mint an equivalent number of wrapped Layer-2 tokens on Bitcoin’s Hyper L2. Once you’re done exploring Hyper’s Web3 ecosystem, simply send your Layer-2 tokens back to the bridge, and it will unlock your native Layer-1 Bitcoin. Thanks to its game-changing potential, Bitcoin Hyper has already raised over $22.7M from early investors, with each token currently priced at just $0.013085. According to our $HYPER price prediction , the token could reach $0.32 by the end of 2025 – a massive 2,300% ROI from current levels. Buy Bitcoin Hyper now and unlock 51% staking APY. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Telegram Trading Bot Helping Retailers Automatically Swipe Meme Coin Liquidity Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the native cryptocurrency of Snorter Bot – a new Telegram-based trading tool built for retail participants. Unfortunately, most of the liquidity in new meme coins is quickly swiped away by large players with access to advanced trading tools and algorithms. This leaves little to nothing for smaller traders. This is where Snorter Bot comes in. It lets you set limit/stop buy/sell orders on your favorite new projects, and then it executes those trades as soon as liquidity kicks in. On top of this, Snorter safeguards you against honeypots, rug pulls, front-running, and even complicated MEV attacks, ensuring you don’t have to put up with any turbulence while trading. Buying $SNORT now could give you a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make ~800% returns in just a few months – the token could reach 0.94 by year-end, according to our $SNORT price prediction . Moreover, $SNORT holders also unlock additional privileges, such as: Unlimited daily swiping Detailed market insights for better trading decisions Staking rewards, currently 110% p.a. Reduced trading fees: just 0.85% vs. 1.5% for non-holders Keep in mind, though, that the $SNORT presale (which has already raised over $4.4M) is now in its final stages. Grab your $SNORT tokens today – the presale ends in just 11 days. 3. BNB ($BNB) – Hottest Mainstream Crypto Right Now with More Upside Left Forget Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or XRP; BNB ($BNB) has been the biggest blue-chip crypto gainer in recent months. The token has rallied over 125% since April and is currently trading around the $1,300 mark. Even better, while the token’s one-sided rally might otherwise warrant some hesitation for new investors right now, experts believe that waiting for a pullback on this bullet train could be a bad idea. According to ChatGPT’s BNB price prediction , the token could be well on its way to hit the $2,500 mark before the end of 2025, largely because of where it’s coming from. BNB’s latest rally stems from the breakout of a rising-wedge consolidation zone that the token took more than four years to finally break past. The AI arrived at a $2,500 price target after measuring the width of this consolidation pattern and mapping it onto BNB’s breakout level. Fancy some $BNB? Buy it now on Binance or any other crypto exchange. Recap : With gold soaring past $4K and Bitcoin ETFs on the verge of a liquidity explosion, now’s the perfect time to load up on explode-worthy tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , and BNB ($BNB).

His road here was not clean or comfortable. He grew up on the Upper West Side of New York City, went to public schools in Hell’s Kitchen, and enrolled in computer science at New York University. But he dropped out before finishing. By 2019, he was living in a small Lower East Side apartment, so broke that he made a list of his belongings to see what he could sell to cover rent. According to Shayne, that is where the story of Polymarket began. By then, crypto was full of scams and shady schemes. Shayne was fed up. He turned to the writings of economist Robin Hanson, who had been pushing the idea of prediction markets as a better way to see what people actually thought would happen in the future. Shayne later wrote on X that the idea was “too good of an idea to just exist in whitepapers.” Then the pandemic arrived, and people were stuck at home. He believed they would want something new to bet on besides sports or stocks. So, from his bathroom, he started coding Polymarket. The platform went live in June 2020. Polymarket battles the government The product was fast and raw. Regulators didn’t like it. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ruled that Polymarket was operating illegally, and U.S. users were blocked. Still, the platform kept growing. People wanted to bet on elections, interest rate cuts, or who would be Time Magazine’s Person of the Year. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election, users put down more than $3 billion. A week later, FBI agents raided Shayne’s apartment, seizing his devices. The company called the move “obvious political retribution.” This was not the first time Shayne and his company had to deal with the CFTC. In 2022, Polymarket agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle allegations of illegal trading. The company did not admit wrongdoing but kept U.S. users blocked. By July 2025, the Justice Department and the CFTC had both dropped their cases. That same month, Polymarket announced it had acquired QCEX, a licensed exchange and clearinghouse, for $112 million. With that deal, Polymarket could finally bring back legal U.S. operations. Investors bet on Shayne The money around Shayne kept rising. Before this year, Polymarket raised $255 million. Backers included Peter Thiel, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, and Blockchain Capital. In 2024, 1789 Capital also invested. That deal came with Donald Trump Jr. joining the company as an adviser in August, while also advising rival Kalshi. The biggest news dropped when Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, announced it would put up to $2 billion into Polymarket at an $8 billion valuation. ICE’s CEO Jeffrey Sprecher is married to Kelly Loeffler, who now leads the Small Business Administration under President Donald Trump. That connection makes Polymarket’s ties to Washington even deeper. Shayne’s competitors are growing too. Kalshi, through a partnership with Robinhood, began offering prediction contracts. Robinhood reported over 2 billion trades in the third quarter. That growth put pressure on gambling giants. On the day ICE’s deal with Polymarket was revealed, shares of Caesars Entertainment and DraftKings both fell more than 5%. Now, Shayne’s company is the largest prediction market in the world, handling over $3.2 billion in bets on the 2024 election alone and getting heavy media coverage. From buying cheap Ethereum in 2014, to building Polymarket from his bathroom in 2020, to fighting raids and penalties, Shayne has made it into a position no one else his age has ever reached. He is the youngest billionaire on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , and for him, the bets keep going. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Annual record number of auction transactions, substantial market paradigm shift, AI influences PARIS, Oct. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — With Frieze London about to kick off, followed by Art Basel Paris, Artprice News ® announces the release of its 31st Contemporary Art Market Annual Report, in which Artprice by Artmarket presents and analyses the densest Contemporary and Ultra-Contemporary art market (see our methodology at the end of this press release) the world has ever seen. Artprice News lifts the veil on the current state of the Contemporary Art Market with analysis by Artprice’s econometrics department. As galleries, auction houses, and art advisors examine the causes and consequences of the slowdown in the global art market, the 31st Artprice by Artmarket Report provides a detailed analysis of the Contemporary Art auction market. It exposes both the drivers and the extent of the contraction, but also highlights a number of positive signals: the rise of female artists, the emergence of new scenes, and the emergence of AI, which represents a genuine paradigm shift. More than just an inventory, this report outlines the key trends in tomorrow’s market. Meanwhile, in order to remain focused on market trends on a regular basis, Artprice has just launched a new press agency, Artprice News , with its long-standing partner Cision PR Newswire. With nearly 30 years of experience as a World Leader in Art Market Information, we will now be publishing daily global art market news in 122 countries and 11 languages. With Artprice News ®, Artprice is supplementing the weekly publication of its ArtMarket Insight® with a daily global news feed that runs 24/7. This initiative will allow Artprice by Artmarket to suplement its famous annual reports with the analysis of its proprietary AI tool, Intuitive ArtMarket®, and its partnership with Perplexity AI, giving users access to an unfathomable volume of data and parameters in its proprietary AI application, Blind Spot®. Artprice – which owns the world’s largest collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues dating back to 1700 – is currently absorbing a colossal volume of historical information into its proprietary AI, Intuitive Artmarket®. This data will be tokenized for use in the next Global Art Market Annual Report (the 32nd edition) to be published in March 2026. Loyal readers will therefore have access to a whole new world. Incidentally, in response to a request by Artmarket.com ‘s board of auditors, Artprice’s collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues has recently (January 2025) been valued at 43 million euros, and it is of course, the primary foundation for Artprice by Artmarket’s proprietary AI tools. Artprice’s annual art market reports are now capable of highlighting extremely complex transversal artistic trends which largely escape the academic, institutional, and commercial spheres. A fractured top and bottom? One quarter of global art auction turnover may have evaporated in a single year, but the auction market has never been so busy: auction houses have in fact recorded a record number of transactions for Contemporary Art. A premium segment running out of steam, but with far more artists, more lots on offer and more traffic than ever. Over the past year, works by tens of thousands of contemporary artists have been sold through auctions around the world, and the scope of acquisition possibilities has never been broader. One in five of these artists was new to the auction market, and many of these were under forty years old. A new generation is therefore emerging, tracing the contours of tomorrow’s market. The art market’s affordable segment (under $5,000 or even under $1,000) is continuing to grow, fueled by online sales. Cheap and easy to access, this segment is attracting a young, connected clientele hungry for works in tune with their times and concerns, in line with their vision of a new, multi-polar world, both geopolitically, philosophically, and digitally with AI. According to Thierry Ehrmann , CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: “Affordable artworks are experiencing a tsunami of interest. Indeed, this interest prompted us to meet with senior executives of the main global auction houses in NY and Beijing to discuss ways of promoting artworks priced between $5,000 and $15,000 and open up to sales in cryptocurrencies, now conducted mainly by ETFs since 2024, after the United States approved the Bitcoin spot ETF as well as the Ethereum spot ETF. Giants like BlackRock (iShares Bitcoin Trust) and Fidelity now offer these products that directly replicate the price of Bitcoin/Ethereum. They are tradable like traditional stocks and eliminate all technical ownership risks. Almost three years ago, Artprice by Artmarket moved to quote all of its art catalog databases in Bitcoin and Ethereum, including price fluctuations since March 2010 (birth of Bitcoin), in addition to the 8 international currencies that already existed in our databases . This initiative raised our database consultations in cryptocurrencies from 2% to 36%. Today, this means that the 300 new millionaire art collectors are mostly young computer scientists between 25 and 40 years old who own Bitcoin and Ethereum. These new art buyers are seeking a form of social recognition that they find in the purchase of art, and particularly in digital artworks with the emergence of AI, which represents a genuine paradigm shift in art. Based on its long-nurtured expertise in AI (since 1987 with Groupe Serveur, its parent company, its proprietary AI Intuitive Artmarket® and its recent collaboration with Perplexity) Artprice predicts that compared with today’s several hundred generative AI creators, the future will see the emergence of billions of creators of all ages and professions, among whom several million will emerge to radically expand the volume of the art market like never before in its history. At the premium end of the spectrum, the market’s powerhouses are marking time: six-digit results have fallen sharply. Hong Kong’s art auction turnover is half the average of the last ten years, and the picture is not much better in London and New York. The most powerful marketplaces – the United States, China, and the UK – currently account for more than three-quarters of global art auction turnover. Meanwhile, Paris now stands out as the world’s most dynamic capital in transaction volumes, ahead of London and New York. New scenes and new faces Our auction data also reflects the emergence of new scenes and the emergence of new faces. The Japanese scene is confirming its influence beyond Takashi Murakami and Yoshitomo Nara. Female artists are reaching important new milestones, breaking records and challenging the long-established hierarchy. As screens of all sizes become increasingly present in our daily lives, the Contemporary Art Market has every opportunity to explode. Digital images, promoted by a multitude of outlets dedicated to digital artworks, now have a quality of definition beyond what the human eye (the sensor) and the brain (the actual generator of the image) can observe. Screens now offer exceptional resolution at a cost that has been divided by ten in just a few years. Moreover, the creation of digital artworks, based on AI prompts, offers artists infinite possibilities without having to learn computer programming (which constituted a real obstacle to artistic creation). The best auction result so far for an AI artwork was hammered for Ai-Da Robot’s A.I. God. Portrait of Alan Turing (2024) on 11 July 2024, fetching $1.1 million at Sotheby’s New York. This sumptuous work is a tribute to Alan Turing, a true pioneer of AI, who, thanks to cryptanalysis, deciphered the Nazi Enigma Code, enabling the Allies to win WWII. Prosecuted in 1952 for his homosexuality, Alan Turing was sentenced to chemical castration and decided to end his life by taking cyanide on 8 June 1954. Queen Elizabeth II recognized him as a war hero and granted him a posthumous royal pardon in 2013. Faced with this paradigm shift, auction houses are rethinking their strategies like never before, and, with rare audacity, collectors are redefining their priorities, and young buyers are imposing new codes. Contemporary art is therefore not on hold: it is changing course and paving the way for a more inclusive, more fluid, and more diverse ecosystem. Artprice News ® focus on the fate of blue chips. From the destiny of blue-chip artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Banksy, and Marlene Dumas, to the unexpected breakthrough of new artists via an ever-broadening spectrum of marketplaces and the digital revolution, Artprice’s 2025 Contemporary Art Market Report is a dive into the underlying dynamics of a rapidly changing market. A market where every dataset tells a story and where every trend already outlines the contours of tomorrow’s market. More than just a statistical inventory, this 31st global report suggests what the future may look like. It also focuses on opportunities that can be seized in a fractured market, which artists are on an upward trajectory despite the prevailing caution, and which scenes are emerging while others are slowing down.

Lookonchain posted on X Thursday that the wallet, identified as 0x94ac8d…4e22eaa1c, bought and sold millions of BNBHolder tokens within 40 minutes. The trader spent 4 BNB, valued at approximately $5,245, to purchase 41.11 million BNBHolder tokens. Soon after, they sold 33.55 million tokens for 956 BNB, equivalent to about $1.25 million, while retaining a balance of 7.55 million tokens, then valued at roughly $906,000. Together, the realized and unrealized profits amounted to over $2.15 million, a return of more than 41,000%, or roughly 410 times the initial investment. Memecoin trader sells BNBHolder, traders count over $2 million in profits Blockchain transaction data, as of 7:30 UTC from BscScan, corroborated the trades, showing transactions between the wallet and the Binance DEX of approximately 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 BNBHolder tokens being transferred and sold. This guy turned $5,245 into $2.16M in just 40 minutes, a 410x return! He spent 4 $BNB ($5,245) to buy 41.11M $BNBHolder and sold 33.55M $BNBHolder for 956 $BNB ($1.25M), leaving 7.55M $BNBHolder ($906K). In just 40 minutes, he made a profit of over $2.15M (+41,088%). Address:… pic.twitter.com/rAyXUesx9U — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 9, 2025 The trade frenzy came shortly after Binance Wallet’s “ MemeRush ” feature went live, a new platform element enabling users to discover and trade meme tokens directly through Binance’s decentralized ecosystem. According to Lookonchain, within less than an hour of MemeRush’s debut, 13 wallets had already recorded more than $1 million each in profits from BNBHolder. Screenshots shared by the analytics firm showed the top-performing accounts had realized profits between $1.2 million and $2.9 million, with token holdings still worth hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time. BNBHolder’s token metrics displayed an overall market capitalization exceeding $70 million, with liquidity above $4 million and a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $298 million. As of the time of this publication, the memecoin’s price hovered around $0.$0.07271 per token, according to data from DEXScreener. Community asks questions over developer wallet origins Several accounts on X are claiming they have reaped some of the “pump” benefits and are promoting the memecoin, which is why some traders are concerned about how the BNBHolder token originated. One user noted that the developer’s wallet was newly created, and they have been solely farming funds from the whole ecosystem since. The dev of $BNBHolder farm is a fresh wallet. Instead of being farmed by 200 devs in SOL, in BSC we get farmed by the same 10 people https://t.co/EMB8pSqkQU pic.twitter.com/n02RwWG16J — Melardev (@uhonyn) October 9, 2025 The trader added that the developer did not buy tokens through a fair launch but instead minted or created the token directly from a fresh address “for the love of the game,” and to bring the “player versus environment” to Binance Smart Chain . Several on-chain observers have also flagged potential insider trading behavior connected to wallets repeatedly appearing in early meme token trades. One analyst pointed to a wallet address, 0x44440f…2db017d03, that made more than $700,000 in unrealized profit from BNBHolder trades in the first hour of the MemeRush launch. Additional wallets bearing similar hexadecimal prefixes (starting with “0x4444”) were also identified as having invested different meme tokens, including memerush and trillions, showing cumulative profits exceeding $1.3 million. “Trillions was an obvious play because the list of Plasma tokens had less than 10 tokens. Yet Trillions didn’t have the positioning for people to make $ 1m, despite reaching a 60m ATH. So now go and believe I am just coping and it is NOT farmed,” said one crypto and Web3 enthusiast using the pseudonym Melardev on X. The overlapping wallet patterns have led the community to believe these accounts belong to Binance insiders or coordinated groups that have early access to new meme token launches. As reported by Cryptopolitan early Thursday, Binance Wallet’s MemeRush program shows the most trending meme tokens and facilitates trading through a decentralized interface in conjunction with launchpad Four.meme .

Yet, despite this growth and sophistication, most crypto market participants across the globe continue to cling to one metric – market capitalization. It remains the primary way people assess and rank cryptocurrencies by multiplying the total supply by the current price per coin, giving a snapshot of each asset’s value in the market. Institutions, too, did the same for years, viewing the entire crypto market primarily through a bitcoin lens. However, they have since moved to more sophisticated and reliable investment analysis methods, according to Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Investments, which manages over $15 billion in assets. ""Historically, institutions viewed the entire crypto market as similar to bitcoin, essentially digital gold, and made broader decisions based on market cap. However, they are gradually recognizing that the crypto space is more diverse, much like the stock market, with each project offering unique use cases and value propositions,"" Horsley told CoinDesk during the Token2049 conference in Singapore last week. ""This realization is fostering a shift from a size-based approach to a more nuanced, stock-like strategy of asset selection,"" he added. A stock-picking strategy is an investment approach where funds select individual stocks with strong potential for growth or value. Unlike passive investing, where funds track a broad market index, stock picking involves detailed analysis of companies' financial health, industry position, and other factors to identify opportunities for higher returns. According to Horsley, institutions are increasingly doing the same in the crypto market, choosing to invest in coins based on their fundamentals. Beyond bitcoin Horsley’s response came after he was asked whether Bitwise, as an asset manager, faced difficulties convincing institutions to invest in assets beyond bitcoin. The question arose because, at the Dubai conference, a prominent bitcoin DeFi investor told CoinDesk that BTC, often seen as digital gold, is easier for investors to understand and has attracted billions of dollars. In contrast, institutions often struggle to grasp Ethereum, Solana, and other smart contract blockchains, along with the complexities of staking, yield generation, and related dynamics, including regulatory aspects. The growing willingness to explore cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin is evident from the number of new ETFs launched this year targeting alternative digital assets, including joke cryptocurrency DOGE. Recently, Bitwise filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot exchange-traded fund focused on Avalanche’s AVAX token. Shift in strategy The stock-like investing strategy aligns well with today’s macroeconomic environment, which differs significantly from that of 2020. Back then, interest rates were near zero across the developed world, including the U.S., and inflation was practically nonexistent. This rare combination sparked an ""everything rally,"" where even the most obscure altcoins and memecoins soared in value. Today, however, U.S. interest rates sit around 4%, with bond yields roughly matching that level, and inflation remains stubbornly high. In this climate, only crypto assets with strong fundamentals and proven quality are likely to thrive, much like analysts picking individual stocks based on fundamentals. Several experts, including Economist Mohamed El-Erian and stock market historian and global equity strategist Russel Napier, have suggested using the strategy for stock market investing . According to them, the current era of financial repression, inflation and fiscal dominance warrants clever structuring and dynamic asset allocation, in short, stock picking. Is bitcoin still a store of value? One of the most heated debates since institutions and corporate treasuries began accumulating bitcoin is whether it serves better as a store of value or as a payment network. This debate matters because on-chain activity has significantly slowed, prompting one observer to note , ""bitcoin is at an all-time high, yet the blocks are completely empty."" This situation is especially concerning for miners, who face periodic halving of block rewards about every four years. They may prefer bitcoin to evolve as a payments network to sustain transaction fees, rather than solely as a store of value. Horsley believes both roles are possible for bitcoin, but likely one at a time, rather than simultaneously. ""Currently, bitcoin is being widely recognized and accepted as a store of value. Once it gains acceptance among governments, corporations, and institutions, and they hold it as a valuable asset, the next logical step is for it to be used for transactions,"" he said. ""However, for bitcoin to be used as a payment method, it first needs to be acknowledged and adopted as a legitimate store of value."" ""Why would someone want to pay with it if they haven't yet agreed on its value?"" he asked. When asked about bitcoin DeFi and other developmental efforts, Horsley said that he is ""encouraged by the work done in the payments space, including initiatives like Lightning and David Marcus’s Lightspark."" Bitcoin Lightning is a second-layer scaling solution that enables faster, lower-cost, and higher-volume transactions by processing payments off-chain through payment channels. A different cycle Lastly, Horsley commented on the widely discussed four-year Bitcoin cycle tied to the quadrennial halving event. Historically, the bull market has tended to peak around 16 to 18 months after each halving. Given that the last halving occurred in April 2024, this timeline suggests the possibility of a bear market emerging in the coming months. Previous bear markets following halving cycles have seen bitcoin prices decline by 80% or more from their bull market highs. The 2022 bear market was marked by the collapses of major players like the stablecoin project Terra, the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund, and the FTX exchange, each causing massive wealth destruction across the crypto ecosystem. Similarly, the 2018 bear market saw the bursting of the ICO bubble and regulatory crackdowns on crypto trading in China and South Korea—two countries that accounted for a significant share of global trading volume at the time. Do we have similar catalysts this time? It's a good thought exercise, Horsley said. ""The four-year cycle in Bitcoin has traditionally been characterized by a bear market, often triggered by an unexpected and significant counterparty event. Whether history will repeat itself and lead to a downtrend next year largely depends on whether such a counterparty blowup can occur again. The potential candidates for such a shock are now fewer, as the ecosystem has matured and diversified,"" he noted. Horsley added that if the bear arrives at all, the downside volatility could be much milder than in the past, when prices collapsed by over 80% from peaks. The cryptocurrency market has matured, with BTC volatility trending lower throughout the ongoing bull market, exhibiting Wall Street-like dynamics .",Markets|Exclusive|Bitwise|Hunter Horsley|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-09 12:00:00

The government in Moscow has been trying to bring the whole business out of the shadows, but despite legalizing it last year, less than a third of Russian miners are registered with the federal tax authority. Russian state misses 10 billion rubles in tax revenue from mining Russia is failing to collect a massive amount of money as a result of tax evasion and unauthorized activities in the cryptocurrency mining sector, according to an observer of the field. Speaking to Russian media, Pyotr Fyodorov, associate professor at the National Research University of Electronic Technology (MIET), estimated: “Around 10 billion rubles a year (more than $122 million) are lost in taxes in Russia due to illegal mining.” Most of the underground crypto farms can be found in two regions with high concentrations of mining operations, the Siberian Irkutsk Oblast and the Republic of Dagestan in the North Caucasus. They are often built at abandoned industrial or agricultural sites in rural areas that still have access to the power grid, Fyodorov elaborated further in an interview with the 78 TV channel. The engineer emphasized that these facilities can be identified by the significant spikes in electricity overconsumption or frequent breakdowns of the distribution network in the area. Majority of Russian crypto miners evade taxation Crypto mining is one of the few, if not the only, properly regulated crypto-related activities in Russia, which recognized it as a legitimate business in 2024 in order to tap into its profits and exploit the vast country’s competitive advantages in terms of cheap energy and cool climate. To legally engage in mining, both companies and individual entrepreneurs are required to register with the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and pay their dues to the state. Home miners are exempted from this obligation as long as they use less than 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly. Energy shortages, caused by the mining boom in parts of the country such as the two regions mentioned by Fyodorov, have been more or less addressed with local, seasonal or permanent restrictions . While the Ministry of Energy recently indicated it sees no reason to expand existing regional bans on cryptocurrency mining, tax evasion in the sector remains a challenge for Russian authorities on the federal level. Speaking at the “Digital Finance: New Economic Reality” forum recently, Russia’s Deputy Minister of Finance Ivan Chebeskov revealed that only around 30% of participants in coin mining activities have so far registered with the FNS, and the government is preparing to increase that figure. One of the proposed measures, discussed with the Federal Customs Service, is an amnesty for imported mining equipment that has not been duly registered. Another is a new draft law introducing harsher penalties for illegal crypto miners, something that the country’s power grid operator Rosseti has called for as well. The finance ministry official also stressed the need for Russia to develop its own infrastructure for mining and everything else related to cryptocurrencies. Quoted by the Bits.media crypto news outlet, Chebeskov explained: “A full-fledged infrastructure is necessary to work with virtual assets. By full-fledged, we mean clear rules of the game, including the ability to convert cryptocurrency into fiat, and more active use of crypto for settlements and investment purposes.” “We are gradually moving towards this goal,” remarked the deputy head of the Russian Treasury, noting that his department is already working with the Central Bank of Russia to develop the domestic crypto infrastructure within the “experimental legal regime” for crypto operations established in the country.

More attractive buy levels await below. What’s next for the $ETH price? $ETH price heads for $4,300 and strong horizontal support Source: TradingView Major resistance was retested on Tuesday, which led to an immediate and sharp rejection for the $ETH price . Since that time, $ETH has fallen as much as 9%, with perhaps more to go before buyers start to come in. The signs are that the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $4,300 could be the first place for a potential bounce, but this will likely depend on how the $BTC price is performing. Given that Bitcoin might still fall a bit further, the same could be true for $ETH . The 0.618 golden retracement level may be favourite, although there is even the possibility of a continued dip down to the major horizontal support, which coincides with the 0.786 Fibonacci level. $ETH bounce soon? Source: TradingView The daily chart for the $ETH price illustrates how it is at an important juncture right now. The price is just dipping below the 50-day SMA, but appears to be holding the $4,300 horizontal level as support. The small upward trendline has broken, and today’s candle looks to have confirmed the breakdown. Either the price will bounce from here, or there could be further downside towards the major support. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator is shown to have rejected from the main downtrend line, and has come back to test a shorter descending trendline. Given that this coincides with the 50.00 level and the yellow moving average line, a bounce could be quite likely. $ETH bull flag forms on higher time frame Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly time frame a pleasant surprise awaits in the form of a bull flag. It can be seen that the $ETH price has tried to escape the flag both to the upside and to the downside - each time so far proving to be a fakeout, with the price then rejected back inside the flag. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators look to be rapidly descending to the base of the range. It could take at least another couple of weeks or so for them to fully descend. Once they turn back up and pass the 20.00 level, this will signal strong upside price momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

IBIT has seen rapid growth since its launch in January 2024. As of October 7th, the fund, which held 798,747 BTC, reached 802,257 BTC after a net inflow of $426 million (approximately 3,510 BTC) in one day. This amount corresponds to approximately 3.8% of Bitcoin's total supply. This performance put BlackRock ahead of MicroStrategy's institutional reserves of 640,000 BTC. On the same day, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw total inflows of $440 million, with IBIT alone seeing net inflows of $4.1 billion over the past eight days. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT led all ETFs with $3.5 billion in weekly inflows. “Spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently experiencing the strongest period in their history,” said Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth. As the Bitcoin price rose to $121,500 with this rise, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink once again confirmed that IBIT is the “fastest-growing ETF in history.” *This is not investment advice.

On-chain data shows that daily transactions on the Solana blockchain have collapsed by nearly 50%. It fell from around 125 million on July 24 to roughly 64 million now. This decline comes as SOL has rallied more than 24% over the past 60 days. As of now, Solana faces a critical week on the regulatory front. The US SEC is reviewing multiple spot Solana ETF filings from major issuers. This includes VanEck, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton, with key deadlines due Friday. Applications from Bitwise and 21Shares will follow by mid-October. Is the SOL rally built on hype? According to the CryptoQuant report, Solana price has climbed from late September lows of $191 to trade near $230 this week. The divergence of rising prices alongside falling usage caught analysts’ attention. They added that in a healthy uptrend, prices usually move in line with growing network demand. However, in this case, the opposite is happening, which suggests that speculation and not fundamentals may be driving the rally. The full picture depends on the type of transactions that have dropped. The report mentioned that around 80–90% of Solana’s total transactions are “voting” transactions. They were tied to its consensus mechanism. If the decline is mostly from those, then it might not be a red flag. It added that if user activity in DeFi, NFTs, and transfers is falling, then it raises questions about how sustainable the current price move really is.

According to notes shared on Thursday by Nicolas Consigny, protocol supporter and coordinator at the Foundation, Kohaku is a “set of primitives that provides wallets with security and privacy.” Its development uses an open-source software development kit (SDK) and a reference wallet implementation for advanced users. Consigny explained that the SDK will deploy privacy and security features that can be integrated by other wallets “either in full or in parts that they care about.” Ethereum Foundation: Kohaku improves dapps security The Ethereum Foundation notes mentioned that the idea of developing Kohaku came from its efforts to build a browser extension with similar capabilities. The extension is a fork of the Ambire wallet meant for developers and “power users” who value privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem. Development will prioritize mainnet support before expanding to Layer 2 networks that are at least stage one and committed to progressing toward stage two. Kohaku’s plugin architecture allows developers to choose privacy modules that make wallet customization easier and future-proof. The Foundation plans to progressively introduce new privacy protocols into this plugin list and add private functionality within applications. Consigny wrote that in the first phase of deploying the plugin, Helios light client will be added directly into the browser extension for users to validate blockchain data locally without external Remote Procedure Call (RPC) dapp providers. This feature, he noted, removes the “need to trust RPC providers for validity.” Multi-layered privacy in sending and receiving assets The Ethereum Foundation sees Kohaku as the way to add several layers of private interaction in sending and receiving assets and private payment requests, all routed through various privacy protocols. Users will have access to an aggregated view of their balances across enabled privacy systems protected by traffic obfuscation, prevention of IP leakage, and transparent support for private addresses. “The wallet has RPC hijacking in cases where decentralized applications enforce their own RPC systems in support of asset discovery through ERC-7811 standards,” the Foundation expounded. Additionally, Kohaku limits developers to one account per decentralized application (dApp) by default. Each new connection will ask users to generate a separate address to minimize data linkage between different activities. It will introduce a “wallet connection kit,” a privacy-first protocol for peer-to-peer JSON-RPC connectivity. EF is testing social recovery tools leaning towards zero-knowledge verification methods, including “ZKemail,” “ZKpassport,” and “Anon Adhar.” These tools could standardize recovery processes and uphold what Consigny coined “maximally-intermediary-free.” Security researchers on Kohaku have come up with a “Post-Quantum killswitch” for token holders to enable post-quantum accounts using Falcon or Dilithium verifiers, optimized for Solidity. This could protect assets against the much-feared quantum computing , which developers argue could compromise Ether’s Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Beyond making changes to wallet software, Kohaku proposes a “universal Ethereum-app for hardware” to take away vendor lock-in and provide open access to advanced features. Complementing this, the team is developing a zero-knowledge hardware signer based on the Jubjub and Bandersnatch curves, all compatible with existing privacy protocols. The SDK and reference wallet will also incorporate spending policy tools like assigning specific spending limits for different signers. There is optional peer-to-peer transaction broadcasting for those who would like to send transactions directly through the Ethereum network and bypass centralized RPC nodes entirely. What’s in the Kohaku post-launch phase? Kohaku’s initial release tackles privacy and SDK integration, but the Foundation has promised to create a native Ethereum browser that runs close to the system kernel, improving security for decentralized application interfaces. Consigny said it would support IPFS-based user interfaces, security-oriented front-end languages, and improved peer-to-peer networking. The roadmap further mentions experimentation with AI systems that assess transaction risk levels without transmitting sensitive user information, referred to as “local AI transaction scoring.” It could help users identify malicious or high-risk smart contract interactions privately. Consigny also wrote about the Foundation’s intent to develop new models for social recovery of private data, such as privacy wallet secrets and zero-knowledge proof-based badges (zkPOAPs). According to the roadmap, complete privacy will require native account abstraction supported directly by the Ethereum protocol, slated to move ahead in 2026. The “privacy-preserving account abstraction,” uses client-side zero-knowledge proof systems like ZK-EVM or ZK-RISC-V to verify wallet control.

52895137,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=835538,1760016617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52895137.jpeg,"The Old Bitcoin Rules No Longer Apply, Arthur Hayes Warns",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/old-bitcoin-rules-no-longer-apply-arthur-hayes/,"Arthur Hayes argues that Bitcoin’s widely cited four-year halving cycle has broken down and that macro liquidity—not protocol mechanics—will dictate the next leg of the market. In a new essay titled “Long Live the King!” published on October 9, 2025, the BitMEX co-founder contends that policy choices in Washington and Beijing are setting up a structurally easier money regime that should keep pushing BTC higher, even as many traders look for a textbook cycle peak. “The four-year anniversary of this fourth cycle is upon us,” he writes, but those applying the old pattern “miss why it will fail this time.” The 4-Year Bitcoin Cycle Is Dead Hayes’ framework is explicit: the price of money and its quantity are the dominant variables for risk assets, and Bitcoin’s USD value rises and falls with dollar liquidity. “Bitcoin in the current state of human civilization is the best form of money ever created,” he says, yet its dollar price “will ebb and flow ‌because of the price and supply of dollars.” He extends the lens to China, arguing that the yuan credit impulse has historically amplified or dampened crypto cycles alongside US conditions. To make the case that halving-anchored timing is obsolete, Hayes revisits four eras and links each to turning points in dollar and yuan liquidity. The “Genesis Cycle” (2009–2013) rode post-GFC quantitative easing and a surge in Chinese credit until both decelerated into 2013, “popp[ing] the Bitcoin bubble.” Related Reading: From Greed To Fear: Expert Says 2026 Bitcoin Bubble Will Dwarf 2017 The “ICO Cycle” (2013–2017) was powered less by dollars than by “a fuck ton of yuan sloshing around the global money markets,” as the China credit impulse spiked in 2015 amid a yuan devaluation, before tightening and higher U.S. rates ended the run. The “COVID Hoax” period (2017–2021)—Hayes’ label for the pandemic-era policy response—saw “helicopter money” under President Donald Trump and a rapid doubling of dollar supply with rates pinned at zero, propelling all risk assets, including crypto, until inflation forced tightening in late 2021. In the current “New World Order” phase (2021–?), Hayes argues that liquidity plumbing, not halvings, explains Bitcoin’s resilience. He highlights the US Treasury’s issuance tilt toward short-dated bills, which drained the Fed’s reverse repo facility and “unleashed ~$2.5 trillion of liquidity into the markets,” and he characterizes this as a political choice to “run the economy hot.” Related Reading: Veteran Macro Strategist Says Bitcoin Is Entering A 1950s-Style Supercycle He links the macro pivot directly to today’s setup: “The Fed resumed cutting interest rates in September even though inflation is above its own target,” while the administration seeks to “lower the cost of housing” and loosen bank regulation to spur lending to “critical industries.” In Hayes’ reading, the policy signals are unambiguous: “money shall be cheaper and more plentiful.” China, in his view, won’t reprise the extreme credit surges of 2009 or 2015, but it also won’t be a headwind. While Beijing grappled with deflationary pressure and a property-sector reckoning, Hayes expects pragmatism to prevail: “When the economic pressure proves too intense… Chinese policymakers print money.” The upshot, he says, is that China may not drive global fiat creation, “but it won’t hinder it either.” The unifying thesis is that cycles have always been monetary cycles wearing different masks. Bitcoin’s earlier peaks coincided with decelerating dollar and yuan liquidity; its latest advance reflects a new alignment of political priorities with easier money, regardless of the halving calendar. Hayes puts it bluntly: “Listen to our monetary masters in Washington and Beijing. They clearly state that money shall be cheaper and more plentiful. Therefore, Bitcoin continues to rise in anticipation of this highly probable future.” His closing line distills the claim to a coronation metaphor: “The king is dead, long live the king!” At press time, BTC traded at $122,147.

52895201,602308,1760016648,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Solana Staking ETF Moves Closer To SEC Approval After Key Filing,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-staking-etf-closer-sec-approval/,"Bitwise Asset Management has updated its proposed Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) to explicitly include “Staking” in the fund’s name and disclosed a 0.20% unitary sponsor fee—one of the lowest headline fees yet seen for a US crypto ETF. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart flagged the amendment late Wednesday, writing: “NEW: Bitwise files an update to their Solana ETF filing to include Staking in the name and provides the fee. Fee will be 0.20%.” In follow-up posts, Seyffart added that “no fee for the first 3 months and for the first $1 billion in AUM [assets under management]” would apply—an aggressive launch incentive mirroring the fee-war playbook that helped turbocharge spot bitcoin ETFs at the start of the year. Eric Balchunas, his colleague at Bloomberg, underscored the move’s competitiveness: “Bitwise not playing around, plans to charge just 0.20% for their spot Solana ETF.” Solana Staking ETF Launch Date Remains Unclear The amendment signals that issuers and the Securities and Exchange Commission have narrowed outstanding issues on the structure of spot Solana products that incorporate staking, a feature unique to proof-of-stake assets. Earlier in the year, the SEC asked prospective Solana ETF sponsors to submit updated S-1 registration statements —widely interpreted as a pre-launch step once substantive policy questions are settled. Timing remains the key variable. The US government shutdown that began on October 1 has forced the SEC onto skeleton staffing, slowing most non-urgent reviews and stalling a broad slate of securities registrations. With more than 90% of the SEC’s staff furloughed, routine offering and listing processes are largely paused—an overhang that could push back crypto ETF effective dates even as the paperwork advances. As Seyffart put it when asked whether a shutdown would delay approval: “Yes. I believe so.” Even with that backdrop, Bitwise’s pricing telegraphs a confident, bare-knuckle approach to market share. A 20-basis-point fee places the proposed Solana Staking ETF at or below the lower end of the fee spectrum that helped bitcoin ETFs achieve mass adoption , and it lands amid a broader “fee-first” arms race that has repeatedly proven decisive in ETFs’ opening months. Balchunas has long argued that “low fees have an almost perfect record in attracting investors,” a pattern that crypto ETPs have closely followed. What happens next will hinge on two tracks. Procedurally, the SEC must allow updated S-1s to go effective before trading can begin; practically, the shutdown will dictate when staff can finalize those reviews. Strategically, Bitwise’s decision to enshrine staking in the fund’s name and to lead with an ultra-low fee sets the competitive tone for rival Solana filings, and—once Washington reopens—positions the product to capitalize on pent-up demand the moment the window clears. In parallel to Bitwise, other spot SOL issuers on the SEC’s docket include VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary—each facing final 240-day decision dates on October 16, 2025—alongside Grayscale’s proposed conversion of its Solana trust, which carries an earlier October 10, 2025 deadline. Franklin Templeton’s final date is November 14, 2025, Fidelity’s is December 5, 2025, and an Invesco Galaxy product runs to April 16, 2026. These dates reflect the SEC’s 19b-4 clock that began when Cboe first filed to list the SOL ETFs; S-1 effectiveness would still be required for trading to commence.

In an interview, Gilbertie explained why his firm chose to support XRP, emphasizing its practical role in connecting traditional finance with blockchain technology. His comments reinforced a growing view that XRP’s strength lies in functionality rather than speculation. Teucrium’s Endorsement and Ripple’s Professional Reputation Gilbertie praised Ripple, the company utilizing XRP for cross-border payments , for its professionalism and well-organized structure. He explained that Teucrium’s decision to align with XRP was driven by the company’s integrity and technical focus, not by market predictions. Comparing the asset to Bitcoin , he described Bitcoin as a store of value but emphasized that XRP offers real-world utility designed to solve payment inefficiencies.

You just listen. pic.twitter.com/dXSJJTKlyP — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) October 7, 2025 Institutional Confidence in Ripple’s Approach Gilbertie also noted that Ripple operates with the same discipline and precision seen in major financial institutions, saying its team “acts like investment bankers” and “knows what they’re doing.” His comments mark a notable acknowledgment from a traditional finance executive familiar with regulated markets. For many, his remarks validated XRP’s credibility within the broader financial system, which has often been hesitant to recognize crypto assets with tangible use cases. Community Reactions Highlight Broader Support The interview gained traction among XRP supporters who viewed Gilbertie’s comments as confirmation of the asset’s growing institutional acceptance.

They suggested that such an environment could attract more investors to XRP and strengthen confidence in its role within the financial landscape. A Shift Toward Utility in Institutional Perspectives Gilbertie’s endorsement comes as more institutions focus on blockchain solutions that emphasize efficiency and regulatory alignment. XRP’s design for real-time settlement and liquidity management makes it a focal point in discussions about modernizing global payments. While Gilbertie avoided making any price predictions, his assessment underscored XRP’s real-world utility and the professionalism behind its development.

Here's Why…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/veteran-analyst-willy-woo-warns-of-an-80-correction-in-bitcoin-heres-why/,"With the start of the historically bullish month of October, expectations for a rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins have increased, while one analyst has warned of an 80 percent correction. At this point, popular analyst Willy Woo warned investors that an 80 percent correction could occur. Although the cryptocurrency market has remained bullish for much of 2025, signs of exhaustion are beginning to emerge, according to analyst Willy Woo. In a recent YouTube video, Woo argued that with global liquidity shrinking, Bitcoin could face an 80 percent correction, mirroring past market trends. Citing the decline in global liquidity as a key risk for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Woo said that current market conditions now resemble previous late-cycle phases that led to major declines. At this point, based on current conditions, Woo estimates that an 80 percent correction in Bitcoin price is more likely, which would be caused not by weak fundamentals but by diminishing global liquidity. Woo acknowledged that the crypto sector is stronger today, with exchange reserves more transparent, regulators more active, and spot ETFs shifting liquidity to regulated markets and less leverage. However, he noted that a more robust market doesn't necessarily make cryptocurrencies immune to decline. Bitcoin still remains dependent on global liquidity flows, and when these flows weaken, the strongest fundamentals are tested by declines, according to Woo. “Liquidity acts as the oxygen of the market. When it expands, prices rise easily. When it contracts, the entire risk curve collapses. In this context, Bitcoin, which is at the top, always gives the first and harshest reaction. While traditional markets can fall by up to a third during recessions, Bitcoin and altcoins typically lose 70-80% of their value. Liquidity injections from the Federal Reserve are also tapering off, diminishing the cash flow that once fueled the rally. Prices remain high, but the capital behind them is weakening. Stronger catalysts can slow the decline, but cannot defy it.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Veteran Analyst Willy Woo Warns of an 80% Correction in Bitcoin!

Market participants are already rotating into high-upside plays with meme, narrative, and infrastructure potential. Among dozens of contenders, Little Pepe stands out in company with Bonk and Pudgy Penguins. Each project occupies a distinct position in the emerging playbook—presale speculation, ecosystem leverage, and NFT-meme fusion. In this environment, bulls see asymmetric reward opportunities if SOL’s momentum drags altcoins upward. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe lives in a rare sweet spot: still in presale, yet already backed by strong capital inflows and a bold technical vision. Currently approaching the tail of Stage 13, the presale price sits near $0.0022, with over $26.4 million raised to date and more than 16.2 billion tokens sold. Those metrics alone mark it as one of the most aggressively funded meme-style presales in 2025. What elevates Little Pepe beyond pure hype is its roadmap. The token is tied into an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 infrastructure built for memes, complete with anti-sniper bot protections, zero transaction tax, and a meme token launchpad. By combining meme appeal with real utility, Little Pepe aims to graduate from speculative play to infrastructure heavyweight. Analysts and outlets have floated 100x upside as a base scenario, citing its early positioning and low entry price. If even a fraction of that thesis plays out, Little Pepe could outperform many altcoins during a broader rally fueled by Solana’s ETF tailwinds. Being in the presale phase allows aggressive buyers to capture a favorable cost basis. Once listings begin and capital rotates into meme/infra hybrids, the ensuing squeeze could drive multiples that mature projects may struggle to match. In short, LILPEPE is currently the highest risk/reward pick among the trio. Bonk (BONK) Bonk carries legacy weight as one of Solana’s most well-known meme tokens. Built into the Solana ecosystem, BONK benefits from ultra-low fees and the potential to leverage Solana’s rising momentum as the ETF narrative intensifies. If Solana’s hype cascades across its native memecoins, BONK could benefit from secondary momentum. In a bullish surge, it might deliver solid multiples relative to its baseline. The key will be timing—buying before momentum returns and holding through Solana’s macro wave. In scenarios where SOL pushes upward strongly, BONK remains a plausible meme play with rebound potential. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Pudgy Penguins occupies an intriguing middle ground—where meme energy, NFT heritage, and real product expansion begin to overlap. In recent weeks, PENGU has ripped higher, surging over 546% in four weeks amid renewed NFT activity and community demand. The token set a new all-time high, surpassing BONK to claim the top spot in Solana’s meme rankings. Observers attribute the move to strong breakout formations, whale accumulation, and revitalized engagement in the underlying NFT collection. Technical charts show clean retests of resistance zones, which often signal continuation in momentum regimes. As SOL hype lifts altcoin appetite, PENGU stands to capture spillover interest—not just from meme traders, but from NFT and community crossover capital. Because PENGU already carries momentum and a stronger foundation than pure meme tokens, it may deliver upside with somewhat less volatility than presale plays. In a market driven by excitement, PENGU’s hybrid character offers both narrative punch and structural depth. Strategic Insight: Riding the Solana Wave As Solana’s ETF prospects gain traction, capital will seek accelerators—tokens that can amplify gains. Little Pepe offers the highest theoretical upside due to its early presale stage and ambitious infrastructure. Bonk is the legacy meme play that could ride Solana’s bounce. PENGU is the bridge between meme culture and real-world projects, with momentum already baked in. In the current climate, meme tokens are no longer purely speculative luxuries—they are being reshaped into infrastructure and narrative vectors. Among the contenders, Little Pepe, Bonk, and Pudgy Penguins stand out not only for their upside potential but for their positioning in a market cocktail of hype, technology, and storytelling. As SOL’s narrative intensifies, these cryptos may not just follow—it’s possible they lead.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it received more than 50 complaints about Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system. The technology, which still needs drivers to stay alert and take control when necessary, has caused cars to behave in ways that break traffic rules, according to the agency. Officials said Tesla vehicles using the system have been reported going through red lights and making unsafe lane changes by driving the wrong way. The agency is examining 58 separate incidents that include 14 accidents and 23 injuries, according to Bloomberg. The probe arrives as lawmakers increase their attention on Tesla’s technology. A new head of NHTSA recently took office. Tesla released a software fix for the system earlier this week, but did not respond to questions about the investigation. Red light violations lead to multiple injuries Six incidents stand out where Tesla cars with the system turned on approached intersections with red lights, kept going anyway, and crashed into other vehicles. Four of these accidents left people injured. This first stage of the investigation could result in Tesla having to recall the vehicles if officials decide they create serious safety problems. One driver from Houston told the agency last year that the system “is not recognizing traffic signals. This results in the vehicle proceeding through red lights and stopping at green lights.” The same driver said Tesla refuses to address the problem, stating: “Tesla doesn’t want to fix it, or even acknowledge the problem, even though they’ve done a test drive with me and seen the issue with their own eyes.” Railroad crossing safety under review Safety officials also plan to look at how the system works near railroad crossings. Two Democratic senators, Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, asked for this investigation last month after hearing about multiple close calls. The Full Self-Driving system, which does more than Tesla’s basic Autopilot feature, has been under federal review for 12 months. Last October, NHTSA started looking into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles with the technology after four crashes happened when visibility was poor from sun glare, fog, or dust. One of those crashes in 2023 caused a fatality. Tesla tells customers the system “will drive you almost anywhere with your active supervision, requiring minimal intervention,” but makes clear it does not turn the car into a truly self-driving vehicle. Other Tesla features have also caught the agency’s attention. In January, officials opened an investigation into 2.6 million vehicles after crashes involving a feature that lets owners move their cars from far away using their phones. NHTSA is currently reviewing Tesla’s self-driving taxi service that started operating in Austin, Texas, this past June. Get seen where it counts.

The company has transitioned from a Bitcoin miner and ETH DAT to a pure ETH DAT with HPC/AI exposure through its WhiteFiber spin-out. At current price levels, BTBT stock is trading at nearly a 13% discount to what I feel is a conservative net asset value estimate. I believe BTBT shares should be priced closer to $4.45. Back in early July, when I last covered Bit Digital ( BTBT ) for Seeking Alpha, I reiterated a cautious sentiment that I have had with the stock going back the last year or so. My BTBT Coverage History (Seeking Alpha) Prior to flipping to more neutral in December 2024, I had written 6 consecutive BTBT articles labeling the stock either a 'buy' or a 'strong buy' between March 2023 and August 2024. My general feeling on Bit Digital over these last few quarters has been that the company betting on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) over Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had been detrimental to its returns due to Ethereum's significant underperformance against the top Digital Asset. That has certainly changed: TrendSpider After bottoming out against Bitcoin in April, Ethereum has performed incredibly well over the last five months. Fundamentally speaking, I'd argue very little has actually changed with the long-term ETH thesis over that period of time. Yet, driven by the surge in Ethereum-based DAT companies in the public equity market, of which Bit Digital can now be considered one, BTBT shares are interesting once again. In this update, we'll get an updated look at a fair value estimate for BTBT shares now that the company has essentially exited the Bitcoin mining business and sold $150 million in convertible notes to start October. Convertible Notes At the end of September, Bit Digital announced the pricing on its upsized convertible note offering that was disclosed earlier in the month. With the exercising of an additional $15 million in underwriting options, Bit Digital's total convertible note sales were $150 million at a conversion price of $4.16 per share. The table below breaks down the potential BTBT dilution from converts as follows: Convertible Note Details Raised $150,000,000 BTBT Shares per $1,000 240.4 $1,000 Allotments 150,000 BTBT Shares from converts 36,057,690 Source: Bit Digital, Author's calculations Given the company had 321.4 million shares outstanding at the end of September, 36 million additional shares isn't necessarily a small amount of dilution. However, there is some credence to the idea that this is a good long-term strategy for Bit Digital, but it largely hinges on whether Ethereum's price goes up or down. Importantly, the notes are unsecured obligations that pay 4% annually and come due in October 2030. This means Bit Digital's annual note liability is $6 million over the next 5 years. With the proceeds from the convertible note sales, Bit Digital purchased 31,057 ETH tokens. During the month of September, the company earned a 3.37% annualized yield on its staked ETH and generated 291 ETH during that period. At current prices, Bit Digital is generating $15.8 million in ETH through staking rewards annually. And this doesn't include any ETH that would be staked following the convertible note raise. Assuming that the newly purchased ETH is also put to work and starts generating yield, a s long as Ethereum remains above Bit Digital's ETH purchase price with the convertible note proceeds, the 4% annual note obligation is almost entirely covered by the company's 3.37% annualized ETH rewards. If you are of the view that ETH will continue to appreciate over the next five years, this looks like pretty good capital allocation from where I sit. Balance Sheet Considerations While a lot has changed since the company's Q2 report, at the end of June, Bit Digital had a considerably attractive balance sheet with over $723 million in total assets and just $90.2 million in total liabilities: Data by YCharts The company's liquidity position was strong, with over $181 million in cash and equivalents. Again, this was at the end of June, and the company is already through Q3 from an operational standpoint. But I still think Bit Digital has a terrific liquidity setup if I'm following the announced moves accurately. In early July, Bit Digital sold BTC and used equity to bring its ETH stack over 100k coins. Roughly a week later, Bit Digital bought another 20k in ETH through a $67 million private placement. That brought the company's ETH stack over 120k ETH. And we also know that the latest 31k ETH buy was done with convertible notes. As far as I can tell, Bit Digital's cash position should still be quite robust when the company reports earnings for Q3. Fair Value NAV Estimate Even if we assume $40 million in COGS and SG&A during Q3 - which I actually think could be aggressive - Bit Digital likely had well over $100 million in cash liquidity at the end of September. While most DAT companies calculate basic mNAV by dividing the common stock market cap from the crypto treasuries held, Bit Digital's valuation is a bit more complex due to its majority ownership of WhiteFiber ( WYFI ). That company has a $1.3 billion market cap and Bit Digital owns roughly 75% of those shares. Considering the company's ETH position, WhiteFiber shares, and potential convert dilution, I'm estimating BTBT fair value like this: As of 10/8/25 Unit Value Total Value Shares Outstanding 321,435,847 $3.88 $1,247,171,086 WYFI Shares 27,043,749 $34.33 $928,411,903 ETH Balance 153,244 $4,441.99 $680,708,316 Asset value $1,609,120,219 Convertible notes/payments $180,000,000 NAV $1,429,120,219 NAV Discount 12.73% Source: Bit Digital, author's estimates Notably this estimate doesn't include the $90 million in Q2 liabilities or the $100+ million in assumed cash and equivalents. But again, I think it's reasonable to assume Bit Digital still maintains a negative net debt position at the end of September. So if we're solely analyzing BTBT stock from its ETH, WYFI, and 5 year convertible obligations, the company is trading at nearly a 13% discount to its liquid investments. Based on this calculation method, I believe BTBT shares are worth closer to $4.45. Key Risk It's admittedly tough to determine what 'fair value' is in the Digital Asset realm. Bit Digital's value is now derived primarily from two major assets that it holds; Ethereum and WYFI stock. Each of these assets is highly volatile and could fall dramatically in price. As each week goes on, it seems there are increasingly more analysts and reporters in the investment community that are questioning AI valuations. In a re-rating of AI/HPC, WhiteFiber stock is unlikely to be immune. Closing Summary We can only trade and invest in the market we have, not the one that we might want. In a world where DATs drive crypto prices and AI names are priced for perfection, BTBT stock is actually a compelling opportunity. As I see it, it's considerably undervalued relative to its net assets, and that undervaluation could actually be even bigger if the company is still holding $150 million in cash/equivalents. While I personally hold shares of the company and have been quite happy with performance over the last month or so, I'll reiterate the 'hold' here purely because of my concerns about the AI bubble bursting.",ETH-USD|WYFI|BTBT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-09 13:39:33

Native BNB steadies above $1,300 as it leads the altseason, and fundamentals suggest further growth for the project. Founder Changpeng Zhao has emphasized building and real-world use cases, and their empire continues to double down on encouraging on-chain developments. A day after BNB Chain received $1 billion to support startups , the platform has officially adopted the 0.05 Gwei gas fee standard across the ecosystem. BNB Chain @BNBCHAIN · Follow BNB Smart Chain’s new standard gas fee of 0.05 Gwei is now fully adopted across the network!Major ecosystem partners including @BinanceWallet , @TrustWallet , @Aster_DEX and more, have switched to 0.05 Gwei as the default gas fee.Spend less on gas, do more on BSC 🤩 2:30 PM · Oct 9, 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The move follows last month’s proposal that sought a 50% gas fee reduction from 0.1 Gwei. This move aims to ensure affordable transactions for developers and users while keeping the ecosystem reliable and faster. With lower gas fees, users can execute trades, transfer assets, or interact in decentralized applications (dApps) at a fraction of the cost. Moreover, the update underscores BNB Chain’s current efforts to make blockchain more accessible and practical to day-to-day users. Top platforms lead the transition BNB Chain collaborated with top players to ensure a smooth rollout. Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet, boasting massive user bases, have already adopted 0.05 Gwei as the default gas fee. Also, the trending DEX Aster has joined, allowing users to provide liquidity or swap tokens at lower costs. The announcement confirmed: Major ecosystem partners, including Binance Wallet, Trust Wallet, Aster DEX, and more, have switched to 0.05 Gwei as the default gas fee. The collective shift reflects how key players are cooperating to bolster network-wide enhancements, with benefits like cost savings trickling down to end users in near-instant. Why does the 50% fee cut matter? Gas fees are the charges users incur when using a blockchain. The payments go to validators to secure and process transactions. Though generally small, gas fees can skyrocket during heightened network activity. BNB Chain aims to boost user experience by reducing the base fee to 0.05 Gwei. That makes it cost-friendly for developers deploying smart contracts and users transacting frequently within the Binance ecosystem. Also, lower costs encourage experimentation, especially for smaller startups that often face constricted budgets. New builders can capitalize on the reduced fees to test and launch new products. Also, the update can attract users from other chains where gas fees remain a challenge. For context, Ethereum’s current average gas is roughly 1.816 Gwei. BNB Chain strengthens its competitive status BNB Smart Chain has positioned itself as an affordable, scalable, and faster platform for blockchain undertakings. It has attracted multiple decentralized applications in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs. The 0.05 gas fee adoption further cements the chain’s cost-efficiency reputation. Meanwhile, the new model comes as BNB Chain sees massive activity. Token Terminal data shows the platform recorded $5.58 million in 24-hour fees – the second-highest in the last three years.

The broker reaffirmed its Strategy buy rating and $705 price target in the Thursday report. The stock was 2% lower in early trading, around $324. In an investor meeting hosted by Benchmark this week, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor outlined how these instruments strengthen the company’s strategy. While other firms race to replicate Strategy’s playbook, the company’s 640,031 BTC treasury, more than twelve times the next-largest corporate holder, remains unrivaled, analyst Mark Palmer said. Its real edge, Palmer said, is in the structure of its perpetual preferred shares. These remove refinancing risk tied to bitcoin’s price swings, giving the company a stable capital base without diluting common equity. Saylor framed the strategy as turning bitcoin into the foundation for a new fixed income market, much as mortgage-backed securities transformed real estate, the report noted. Investors are buying in: the STRC offering in July raised $2.52 billion, the largest U.S. IPO this year. Benchmark sees bitcoin-linked fixed income evolving into a multi-hundred-billion-dollar market, with Strategy as its architect. The broker's price target reflects projected bitcoin value, a 10x multiple on expected gains, and the company’s software business outlook through 2026.

52896124,602945,1760018391,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52896124.jpeg,"Ethereum Ha un Problema Fondamentale, Avverte il Cyberpunk Nick Szabo",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-ha-un-problema-fondamentale-avverte-il-cyberpunk-nick-szabo/,"Il leggendario esperto di cyberpunk Nick Szabo e Ryan Watkins , cofondatore di Syncracy Capital , hanno delineato due visioni opposte per interpretare il recente rally di Ethereum e i meccanismi che ne determinano la valutazione. Entrambi hanno pubblicato le loro analisi su X (Twitter) , in cui punto per punto spiegano realmente cosa muove i prezzi delle blockchain di Layer-1 . Il Prezzo di Ethereum Non Ha Nulla a Che Fare con la Sua Utilità La tesi di Szabo è netta : “Un problema fondamentale nella valutazione di ETH è che i principali casi d’uso di Ethereum sono in gran parte esterni al valore di mercato di ETH.” Secondo lui, Ethereum può essere molto utile, le sue applicazioni possono generare ottimi ricavi, ma il prezzo di ETH può comunque restare basso — o viceversa — perché il legame tra utilità e valore è debole. Szabo mette in contrasto questa dinamica con Bitcoin , il cui “principale caso d’uso è come riserva di valore, strettamente legato al suo prezzo.” Aggiunge che “il design di base di Bitcoin è molto più adatto a questo scopo, quindi ETH non può semplicemente imitarlo; deve fare affidamento su altri casi d’uso, scarsamente collegati al suo valore di mercato.” In sintesi, per Szabo il problema è strutturale : l’utilità della rete Ethereum non si traduce automaticamente in valore per ETH, mentre nel caso di Bitcoin utilità e prezzo coincidono per natura. Il suo commento, pubblicato dopo un’assenza di cinque anni da X (settembre 2025), è arrivato in risposta a un post di Ryan Watkins , che invece adotta una prospettiva completamente diversa. Ryan Watkins: “Gli Investitori Sovrastimano i Modelli di Valutazione delle L1” Watkins sostiene che gli investitori tendano a complicare eccessivamente i modelli di valutazione delle blockchain Layer-1, mentre in realtà sono il prezzo e le narrazioni a fare la parte del leone. “Ogni volta vedo persone che pensano troppo ai modelli di valutazione delle L1”, scrive, spiegando che l’ultima spinta di Ethereum non deriva da un cambiamento nei fondamentali, ma da una svolta narrativa . Perché Il Prezzo di ETH È Triplicato da Aprile? “L’unica differenza tra ETH a 1.400 $ e ETH a 5.000 $ è Bitmine.” Ad aprile, dice Watkins, “Ethereum era una piattaforma morente.” Oggi, invece, “è la blockchain delle stablecoin e la prossima opportunità ‘in stile Bitcoin’ per gli investitori istituzionali.” La lezione è chiara: “Il prezzo guida le narrazioni, dicono.” Watkins non afferma che queste narrazioni siano fondate, ma sottolinea il vuoto che esse colmano : “Il punto non è se tutto questo sia giustificato. Il punto è che l’assenza di metodologie di valutazione condivise crea un vuoto che solo le narrazioni e i confronti relativi possono riempire.” Narrativa, Relativo Valore e “Gioco dei Flussi” Watkins propone diverse ipotesi sul caso rialzista di Ethereum , senza sposarne nessuna in particolare: “ETH diventerà una sorta di tassa globale sul PIL mondiale?” “Oppure sarà un ‘Bitcoin programmabile’, che per definizione non può essere valutato?” “O entrambe le cose?” “La verità è che nessuno lo sa”, ammette. Questa incertezza spinge i mercati a basarsi su confronti semplici e flussi di capitale : “Quindi cosa succede quando il mercato si ancora al valore relativo e alle narrazioni? Bitcoin vale 2 trilioni di dollari. Perché ETH non dovrebbe valere il 50% di quella cifra? Dopotutto offre un set di funzioni più ampio. ETH è a 500 miliardi. Perché SOL non dovrebbe valere altrettanto o di più? È un prodotto più efficiente, con maggiore trazione su quasi ogni metrica economica.” Watkins ammette che questi confronti sono “goffi” , ma utili per orientarsi: “Possiamo teorizzare quanto vogliamo, oppure navigare il contesto davanti a noi. Finché i fondamentali non torneranno a contare, non pensiamoci troppo.” Conclude con una riflessione lucida: “Esiste un enorme vantaggio competitivo per gli asset che hanno conquistato la coscienza di massa e resistono nel tempo. È un gioco di flussi e narrazioni, finché la musica non si ferma.” Due Visioni, Una Stessa Realtà di Mercato Entrambe le prospettive possono essere vere contemporaneamente.Il mercato potrebbe continuare a premiare ETH sulla base delle narrazioni e del valore relativo, mentre la domanda posta da Szabo — se il design di Ethereum potrà mai creare un legame stabile tra utilità della rete e valore del token — resta senza risposta. Per ora, il dibattito stesso è il segnale: Ethereum sta attraversando un ciclo in cui la percezione del suo scopo, più dei flussi di cassa o dei modelli fondamentali, determina il tono del mercato.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 13:59:51

The altcoin has surged 220% over the past two weeks amid a sharp rise in adoption, with more ZEC being moved into shielded addresses. gorgeous chart The amount of ZEC being shielded on Zcash is going up and to the right over time I love shilling privacy stuff because it actually ends up making a difference in the privacy properties of these systems (see the rightmost vertical bump) $1,000 pic.twitter.com/E3Y5NclR4A — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) October 6, 2025 Zcash has found new relevance in this institution-led market cycle: Institutional use-cases need rails that offer privacy, yet are compliant with selective disclosure. A gap Helium Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz argues Zcash is best equipped to fill, citing its long-standing community, the onboarding of new builders, and “stronger privacy and scale design” compared to alternatives like Monero. Backing from the world’s largest digital asset manager further underscores the trend, with the launch of the Grayscale Zcash Trust giving TradFi markets regulated access to ZEC. Zcash Price Prediction: Is This Just the Start? The uptick over the past two weeks represents the breakout of a descending triangle pattern that has formed over the past 4 years. While the rally has been uninterrupted so far, momentum indicators suggest that a correction may be on the horizon. ZEC / USD 1-week chart, descending triangle pattern breakout. Source: TradingView. The RSI has far surpassed the overbought threshold at 70, reaching 90, a level that often signals local tops as buyers begin to exhaust. The MACD shows a similar picture, reflecting short-term speculative euphoria over steady accumulation, with its widest lead above the signal line since 2017. In a potential reversal, a strong confluence of support around the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level and a historic demand zone near $105 could mark a local bottom. With a cool-down, a more stable continuation stands to see the triangle pattern’s $1000 target fully realized, a 380% gain from current prices. A cooling period there could provide a launchpad for a more sustainable continuation, with the triangle pattern targeting a potential 380% move to $1,000 . However, realizing this move likely hinges on sustained institutional demand and broader adoption of Zcash’s privacy technology.

Nassif shared a screenshot of a brief reply from Elon Musk to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, noting that the billionaire knows and follows XRP. While Musk’s past involvement with assets such as Dogecoin is well known, this particular interaction has gained renewed visibility as discussions continue about the possible role of XRP in digital payment systems, including Musk’s upcoming X Payments. REMINDER: Elon Musk Commented On Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Post 10/20/2022! Elon Knows $XRP . pic.twitter.com/3xVhJAbCiy — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) October 8, 2025 Context Behind the Moment The image Nassif shared shows a response from Musk to a post by Garlinghouse in October 2022. At the time, Garlinghouse had been publicly criticizing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) conduct during its extended legal battle with Ripple . Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, had announced that the company finally obtained the so-called Hinman documents after months of litigation and multiple court orders. These internal SEC communications were connected to a 2018 speech by former SEC official William Hinman , which played a key role in shaping how the agency viewed cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Musk’s comment came in response to Garlinghouse’s criticism of the SEC’s transparency, aligning with Musk’s own history of questioning regulatory agencies and their approach to emerging technologies. Musk’s brief response to Garlinghouse’s post was one of the few instances where he directly engaged with a figure central to the XRP debate. This comment suggests that the digital asset’s interest in the crypto space extends beyond Dogecoin and similar meme coins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Continued Speculation on Future Integration The renewed focus on this exchange coincides with growing calls from sections of the XRP community for Musk to consider integrating XRP into the X Payments system or even into Tesla’s payment options . As of now, Musk has not indicated any plans to do so, and Dogecoin remains the cryptocurrency most closely associated with him. Nonetheless, the resurfacing of this brief interaction has fueled continued interest in how his companies might eventually approach digital asset integration. XRP is already playing prominent roles in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization projects and other payment systems around the globe. Integration into Musk’s X Payments would be a major milestone for XRP, as it would drastically increase its reach and adoption. Musk’s response to Garlinghouse shows that he is aware of the digital asset, and its speed and efficiency make it a superior option to other assets.

The service, called Gemini Enterprise, went public before the company’s Gemini at Work event. It will charge businesses $30 each month for every person who uses it. The platform aims to help workers handle complicated tasks and create content without needing technical skills. Thomas Kurian, who runs Google Cloud , explained what the service does during a meeting with reporters. He said Gemini Enterprise gives workers “a single front door through which they can chat with all of their enterprise data, search for information and use agents to do a variety of tasks on their behalf.” He added that Google is “democratizing how people can access AI.” The launch puts Google in direct competition with Microsoft’s Copilot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise. Google believes its approach of building an open platform that works across different systems will help it win customers in the growing market for workplace AI tools. Google Cloud shows strong business growth The announcement comes as Google tries to prove it can attract serious business customers. As Cryptopolitan reported, the company recently said it is adding Gemini features to its Chrome browser and working to put its AI technology in all its products. Kurian shared that nine out of the ten biggest AI research groups now buy their computing power from Google Cloud. The company also revealed it has $106 billion worth of contracts with current customers that haven’t been completed yet. About $58 billion of that amount should turn into actual revenue for the cloud division by 2027. Google Cloud has become an important growth area for Alphabet as its main search business gets older and more mature. Gemini Enterprise combines several tools that Google already offers, including its Gemini AI models, automated agents from both Google and outside companies, and technology that creates content. The platform can connect to data from many business programs, including software from Salesforce and SAP. While Google Cloud has sold some of these individual tools before, they were mostly designed for programmers and IT workers. The tools also existed as separate products spread across Google Cloud’s offerings. The new platform changes that. Now, any worker can talk to the system about company data and start automated processes across different business programs without writing any code. How the system works in practice Maryam Gholami, a senior director at Google Cloud, showed how the platform works during a demonstration. She played the role of a marketing manager using something called a “Campaigns Agent” to build a Halloween marketing campaign. The AI assistant did research, spotted important trends, and checked product inventory on its own. It found a shortage and let the marketing manager approve a purchase order through ServiceNow. Then it wrote an email to store managers about the order. Finally, it made social media materials and used Google’s tools to turn a marketing picture into an animated image. Google said Gemini Enterprise will work in every country where the company sells its cloud products. The platform will support more than twelve languages when it launches.

With total assets under management of approximately €764 million (about $888 million) as of June 30, the 1% allocation puts roughly $9 million into Bitcoin ETFs. Kieffer addressed the mixed reactions to the move, acknowledging that opinions vary on both timing and scale. “ Some might argue that we’re committing too little too late; others will point out the volatility and speculative nature of the investment ,” he wrote. However, he stressed that the FSIL management board views the 1% allocation as a sensible balance between innovation and stability. The decision, according to Kieffer, reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential while staying consistent with the fund’s conservative investment approach. Luxembourg Flagged Crypto as High-Risk—Then Invested Anyway The announcement may surprise those familiar with Luxembourg’s traditionally cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies. It follows earlier reports from late May indicating that the country’s 2025 National Risk Assessment had classified crypto-related businesses as high-risk for money laundering. The report noted that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) often operate in decentralized environments, which complicates oversight and makes tracing illicit financial activities more challenging. Yet Luxembourg continues to attract major crypto players seeking regulatory approval. In May, Bitstamp, one of the world’s longest-running cryptocurrency exchanges, secured its Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license from Luxembourg regulators under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. In January, UK-based Standard Chartered announced plans to establish a Luxembourg-based entity as its regulatory hub for crypto and digital asset custody services across the European Union. Coinbase has also expanded its European presence , obtaining a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator, solidifying the nation’s position as a compliant hub for digital assets. Breaking Down National Bitcoin Holdings Around the World Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that, beyond Europe, nation-states and government entities collectively hold about 515,885 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $63 billion, representing around 2.46% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The United States leads with 198,021 BTC worth approximately $24.2 billion, followed by China with 190,000 BTC valued at $23.2 billion, much of it seized through enforcement actions despite China’s restrictive crypto policies. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The United Kingdom ranks third with 61,245 BTC (around $7.5 billion), while Ukraine holds 46,351 BTC valued at $5.7 billion, reflecting its reliance on crypto donations amid ongoing conflict and its progressive approach to digital assets. El Salvador remains the only country to have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender , holding 6,344 BTC worth $776 million, making it a global outlier in crypto-based monetary policy. Both the United Arab Emirates and Bhutan hold more than 6,000 BTC each, showing a trend among both resource-rich and emerging nations to treat Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Bhutan government moves $23.73M Bitcoin to Binance perfectly timing $BTC 's $112K ATH, maintaining massive 11,711 $BTC worth $1.3B with superior market strategy. #Bhutan #Bitcoin https://t.co/ghEZF0AnO8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 10, 2025 Several countries, including Finland, Roswell in New Mexico, Germany, and Bulgaria , now have zero or minimal holdings after liquidating their positions.

Key Takeaways: France wants the EU’s top markets regulator, ESMA, to directly oversee major crypto firms. Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau called for tighter control over stablecoins. The proposal comes amid EU efforts to centralize supervision and strengthen financial stability. Speaking Thursday, Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau said the move would ensure consistent supervision and enforcement of crypto regulations under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. He warned that the current system, which allows companies to obtain licenses from individual member states and “passport” them across the EU, risks regulatory loopholes and uneven oversight. France Urges Stricter EU Rules on Cross-Border Stablecoin Issuance “This framework would benefit from much stricter regulation of the multi-issuance of the same stablecoin within and outside the European Union, to reduce arbitrage risks in times of stress,” he said. The comments come as the European Central Bank gains support for restricting cross-border stablecoin issuance, potentially setting up a clash with issuers such as Circle and Paxos, which currently operate under MiCA’s multi-issuance provisions. Circle, the issuer of USDC, Europe’s largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, relies on this model to manage both EU-based and overseas tokens. The firm received an electronic money license in France last year, positioning the country as a hub for its European operations. Stablecoins are seen as crucial to digital finance but also pose systemic risks if not properly backed. Under MiCA, licensed issuers must hold reserves in at least one EU country, yet can simultaneously issue equivalent tokens abroad, a structure France now argues needs stricter supervision to protect financial stability and prevent market fragmentation. As reported, the European Commission is preparing sweeping changes that could hand over direct supervisory authority of stock exchanges, cryptocurrency firms, and clearing houses to the EU’s markets watchdog, the ESMA. France has warned it may try to block some crypto firms licensed in other EU countries from operating domestically as part of a push to get oversight transferred to the bloc’s central securities regulator. More here: https://t.co/31xAtTuZWG pic.twitter.com/y550hTCY8h — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) September 15, 2025 Verena Ross, chair of ESMA, told the Financial Times that the proposed changes aim to resolve persistent fragmentation across the EU’s financial sector and create a more unified capital market. “This would provide a key impetus towards having a capital market in Europe that is more integrated and globally competitive,” she said. Under the proposals, regulation of several financial market sectors currently overseen by national authorities would shift to ESMA. ESMA Flags Gaps in Malta’s Crypto Licensing In July, ESMA raised concerns about Malta’s crypto licensing process , following a peer review of the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). While acknowledging that the MFSA has adequate staffing and sector expertise, the review found that Malta only “partially met expectations” in its authorization of a crypto asset service provider (CASP), with several material issues left unaddressed during the approval stage. The review, initiated in April 2025 by ESMA’s Peer Review Committee, focused on the MFSA’s supervisory setup, authorization procedures, and oversight tools. ESMA emphasized that consistency across EU member states is essential under the MiCA regulatory framework, which seeks to standardize how crypto firms are licensed and supervised throughout the bloc.

While there has been significant institutional investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs, interest continues to grow. While the world's giants continue to invest in Bitcoin ETFs, news also came from Europe. The Luxembourg Sovereign Wealth Fund (FSIL) has invested 1% of its assets in Bitcoin ETFs, becoming the first sovereign wealth fund in the Eurozone to do so, Coindesk reported. At this point, the Luxembourg sovereign wealth fund became the first instance in which a national-level sovereign wealth fund in a European Union (EU) member state officially invested in Bitcoin. “This decision strengthens Luxembourg's leadership in digital finance and ensures the recognition of Bitcoin as a mature asset class. The 1% allocation is conservative but sends a clear signal to the market about Bitcoin's long-term potential. Given the nature of the FSIL, it was the most balanced choice,” said Jonathan Westhead, spokesman for Luxembourg's financial authority. The investment follows a legal change that allows Luxembourg sovereign wealth fund Fonds Souverain Intergénérationnel du Luxembourg (FSIL) to allocate up to 15% of its assets under management to alternative investments, including cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

Ripple has announced a formal partnership with Bahrain FinTech Bay as it accelerates its entry into the Middle East, according to Coindesk. Accordingly, Ripple announced a strategic partnership with Bahrain Fintech Bay (BFB), Bahrain's largest fintech hub. Under the agreement, Ripple plans to collaborate in various key areas in the country, including blockchain technology, cross-border payments, digital assets, stablecoins, and tokenization. This partnership is seen as a continuation of Ripple’s expansion into the Middle East after receiving authorization from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in Dubai earlier this year, making it the first blockchain-based payments provider to achieve this milestone. “Bahrain is an early adopter of blockchain technology and one of the first countries in the world to implement virtual asset regulation. Ripple will work with FinTech Bay to strengthen the foundations of the local blockchain sector and ultimately deliver digital asset custody and RLUSD stablecoin solutions to financial institutions,” said Reece Merrick, General Manager of Ripple Middle East and Africa. Merrick stated that Ripple aims to offer its digital asset custody services and Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin to Bahraini financial institutions in the near future. Ripple recently announced that it has secured over 60 regulatory licenses and registrations worldwide. It added that the latest collaboration aims to make Bahrain a “regulation-friendly blockchain hub” for the Gulf region. Next up → the Kingdom of Bahrain.

At the time of publication, the stablecoin market is valued at approximately $260 billion. Nearly all stablecoins are pegged 1:1 to the dollar, which means that any conversions of any foreign currency into stablecoins, such as Tether, would represent new U.S. dollar demand. The financial institution stated that if such a growth trajectory eventually plays out, stablecoin-related dollar inflows could become cumulatively significant. Standard Chartered forecasted that the amount of funds held in stablecoins in emerging markets could surge to $1.22 trillion by 2028. The financial institution’s research team argued that people in developing countries will turn to stablecoins as a safer and more convenient way to save money as the cryptocurrency industry grows. The bank revealed that around two-thirds of the current global stablecoin supply is already held in emerging markets. Standard Chartered’s research team found that people in emerging markets are increasingly turning to stablecoins to protect themselves from inflation. They argued that local currencies lose value fast and U.S. dollar-pegged digital assets offer a safer store of value. Cryptopolitan previously reported that the bank’s research team added that stablecoins become reliable when local banks are unstable or under government pressure. The bank pointed to Venezuela, where the country’s inflation is out of control, and many Venezuelans have resorted to using USDT for daily payments. BoE introduces stablecoin exemptions for businesses The Bank of England introduced exemptions to its proposed limits on corporate stablecoin holdings on Tuesday. Bloomberg reported that the initiative signals a shift in approach as Britain faces mounting pressure to remain competitive with U.S. crypto regulations. According to the report, Britain’s central bank plans to issue waivers for certain businesses, including crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of stablecoins. The BoE will also issue waivers for businesses that allow the use of stablecoins as settlement assets within its experimental Digital Securities Sandbox. The BoE Governor, Andrew John Bailey, recently mentioned that stablecoins could coexist with traditional finance. The Financial Times reported last week that Bailey said it would be wrong to oppose stablecoins as a matter of principle. “Indeed, I do not hold that view, recognising their potential in driving innovation in payment systems both at home and across borders. Practice matters, however, and these stablecoins must satisfy the conditions that enable public trust.” -Andrew John Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The Bank of England had previously proposed capping stablecoin transactions at up to €20,000 ($26,832) for individuals and €10 million ($13.4 million) for businesses. The report revealed that the stablecoin caps are expected to be detailed in a consultation later this year. There have been widespread concerns within the crypto industry regarding the proposed stablecoin holding limits, which may have prompted consideration of potential exemptions. There was also criticism that the UK risks falling behind markets like the U.S., which has recently passed the GENIUS Act that establishes rules for dollar-backed stablecoins.

In a terse post on X, Coplan simply wrote: “$BTC $ETH $BNB $SOL $POLY ,” a construction that bracketed an unannounced “$POLY” ticker alongside four of the market’s largest assets and set off immediate debate about token timing, design, and whether an airdrop could accompany any launch. $BTC $ETH $BNB $SOL $POLY https://t.co/HmMobU6nBh — Shayne Coplan (@shayne_coplan) October 8, 2025 Will Polymarket Launch A Token? The timing of the tease is striking. On Tuesday, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)—the owner of the New York Stock Exchange— announced a strategic investment of up to $2 billion in Polymarket that implies a roughly $8 billion pre-money valuation. ICE framed the deal as a bet on the institutionalization of event-based information markets and their underlying data exhaust. “Intercontinental Exchange… announced a strategic investment in Polymarket,” the company said, specifying the “up to $2 billion” commitment and the approximate valuation impact. Polymarket’s trajectory has been anything but linear. In January 2022, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a cease-and-desist order and a $1.4 million civil monetary penalty over unregistered event-based binary options, requiring the platform to wind down non-compliant markets. The CFTC’s order also documented the firm’s cooperation and remedial steps. Those actions forced Polymarket to rebuild its compliance posture even as prediction markets were gaining cultural relevance during major political events and sports seasons. Against that backdrop, Coplan’s five-ticker line reads like an ambition statement more than a technical spec sheet. There are no published details on issuance mechanics, governance scope, chain selection, or distribution; Polymarket itself has not announced a token, and there is no public documentation outlining airdrop criteria, eligibility windows, or clawbacks. But the semiotic weight of placing “POLY” in the same breath as Bitcoin, Ether, BNB, and Solana was not lost on traders who have come to expect user distributions when crypto-native platforms formalize decentralization or community governance. Until Polymarket releases definitive materials, any talk of timing, supply, or airdrops remains conjecture. For now, the only on-record line about a token is Coplan’s—nothing more, nothing less. Given Polymarket’s regulatory history and its newly prominent backer, any tokenization path would likely be sequenced with care. Until formal disclosures arrive, the market will continue to parse a single eight-word post for signal. Biggest Crypto Airdrop Ever? As of today, Solana’s market cap hovers around $124–125 billion, with XRP sitting near $170 billion and BNB around $178 billion. That puts SOL roughly at the #6 slot today, below XRP and BNB. In other words, a token placed directly behind SOL would be ~#7 at roughly $120–124 billion in market cap. By day-one dollar value, the watermark for an airdrop is Arbitrum. The foundation allocated about 1.162 billion ARB to users; contemporaneous trading around $1.35–$1.40 put the aggregate day-one value near $1.6 billion—well ahead of prior marquee drops. For comparison, Uniswap’s Sept. 2020 airdrop distributed 150 million UNI; launch-day pricing implied roughly $0.5–$0.6 billion in value. These would be the benchmarks that POLY would have to surpass. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $4.08 trillion.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Poly|Polymarket|Polymarket Airdrop|Polymarket news|Polymarket Token,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|AIRDROP|MARKET|SOL|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 15:30:48

He suggested that institutions are already acting on this perception, stating that they are “quietly accumulating it as a liquid, portable, and regulatory-friendly alternative to physical reserves.” XRP mirrors gold as a reserve and settlement asset, with speed, divisibility, scalability, and interoperability. Which is why institutions are quietly accumulating it as a liquid, portable, and regulatory-friendly alternative to physical reserves. I’m not wrong, I’m just early. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 8, 2025 His closing remark, “I’m not wrong, I’m just early,” captured both conviction and patience, traits often seen in early adopters of transformative financial technologies. XRP’s design supports his argument. Created to enable fast cross-border payments, the asset’s transaction speed and low cost have attracted attention from financial institutions exploring digital liquidity solutions. Its scalability allows for consistent performance across high transaction volumes, a quality essential for large-scale settlement systems. Unlike physical commodities, XRP’s digital nature makes it easily transferable without logistical barriers, appealing to institutions that require efficiency and mobility in managing reserves. Institutional Attraction and Technological Strength Aljarrah’s comparison between XRP and gold aligns with a broader shift among institutional investors seeking digital equivalents to traditional assets. Gold has historically served as a store of value and reserve instrument, but it lacks the transactional efficiency that modern financial systems demand.

This capacity strengthens its case as a viable complement to, rather than replacement for, established reserve assets. Positioning for the Future of Finance Aljarrah’s comments come at a time when digital assets are gradually moving from speculative markets into practical financial applications. His assessment highlights confidence in XRP’s structural design and its capacity to serve institutional purposes beyond trading. Aljarrah’s remarks reinforce the view that XRP’s long-term relevance does not rest on hype, but on its utility and alignment with institutional needs. Whether adoption accelerates or unfolds gradually, the foundation he describes positions XRP as a credible participant in the next phase of digital finance .

Citi said OSL is well positioned as a regulated digital-asset trading and payments platform, with strong growth prospects tied to institutional crypto adoption and stablecoin-related products. The bank projects revenue growth of 80%, 60% and 36% in 2025, 2026 and 2027, driven by payment finance (PayFi) expansion and a broader regulated market footprint. The firm's analysts highlighted OSL’s regulatory-first strategy, noting its more than 50 licenses across 10 jurisdictions and plans to expand further in Europe, the Middle East and emerging markets. The bank also pointed to OSL’s dominant position in Hong Kong’s OTC crypto market, where it controls over 60% share, citing liquidity, pricing and client retention as key strengths. OSL is also pushing into stablecoin infrastructure with upcoming launches including OSL BizPay, a lower-cost cross-border payment platform, as well as StableX for stablecoin issuance and Tokenworks for tokenization. Citi warned of risks from volatility, regulation and competition but said OSL’s compliance-first approach and early lead make it a standout in Hong Kong’s growing digital-asset sector.

The interviews wrapped up Tuesday, with Scott joined by Hunter McMaster from the Treasury and adviser Francis Browne. Each session lasted nearly two hours, and the questioning followed a clear script, one rooted in Scott’s recent 6,000-word takedown of the Fed’s policies in International Economy. Everyone interviewed was asked how they’d tackle what Scott calls “mission creep,” the central bank doing too much, and how they would fix the mess caused by quantitative easing, or QE. In his article, Scott labeled QE a “gain-of-function monetary policy experiment”, blaming it for inflating the balance sheet and giving too much control to unelected technocrats. He made it clear he wants less Fed power over bond markets and more authority handed back to the Treasury. Trump wants aggressive rate cuts as Scott pushes structural changes Trump has made no secret that he wants the Fed’s benchmark rate cut to 1%, far below the current 4% to 4.25% range. He’s not interested in debating QE or mission creep, he wants someone who will cut borrowing costs hard and fast. He has final say on the appointment and is eyeing three men: Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; Christopher Waller, who’s on the board now; and Kevin Hassett, one of his top economic advisers. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer at BlackRock, is also in the running. A person close to the discussions allegedly told Financial Times that Rick “performed very well,” though he’s seen as less likely to land the job than Trump’s inner circle. Scott himself hasn’t dropped many hints, but told Fox Business that he’s looking for someone “with an open mind” who’s “looking forward.” He admitted some candidates surprised him, making it hard to shrink the list down to a final recommendation for the White House. Jay Powell will step down as chair in May 2026, ending an eight-year run. He could stay on as a regular Fed governor until January 2028, but Trump has already moved to sideline him. He’s called Powell a “moron” who was “too late” to act on inflation and has tried more than once to fire him. Internal Fed backlash grows as Trump’s allies target Lisa Cook While Scott is pushing balance sheet reform, senior Fed officials aren’t backing down. They say QE may have driven up asset prices that benefited the rich, but without it, unemployment would’ve exploded, hitting the poorest Americans first. That argument hasn’t stopped Trump’s team from hammering the Fed from all directions. Russ Vought, who runs the Office of Management and Budget, slammed what he called the “ostentatious” $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. At the same time, Bill Pulte, another Trump ally, accused Lisa Cook, the first Black female Fed governor, of mortgage fraud. Trump used the accusation to try to fire her. Cook has denied it and is suing him. The Supreme Court ruled last week that she can keep working at the Fed until at least January 2026. Trump’s current goals and Scott’s views aren’t exactly in sync. Trump wants quick, deep rate cuts before 2026. Scott wants to gut QE, shrink the balance sheet, and clip the Fed’s powers. But both agree Powell has to go, and soon. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The global crypto market capitalization plunged 2% the past day to $4.16 trillion. While most tokens appear poised for further declines before rebounds, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies held strong, recording substantial gains despite broader bearishness. CoinGecko data shows privacy tokens saw a 14.8% uptick in market value to $11.45 billion (adding roughly $1.696 billion) over the past 24 hours. Source – CoinGecko The over $1.35 billion in 24-hour trading volume reflects considerable trader activity. The decouple has stirred markets as it indicates a potential shift, where players are prioritizing anonymity and privacy when interacting with cryptocurrencies. ZEC extends gains One of the earliest privacy tokens, Zcash, has performed well after starting the week on a bullish note . The digital token exhibits an optimistic structure after recording substantial gains in trading volume and price over the past day. ZEC is trading at $187 after a 24-hour peak of $194, still up 32% on the daily timeframe. Source – Coingecko Technical indicators suggest bull dominance. Zcash’s price hovers well above the vital 50- and 100-Exponential Moving Averages on the 24-hour chart. Also, the MACD demonstrates buyer presence with visible green histograms after the late September bullish crossover. However, the daily Relative Strength Index at 76 highlights overbought situations. That means ZEC might dip slightly as momentum cools before extending its rally. Veil gains 40% Lesser-known privacy coin, VEIL, gained traction after a more than 40% increase the previous day. It is hovering at $0.06905 with significant volatility VEIL mirrors the enhanced sentiments among privacy tokens. Other related coins that recorded impressive price performances in the past 24 hours include Railgun (+130%), LOCK (+30%), FIRO (+20%), and YEC (+55%).

Trading just below $124,000 just ahead of the opening of the stock market, bitcoin pulled back to below $121,000 about ninety minutes later. The action happened alongside pullbacks in previously red-hot gold and silver markets. Gold has been making most of the headlines of late, but the action in silver may have been today's driver. Up 50% from the April lows, the metal hit $50 per ounce for the first time ever on Thursday. That level, though, spurred some fast profit-taking, with the price dropping about 4% within minutes. At press time, silver was changing hands at $48.55. ""Near term, momentum looks choppy as technicals flag an increasingly overbought market; medium term, appetite to sustain ranges above $50 should persist if the macro and real-yield picture stays benign,"" wrote Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com. For its part, gold reversed more than 1% from a challenge of the $4,100 per ounce level to the current $4,035. The ongoing U.S. government shutdown may also be starting to weigh on investor sentiment, disrupting the release of key economic data and slowing operations for businesses that rely on federal services, clouding both traditional and digital asset markets. Altcoins bleed against BTC Smaller cryptocurrencies fared worse during the pullback: ether slumped 3.5% to $4,300, while BNB and DOGE also fell 3%-4%. Amidst the risk-off move, bitcoin's market share of the total crypto market climbed to its strongest reading in nearly eight weeks The Bitcoin Dominance metric rose above 59.4% for the first time since August, TradingView data shows, suggesting traders rotate capital back to the largest crypto asset.

At the same time, Wall Street’s main indexes posted subdued gains; however, JP Morgan says it’s just a matter of time before they crash. On Wednesday, minutes from the Fed’s September meeting, as seen by Cryptopolitan, revealed that around half of policymakers expect two more rate cuts by the end of the year. This marked a more dovish stance from the central bank. The price action of BTC. Source: Coinmarketcap In response, markets reacted with gains across equities, crypto, and commodities. Spot bitcoin ETFs saw $441 million in net inflows, marking their eighth consecutive day of gains. The price of the coin went up to $124k, a little below its all-time high of $126k achieved on Monday. However, on the wake of Thursday, the king coin has been volatile, with its price fluctuating between $121k and $123k. Market watchers say that the ongoing bull market will continue The current market data shows that since the start of October, there has been a massive inflow into Bitcoin ETFs. This peaked at over $1.2 billion on October 6, a liquidity boom that translated into an all-time high of $126,198 on the same day. Several market watchers expect BTC to remain bullish because of the prevailing factors. With the US government on shutdown, investors of all classes have managed to find solace in Bitcoin and other assets as a cushion for macro-economic uncertainties. Overall, exchanges are bleeding Bitcoin, a liquidity crunch that shows potential for more price breakouts ahead. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, said that this bull cycle is distinct from previous ones. “In complement to the sustained accumulation by Spot Bitcoin ETF outfits, firms are also directly adding Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries, locking up the coin as a major store of value and hedge against inflation,” he added. In retrospect, Arthur Hayes contended in an essay titled “Long Live the King!” that the primary catalyst behind the 2014, 2018, and 2022 BTC bear markets was monetary tightening in major economies, rather than the four-year halving cycle. The essay shows that Bitcoin’s price experienced a 70% to 80% decline from its bull market apex on each of these occasions. The US stock market is on the verge of collapse Jamie Dimon, chair and CEO of the huge Wall Street bank JPMorgan Chase has said that the chances of the US stock market collapsing are much higher than most investors think. Jamie Dimon said that he is far more worried than others about a big drop in the stock market. He thinks it will happen in the next six months to two years. “I would give it a higher probability than I think is probably priced in the market and by others,” he stated . “So if the market’s pricing in 10%, I would say it is more like 30%.” Dimon also said that there are a lot of things out there that are making things unclear. He named risks like the state of geopolitics, government spending, and the remilitarisation of the world. Additionally, Kristalina Georgieva, head of the International Monetary Fund, said on Wednesday that the world economy had been surprisingly strong in the face of Donald Trump’s trade war. However, she gave a stark warning about the rising risks, saying, “Buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal.” Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 20.5 points, or 0.04%, to 46,622.31.

52899634,603112,1760025006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52899634.jpeg,Luksemburg inwestuje w Bitcoina przez fundusz państwowy,https://bitcoinist.com/luksemburg-inwestuje-w-bitcoina-przez-fundusz/,"Luksemburg właśnie zapisał się w historii europejskich finansów. Państwowy fundusz Fonds Souverain Intergénérationnel du Luxembourg stał się pierwszym funduszem narodowym w strefie euro, który zainwestował w Bitcoina. Według ogłoszenia, 1% jego portfela, czyli około 9 milionów dolarów, trafi do funduszy ETF opartych na Bitcoinie. Takową decyzję potwierdził Bob Kieffer , dyrektor luksemburskiego skarbu państwa i sekretarz generalny. Luksemburg inwestuje w Bitcoina, reszta krajów pójdzie za ciosem? Odważny krok w stronę Bitcoina Choć 1% może wydawać się niewielkim udziałem, dla konserwatywnie zarządzanego funduszu państwowego to bardzo znaczacy krok. FSIL zarządza aktywami o wartości około 764 milionów euro. Zdecydował się dodatkowo na ekspozycję poprzez regulowane ETF-y , a nie bezpośrednie zakupy kryptowaluty. Niektórzy mogą twierdzić, że działamy zbyt późno lub zbyt ostrożnie; inni wskażą na zmienność i spekulacyjny charakter tego aktywa – napisał Kieffer. Zarząd FSIL uznaje jednak, że 1% to rozsądny kompromis między innowacją a stabilnością. – dodał. Ta decyzja pokazuje, że Luksemburg, mimo ostrożności, widzi w Bitcoinie długoterminowy potencjał. To również wyraźny sygnał dla całej strefy euro. Kryptowaluty konsekwentnie nabierają znaczenia jako strategiczne aktywa. Od ostrożności do działania Decyzja FSIL zaskoczyła wielu analityków. Szczególną zasłonę dymną stanowił fakt, że w maju Luksemburg sklasyfikował firmy kryptowalutowe jako wysokiego ryzyka w kontekście prania pieniędzy . Narodowy raport ryzyka na 2025 rok wskazywał, że podmioty działające w obszarze aktywów cyfrowych często funkcjonują w środowisku zdecentralizowanym, co utrudnia kontrolę i śledzenie przepływu środków. Mimo to Luksemburg konsekwentnie przyciąga duże firmy z branży krypto, oferując im stabilne i przejrzyste regulacje. W maju giełda Bitstamp uzyskała licencję Crypto Asset Service Provider w ramach unijnego rozporządzenia MiCA . Podobną ścieżką poszły Standard Chartered oraz Coinbase , które otworzyły w Luksemburgu europejskie centra operacyjne dla usług związanych z kryptowalutami i aktywami cyfrowymi. Rządy i państwowe rezerwy w Bitcoinie Według danych Bitcoin Treasuries , rządy i instytucje państwowe na całym świecie posiadają łącznie około 515 885 BTC o łącznej wartości ponad 63 miliardów dolarów, co odpowiada 2,46% całkowitej podaży Bitcoina . Liderem pozostają Stany Zjednoczone z 198 021 BTC, tuż za nimi znajdują się Chiny z 190 000 BTC. Co ciekawe, większość chińskich zasobów pochodzi z konfiskat dokonanych przez władze w ramach działań przeciwko nielegalnym giełdom. Na trzecim miejscu uplasowała się Wielka Brytania (61 245 BTC), a tuż za nią Ukraina (46 351 BTC), która wykorzystuje kryptowaluty m.in. do pozyskiwania darowizn w czasie wojny. Salwador pozostaje jedynym krajem, który uczynił Bitcoina prawnym środkiem płatniczym – jego rezerwy wynoszą 6 344 BTC, czyli około 776 milionów dolarów. Kolejne państwa, takie jak Zjednoczone Emiraty Arabskie czy Bhutan , również gromadzą BTC jako część swoich rezerw strategicznych. Czy w przyszłości ujrzymy w tym zestawieniu również Polskę? Symboliczny krok z dużymi konsekwencjami Choć udział FSIL w Bitcoinie to zaledwie 1%, ruch ten ma wymiar symboliczny. Po raz pierwszy państwowy fundusz w strefie euro oficjalnie przyznał, że Bitcoin może być pełnoprawnym aktywem inwestycyjnym. To może uruchomić efekt domina. Inne kraje, zwłaszcza te z rozwiniętymi sektorami finansowymi, mogą pójść w ślady Luksemburga. Dla wielu inwestorów to również sygnał, że warto przyjrzeć się bliżej rynkowi kryptowalut, szczególnie w kontekście projektów rozwijających infrastrukturę Bitcoina. Bitcoin Hyper – nowa warstwa innowacji dla Bitcoina Jednym z projektów, który w ostatnich miesiącach robi szum wśród społeczności krypto, jest Bitcoin Hyper . Tutaj identycznie, jak w przypadku Luksemburga mamy kwestię przełomową. $Hyper to pierwsze w historii rozwiązanie warstwy 2 dla sieci Bitcoin . Jego celem jest usprawnienie funkcjonowania łańcucha BTC. Odbywa się to przez wdrożenie takich elementów, jak szybkie transakcje, wsparcie dla smart kontraktów oraz zdecentralizowanych aplikacji. Bitcoin Hyper działa równolegle do głównej sieci Bitcoina. Wykorzystuje on technologię Solana Virtual Machine oraz zero-knowledge proofs . Dzięki temu użytkownicy mogą wykonywać błyskawiczne operacje, tworzyć aplikacje DeFi, NFT i nawet gry oparte na ekosystemie Bitcoin. Potencjał projektu przemawia przez niesamowite liczby. W samej przedsprzedaży kryptowaluty zebrano już ponad 22,8 mln dolarów , przy cenie jednego tokena $HYPER na poziomie 0,013085 USD . Dlaczego Bitcoin Hyper przyciąga uwagę? Bitcoin Hyper nie tylko wprowadza skalowalność i interoperacyjność między blockchainami, ale również zapewnia bezpieczeństwo dzięki kanonicznemu mostowi. Umożliwia on zamrożenie BTC i uzyskanie ich reprezentacji w sieci L2 z pełną możliwością cofnięcia transakcji. Projekt przeszedł także audyty bezpieczeństwa przeprowadzone przez firmy SolidProof i Coinsult . Dla osób, które zastanawiają się, jak kupić kryptowaluty , twórcy projektu przygotowali szczegółowy poradnik na swojej oficjalnej stronie. Cały proces jest intuicyjny i dostosowany nawet do mniej zaawansowanych użytkowników rynku krypto. Potencjał wzrostu i perspektywy projektu Eksperci prognozują, że jeśli projekt utrzyma tempo rozwoju, Bitcoin Hyper może w kolejnych latach odnotować znaczące wzrosty wartości. Najbardziej optymistyczne przewidywania wskazują, że do końca 2025 roku cena tokena może wzrosnąć nawet do 0,32 USD . Nie brakuje również bardziej ostrożnych prognoz. Według nich token $HYPER może kosztować około 0,0167 USD w 2025 roku i 0,0231 USD w 2026 roku. Nawet w tym wariancie inwestorzy, którzy dołączą na wczesnym etapie, mają szansę na znaczące zyski. Bezpieczeństwo i zaufanie – fundament projektu W świecie kryptowalut kluczowe znaczenie ma zaufanie. Bitcoin Hyper przykłada do tego ogromną wagę. Transakcje są zabezpieczone kryptograficznie, a użytkownicy zawsze zachowują kontrolę nad swoimi środkami. Projekt wprowadził również fundusze bezpieczeństwa oraz programy stakingowe, które minimalizują ryzyka związane z infrastrukturą sieci. Dla osób poszukujących większej prywatności interesującą opcją pozostaje także anonimowe kupno kryptowalut , które w przypadku projektu HYPER odbywa się zgodnie z obowiązującymi regulacjami.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 15:50:06

The Softbank-backed platform rationalized the move based on Solana’s speed, low transaction fees, and composability. Along with its SoftBank backing, Sorare also claims partnerships with global leagues like the Premier League and NBA. It clarified that the transition will start in early October, as the platform looks to make the most of its intersection of mainstream sports fandom and crypto infrastructure. Sorare tethers move to openness and scalability taglines In a recent post , Sorare stated that the migration is “more than a technical upgrade,” framing it as a long-term strategy to connect its player cards to the growing crypto economy. “We believe in true digital ownership that extends beyond our own marketplace,” the company wrote. It also said by moving to Solana, it is connecting the Sorare cards of their users to a broader ecosystem. According to Sorare, this means that users will get expanded capabilities and utility on Solana , increased connectedness to the heart of crypto, access to external marketplaces, and expanded payment options including ETH, SOL, and other payment options, and all these are promised to happen in the short term. The migration will enable Sorare users to trade, verify, and store their cards directly through popular Solana-compatible wallets such as Phantom and Backpack. Migration timeline and user impact The transition is scheduled to happen in phases throughout October, and the first item on the list is the migration of Sorare’s Ethereum balances on StarkEx to Base to improve efficiency while still maintaining Ethereum compatibility. By the end of the month, all Sorare cards are expected to be bridged to Solana as NFTs while still maintaining their unique attributes, such as scarcity, season, experience points (XP), and metadata. Existing gameplay, collections, and ownership will remain intact. However, those who prefer to keep their assets outside the new environment can withdraw them to the Ethereum mainnet before migration. However, any cards moved externally would need to be bridged back to Solana for continued trading on Sorare’s marketplace . Sorare’s move also enhances the platform’s payment and reward flexibility, with both ETH and SOL now supported across its marketplace and tournaments. Implications for Solana and Sorare’s plans for the future For Solana, the integration marks another high-profile validation of its technical infrastructure and growing role in the next generation of blockchain applications beyond the NFT art and DeFi circles, as it now extends into mainstream entertainment and sports. The migration of Sorare’s platform could also open doors to future collaborations between Solana-based gaming projects and major sports franchises. At the same time, Sorare mentioned that it is exploring every opportunity in front of it, from community partnerships, new forms of gameplay and the possible expansion of its ecosystem via a Sorare token, stating that it is building a future where everything is on the table, thanks to the migration.

While these blue-chips dominate headlines and institutional capital, the most lucrative opportunities for early investors typically look like they do in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-centered altcoins in its early phase. MUTM sits at Stage 6 of presale at just $0.035 and over 60% sold out as of now. The project gives investors a chance to participate in a project designed for long-term adoption and significant upside, potentially outperforming even the largest names as the next crypto cycle unfolds. Crypto Funds Pull in Record $6 Billion as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Rally Cryptocurrency funds collectively added nearly $6 billion last week, a record week in the view of CoinShares, as Bitcoin (BTC) passed $125,000 and investors desperately sought exposure to quality assets. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also saw inflows, supporting strong institutional appetite and growing faith in these networks as hedges against failing fiat. As these blue-chip cryptos capture most of the capital deployment, traders looking for early-stage prospects with real utility and growth potential are flocking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in increasing numbers. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Steady Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has shattered yet another presale record after raising over $17 million in Phase 6. Tokens are now on sale at $0.035, representing an increase of 16.17% compared to Phase 5. Investor interest remains high, with over 16,820 supporters who are confident in the project roadmap in the long term. To achieve stable, real-time valuations, the protocol employs Chainlink oracles for USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX feeds. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are also used by the system, which provides multi-layer protection and stable prices even during periods of rare market volatility. The protocol is dynamic in its Loan-to-Value and Liquidation ratios that change automatically based on real-world market conditions, a feature that renders the system highly sensitivity to volatility. Reserve multipliers range from 10% for risky assets and 35% for lower-risk assets, allowing for a double-layered safeguard mechanism for users’ and platform safety. Mutuum Finance recently launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, in which it welcomes white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to detect and report bugs. Bugs have four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low, to achieve round-the-clock protection and ensure the long-term security roadmap of the platform. Lending & Borrowing Protocol development Mutuum Finance has released plans for the launch of its lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 (V1) is coming in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet with liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be available from day one to collateralize, lend, and borrow, and the protocol offers a secure and scalable experience for the users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to Outshine Titans As Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) receive billions of dollars in institutional inflows, their dominance merely indicates how mainstream belief in digital assets is on the rise, but also implies that the biggest returns for the early birds are to be made elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at a mere $0.035 and already over 60% sold out in its Phase 6 presale, is fast emerging as the next decentralized finance (DeFi) giant. With a dual-lending protocol fully audited, oracle engagements in real-time, dynamic risk management instruments, and a Q4 2025-released lending & borrowing platform, MUTM is designed for long-term scalability, security, and adoption. For upside exposure for investors before the next round of capital rotation, Mutuum Finance is one of the most promising altcoins to have in your portfolio today.

This comes as market participants continue to speculate on whether the flagship crypto could fall below this psychological level if a full-blown bear market were to occur. Bitcoin Price Has Likely Turned $100,000 Into Support PlanB stated in an X post that he will not be surprised if the Bitcoin price does not drop below $100,000 again as the market witnesses the $100,000 resistance turn into $100,000 support. The analyst further noted that the September close was the fifth consecutive monthly close above that psychological price level. Related Reading: Here’s The Best Time To Buy Bitcoin As Impulse Wave Sets Path To $150,000 PlanB stated that the same thing happened when the Bitcoin price was trading at $10,000, $1,000, $100, and $10. The analyst’s remarks came as he noted that 63% of people think that Bitcoin will drop below $100,000. Notably, there were more calls for a drop below $100,000 towards the end of September when BTC dropped to as low as $108,000. Crypto influencer Ansem was among those who predicted that the flagship crypto would likely retest $90,000. However, the Bitcoin price has since staged a remarkable comeback from the $108,000 lows, rallying to a new all-time high (ATH) above $126,000 to start the month. As a result, BTC is already up 7% to start the month, with October notably the flagship crypto’s second-best performing month after November, based on historical data. It is worth noting that the Bitcoin price has traded above $100,000 since May 8 and has now been above this psychological level for over 150 days, its longest streak. Meanwhile, market participants are currently betting that it will likely stay this way. According to Polymarket data, there is only a 25% chance that BTC will drop below $100,000 by the end of this year. BTC Bull Market Still On Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto declared that the crypto market is still on and questioned why market participants were in a rush to call the top. The analyst noted that the Stoch Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossovers keep aligning with strength. He added that the chart will tell them when the bull run is over, but for now, that is not the case. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s 2021 Playbook Shows The Final Price Target For This Bull Cycle In another analysis, Titan of Crypto revealed that the Bitcoin price continues to print higher highs and higher lows. Based on this, he raised the possibility that BTC could rally to as high as $160,000 by the end of the year. This aligns with predictions by JPMorgan and Standard Chartered, which predict that BTC can reach $165,000 and $200,000, respectively, by year-end. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $122,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto investor and analyst Mason Versluis shared his reaction in a video posted, describing the update as “bad news for XRP holders.” Versluis emphasized that while he remains bullish on XRP, the news marks a setback for those who believed SWIFT would align with Ripple . Bad $XRP News?! SWIFT has clearly chosen Ethereum. Not Ripple, and not XRP! I am NOT selling because of this, I don’t care! Explained pic.twitter.com/g59jqF5vkT — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) October 8, 2025 SWIFT Partners with Ethereum’s ConsenSys According to SWIFT, the organization is developing a shared digital ledger with more than 30 financial institutions worldwide. The initiative aims to enable real-time, around-the-clock cross-border payments by integrating blockchain-based ledgers into SWIFT’s infrastructure stack. The surprising element for XRP supporters is the company SWIFT chose to collaborate with. Versluis noted that ConsenSys, founded by Ethereum co-creator Joseph Lubin, “focuses on Ethereum,” showing SWIFT’s preference for that ecosystem. This move appears to dismiss two major beliefs within the XRP community: that SWIFT would either be replaced by XRP or directly adopt Ripple’s products. “Today is the day that we get confirmation that they’re actually just going with ConsenSys,” Versluis said, making clear that the global network has opted for Ethereum-based solutions instead. Questions Over Ethereum’s Efficiency While analyzing the decision, Versluis questioned the practicality of using Ethereum for cross-border settlements, given its transaction fees and speed limitations. “Why would they use Ethereum, where you can pay $20 per fee?” he asked, contrasting it with XRP’s faster and cheaper payment capabilities. However, he acknowledged that recent advances, such as layer 2 scaling solutions and atomic swaps, are improving Ethereum’s efficiency and may have influenced SWIFT’s decision. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Versluis also pointed out that SWIFT’s statement referenced earlier pilot programs involving various blockchain platforms. He suggested that Ripple or Chainlink could have been among those tested, but the final selection of ConsenSys shows where SWIFT intends to concentrate its current efforts. XRP Community Remains Firm Despite describing the update as disappointing, Versluis said he has no plans to sell his holdings . He reiterated confidence in Ripple’s progress, stating that “Ripple will continue to build as they have been, and XRP will continue to build as they have been.” His closing remarks signaled determination rather than panic, reflecting the stance of investors who view XRP’s utility and partnerships as long-term strengths independent of SWIFT’s direction. Although SWIFT favors Ethereum, XRP supporters remain confident that Ripple’s ecosystem will continue advancing XRP’s role in cross-border finance .

Germany trades more with EU countries Good Morning from Germany, where the trade surplus widened slightly in Aug as imports fell 1.3% – a steeper drop than exports, which declined 0.5% MoM. Exports to the US – Germany’s largest trading partner – fell 2.5% to €10.9bn, marking the fifth straight monthly decline and… pic.twitter.com/Vjcp4RuagA — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) October 9, 2025 According to the report, exports from Germany to the U.S. have dropped for the fifth consecutive month, reaching their lowest level in nearly four years. The drop in exports comes as the impact of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump continues to reverberate across global trade. Senior economist at Commerzbank, Ralph Solveen, argued that the flow of goods to the U.S. in particular is likely to remain weak in the coming months, especially as higher tariffs are compounded by an even stronger euro. In August, the European Union agreed with the Trump administration on a unified 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. The deal includes levies on automotives, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and timber. Other European goods, such as critical natural resources like cork, all aircraft and aircraft components, generic pharmaceuticals, and chemical precursors, were granted preferential treatment under the agreement. The European Commission reported that goods and services worth over 4.2 billion euros cross the Atlantic each day. According to the commission, the EU’s annual trade value amounts to 1.6 trillion euros. Destatis reported that Germany’s trade surplus stemmed from trade within the European Union. Data shows the country exported roughly 72.5 billion worth of goods to other EU members, as well as imported 58.8 billion euros, which resulted in a significant intra-bloc surplus. The EU recorded a 2.5% month-to-month drop in exports, while imports also fell by 1.9%. Germany also saw a trade deficit with non-EU countries, with exports amounting to 57.1 billion euros in August and imports reaching 53.7 billion euros. The United Kingdom recorded the biggest decline in German imports among non-EU partners, with exports dropping 6.5% month-on-month to 13.5 billion euros. Germany’s imports to China increased by about 5.4% from July to 6.8 billion. Beijing is also currently the biggest supplier to Germany, but imports from the country dropped 4.5% in the month to 13.5 euros. Solveen believes that exports to China are unlikely to pick up more pace in the coming months. Germany sees improvement in its overall trade balance in August Germany still saw an improvement in its overall trade balance in August despite subdued export activity. The country exported goods worth 129.7 billion euros, down 0.5% from July and 0.7% lower than in August. Its imports amounted to 112.5 billion euros, a 13% monthly decline but a 3.5% surge year-on-year. Germany’s trade surplus increased to 17.17 billion euros in August 2025, its second consecutive monthly gain. However, the country’s trade surplus saw a 21.6% annual drop, representing 21.9 billion euros a year earlier. “Hopes for an economic recovery are not based on foreign demand, but on a domestic economy that is picking up due to lower European Central Bank interest rates and higher government spending.” -Ralph Sloveen, Senior Economist at Commerzbank. Despite the drop in exports, Germany’s DAX index rose to fresh record highs during morning trading on Thursday, trading above 24,700 points. Companies like Bayer and HeidelbergCement led the gains on the index, climbing by 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. The EURO STOXX 50 index also rose to all-time highs, trading around 5,655 points and rising by more than 5% over the past month. The STOXX 600 index is trading near all-time highs despite dropping by 0.3% in the morning hours.

The flagship cryptocurrency traded above $124,000 on Wednesday but lost momentum and fell to $121,600. Selling pressure pushed BTC even lower as it fell to $121,274 before moving to its current level. BTC is down 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $121,616. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $4,500 and is down nearly 3%, trading around $4,345. Ripple (XRP) is down over 2%, while Solana (SOL) is marginally down, trading around $221. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 1.43%, while Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) are down 1.64% and 1.45%. Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) are also trading in bearish territory. Tokenization Race Raises Red Flags The race to tokenize stocks has raised concerns among traditional financial firms and regulatory experts who have warned of significant risk to investors and market stability. Crypto companies are rushing to sell tokens pegged to stocks, buoyed by President Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the SEC’s push for friendlier regulations under Chair Paul Atkins. Crypto firms Kraken, Gemini, and Robinhood have already launched tokenized stocks in Europe and are seeking approval in the United States. According to supporters, blockchain-based trading instruments tracking traditional equities could revolutionize the stock market, allowing shares to be traded 24/7. It will also offer instant settlements, boosting market liquidity and lowering transaction costs. However, critics have noted that while the products are marketed as stocks, they rarely offer the same rights, disclosures, and protections as traditional equities. Critics argue these products resemble riskier derivatives, increasing the hazards for investors. Additionally, tokenization could also undermine market integrity and fragment liquidity. Diego Ballon Ossio, partner at law firm Clifford Chance, stated, “You're buying exposures to those shares through creating some sort of synthetic instrument. A lot of the burden gets shifted on you to understand what exactly it is that you're buying.” Stablecoins Could Boost Dollar Demand JPMorgan analysts believe stablecoins could generate $1.4 trillion in US Dollar demand by 2027. According to a note to investors, the rapid growth of stablecoins could give a boost to the currency instead of dethroning it. The increase can be attributed to overseas investors adopting stablecoins for transactions and investments, which would require them to convert their local currencies into tokens backed by the US Dollar. US treasuries, bonds, and dollar-based assets also back some stablecoins. The report noted, “Whether such a high-end scenario growth trajectory will actually play out remains to be seen, but if it does, stablecoin-related dollar inflows could become cumulatively significant.” While there are stablecoins backed by other countries in the market, none dominate the market like Dollar-backed coins. CoinGecko data reveals that dollar-backed stablecoins make up over $300 billion of the $304 billion stablecoin market cap. This means over 90% of stablecoins are backed by the US Dollar in some way. Bitcoin (BTC) Could See Dramatic Surge: Peter Brandt Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes Bitcoin (BTC) is set for an unprecedented price discovery phase as long as it doesn’t peak in the next few days. Brandt highlighted BTC’s historical cycle pattern, which played out during previous cycles, stating, “It is reasonable to expect a bull market high any day now. These cycles from low-to-halving-to-high have not always been the same length, but the post-halving distance of each has always been equal to the pre-halving distance. Sooner or later, cycles change. But betting against a cycle that has a perfect three-for-three record should not be done with reckless abandon.” However, Brandt added that he is divided about the outcome, stating, “I will remain bullish, hopeful for counter-cyclicality. In this case, a move well beyond $150,000 would be my expectation, perhaps as high as $185,000.” North Korean Hackers Going After Wealthy Crypto Holders North Korean hackers are increasingly targeting high-net-worth crypto holders, having stolen over $2 billion from them so far this year. North Korean hackers associated with the Lazarus Group targeted cryptocurrency companies to pull off large heists. However, investigators from research firm Elliptic have warned that wealthy individuals have emerged as attractive targets because they lack security measures. According to Dr. Tom Robinson, chief scientist at Elliptic, targeting of individuals is rarely reported, meaning the actual number of individual hacks could be significantly higher. “Other thefts are likely unreported and remain unknown, as attributing cyber thefts to North Korea is not an exact science. We are aware of many other thefts that share some of the hallmarks of North Korea-linked activity but lack sufficient evidence to be definitively attributed.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is facing selling pressure and volatility as it looks to hold above $120,000. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Monday, reaching $126,296 before settling at $124,720. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as the price fell almost 3% to $121,393. BTC recovered on Wednesday, reaching an intraday high of $124,254 before settling at $123,343. The price is down nearly 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $122,230. A new price volatility analysis has predicted that BTC could flip parabolic or end its bull market within the next 100 days. According to a post on X, Bitcoin trader Tony Severino stated that Bitcoin’s next move depends on the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator. Bollinger Bands are a classic volatility gauge that act as a leading indicator for price action. Severino pointed out that the bands hit record tightness on the weekly timeframe. Market analysts have been waiting for a price breakout through the upper or lower band. However, Severino believes such a move will not come immediately. “For now, BTCUSD has failed to break out above the upper band with strength. According to past local consolidation ranges, it could take as long as 100+ days to get a valid breakout (or breakdown, if BTC dumps instead).” According to analysts, BTC’s price action is yet to show the rapid upside characteristics observed during the final stages of bull runs. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that BTC price cycles are getting longer, not shorter. “It’s unlikely Bitcoin has already peaked in its Bull Market because that would effectively mean that this cycle was one of the shortest of all time. Price Discovery Correction 2 is over. In the end, it was indeed shallower, but it took roughly the same amount of time to resolve as in previous cycles (2017, 2021). Now, Bitcoin is on the cusp of entering Price Discovery Uptrend 3.” Additionally, Bitwise analysts have pointed out that BTC is clear of overbought conditions, and could continue pushing higher after Monday’s all-time high. “Despite this strong performance, technical indicators suggest the price is still moving within a stable range far from the overbought conditions that typically precede historical peaks.” BTC started the previous weekend with a marginal drop on Saturday before rising over 2% on Sunday and settling at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,659. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 1.65% to reclaim $120,000 and settle at $120,621. Bullish sentiment persisted on Friday despite volatility and selling pressure. As a result, BTC reached an intraday high of $123,996 before settling at $122,318. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $122,458. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as BTC rallied, surging past $125,000 to a new all-time high of $125,559. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $123,520. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Monday, crossing $126,000 to reach $126,296 before settling at $124,720. Despite strong bullish momentum, BTC retreated on Tuesday, falling nearly 3% and settling at $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 2% to reclaim $123,000 and settle at $123,343. BTC is down nearly 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $122,600 after falling to an intraday low of $121,175. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Bearish sentiment returned during the ongoing session as Ethereum (ETH) fell over 3% to $4,371. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied on Monday, briefly crossing $4,700 before settling at $4,687. However, price action turned bearish on Tuesday, falling over 5% to $4,451. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Wednesday, rising 1.68% and settling at $4,525 before declining during the current session. ETH came within $200 of its all-time high Monday when it briefly crossed $4,700. However, with sellers active at upper levels, buyers lost momentum and the price crashed to a low of $4,436. Analysts expect ETH to set a new record above $5,000 if institutional demand and optimism around its Fusaka upgrade persist. Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, CIO at XBTO, stated, “Ethereum’s path toward $5,000 will depend on a confluence of sustained institutional demand, upgrade-driven scalability, and supportive macro conditions. Spot ETH ETFs have seen robust inflows, over $1.3 billion in the past week alone, signaling renewed conviction from institutional allocators. On-chain metrics and whale accumulation patterns indicate that ETH may be entering an expansion phase reminiscent of BTC’s 2020 breakout.” ETH started the week strong, with spot Ethereum ETFs pulling in over $176 million in inflows on Monday. Ethereum ETFs registered $1.48 billion in inflows globally last week, making a comeback after substantial outflows the week prior. Investors and analysts believe ETH could resume its uptrend. Rodriguez-Alarcón stated that risk assets have benefited from monetary policy signals coming from the Federal Reserve. “On the macro front, a dovish Fed tilt, ongoing pressure on fiat currencies, and positive momentum in gold could unlock additional flows into risk assets. In that environment, Ethereum stands to benefit disproportionately given its foundational role across DeFi, stablecoins, and tokenization infrastructure.” However, one cause for alarm is a record $10 billion worth of ETH queued in Ethereum’s validator exit queue, as stakers look to withdraw their funds from the network. Validators looking to exit the network are facing an average wait time of 42 days. ETH started the previous weekend in the red, registering a marginal decline on Saturday. Price action turned bullish on Sunday as ETH rose over 3% and settled at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose nearly 2% and settled at $4,217. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping almost 2% to $4,145. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as the price rose 4.92% to cross $4,300 and settle at $4,349. Buyers retained control on Thursday as ETH rose over 3% to $4,486. The price faced volatility on Friday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as ETH rose $0.56% to reclaim $4,500 and settle at $4,512. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as ETH fell 0.54% on Saturday and reached an intraday high of $4,616 on Sunday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $4,515, ultimately rising 0.62%. ETH continued rising on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $4,738 before settling at $4,687. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as the price fell by over 5% and settled at $4,451. ETH recovered on Wednesday, rising 1.68% and settling at $4,525. The price is down over 3% during the ongoing session, trading around $4,388. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is down over 2% during the ongoing session as it struggles to regain momentum after Tuesday’s dramatic correction. The price fell by over 5% on Tuesday before recovering on Wednesday, rising over 4% to $229. Analysts believe that despite recent struggles, SOL could surge to $300 if bullish sentiment returns. The altcoin has registered a 22% increase in seven-day network fees, thanks to rising activity across decentralized exchanges. Network fees are key for blockchains focused on decentralized applications, as the revenue helps offset inflationary pressures. Solana’s total value locked (TVL) also rose 8% in 30 days, further helping network fees. Solana ETPs and ETFs have also registered substantial investor interest, attracting over $700 million in inflows for the week ending September 5. Investors are also optimistic about the SEC approving Solana ETFs, which could act as a catalyst for positive price action. Additionally, several companies have rebranded themselves as Solana treasury companies. This has resulted in nearly $4 billion in SOL being held on the balance sheets of public companies. Recently, Nasdaq-listed Brera Holdings rebranded itself to Solmate after a $300 million oversubscribed PIPE raise. SOL started the previous weekend in the red, registering a drop of almost 1%. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising 3.58% to settle at $210. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as SOL rose 0.92% to $212. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping over 2% to a low of $204, before settling at $208. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to reclaim $220 and settle at $222. Buyers retained control on Thursday as SOL rose nearly 6% to cross $230 and settled at $234. Source: TradingView However, SOL lost momentum on Friday, dropping 0.86% to $232. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell by over 2% and settled at $227. SOL reached an intraday high of $237 on Sunday as markets rallied. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $228, ultimately rising 0.35%. Buyers retained control on Monday as SOL reached an intraday high of $237 before settling at $232. Despite the positive sentiment, the price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling over 5% and settling at $220. SOL recovered on Wednesday, rising over 4% to $229. However, it is back in the red during the ongoing session, down over 2%, trading around $224. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Analysis Internet Computer (ICP) started the previous week in positive territory, rising 1.90% on Sunday and settling at $4.30. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 0.93% to $4.26. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 0.94% and settled at $4.22. Despite the selling pressure, ICP recovered on Wednesday, rising over 6% and settling at $4.49. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 2% to $4.58.

Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 2.51% and settled at $4.401. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as APT rallied, rising almost 11% and settling at $4.871.

With this feature, Coinbase users will have access to millions of on-chain assets directly within the Coinbase mobile app and won’t need to switch platforms or manage external wallets. American users get a new DEX Even though Coinbase formally launched its DEX trading within its app for U.S. users, customers in New York won’t have access to those services. Talk of an exchange first came in August, when it was available to select users. It has now been formally rolled out to the public, who will be able to trade tokens before they’re considered for traditional listing on the exchange. To facilitate the service, Coinbase has integrated with liquidity pools supported by 1inch and 0x, which expose users to only “secure, non-custodial token swaps” directly on-chain. Users can trade a variety of Base-native tokens at launch, including assets from projects such as Virtuals AI Agents, Reserve Protocol DTFs, SoSo Value Indices, Auki Labs, and eSuper Champs. Why Coinbase is going the DEX route now The timing is not a mistake as it is happening at a time when Coinbase is trying to offset declining exchange activity. In the second quarter, the company recorded $237 billion in trading volume, down slightly from $226 billion a year earlier. Aside from declining CEX activity, Coinbase is also launching a DEX because it wants a piece of the growing trading volume pie that many DEXs are now enjoying. According to DefiLlama, perpetual decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) have hit a record $1.226 trillion in trading volume over the past 30 days, marking the first time the sector has crossed the trillion-dollar threshold . The surge has pushed the values 48% higher than August’s $707.6 billion, highlighting accelerating demand for decentralized derivatives trading. So far, Aster DEX has led the rally, with $493.6 billion in volume, followed by Hyperliquid, which has generated over $280 billion. However, there are other notable contributors, including Lighter DEX, EdgeX, Pacifica, and Bybit’s Apex Protocol, who together account for over $280 billion in additional trading activity. Lighter and EdgeX have a confirmed airdrop campaign ongoing and have been doing considerable volume, with EdgeX pulling in revenue to rival Circle and Tether’s while Lighter DEX drew $164 billion in activity despite still being in beta. There are also new entrants like SunPerp, the first perpetual DEX on TRON, which has amassed $30 million in total value locked after launch. The growing popularity of perp DEXs is proof of changing trading behavior from centralized exchanges to decentralized platforms offering transparency, self-custody, and 24/7 global access.

Contradicts Previous Forecasts!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/jpmorgan-releases-new-solana-sol-forecast-contradicts-previous-forecasts/,"As is known, following the budget crisis in the USA, the budget bill failed to receive approval and the US government officially shut down. While the government shutdown is expected to have an impact on Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market as well as financial markets, it is also stated that it will delay altcoin ETF decisions. Like many government agencies, the SEC has furloughed many employees and will continue to operate with a limited staff. This has caused delays in decisions regarding the altcoin ETFs awaiting approval. Related News: How Will the US Government Shutdown Affect XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Other Altcoin ETFs? Here's the Answer... While popular altcoins such as XRP, Solana, and Litecoin are among the altcoins awaiting approval from the SEC, JPMorgan announced its expectations for the Solana (SOL) ETF. JPMorgan analysts said spot Solana ETFs are likely to be approved soon, but will see limited inflows compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs, The Block reported. Analysts estimate that Solana ETFs will see net inflows of only about $1.5 billion in the first year, compared to about one-seventh of the Ethereum ETF inflows in the first year. JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in the report: “The likelihood of spot Solana ETF approval is further strengthened by the fact that a futures contract is already trading on the CME. But even if the SOL ETFs are approved, first-year inflows would be around $1.5 billion. This equates to about one-seventh of the Ethereum ETF holdings. JPMorgan analysts listed the following reasons for the outlook they predicted for SOL: “slowing on-chain activity, concentrated trading in memecoins, weakening investor sentiment towards Solana compared to Ethereum, declining on-chain activity such as declining active addresses since November 2024, and competition with composite index-based products such as the S&P Dow Jones Digital Market 50.” JPMorgan also noted that there was no clear signal of strong demand in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Solana futures positions, suggesting that Solana ETFs would be in high demand. JPMorgan's latest forecast contradicts earlier estimates from another JPMorgan analyst team led by Kenneth B. Worthington, which earlier this year estimated that the Solana ETFs could attract net inflows of $2.7 billion to $5.2 billion within six to 12 months if approved. *This is not investment advice.

See our comprehensive breakdown of the growing landscape of seizable crypto assets: https://t.co/giBijDP5LM — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) October 9, 2025 The analysis focuses on static balances rather than transaction flows, arguing that the stock of assets sitting in wallets tied to illicit activity is the clearest indicator of what can be recovered today. Illicit Balances Swell to $15B, Led by Stolen Funds As of July 2025, wallets directly attributed to illicit entities hold nearly $15 billion across Bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins—up roughly 359% since 2020. Stolen funds are the single largest category by balance, reflecting the tendency of hackers to park assets while testing laundering routes or awaiting cash-out opportunities. While the share of Bitcoin held by illegal actors has fallen in coin terms since 2020, BTC still represents about 75% of illicit entity balances by value, thanks to long-run price appreciation. Ether and stablecoins have grown as a share of holdings, with stablecoins often used tactically as short-term liquidity during laundering. The $60B Downstream Shadow Economy Beyond the first hop, Chainalysis identifies over $60 billion sitting in “downstream” wallets—addresses that received more than 10% of their inflows from illicit sources—roughly four times the balances held by the illicit entities themselves. Darknet market administrators and vendors account for over $40 billion of this total, showing how marketplace structures distribute wealth across operators and sellers and have benefited from a decade of crypto price gains. Chainalysis cautions that some laundering hubs and cross-chain bridges act primarily as transit points, so their standing balances may understate their centrality to criminal value chains. Cash-Out Routes Fragment as Seizure Windows Shrink Centralized exchanges remain the preferred off-ramp, with illicit inflows averaging more than $14 billion per year since 2020 and nearing $7 billion in the first half of 2025. But criminals are adding layers to evade compliance: direct transfers from illicit wallets to exchanges have plunged from roughly 40% of quarterly flows in 2021–2022 to around 15% in Q2 2025. Deposit address reuse is also collapsing, indicating faster turnover of exchange accounts. After operations cease, liquidation speeds diverge by asset: nearly 95% of stablecoin balances drain within 90 days, about 87% for ether, and only ~52% for Bitcoin—leaving a longer runway to interdict BTC holdings. Policy Playbook: Converting Insight into Recoveries With Washington’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Assets Stockpile indicating a more aggressive seizure policy, Chainalysis argues that speed and coordination are now decisive. Effective recovery requires expedited seizure powers, cross-border information sharing, and technical capacity to trace funds across chains. The company says its KYT and Reactor tools, along with its services arm, have already helped authorities seize more than $12.6 billion. The headline figure—$15 billion in illicit-entity balances and over $60 billion downstream—suggests that with modernized workflows and clearer legal pathways, law enforcement can translate blockchain transparency into record-level recoveries.

The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1%, trading around $122,229. BTC appears to have lost momentum as its record-breaking rally cools. Prices are testing key levels that could dictate their next move. Markets started October in bullish fashion, with BTC surging to a new all-time high of $126,296. Peter Brandt Makes Bitcoin (BTC) Prediction Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes Bitcoin is set for an unprecedented price discovery phase if it doesn’t peak in the next few days. Brandt highlighted BTC’s historical cycle pattern, which played out during previous cycles, stating, “It is reasonable to expect a bull market high any day now. These cycles from low-to-halving-to-high have not always been the same length, but the post-halving distance of each has always been equal to the pre-halving distance. Sooner or later, cycles change. But betting against a cycle that has a perfect three-for-three record should not be done with reckless abandon.” However, Brandt added that he is divided about the outcome, stating, “I will remain bullish, hopeful for counter-cyclicality. In this case, a move well beyond $150,000 would be my expectation, perhaps as high as $185,000.” Four-Year Cycle Debate Rages On Meanwhile, the debate over whether Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is still relevant continues as institutional interest, ETFs, and corporate treasuries make their mark. Analyst Rekt Capital had said back in July that if Bitcoin follows its 2020 pattern, the rally would likely peak in October. “We have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left.” Some analysts and market experts believe that even if Bitcoin doesn’t follow the four-year cycle, it will exhibit a similar pattern. Gemini’s head of the APAC region, Saad Ahmed, stated during Token2049, “It ultimately stems from people getting excited and overextending themselves, and then you kind of see a crash, and then it kind of corrects to an equilibrium.” Arthur Hayes Believes Four-Year Bitcoin Cycle Is Dead BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes the Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead. However, his reasons are not what many people expect. Hayes stated in a blog post, “As the four-year anniversary of this fourth cycle is upon us, traders wish to apply the historical pattern and forecast an end to this bull run.” Hayes stated that Bitcoin price cycles are driven by the supply of the USD and the Chinese yuan, not four-year patterns linked to the halving event. The BitMEX founder also believes the current cycle is different for several reasons. These include the US Treasury draining $2.5 trillion from the Federal Reserve’s reverse repo program into the market by issuing more treasury bills. There are also ongoing discussions about deregulating banks and increasing lending. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has resumed rate cuts despite inflation being at higher levels. However, several market experts still believe in the four-year cycle. On-chain analytics platform Glassnode believes that Bitcoin’s current price action mirrors past patterns. Meanwhile, Ahmed added, “I think when it comes to the four-year cycle, the reality is that it’s very likely that we’ll continue to see some form of a cycle.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with BTC down nearly 2%. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to regain momentum after Monday’s record high, registering a notable decline on Tuesday before recovering on Wednesday to reclaim $123,000. Bitcoin’s current price action is part of a broader market slowdown as Monday’s rally loses steam. BTC’s rally was fueled by spot buying and record ETF inflows. However, with buyers losing momentum, analysts fear a drop to $120,000 could be possible. However, technical indicators point to further strength after Bitcoin formed a double-bottom pattern on its daily chart. The pattern is marked by two lows at roughly the same price between a sharp rally, and is generally viewed as a bullish signal. An analysis from CryptoQuant supported this outlook, pointing out that profit-taking remained low despite BTC rising to record levels. However, if BTC remains above $120,000, it could retest $120,000, potentially pushing towards $130,000. According to a post on X, Bitcoin trader Tony Severino stated that Bitcoin’s next move depends on the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator. Bollinger Bands are a classic volatility gauge that act as a leading indicator for price action. Severino pointed out that the bands hit record tightness on the weekly timeframe. Market analysts have been waiting for a price breakout through the upper or lower band. However, Severino believes such a move will not come immediately. “For now, BTCUSD has failed to break out above the upper band with strength. According to past local consolidation ranges, it could take as long as 100+ days to get a valid breakout (or breakdown, if BTC dumps instead).” Rekt Capital believes BTC’s price cycles are getting longer, stating, “It’s unlikely Bitcoin has already peaked in its Bull Market because that would effectively mean that this cycle was one of the shortest of all time. Price Discovery Correction 2 is over. In the end, it was indeed shallower, but it took roughly the same amount of time to resolve as in previous cycles (2017, 2021). Now, Bitcoin is on the cusp of entering Price Discovery Uptrend 3.” BTC started the previous weekend with a marginal drop on Saturday before rising by over 2% on Sunday and settling at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,659. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 1.65% to reclaim $120,000 and settle at $120,621. Bullish sentiment persisted on Friday despite volatility and selling pressure. As a result, BTC reached an intraday high of $123,996 before settling at $122,318. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $122,458. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as BTC rallied, surging past $125,000 to a new all-time high of $125,559. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $123,520. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Monday, crossing $126,000 to reach $126,296 before settling at $124,720. Despite strong bullish momentum, BTC retreated on Tuesday, falling nearly 3% and settling at $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 2% to reclaim $123,000 and settle at $123,343. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 2%. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
