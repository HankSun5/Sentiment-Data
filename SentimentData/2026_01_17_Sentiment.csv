SOL was trading for $5 before its huge rally in 2021. Currently, MUTM is in phase 7 of presale for $0.04, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking asymmetrical gains. MUTM is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, creating real on-chain demand for investors. If MUTM were to tap the DeFi market in the same way that SOL did, it could reach multiples similar to what Solana achieved in 2021, positioning itself as the best crypto to invest in. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana has recently stabilized above long-term support following a trend of lower highs, which means that it might be overcoming some of the downward pressure that it was facing. Currently, it’s testing downward resistance lines, which will define its future trend. Although SOL is a strong long-term investment, it’s no longer an asymmetrical investment opportunity, unlike projects that are still in their earlier cycles, for example, MUTM, which many analysts now consider the next crypto to explode. MUTM Presale Growth The Mutuum Finance presale has been effective in incentivizing early investors while also promoting a smooth process of token distribution. From a price of $0.01, the token has appreciated to $0.04 in Phase 7, a tremendous 300% increase for the initial investors. Phase 8 is set at $0.045, while trading will commence at $0.06. Early investors get a head start, as seen below, where a $5,000 investment made today will increase to $6,250 at the opening of Phase 8, realizing a $1,250 profit long before the token listing on exchanges. With more than 18,800 participants and close to $19.8 million raised, MUTM appears to be gaining significant adoption momentum, making it a highly notable rising star of 2026 and the best crypto to invest in during the presale stage. Dual Lending System: Real Utility & Real Returns Mutuum Finance provides a two-way lending system to achieve the highest possible flexibility and returns. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools enable lenders to contribute liquid funds such as ETH and USDC, earning variable interest rates depending on the pool’s usage ratio. An investor could for instance deposit 20,000 USDC in a P2C lending pool, earning 10-15% APY. This could see their initial investment grow into up to $23,000 by the end of the first year. Further compounding over the years could mean reaching as high as $100,000. In contrast, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending option is designed for riskier and less liquid tokens, such as meme coins, where the terms of the loan can be customized and agreed upon by the borrower and the lender. A borrower, for instance, can acquire a 30-day loan of $20,000 in USDC collateralized with a total of $25,000 in PEPE at an interest rate of 15% APR, making MUTM a flexible tool for those searching for the next crypto to explode with real utility. Risk Management Risk management practices are a top priority at Mutuum Finance, with Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation levels determined according to the volatility of each asset. For instance, ETH and USDT support up to 75% Loan-to-Value with an 80% liquidation level, enabling an investor with $8,000 of ETH to take a loan of up to $6,000 of USDT without selling their holdings. More volatile assets support lower Loan-to-Value levels, ensuring that both lenders and the system are safe. Automated liquidation of positions maintains a stable system and inspires trust among users that their assets and returns are safe and secure, which is why analysts consider MUTM the best crypto to invest in for high-potential gains. Prior to deploying on mainnet, Mutuum Finance will roll out Version 1 of its lending/borrowing solution on the Sepolia Testnet . Users will be able to engage with ETH, USDT liquidity pools, mtTokens, which are tokens of deposits, debt tokens issued as a result of taking loans, as well as the automated liquidator bot. In this way, test users will be able to see, hands-on, how interest rates work, how collaterals are handled, among other aspects of the platform. Upside Post-Launch Looking forward from the presale, market analysts believe that as MUTM implements layer-2 scaling, multi-chain expansion, and the launch of interest-bearing pools, adoption-driven market demand may drive token prices substantially upwards. Phase 7 presale token investments of $0.04 may potentially break through several times to mirror Solana’s growth. This solidifies Mutuum Finance’s status as the best crypto to invest in this year.

Monero is built around private, censorship-resistant transactions, using cryptography to obscure wallet balances and transfer details on-chain. That privacy-first design has kept XMR in its own category for years, often moving independently from large-cap altcoins when narrative-driven momentum returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Hits Level Seen Only 7 Times In 6 Years – A Rare Historical Signal Since the beginning of the year, XMR has surged from roughly $410 to nearly $799, a near-vertical move that reflects both aggressive demand and a rapid shift in trader attention toward the privacy coin sector. The breakout comes after similar sharp rallies in names like Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH), which also experienced explosive upside followed by fast pullbacks. Zcash climbed to around $750 before reversing toward the $400 zone, while Dash ran to roughly $120 and later dropped to near $35. Those moves set the tone for a volatile privacy coin rotation, where price action tends to accelerate quickly once momentum enters the sector. Now, with Monero leading the pack, the market is watching whether this rally can establish higher support levels, or if it becomes another short-lived spike driven by crowded positioning and thin liquidity. Retail Hype Signal Flashes As Monero Extends Its Breakout Monero’s surge is now starting to show the same “retail frenzy” footprint that appeared earlier in other privacy coins, raising questions about how sustainable this move really is. A trading frequency signal—often associated with crowded participation and late-stage chasing—previously lit up in Zcash and Dash near their local tops, before both coins reversed sharply. In Zcash, the retail-heavy activity spike aligned with a push to roughly $698, and the price has since slid back to around $442, a drawdown of about 37%. Dash followed a similar pattern. The trigger appeared near $120, before the market cooled off aggressively and dragged the price down to the $57 zone. A decline of roughly 52%. Now, the same signal is flashing for Monero. The retail-frequency threshold appeared around $714 as XMR traded deep into its parabolic advance. That matters because these setups often reflect emotional participation, where buyers enter late, liquidity thins, and volatility increases sharply. This doesn’t guarantee an immediate top, but history suggests a clear risk: once retail demand becomes dominant, the rally can become fragile. The bigger question is whether Monero can absorb profit-taking without breaking structure—or if it repeats the same post-spike unwind seen in ZEC and DASH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $97K As Long-Term Holders Supply Stays Locked XMR Surges Into Parabolic Territory Monero is showing one of the strongest price trends in the market. The weekly chart is now moving into a clear parabolic expansion phase. After spending much of 2024 in a slow accumulation range, XMR gradually built a base and repeatedly defended higher lows. This has set the stage for the subsequent breakout. Once Monero reclaimed the $200 area, momentum accelerated sharply, and buyers began to absorb sell pressure without allowing deep pullbacks. The chart shows a clear bullish structure. With price holding above rising moving averages and using them as dynamic support during each consolidation phase. This type of price behavior usually reflects sustained demand rather than a single short-lived spike. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Take Control: Futures Positioning Turns Bullish for First Time Since October However, the most notable development is the latest impulse candle. We saw the price surge into the $700 zone with almost no overhead resistance. These kinds of vertical advances often signal aggressive market participation and can lead to a volatility expansion event. Price either continues trending higher or enters a sharp correction after exhaustion. From a market structure perspective, the key is whether Monero can hold above previous breakout zones near $500–$600. If buyers defend those areas, the uptrend remains intact. If not, a deeper retracement could unfold quickly.

Ripple CEO Highlights Crypto Impact On CPI Data In an X post , the Ripple CEO noted that the latest CPI data shows a 3.5% reduction in financial services costs for consumers. He then raised the possibility that this decline could be partly due to the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies . The administration has created a regulatory environment for the crypto industry that may have made financial services more accessible, reducing their cost. Notably, the CPI data came in line with expectations, which was a positive for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . The CPI came in at 2.7% year-over-year (YoY), in line with expectations. The core CPI came in at 2.6% YoY, lower than expectations of 2.7%, signaling that inflation in the country has remained steady. Following the release of the CPI data, Bitcoin broke $92,000 and since surged to a new yearly high above $97,000. Major altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple-linked XRP , Solana, and Dogecoin have also recorded significant gains. The inflation data is bullish for the market as it could, in the long run, influence the Fed to make more rate cuts if inflation holds steady rather than trends upwards. Polymarket data show an increase in the number of rate cuts the Fed could make following the release of the CPI data. There is now a 27% chance of three rate cuts this year, while a 21% chance of two. Previously, crypto traders were betting on only two rate cuts this year. Trump is also expected to nominate a rate-cut advocate as the next Fed chair , which would be positive for lower interest rates. Ripple CEO Also Comments On Crypto Legislation The Ripple CEO also commented on the CLARITY Act’s markup , just before its postponement. He noted that the markup was long overdue, but that it is a massive step forward in providing workable frameworks for crypto while continuing to protect consumers. Garlinghouse further remarked that he and his company know firsthand that clarity beats chaos and that the bill’s success is crypto’s success. The Ripple CEO also mentioned that they will continue to move forward with a fair debate and remain optimistic that issues can be resolved through the markup process. The Senate Banking Committee has since postponed the markup after Coinbase withdrew its support for the bill due to concerns about DeFi and stablecoin yield provisions. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse has yet to comment on the postponement, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes that progress with the bill hasn’t stalled despite the setback.",Ripple|altcoins|bitcoin|Brian Armstrong|CLARITY Act|coinbase|DeFi|dogecoin|Donald Trump|Ethereum|Polymarket|ripple|solana|stablecoin|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-16 22:00:46

As this focus on tangible applications grows, investors are seeking out new ecosystems that offer similar utility. This trend has put a spotlight on GeeFi, a decentralized wallet platform that has already raised over $2.6 million in its presale by delivering a user-centric experience and a clear product roadmap. Building a Comprehensive Financial Ecosystem GeeFi is developing a suite of financial tools designed to offer real-world utility, mirroring Avalanche’s focus on payments and rewards. The project’s roadmap includes the upcoming launch of a proprietary Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and specialized Cryptocards. The DEX will provide a seamless environment for trading digital assets directly within its decentralized wallet. At the same time, the Cryptocards will connect users’ digital holdings to everyday commerce, making it easy to spend crypto for goods and services. These features are designed to create sustained demand for the $GEE token. Substantial ROI Potential for Early Backers The investment metrics for GeeFi’s presale are compelling. The $GEE token is currently priced at $0.10 , a significant discount from its confirmed exchange listing price of $0.40 . This provides an immediate 300% ROI for presale participants at the time of listing. Market analysts further project that the token’s value could rise to $3.00 as the platform’s full feature set is rolled out. A $1,500 investment at the current price could potentially grow to $45,000 , representing a 2900% return . Direct Presale Access Fuels User Growth Ease of use is a critical factor in driving adoption, and GeeFi has made participating in its presale remarkably simple. The team recently integrated the $GEE token presale directly into the GeeFi Wallet application. This strategic move eliminates the complexities often associated with early-stage investing, allowing users to purchase tokens instantly with Ethereum (ETH), USDT, or a standard bank card. This seamless experience has significantly boosted participation, pushing Phase 3 of the presale to 90% sold out . With only 3 million tokens remaining at the $0.10 price, the opportunity for entry is quickly diminishing. Rewarding Community and Long-Term Holding GeeFi has implemented a multi-faceted rewards system to foster a strong and engaged community. The platform offers a staking feature that allows token holders to earn a passive yield on their assets, which encourages long-term holding and helps stabilize the token’s economy. In addition, a 5% referral commission rewards users for bringing new participants into the ecosystem. These incentives, alongside a bonus system for early presale investors, create multiple avenues for maximizing returns. A Strong Commitment to Security and Privacy As institutional products like tokenized credit come on-chain, security becomes more important than ever. GeeFi is addressing this by fortifying its wallet with advanced security and privacy features. The latest update includes enhanced encryption and robust backend protocols designed to protect user assets and data from digital threats. This commitment to building a secure and trustworthy platform provides users with the confidence needed to manage their digital finances, establishing GeeFi as a reliable hub in the decentralized economy. Conclusion GeeFi is proving that a focus on utility, security, and accessibility is a winning strategy. As the broader market matures, with platforms like Avalanche leading the charge in institutional adoption, GeeFi stands out as a high-potential project for investors seeking real value. The window to join the presale at the current price is closing.

57225236,https://cryptonews.com/?p=475515,1768602600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57225236.jpeg,"New ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, PEPE and Ethereum By the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/new-chatgpt-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-pepe-and-ethereum-by-the-end-of-2026/,"OpenAI’s world famous AI , ChatGPT, predicts veritably explosive price scenarios for XRP, Pepe and Ethereum, offering a clear warning to investors with FOMO this year. The AI suggests that a sustained bull market, potentially reinforced by clearer and more supportive U.S. regulation, could propel these cryptocurrencies to fresh all-time highs (ATHs) in the next major cycle. Below is how ChatGPT expects these leading cryptocurrencies to perform during a projected 2026 bull market. XRP ($XRP): ChatGPT Sees XRP Reaching $12 by 2027 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) started the year on solid footing, gaining 19% in the opening week alone. Over the past fortnight, it grew 9% to trade at $2.06. According to ChatGPT, sustained bullish momentum could see XRP climb to $12 by 2027. Source: ChatGPT XRP was one of the strongest-performing large-cap cryptocurrencies throughout much of last year. In July, it notched its first new ATH in seven years, hitting $3.65 after Ripple achieved a landmark legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That court decision significantly reduced regulatory ambiguity around XRP and eased concerns that the SEC could classify similar altcoins as securities. Since New Year’s Day, XRP has risen roughly 12.5%, while its Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 58, indicating the token’s current price is strong with plenty of headroom for a weekend rally. Reaching ChatGPT’s bullish target would require substantial upside, however, as XRP needs to gain approximately 483% from current levels to hit $12. The recent launch of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., is channeling institutional capital into XRP, similar to the strong consistent multibillion dollar inflows seen following Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. Pepe ($PEPE): ChatGPT Predicts a 2,000% Price Explosion Pepe ($PEPE) , which debuted in April 2023, has become the largest meme coin not based on a doge avatar, boasting a market cap of about $2.5 billion. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comics, PEPE’s immediately recognisable face and ongoing cultural relevance have given it a strong presence across crypto-focused social platforms. Despite intense competition within the meme coin space, PEPE’s loyal community keep it pumping near the top of the sector. Periodic cryptic posts from Elon Musk on X have also fueled speculation that PEPE could rank alongside his widely known DOGE and BTC interests. PEPE is currently trading near $0.0000059, placing it roughly 79% below its December 2024 ATH of $0.00002803. In ChatGPT’s most bullish scenario, PEPE could surge as much as 1,934% to around $0.00012, a move that would take it well beyond its previous record high. Ethereum ($ETH): ChatGPT Models a Potential Rally Toward $15,000 Ethereum ($ETH) , the world leading blockchain for smart contracts, decentralized applications, and DeFi, remains the leading platform driving Web3 innovation. With a market capitalization approaching $400 billion and $75 billion in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols, Ethereum is crypto’s primary hub for on-chain commercial activity. Ethereum’s track record for security, dependable settlement, and its early dominance in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization make it a prime candidate for deeper institutional adoption, particularly if U.S. lawmakers advance clearer, comprehensive crypto legislation. ETH is currently trading around $3,308, with strong resistance expected near $5,000. It set its all-time high of $4,946.05 back in August. If ChatGPT’s bullish thesis plays out, a decisive break above the $5,000 level could open the door to multiple new ATHs this year in the $7,000 to $15,000 range. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Play With Explosive Upside Potential Beyond ChatGPT’s forecasts, the crypto presale market continues to attract investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as one of January’s most discussed presales, raising around $4.5 million ahead of its expected exchange launch. The project puts an louche, muscle-bound twist on Dogecoin. Brash, over-the-top, and intentionally absurd, Maxi Doge channels the raw meme energy that originally fueled meme coin culture. After years of watching his cousin DOGE dominate the spotlight, Maxi Doge is rallying a his own degen army driven by meme loyalty, aggressive trading strategies, and an unapologetic embrace of volatility. MAXI is an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a considerably lower environmental footprint than Dogecoin’s proof-of-work design. The current presale phase offers staking rewards of up to 69% APY, although returns decrease as more users join the staking pool. MAXI is priced at $0.0002785 in the latest round, with automatic price increases scheduled for future stages. Tokens can be purchased using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Maxi is sending Dogecoin back to the kennel with his tail between his legs! Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The attack was detected around 14:01 UTC, and CyversAlerts, a web3 security platform, posted it shortly after at 14:34 UTC, making it one of the first reported cases of address poisoning in the new year. How the $500K address poisoning scam happened According to the alert posted by CyversAlerts, the victim had initially sent a small test transaction of 5,000 USDT to what they thought was the intended recipient address, which ended in D3E6F. However, this was a poisoned fake address being monitored by the scammer. The scammer’s address ended in f3e6F, only differing subtly in the middle characters, which is usually abbreviated with dots for aesthetic purposes, something that these scams exploit . Two minutes after the victim sent the $5,000, he followed up with a bulk transfer of 509,000 USDT to the same incorrect address, bringing the total loss to a whopping $514,000. According to the attack flow timeline shared by CyversAlerts, the scammer put a lot of preparation into the effort, sending multiple small transactions from various similar addresses to poison the victim’s transaction history. In this way, they were able to fool the victim into thinking the fake address was legitimate when they copied it from their history. Unfortunately, once confirmed onchain, funds lost to such scams are rarely recoverable. They prey on human error and “copy pasta” habits. Victim lost $50M in December 2025 Last year, address poisoning scams contributed significantly to the millions of dollars lost to crypto scams. One of the biggest known losses was recorded in December. That attack saw a seasoned trader fall victim, losing a shocking $50 million in a single transaction after they copied a fraudulent wallet address from their transaction history. The victim transferred 49,999,950 USDT to the attacker-controlled address because it also closely mimicked their intended destination, with the first three and last four characters matching. The scammer quickly converted the stolen funds to ETH and distributed them across multiple wallets. Then they partially funneled it through the Tornado Cash mixer. According to reports, the victim’s wallet had been active for approximately two years and was primarily used for USDT transfers, with the stolen funds withdrawn from Binance shortly before the poisoned transfer occurred. Like the person who lost $500K today, the victim from last year also sent a test transaction, but theirs actually went to the correct address. This made them not doublecheck when they pasted the address again from their transaction history to send the bulk of the funds. It was one of the largest onchain scam losses in recent times. The victim followed up with an onchain message demanding a return of 98% of the stolen funds within 48 hours and backed it up with threats to involve law enforcement and legal entities, even offering the attacker a $1 million white hat bounty if they returned the funds in full. “This is your final opportunity to resolve this matter peacefully,” the message read. “If you fail to comply: we will escalate the matter through legal international law enforcement channels.” However, as of the time of this writing, no response has come from the scammer, and there is no proof the funds were recovered.Since it was laundered via Tornado Cash, the trail quickly went cold and recovery is unlikely.

Central to this is whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delivers Project Crypto quickly, a proposal aimed at updating federal securities laws to provide digital asset firms with long-overdue regulatory clarity. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market dominance has been sliding since summer , which indicates people are ditching it for altcoins. All of these factors ferment the high upside potential of XRP, Shiba Inu and Bonk in the next major bull cycle. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Eyes New Q1 Breakout With a market cap exceeding $125 billion, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) remains the largest cryptocurrency purpose-built for cross-border payments, offering rapid settlement times and very low transaction fees. Ripple designed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) primarily for banks and financial institutions, positioning itself as a faster and more cost-efficient alternative to SWIFT, which can be slow and expensive. Ripple’s underlying technology has also come up on the radars of organizations such as the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House, underscoring its increasing relevance. XRP surged to an all-time high of $3.65 in mid-2025 after Ripple resolved its long-running legal battle with the SEC. Since then, the token has declined roughly 43% amid a broader crypto downturn and is now trading near $2.06 after gaining 9% in the last fortnight. One recent game changer was the debut of multiple spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), giving traditional investors a regulated pathway into the asset. Additional ETF approvals, alongside a more favorable macro backdrop, could drive XRP toward $5 by Q2. A move toward $10 later in the year is possible if supported by regulatory progress, positive macro signals, and continued expansion of the Ripple ecosystem. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Origins to a High Utility Network Introduced in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has grown into the second-largest meme coin, with a market capitalization around $5 billion. Supported by a vast community and an expanding range of products, SHIB is increasingly viewed as a blue-chip altcoin contender rather than a purely-for-entertainment meme coin. At the time of writing, it trades around $0.0000084. Breaking above the sticky $0.000022 resistance level could set the stage for a move toward $0.00003 by March. In a sustained bullish scenario, SHIB could even finish the quarter near $0.00005. Shiba Inu’s utility is more than just a sales pitch. Shibarium, its Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution, reduces fees and enhances scalability. Additional privacy features and upcoming upgrades further reinforce SHIB’s transition from meme culture to a broader blockchain ecosystem. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin on the Rise Bonk ($BONK) , a dog-themed meme coin native to Solana, launched on December 25, 2022, triggering a holiday surge that pushed Solana ($SOL) up 34% in just two days and firmly established BONK as a key player within the ecosystem. Now trading at $0.00001077 with a market cap near $1 billion, it is one of the largest meme coins on Solana and is close to flipping the Official Trump ($TRUMP) token as the network’s flagship meme coin. Beyond speculation, BONK is actively used across Solana DeFi for tipping, micropayments, and NFT collateral. A falling wedge formation between late November and mid-March anticipated BONK’s July rally, during which it peaked at $0.00003906 before retracing alongside the broader meme coin market. Although still roughly 80% below its November 2024 all-time high of $0.00005825, renewed market momentum could see it set a new ATH by spring. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): It Looks Like a Meme Coin; It’s Really a High-Performance Bitcoin Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer-2 initiative that pairs playful visuals with serious technical ambitions, delivering faster transactions, lower fees, and advanced smart contract functionality on Bitcoin. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper incorporates decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables seamless cross-chain transfers involving Bitcoin. The project’s presale has already raised approximately $30.7 million, and market watchers anticipate 10x to 100x upside once the token lists on exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit reported no critical vulnerabilities in the smart contract. The HYPER token plays multiple roles within the ecosystem, including payment of transaction fees, governance voting, and staking rewards. Early presale participants can currently earn staking yields of up to 38% APY, although returns are expected to decline as the staking pool expands. With a full rollout planned for 2026, Bitcoin Hyper is an onramp for both long-term Bitcoin maxis and newcomers alike into the next evolution of the Bitcoin network.

Patrick Witt posted an update on X regarding the sale of 57.55 BTC forfeited by Samourai Wallet developers Keonne Rodriguez and Will Lonergan Hill. Did the SDNY violate Presidential orders? Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month that the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had sold approximately $6.3 million worth of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin was handed over by Samourai Wallet developers Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill as part of a guilty plea. On November 3 last year, on-chain data recorded a transfer of the seized 57.55353033 BTC from a government-controlled address (bc1q4pntkz06z7xxvdcers09cyjqz5gf8ut4pua22r) to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. The Coinbase address soon showed a zero balance, causing many analysts to believe that the assets had been sold for cash, directly violating Executive Order 14233, signed by President Trump in March 2025. The order specifically mandates that any “Government BTC” acquired through criminal or civil forfeiture “shall not be sold” and must instead be held in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). Patrick Witt, the Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the situation. “We have received confirmation from (the) DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated, per EO 14233. They will remain on the USG balance sheet as part of the SBR,” he said . Will the SDNY continue to defy the White House? Despite Todd Blanche’s memo from May 2025 that instructed the DOJ to only go after cases where there’s evidence of “knowing and willful” criminal intent by the developers themselves, the SDNY went ahead to successfully secure convictions for Roman Storm, a co-founder of Tornado Cash. In August 2025, a jury found him guilty of conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The SDNY also sentenced Rodriguez and Hill in November 2025 to five and four years in prison, respectively. President Trump told reporters in December last year that he is “looking into” a pardon for Rodriguez . Tim Scott, the Senate Banking Committee Chair, was forced to postpone a high-profile hearing for the CLARITY Act after Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, announced on social media that he would no longer be supporting the current draft. Armstrong said he is concerned that the bill gives too much authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over stablecoins and DeFi protocols. And without the backing of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, the bipartisan consensus led by Senator Cynthia Lummis has begun to fracture. Despite this, she has so far stated that lawmakers are “closer than ever” to a final deal. The current draft of the CLARITY Act includes rules that ban platforms like Coinbase from offering interests or rewards on stablecoins. The ban is a major win for traditional banking platforms, which claim that high stablecoin returns were taking away trillions of dollars from their sector. If these issues aren’t resolved, the bill could fail to pass before the 2026 election cycle starts and freeze all legislative processes. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

But even with the short-term dip, ETH is still up 7% this week and 13% over the past month, holding strong while setting the stage for a bigger breakout. Fueling this bullish momentum is a major announcement from BitMine , the largest Ethereum treasury in the market, which just invested $200 million into Beast Industries , the media company founded by YouTube icon MrBeast . This move signals confidence in Ethereum as the foundation for the next wave of digital platforms, content economies, and Web3 media. Ethereum remains the largest and most battle-tested layer-one network, and with institutional capital flowing in, the long-term Ethereum price prediction continues to look increasingly bullish. Ethereum Price Prediction: MrBeast Just Got a $200M Backing From One of ETH’s Biggest Whales – What Happens Next? As explained in the accompanying press release , BitMine – which currently holds just over 200,000 ETH (c. $13.7 billion) – has announced a $200 million equity investment into Beast Industries, with Beast CEO Jeff Housenbold indicating that there may also be collaboration between the two firms at some point. 2/ For those not familiar, @MrBeast is the number #1 content creator in the world and central to the lives of GenZ, GenAlpha and even Millennials – BitMine has targeted 5% of its balance sheet for ""moonshots"" and this is strategically sound move pic.twitter.com/iMLaJeNHWu — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) January 15, 2026 “Their support is a strong validation of our vision, strategy, and growth trajectory and it provides additional capital to achieve our goal to become the most impactful entertainment brand in the world,” he said. “We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.” This is bullish for both BitMine and MrBeast, and (by extension) it’s also bullish for the Ethereum price, although the latter hasn’t reacted all that positively to this news. As we see from its chart below, it continues to ride some significant momentum, despite the slight correction of the past 24 hours. It recently broke out of a bullish pennant, while its two main indicators – the relative strength index (yellow) and the MACD (orange, blue) – are still in the ascendancy, having been subdued for several months previously. Source: TradingView It therefore remains a very opportune time to buy Ethereum, which still remains 33% down from its ATH of $4,946, which it set in August. And fundamentally, Ethereum is one of the most bankable cryptos in the market. Its TVL accounts for 58% of the entire crypto ecosystem , and that’s not including Ethereum-based L2s, while Ethereum ETFs and digital funds currently sit on assets worth $25.26 billion . The future is therefore very bright for the token, with the Ethereum price likely to reach $4,000 by the end of Q1, and then $5,000 by H2. SUBBD Is Preparing to Launch An AI-Powered Content Creation Platform: Next 100x Alt? While Ethereum is one of the safer altcoins to invest in, traders looking for bigger, quicker gains may also want to diversify into smaller cap tokens. This may include allocating a percentage to presale coins, which in building up momentum during their sales can then go on to rally strongly when they list on exchanges. One token generating some early momentum right now is SUBBD ($SUBBD), a new Ethereum-based project that’s preparing to launching an adult content creation platform. Earn up to $500 per day with your own AI Creator Start here: https://t.co/9jJM0SyyiQ https://t.co/v7oruRW0ag — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) December 28, 2025 SUBBD launched its presale a couple of months ago, and has so far raised more than $1.4 million, a signal of just how much interest it’s attracting. Much of this interest comes from how it’s planning to combine AI and crypto in order to give its content creation platform an edge over pre-existing rivals. Its platform will offer a suite of AI tools that will make it easier for content creators to produce engaging content, including tools that help with ideas, that produce media and videos, and that also produce AI agents/performers. These promise to make users much more efficient, while the use of crypto means that payouts will be transparent and immediate. Together, this combination promises to make SUBBD one of the most advanced content platforms on the Web, and given that the SUBBD token will be necessary to pay subscriptions, it could experience substantial demand. Investors can buy it now by going to the SUBBD website , where the token is currently selling for $0.057475.

57227040,658018,1768604407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57227040.jpeg,"Bitcoin Smart Money Buys, While Retail Dumps: Why The Latest Rally Looks Well-Founded",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rally-looks-well-founded/,"A few days ago, the price of Bitcoin experienced a bounce after weeks of trading below the $91,000 mark. However, this renewed momentum appears to be gradually fading as the crypto market slowly shifts toward a bearish state, with large and retail BTC investors moving in a distinct direction. What’s Happening Behind The Bitcoin’s Rise Bitcoin may have slightly pulled back from its most recent bounce, but the price is still holding strong above the $95,000 level. Meanwhile, the latest jump has attracted significant attention in the broader cryptocurrency market, with the move being increasingly viewed as well-justified rather than speculative. Currently, on-chain and market data are showing a clear divergence in who is driving the ongoing move. Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain data analytics platform, disclosed that itcoin’s surge to a high of $97,800 on Wednesday seemed more than warranted due to the behavior of large and retail investors. Institutions, long-term investors, and big wallets, together referred to as smart money, have been discreetly accumulating while retail traders have been gradually lowering their exposure and selling into strength. With the rotation of supply from weaker hands to more conviction-driven investors reducing selling pressure , the rally’s foundation is being strengthened. When whales are buying more BTC, and retail investors are dumping, it reflects a very bullish market outlook. Since January 10, whales and sharks, particularly wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have been amassing BTC, collectively scooping up more than 32,693 BTC. This massive purchase represents a +0.24% rise to their collective holdings. On the other hand, retail or shrimp holders, those holding less than 0.01 BTC, have collectively offloaded over 149 BTC since January 10. Data shows that the dump represents a 30% decline in their holdings altogether. Santiment highlighted that the key signal underneath the action is that smart money is finally buying consistently, while micro money bows out. Furthermore, it is considered an ideal setup for a bull run. However, how long retail doubts the formed tiny rally will determine how long it lasts, and the “Very Bullish” green zone is still in place for the time being. Ongoing FUD In The Market Set To Propel BTC’s Price Even with the recent recovery, Bitcoin is seeing negative interactions from crypto enthusiasts and analysts on social media platforms. This behavior implies that the crowd is not entirely confident in the BTC rally that occurred on Wednesday. Although the development may seem present itself as negative, it is actually a good sign that the rally might extend . Social data reveals that commentary toward BTC across social media platforms has sharply leaned to a bearish outlook as prices have bounced this week. With markets often moving in the opposite direction of retail sentiment, Santiment noted that the most FUD in 10 days is likely to propel BTC to its first return above the $100,000 mark, which was last seen on November 13, 2025.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Retailers|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|fud|Santiment,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-16 23:00:07

After weeks of uneven price action, the ETH/USD chart on the 3-day timeframe is now printing a MACD bullish crossover, a signal that has preceded some of Ethereum’s rallies in the past. The setup is notable because it proposes a situation where Ethereum is laying the groundwork for another sustained rally that plays throughout the entirety of 2026. Bullish MACD Crossover For Ethereum The latest analysis shared by Javon Marks points to Ethereum climbing steadily following another MACD bullish crossover in December 2025. This bullish crossover is visible on the 3-day chart, where the MACD line crossed above the signal line from below. Related Reading: Ethereum Chart Turns Bullish: New Cycle Energy Points To $5,000 This is a change that shows downside momentum has faded and bullish pressure is starting to rebuild among Ethereum traders. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around the $3,300 region, about 33% below its August 2025 peak, but holding above swing lows in November 2025. According to Javon Marks, this recent price action is potentially the early stages of a much larger bull wave. This projection is based on the fact that the current crossover looks like an earlier crossover that occurred before Ethereum transitioned into an extended upside move in early 2025. Back in April 2025, the 3-day MACD also recorded a bullish crossover after an extended period of consolidation and pullbacks that lasted for a few months. That signal was the start of a multi-month rally that steadily pushed Ethereum higher, eventually culminating in a new all-time high in August 2025. Price action following that April crossover did not explode immediately. Ethereum first stabilized for a few days, then began forming higher lows above $1,500. Once resistance at $2,000 gave way, the rally gained much momentum and carried Ethereum from the mid-$2,000 range all the way above $4,800, broke above its old record of $4,878 that had stood since Nov. 2021, before finally peaking at $4,946 in late August. Price Targets To Look Forward To The final message of this technical analysis is that Ethereum is about to embark on a comparable rally and break out to new all-time highs. According to the updated outlook by Javon Marks, the first major level that defines this potential continuation is $4,811.71. This price acted as an important resistance level during the previous rally in 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Overbought Levels With Weekend Pump, Why A Crash Could Be Coming A decisive break and sustained hold above $4,811.71 would confirm that Ethereum has exited its corrective phase and re-entered into a broader expansion move. If that breakout unfolds as expected, the measured move projected from the chart points to $8,557.68 as a target to look forward to. This target is based on the magnitude of Ethereum’s last MACD-driven advance and would translate to a 160% increase from current price levels.

It marks the formal end of a two-and-a-half-year investigation into the Zcash Foundation into whether its altcoin offering complies with anti-money laundering (AML) and economic sanctions requirements. We are pleased to announce that the SEC has concluded its review and informed us that it does not intend to recommend any enforcement action or other changes against Zcash Foundation regarding this matter. https://t.co/zjxfh3mmst — Zcash Foundation (@ZcashFoundation) January 14, 2026 Until now, the privacy coin narrative has functioned in a regulatory dark spot, keeping meaningful adoption and capital largely sidelined. Much-needed input, as privacy coins find new relevance in this institution-led market cycle. Institutional use-cases need rails that offer privacy, yet are compliant with regulations and selective disclosure. The initial announcement triggered a 9% daily surge. With regulatory uncertainty lifted, Zcash could unlock sidelined capital and explore more mainstream use cases over the longer term. Still, near-term focus remains on internal conflict. The exodus of the core Electric Coin Company (ECC) development team raises doubts about the Zcash ecosystem’s integrity. Zcash Price Prediction: Could Regulatory Clarity Rekindle the Bull Run? Regulatory clarity may have been the catalyst Zcash needed to ease near-term pressure and refocus attention on a two-month bull flag continuation pattern that has been quietly developing. Momentum indicators hint at the potential return of bullish momentum as the structure nears its apex. ZEC USDT 1-day chart, bull flag pattern nears apex. Source: TradingView . The RSI appears to be carving out a higher low after rejection at the 50 neutral line. While not yet strong enough to confirm a bullish flip, underlying strength is building. The MACD reads much the same, closing in on a potential golden cross above the signal line and hinting that the early stages of a new uptrend may be taking shape. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout is all-time highs around $760. This interim resistance stands as the key proving grounds for a push into new price discovery. Fully realised, the bull flag pattern sets a potential $5,000 target , a 1,150% gain . That scenario, however, likely hinges on sustained institutional adoption and the emergence of a clear, mainstream use case for Zcash. Bitcoin Hyper: A Key Bitcoin Upgrade Most Traders are Missing Those who bet on narratives like Privacy coins over the leading cryptocurrency may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Bitcoin could soon gain deeper exposure in mainstream narratives like DeFi and RWAs. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale , and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

This prediction hinges not on speculative trading, but on a fundamental shift: Ethereum is rapidly becoming core financial infrastructure for major Wall Street institutions. According to analysis from Etherealize co-founders Vivek Raman and Danny Ryan, recent U.S. regulatory clarity has unlocked a wave of institutional adoption that could revalue the entire network. Ethereum Price Prediction Anchored in Regulatory Clarity The pathway to a $15,000 ETH valuation by 2027 is fundamentally linked to recent legislative developments. Specifically, the passage of definitive U.S. stablecoin legislation has provided the legal certainty large financial entities required. Consequently, firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan are now actively building on the Ethereum blockchain. This institutional adoption represents a critical phase change for the network, moving it beyond regulatory uncertainty. Moreover, this trend signals a broader acceptance of blockchain technology within traditional finance. Vivek Raman of Etherealize provided a clear rationale for this optimistic Ethereum price prediction. He stated that growth in two key sectors could propel Ethereum’s market capitalization into the trillions. First, the stablecoin market, which largely operates on Ethereum, is poised for exponential expansion. Second, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) like treasury bonds and real estate is gaining immense traction. Stablecoin Growth: Legislation has effectively legalized and structured the stablecoin market, encouraging traditional finance to participate. RWA Tokenization: Converting physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain creates efficiency and new financial products. Network Effect: As more institutions build, Ethereum becomes more valuable and secure for all participants. The Engine of Institutional Adoption on Ethereum Institutional interest in Ethereum is not a new phenomenon, but it has recently accelerated at a remarkable pace. Major asset managers are launching Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), providing a regulated gateway for traditional investors. Simultaneously, investment banks are exploring Ethereum for settling complex transactions and creating digital bonds. This institutional embrace provides a powerful validation of the network’s security and scalability post its transition to proof-of-stake. The following table contrasts the drivers of Ethereum’s value in previous cycles versus the current institutional cycle: Previous Cycle Drivers (Pre-2023) Current Institutional Cycle Drivers (2024+) Retail speculation and DeFi yield farming Stablecoin issuance for global payments NFT and digital collectible mania Tokenization of treasury bonds and real-world assets Layer-2 scaling promises Actual deployment of institutional-grade Layer-2 networks General smart contract potential Specific, regulated financial applications Expert Analysis: From Niche Technology to Financial Plumbing Danny Ryan, an Ethereum core developer and Etherealize co-founder, emphasizes the technological readiness. He notes that Ethereum’s development roadmap, including proto-danksharding, is directly aimed at supporting high-volume, low-cost transactions necessary for finance. This technical evolution, combined with regulatory progress, creates a unique convergence. Financial institutions are no longer just experimenting; they are deploying production systems. Therefore, the $15,000 price prediction by 2027 reflects a belief that Ethereum will capture a significant portion of the future digital asset economy’s value. Quantifying the Trillion-Dollar Revaluation Thesis The core of the $15K forecast rests on a quantifiable market expansion thesis. Raman suggests that if both the stablecoin and RWA markets grow fivefold from current levels, the fee demand and value secured on Ethereum would skyrocket. Currently, hundreds of billions in stablecoin value exist on Ethereum. A fivefold increase would place this figure in the multi-trillion dollar range, all requiring ETH to pay for transaction security. Similarly, tokenizing just a fraction of the global real-world asset market would represent an enormous value transfer onto the blockchain. This revaluation would be driven by several concrete factors. First, increased transaction fee revenue would make the network more valuable. Second, ETH would be staked by institutions to secure these high-value applications, reducing circulating supply. Finally, ETH would function as the primary collateral and settlement asset within this new financial system. As a result, its utility would expand far beyond its current uses. Conclusion The Ethereum price prediction of $15,000 by 2027 represents a fundamental analysis based on institutional adoption and regulatory maturation. The convergence of clear U.S. stablecoin laws, active development from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, and Ethereum’s own technical upgrades creates a compelling growth narrative. While price forecasts are inherently uncertain, the shift of Ethereum into the core infrastructure of Wall Street is a tangible, ongoing trend with profound implications for the network’s long-term value and the broader digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason behind the $15,000 Ethereum price prediction for 2027? The primary driver is institutional adoption accelerated by new U.S. stablecoin legislation, which is encouraging major financial firms like BlackRock and JPMorgan to build on Ethereum for stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization. Q2: How does stablecoin growth affect Ethereum’s price? Stablecoins are predominantly issued on Ethereum. Their growth increases network usage and transaction fees, which requires ETH to pay for gas. It also demonstrates Ethereum’s utility as core financial infrastructure, boosting its perceived value. Q3: What are Real-World Assets (RWAs) and why do they matter for ETH? RWAs are traditional financial assets like bonds, real estate, or commodities that are represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. Tokenizing them on Ethereum brings immense value onto the network, increasing demand for ETH to secure and transact these assets. Q4: Is this prediction just speculation? The prediction cited is based on observed trends: enacted legislation, public announcements from financial institutions, and the growing market size of Ethereum-based financial applications. It is an analytical forecast, not market speculation. Q5: What are the biggest risks to this Ethereum price prediction? Key risks include potential new regulatory hurdles, the rise of competing blockchain platforms for institutional use, unforeseen technical challenges, or a broader macroeconomic downturn that slows financial innovation.

This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as it indicates that Wall Street is quietly accumulating the token. Data from SoSoValue shows that XRP ETFs have only experienced one day of negative net inflows since the first of these products was launched in the U.S. As a result, the total assets held by these funds have skyrocketed to $1.51 billion in just two months, surpassing Solana’s ETF assets by more than $300 million. In the past 7 days, XRP has booked a 2% drop, although its year-to-date gains currently sit at 12% due to a spike in the price during the first few days of the year. This streak of positive net inflows indicates that both institutional and retail investors are steadily increasing their holdings, creating a strong floor for the token in case this pullback accelerates. XRP Price Prediction: Move to $3 Likely If XRP Breaks Out of Descending Triangle Again The 4-hour chart shows that XRP has formed a descending triangle once again. The last time this happened, the token broke out of this setup and delivered strong gains in the near term. Now that its bearish structure has been invalidated on higher time frames, another breakout could result in a much more explosive move that pushes XRP back to $3 at least. Source: TradingView The price has now crossed above the 200-period EMA in this lower time frame, favoring a bullish outlook. If the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rises past the mid-line and makes a bullish crossover above the 14-day moving average, that would confirm a buy signal for this altcoin. As altcoins seem ready to make a loud comeback, top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could benefit from a market-wide recovery. This project leverages Solana’s speed and low transaction costs to kickstart a new era for Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Will Transform BTC’s DeFi Via Solana’s High Speed and Low Fees Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a fast-moving presale that connects Solana’s high-speed blockchain with the Bitcoin network, giving investors a brand-new way to earn passive income on BTC. With the Hyper Layer 2 , users can stake, lend, and earn yield on their Bitcoin while enjoying low fees and faster transactions that help maximize gains instead of losing them to costs. In just a few months, the project has raised over $30 million. Its ambitious roadmap is what has investors all excited, as developers will now be able to launch highly efficient Bitcoin-native applications that BTC holders will love. As top wallets and exchanges increasingly adopt the Hyper L2, demand for its native token, $HYPER, will likely explode.

Crypto YouTuber Mason Versluis has cautioned investors against expecting XRP to surge to $1,000 in the foreseeable future, describing such forecasts as detached from economic and structural realities. Versluis shared his position on X, where he emphasized the need for more grounded expectations among XRP holders. While acknowledging the asset’s long-term potential, he made it clear that a $1,000 valuation is not something he anticipates in the near or medium term, including the period leading up to 2026. Why a Four-Figure XRP Price Is Unlikely According to Versluis, the global financial system is not currently positioned to sustain an XRP valuation anywhere near $1,000. He argued that regulatory frameworks, liquidity depth, and overall market maturity would all need to undergo substantial changes before such pricing could be justified. In his view, expectations have outpaced the actual pace of adoption and infrastructure development. Rather than focusing on extreme long-term targets, Versluis believes market participants should assess XRP’s progress based on measurable growth and realistic benchmarks tied to broader market behavior. More Achievable Price Levels Before 2026 Although Versluis is dismissive of the $1,000 narrative , he remains positive about XRP’s performance over the next few years. He outlined several price levels he considers more reasonable, suggesting that movements toward $5 or $10 would be consistent with current adoption trends. He also noted that a rise toward $20, while ambitious, is not entirely out of reach if market conditions remain favorable. These projections reflect ongoing discussions within the XRP community, where enthusiasm about long-term utility often contrasts with near-term price constraints. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Position and Growth Requirements At the time of writing, XRP is trading at approximately $2.04 , reflecting a modest weekly loss of 3.38%. A move to $5 would require a little more than a doubling of its current price, while reaching $10 would imply a fivefold increase. A $20 valuation, however, would necessitate a significantly larger expansion, pushing XRP’s market capitalization beyond $1 trillion. Versluis believes that such growth could occur before the end of 2026, though he acknowledges it would depend heavily on broader market momentum and capital inflows. Long-Term Outlook: The Case for $30 Versluis has previously outlined why a $30 XRP price could be plausible over the long term. His argument centers on market structure rather than short-term speculation, noting that XRP would need roughly a twelvefold increase from current levels to reach that price. He linked this possibility to Bitcoin’s long-term expansion. If Bitcoin’s market capitalization were to grow substantially, capital rotation into major altcoins could support higher valuations across the sector, potentially placing XRP near a $2 trillion market cap. However, Versluis stopped short of assigning a timeline, emphasizing that such outcomes depend on evolving market cycles rather than fixed dates.

Consequently, senior Judiciary Committee leaders have declared a proposed liability shield for software developers inappropriate for inclusion in a major market structure bill. This development, reported by CoinDesk, highlights a fundamental tension in regulating the nascent industry. Crypto Developer Protection Clause Faces Bipartisan Opposition Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the ranking member and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee respectively, have taken a firm stance. They argue the provision, which aims to exempt cryptocurrency software developers from criminal liability if their code is misused by third parties, does not belong in financial market structure legislation. Their primary concern centers on the potential weakening of federal laws targeting unlicensed money transmitters. Specifically, they cite platforms like Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixing service sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. This opposition creates a significant procedural hurdle. The provision has become a major point of contention within the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the market structure bill. Indeed, disagreements over this clause are directly cited as a reason for the recent delay in the bill’s deliberation timeline. The debate forces a critical examination of how to foster innovation while preventing illicit finance. The Core Legal Debate: Innovation vs. Enforcement Proponents of the developer protection clause often draw parallels to other technologies. They argue that developers of neutral, general-purpose software tools should not be held criminally liable for actions of end-users, similar to how telecom companies are not liable for illegal phone calls. This perspective emphasizes the open-source nature of much crypto code and the need for clear legal boundaries to encourage U.S.-based development. Opponents, however, see a dangerous loophole. Their analysis focuses on the unique financial capabilities of certain decentralized protocols. The clause, they warn, could inadvertently protect entities that build and launch software explicitly designed to obscure financial transactions, potentially crippling enforcement against money laundering and sanctions evasion. The case of Tornado Cash looms large here; its developers face charges, setting a contentious legal precedent. Expert Analysis on the Legislative Impasse Legal scholars note this debate reflects a broader struggle to apply existing legal frameworks to decentralized technology. “The Senate is grappling with a classic ‘code is law’ dilemma,” explains a former CFTC counsel specializing in digital assets. “They must decide if writing financial software is an act of speech and creation, or an act of operating a financial service. The Judiciary Committee’s intervention signals concern that the Banking Committee’s approach may undermine other critical statutes.” This inter-committee dynamic adds complexity, as the Judiciary Committee oversees criminal law. The timeline is also crucial. This delay comes amid increased global regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency. The European Union has implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, while other jurisdictions are advancing their own rules. Observers suggest the U.S. legislative process risks falling behind, creating uncertainty for businesses. The table below outlines key positions: Position Key Argument Potential Impact Pro-Protection Clause Shields innovators from downstream misuse, fostering U.S. tech leadership. Could limit developer prosecution but may attract regulatory scrutiny. Anti-Protection Clause (Judiciary) Preserves DOJ/FinCEN power to combat illicit finance via software. May chill open-source development; upholds current enforcement. Banking Committee Goal Create clear market rules to protect consumers and define asset status. Bill stalled without compromise on this ancillary issue. Broader Implications for the Crypto Market Structure The market structure bill itself aims to answer foundational questions. It seeks to clarify which digital assets are commodities or securities, assign regulatory roles between the SEC and CFTC, and establish rules for trading platforms. The developer clause, while seemingly niche, touches the heart of a key question: what constitutes a regulated entity in a decentralized ecosystem? Resolving this is essential for the bill’s success. Industry reaction has been mixed. Some advocacy groups express deep disappointment, arguing the clause is essential for legal certainty. Conversely, compliance-focused firms and traditional finance entrants often prioritize strong anti-money laundering (AML) provisions. This internal industry split mirrors the divide in the Senate. The path forward likely requires a narrowly tailored solution that distinguishes between different types of software development and intent. Conclusion The Senate debate over the crypto developer protection clause represents a critical inflection point for U.S. digital asset policy. The opposition from Judiciary Committee leaders Grassley and Durbin underscores the serious law enforcement concerns intertwined with technological innovation. As deliberations continue, the outcome will significantly influence whether the comprehensive market structure bill can advance. Ultimately, this conflict will shape the legal landscape for software developers and define the boundaries of liability in the decentralized financial world for years to come. FAQs Q1: What is the crypto developer protection clause? It is a proposed legislative provision aiming to shield software developers from criminal liability if their decentralized code is misused by others for illegal activities, such as money laundering. Q2: Why are Senators Grassley and Durbin opposed to it? They argue its inclusion in a financial market structure bill could weaken existing federal laws against unlicensed money transmission, hindering enforcement against services like Tornado Cash. Q3: How does this affect the broader crypto market structure bill? The disagreement over this clause is a primary reason for the bill’s recent delay, creating a major obstacle to passing comprehensive digital asset regulation in the U.S. Senate. Q4: What is Tornado Cash, and why is it relevant? Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency “mixer” or privacy tool sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. Its developers face criminal charges, making it a central case study in the debate over developer liability. Q5: What happens next with this legislation? The Senate Banking Committee must either revise the clause to address Judiciary concerns, remove it entirely, or face continued stalemate, potentially pushing final action into the future.

This dramatic escalation follows an earlier investigation announcement and represents one of the most significant regulatory actions against generative AI technology to date. xAI Cease-and-Desist Order Targets Grok’s ‘Spicy’ Mode The California Department of Justice formally demanded that xAI stop all creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Attorney General Bonta emphasized California’s zero-tolerance policy toward such content in his public statement. The agency specifically cited Grok’s ‘spicy’ mode feature as a primary concern, noting its explicit content generation capabilities. Consequently, the AG’s office gave xAI just five days to demonstrate concrete steps addressing these serious issues. This rapid timeline underscores the urgency regulators now attach to AI safety concerns. Furthermore, the investigation revealed disturbing patterns of misuse. The AG’s office claimed xAI appeared to facilitate large-scale production of nonconsensual nudes used to harass women and girls online. This troubling development mirrors broader industry challenges with generative AI tools. Meanwhile, X’s safety account previously condemned such user activity, warning that prompters of illegal content would face consequences. However, regulatory authorities clearly seek more proactive platform responsibility. Global Regulatory Response to AI-Generated Content The controversy extends far beyond California’s borders. Multiple nations have launched their own investigations into Grok’s operations. Japan, Canada, and Britain have all opened formal probes examining the platform’s content generation features. Additionally, Malaysia and Indonesia have taken more drastic measures, temporarily blocking access to the platform entirely. This international coordination signals growing global consensus on AI regulation needs. Simultaneously, United States lawmakers have intensified their scrutiny. On Thursday, Congressional representatives sent letters to executives at several major technology companies including X, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Alphabet, and Meta. These letters specifically inquired about plans to combat sexualized deepfake proliferation. The coordinated timing suggests a deliberate regulatory strategy unfolding across multiple government levels. The Technical and Ethical Challenge of Content Moderation Generative AI platforms face fundamental technical challenges in content moderation. Unlike traditional social media where users upload existing content, AI systems generate entirely new material based on prompts. This creates novel moderation complexities. xAI implemented some restrictions on image-editing features late Wednesday, but regulators deemed these measures insufficient. The core difficulty lies in balancing creative freedom with harm prevention—a challenge affecting the entire AI industry. Industry experts note several critical considerations: Prompt filtering effectiveness: Current systems struggle to interpret nuanced user intent Real-time generation monitoring: AI can produce harmful content faster than human review Cross-platform coordination: Bad actors often use multiple services simultaneously Age verification systems: Preventing minor access remains technically challenging Historical context reveals this isn’t entirely new territory. Previous technologies from photocopiers to Photoshop prompted similar regulatory discussions. However, generative AI’s scale and accessibility represent a qualitative difference. The advent of free, powerful AI tools has indeed led to a disturbing increase in nonconsensual sexual material across multiple platforms. Legal Precedents and Future Implications California’s action establishes important legal precedents for AI regulation. The state has positioned itself as a leader in technology governance through previous legislation like the California Consumer Privacy Act. This cease-and-desist order represents a natural extension of that regulatory philosophy into artificial intelligence. Legal experts anticipate this case could influence pending federal legislation and international standards. The following table outlines key regulatory developments in AI content moderation: Jurisdiction Action Taken Timeline California Cease-and-desist order to xAI June 2025 United Kingdom Online Safety Act implementation Ongoing since 2023 European Union AI Act enforcement Phased from 2024 Japan Grok investigation launched June 2025 Industry response has been notably cautious. When Bitcoin World contacted xAI for comment, they received an automated email response stating ‘Legacy Media Lies.’ This suggests potential tension between the company and media outlets covering the story. Meanwhile, traditional technology companies face parallel pressures as lawmakers demand clearer content moderation strategies. Conclusion The California Attorney General’s cease-and-desist order against xAI represents a watershed moment for artificial intelligence regulation. This action highlights growing governmental impatience with self-regulation approaches to AI safety. As generative AI tools become increasingly powerful and accessible, regulatory frameworks must evolve correspondingly. The xAI case will likely influence how platforms worldwide approach content moderation, user safety, and ethical AI development. Ultimately, this incident underscores the urgent need for balanced approaches that foster innovation while preventing tangible harm. FAQs Q1: What specifically did the California AG order xAI to do? The cease-and-desist order demands xAI immediately stop creating and distributing deepfake nonconsensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material through its Grok chatbot. The company must demonstrate compliance within five days. Q2: Which feature of Grok is causing the most concern? Regulators have focused particularly on Grok’s ‘spicy’ mode, which xAI designed specifically to generate explicit content. This feature appears central to the nonconsensual imagery creation problem. Q3: Are other countries taking similar action? Yes, Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, while Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform entirely. This indicates a coordinated international regulatory response. Q4: How has xAI responded to these allegations? xAI implemented some restrictions on image-editing features recently, but the California AG deemed these insufficient. The company’s automated response to media inquiries has been ‘Legacy Media Lies,’ suggesting a contentious relationship with press coverage. Q5: What broader implications does this case have for AI regulation? This action establishes important precedents for holding AI companies accountable for content generated through their platforms. It will likely influence pending legislation and industry standards worldwide, particularly regarding content moderation responsibilities.

57226959,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262386,1768607711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Silver Market Cap Skyrockets $3.9 Trillion, Stunningly Outperforming Stocks and Crypto",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/silver-market-cap-surge-outperforms/,"BitcoinWorld Silver Market Cap Skyrockets $3.9 Trillion, Stunningly Outperforming Stocks and Crypto Global financial markets witnessed a historic shift over the past year, as the silver market cap exploded by a staggering $3.9 trillion, decisively outperforming traditional stocks, volatile cryptocurrencies, and even its peer gold. According to data from CryptoBriefing, this monumental rally has propelled silver’s total valuation past the $5 trillion threshold, cementing its position as the world’s second-largest tangible asset class. The price of silver itself reached an unprecedented high near $93 per ounce before stabilizing, marking a period of exceptional performance that has reshaped investment portfolios and analyst forecasts worldwide. Silver Market Cap Achieves Historic Trillion-Dollar Growth The scale of silver’s ascent is unprecedented in modern financial history. Over a concise 12-month period, the asset’s total market valuation swelled by over $3.9 trillion. This growth trajectory far exceeded gains in every other major asset class. Consequently, silver now commands a market capitalization exceeding $5 trillion. This figure places it firmly behind only gold, which maintains an approximate $32 trillion valuation. The sheer velocity of this expansion has captured the attention of institutional investors and central banks alike. Several interconnected factors drove this explosive growth. First, sustained industrial demand from the renewable energy and electronics sectors created a solid demand floor. Second, macroeconomic uncertainty prompted a significant flight to tangible assets. Finally, constrained mining supply and strategic national stockpiling exacerbated the supply-demand imbalance. These elements combined to create a powerful bullish catalyst for the white metal. Comparative Asset Performance Analysis When placed in direct comparison, silver’s performance highlights a dramatic divergence from broader market trends. The following table illustrates the stark contrast in returns across major asset classes during the same 12-month window: Asset Approximate Performance Silver Market Cap +$3.9T / Price to All-Time High Gold ~ +70% S&P 500 Index ~ +17% Nasdaq Composite ~ +21% Bitcoin (BTC) ~ -4% This comparative data reveals a clear narrative. While traditional equity markets posted modest, positive gains, and Bitcoin experienced a slight contraction, precious metals soared. Gold’s strong 70% advance was impressive, yet it was ultimately overshadowed by silver’s parabolic move. This outperformance is partly due to silver’s higher volatility and its dual role as both a monetary and industrial metal. Investors seeking a hedge against inflation and currency debasement flooded into the sector, with silver offering greater potential leverage than gold. Expert Insight on the Structural Shift Market analysts point to a fundamental repricing of risk as the core driver. “The movement into silver represents more than a simple commodity trade,” explains a veteran commodities strategist cited in financial reports. “It is a strategic reallocation reflecting deep concerns over sovereign debt levels, geopolitical fragmentation, and the long-term store-of-value proposition of digital versus physical assets.” This sentiment echoes across trading desks, where silver is increasingly viewed not just as an industrial input but as a critical strategic reserve. The price surge to approximately $93 per ounce, followed by a consolidation around $89, demonstrates robust underlying support and healthy profit-taking activity rather than speculative froth. The Driving Forces Behind the Rally The rally’s foundations are built on verifiable macroeconomic and sector-specific trends. Firstly, global initiatives for green energy infrastructure have massively increased photovoltaic (PV) panel production. Silver is a critical component in solar cells, and demand from this sector has grown exponentially. Secondly, ongoing geopolitical tensions have accelerated central bank purchasing of precious metals for diversification. Nations are actively bolstering their tangible asset reserves. Key industrial demand drivers include: Solar Energy Expansion: Record installations of solar farms worldwide. Electronics Manufacturing: Continued use in conductors, contacts, and solders. Automotive Electrification: Increased use in electric vehicle components and charging infrastructure. Simultaneously, supply has struggled to keep pace. Major mining outputs have faced headwinds from rising operational costs, regulatory challenges, and long lead times for new project development. This persistent deficit between annual mine supply and total demand has systematically drained above-ground inventories, creating a tight physical market that amplifies price moves. Implications for Investors and the Global Economy The recalibration of the global asset hierarchy carries significant implications. For portfolio managers, the dramatic rise of the silver market cap necessitates a review of traditional 60/40 stock-bond allocations. Many are now advocating for a permanent strategic weighting in physical commodities, with precious metals forming its core. Furthermore, silver’s outperformance challenges the dominance of purely digital stores of value, prompting a broader debate about asset resilience in different economic climates. On a macroeconomic level, soaring commodity prices can act as a leading indicator for broader inflationary pressures. Central banks now monitor these markets not just for investment flows but for signals about future consumer price trends. The strength in silver also reflects a potential weakening of confidence in fiat currency systems, driving a renewed interest in asset-backed monetary history. This shift could influence future monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding reserve asset management. Conclusion The data presents a clear and compelling story: the silver market cap has undergone a transformation, surging by $3.9 trillion to surpass $5 trillion and outperform every other major asset class. This was not an isolated event but the result of converging industrial demand, investment safe-haven flows, and constrained supply. While gold remains the larger asset, silver’s explosive growth highlights its unique position at the intersection of industry and finance. As markets continue to evolve, the performance of silver will remain a critical barometer for global economic health, investor sentiment, and the ongoing dialogue between tangible and digital value. This historic rally redefines silver’s role in the modern financial ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly does ‘market cap’ mean for a commodity like silver? The market capitalization for silver is an estimate of the total value of all investable silver above ground. It is calculated by multiplying the current spot price by the total estimated volume of refined silver held in bars, coins, ETFs, and other liquid forms, representing its total financial footprint. Q2: Why did silver outperform gold during this period? Silver typically exhibits higher price volatility than gold. Its smaller market size means investment flows impact its price more dramatically. Additionally, strong industrial demand, particularly from the solar sector, provided a fundamental demand boost that pure monetary metals like gold do not experience to the same degree. Q3: Does this price surge indicate a bubble in the silver market? While the rapid price increase warrants caution, analysts note the move is supported by documented supply deficits and sustained industrial demand. The consolidation from the $93 high to the $89 range is seen as healthy. A bubble is typically characterized by purely speculative buying, whereas current demand appears structurally driven. Q4: How can an average investor gain exposure to silver? Investors can access silver through physical bullion (bars/coins), shares of silver mining companies, publicly traded silver streaming and royalty companies, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold physical silver. Each method carries different risk profiles concerning liquidity, storage, and direct price correlation. Q5: What are the main risks to silver’s price going forward? Key risks include a sharp global economic downturn reducing industrial demand, a significant strengthening of the US dollar, a sudden resolution of geopolitical tensions reducing safe-haven buying, or technological substitution in key applications like photovoltaics. Increased mining output from new projects could also ease the supply deficit over time.

On-chain activity and the real-world tokenization of assets point to a network that is becoming increasingly useful and more deeply embedded in financial infrastructure. The price action movement shows that ETH is stuck in a range where it is struggling to attract sustained momentum. Why Fundamentals And Price Are Diverging Ethereum is stuck in the middle, with the price hovering around $3,300, which is slightly up from earlier this month, but it remains compressed within the same triangle that has been forming since November. An investor known as Pepeisfriend mentioned on X that this kind of price action usually means pressure is building and a move is coming. However, the direction hasn’t been specified. Related Reading: Ethereum Outlook Has Improved, And It Could Outperform Bitcoin – Here’s What To Know As a result of this move, big money doesn’t seem very excited. ETH whales have been slowly reducing their exposure since mid-December, with no panic selling, just lightening positions. This kind of behavior signals a lower willingness from large investors to carry risk at these levels. The ETF flows have shown that there have been a few days of positive inflows, but the overall net flows are still negative, showing institutions haven’t truly rotated back into ETH the way they did during the previous hype phase. Meanwhile, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) activity looks weaker, and total value locked (TVL) has dropped noticeably, suggesting that on-chain capital is either leaving or just sitting on the sidelines. When DeFi isn’t active, ETH struggles to generate sustained upside momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Balance at Support—But the Next Move Matters Investor Pepeisfriend concluded that ETH isn’t bearish, but also not inspiring confidence for a breakout. This is a clear “wait for confirmation” phase that must be held, but probably still too early to go all-in or expect an immediate breakout. The Moment That Will Look Obvious In Hindsight While the market is obsessed with layer-1 competition, Ethereum is transitioning from a speculative asset into a yield-bearing, productive asset. Analyst Senior pointed out that on January 15, 2026, Sharplink Gaming deployed $170 million worth of ETH into a combined staking and restaking strategy on Linea. This move shows that institutional treasuries have moved beyond simple accumulation to active yield generation. At the same time, Visa is piloting stablecoin payouts directly on-chain, and EIP-7702 infrastructure is finally going live to eliminate biometric authentication seed phrases via Face ID. The user experience gap that once held ETH back has officially closed. This is the moment ETH is positioning itself as the most secure and liquid on-chain neobank financial platform in the world, and why the $3,500 breakout attempt will feel obvious.

57227043,658045,1768608020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57227043.jpeg,Ethereum Exchange Outflows Signal Supply Is Stepping Back,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-exchange-outflows-signal-supply-step-back/,"Ethereum is struggling to push above critical supply levels after a brief surge above $3,300, as the market attempts to stabilize following weeks of sustained selling pressure. While the rebound has sparked renewed optimism, price action remains fragile, with bulls still needing clear confirmation before a broader recovery can take hold. Still, the fact that ETH is holding near key levels has led some analysts to start calling for higher prices, arguing that the market may be entering a new phase after the recent downtrend. Supporting this view, a CryptoQuant analyst highlighted Ethereum Exchange Netflow spot data showing persistent ETH outflows from spot exchanges during price pullbacks, while inflows during upward moves remain relatively limited. This pattern suggests a more disciplined supply environment, where holders are reluctant to sell into weakness and are not aggressively distributing during rallies. In other words, sell-side pressure appears to be easing, even as Ethereum remains capped below major resistance. If demand returns, this type of netflow structure can support sharper upside moves, as fewer coins are available on exchanges to meet new buying interest. For now, Ethereum is caught between fading fear and unfinished recovery, with the next breakout attempt likely to define the short-term trend. ETH Supply Tightens As Exchange Outflows Persist Ethereum’s recent Exchange Netflow behavior suggests that the latest pullbacks have been met with holding and accumulation rather than broad-based distribution. Instead of rushing to send ETH onto exchanges during weakness, many participants appear willing to sit through volatility, reducing the immediate sell pressure that typically accelerates downtrends. This supports the idea that supply is gradually stepping back, even as price remains capped below key resistance zones and market sentiment stays cautious. However, Exchange Netflow alone is not enough to define direction. A favorable supply structure can still fail if demand remains weak, or if macro conditions deteriorate and force investors back into risk-off positioning. In that scenario, downside continuation cannot be ruled out, even if exchange balances remain constrained. That said, in the absence of major systemic stress, the current netflow profile offers a constructive backdrop for upside. The lack of supply expansion during drawdowns and the restrained profit-taking during rebounds imply that sellers are not in control. If demand rotates back into Ethereum, price could respond more efficiently because there is less readily available liquidity sitting on exchanges. In this sense, the on-chain data is not signaling an immediate breakout. Instead, it highlights a market structure that appears increasingly prepared for upward price action once broader conditions align and buyers regain conviction. Ethereum Bulls Fight Structural Resistance Ethereum is attempting to stabilize above the $3,300 zone after a sharp rebound from the December lows, but the chart shows bulls are still battling heavy overhead supply. Price recently pushed into the $3,300–$3,400 band, a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot point during this downtrend. While momentum has improved, ETH is still trading below key moving averages, reinforcing the idea that this move may be more of a recovery leg than a confirmed reversal. The blue moving average overhead continues to slope downward and sits above current price, highlighting that the broader structure remains pressured. At the same time, the green moving average is flattening near the $3,300 area, adding to the resistance cluster and making this zone difficult to reclaim cleanly. From a market structure perspective, ETH has shifted from a clear downtrend into a tighter consolidation, with buyers stepping in on dips and building higher lows since early January. However, volume remains relatively muted compared to the October and November selloffs, suggesting that conviction is still developing.

While the asset has managed to stay above the psychologically important $2 level, technical analysis suggests that a deeper correction could still unfold under unfavorable conditions. According to recent market assessments, XRP has already declined significantly from its prior cycle peak. Despite this pullback, analysts emphasize that the current phase does not necessarily indicate a breakdown of the long-term bullish trend. Instead, the focus has shifted to understanding how severe a downside move could become if bearish pressure intensifies. Analyst Outlines Worst-Case Price Range Crypto market analyst EGRAG Crypto addressed this scenario in a recent commentary where he deliberately approached XRP’s outlook from a defensive perspective. His analysis was designed to examine potential downside risk rather than predict an imminent reversal of the broader trend. #XRP – The Nightmare Scenario vs. Conviction : Today I’m wearing the #Bears hat briefly Not because I’m #Bearish , but to assess the worst-case scenario objectively. Long term, nothing is bearish in #XRP ’s fundamentals or structure. Only HATERS stays negative, not… pic.twitter.com/4Nd0pGIFqY — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 15, 2026 While maintaining confidence in XRP’s long-term fundamentals, he acknowledged that short-term volatility could still drive prices lower. Under this framework, EGRAG identified a possible decline of between 31% and 47% from current levels as the most severe outcome within the existing market cycle. Should such a move materialize, XRP could temporarily trade within a price band ranging from approximately $1.20 to $1.40. He described this range as a stress scenario rather than a base expectation, stressing that it would represent an extreme test of market confidence rather than a structural failure. Recent Performance and Market Positioning XRP’s current position reflects mixed momentum. After reaching a cycle high of $3.66 in July 2025, the asset has since retraced by roughly 43.7%. The latter part of 2025 proved particularly challenging, with XRP closing the year down 11.54% following a weak fourth quarter. Although a modest recovery of about 12.54% has occurred in early 2026, the price remains well below its previous peak. This uneven performance highlights XRP’s vulnerability to broader market sentiment, even as long-term adoption narratives continue to support optimistic projections. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Drawdowns Provide Context EGRAG’s downside estimates draw heavily from XRP’s historical behavior during previous market cycles. In earlier periods, XRP experienced corrections of similar magnitude before resuming upward movement. For example, following the 2018 market peak, XRP declined by roughly 31% before eventually rebounding in the subsequent bull phase. A later cycle saw an even steeper drop of about 47%, coinciding with widespread market stress during 2022. These historical precedents form the basis of the analyst’s view that a comparable retracement, while uncomfortable, would not be unprecedented. He noted that such outcomes would only be relevant if XRP’s current structure closely mirrors those earlier cycles, a theory that some market observers have already suggested. Outlook Remains Constructive Despite Risks Despite acknowledging the possibility of further declines, EGRAG reaffirmed his belief that XRP remains within a broader bullish cycle. He argued that macro-level indicators still support higher valuations over time, potentially reaching double-digit price levels once the current phase of consolidation resolves. He also clarified that any decision to increase exposure during a downturn reflects his personal investment strategy and should not be interpreted as financial guidance. Investors, he cautioned, should base their decisions on independent analysis and risk tolerance rather than analyst conviction alone. While near-term uncertainty persists, the prevailing view among bullish analysts is that XRP’s longer-term trajectory remains positive, even if the path forward includes additional volatility.

The platform has around 320 million active users and an average of 143 million active users on mobile as of January 2026, according to Forbes, citing Similarweb data. In December 2025, more than 30 million new users signed up for Threads. The platform keeps growing quickly as Elon Musk’s X has trouble holding onto its position with several policy changes and Elon Musk’s controversial streak since he shelled out $44 billion to buy the platform. The report also claims that Brands are moving toward Threads’ more advertiser-friendly environment as X faces user and ad revenue declines amid leadership and moderation concerns. Zuckerberg’s Threads is riding the hot hand On January 3, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Threads now has 320 million active users, surpassing X. He emphasized that the platform’s growth was purely organic with no aggressive marketing campaigns. Also, the integration with Instagram makes it easy to onboard existing Instagram users. Following the acquisition by Elon Musk, X has been losing daily active users . Estimates suggest that X has seen a decline of about 11.9% year-over-year as daily active users in January, while Threads has increased its active user count by about 38%. One of the major reasons for the growth of Threads is that it provides a more advertiser-friendly platform compared to X. Meta also continues to refine Threads’ features by addressing user feedback and directly competing with X’s functionality. Analysts project that Threads could generate about $11.3 billion in revenue. Brands are moving away from X due to the growing discomfort around Musk’s leadership, along with concerns around content moderation. About 68% of X’s revenue is generated from ads and in 2024, it generated $2.5 billion in revenue from ads, which represents a 13.7% decline year-over-year. X isn’t the only platform in decline. Bluesky, which came out as a direct competitor to X has been shedding users. Bluesky grew from a user base of about 10 million to about 40 million in late 2025. However, Bluesky’s daily active users are down to about 3.6 million, representing a 44.4% year-over-year decline. Zuckerberg and Musk’s competition plays out on the social media landscape Zuckerberg and Musk have a rivalry that has played out publicly at times. It even escalated to the point of a cage match in 2023. However, their real rivalry has been in the tech domain, where they often find themselves sponsoring competing causes. Threads’ growth challenges X’s historical dominance in real-time conversation and news distribution. Both the US and international user counts have been declining since 2024, even though there are spikes in usage during major news events. However, for all its problems, X still has more daily active users on mobile in the United States, with 21.2 million compared to Threads’ 19.5 million. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This pivotal reading, reported by data analytics firm Alternative, indicates a market sentiment squarely in neutral territory, a condition often associated with periods of consolidation and deliberation among investors. The index’s movement provides a crucial snapshot of collective psychology, a key driver of price action in the volatile digital asset space. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Methodology The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a daily barometer for market emotion. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” A score of 50, therefore, marks the exact midpoint, suggesting a balanced and arguably rational market environment. The calculation is not arbitrary; it synthesizes data from six distinct market dimensions to form a composite view. Specifically, the index weights its components as follows: Volatility (25%): Measures current price swings against historical averages. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading volume and momentum. Sustained high volume can indicate greed-driven buying or fear-driven selling. Social Media (15%): Tracks sentiment and buzz across platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from periodic polls of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can signal a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Gauges retail interest through search volume for key terms like “Bitcoin” or “crypto crash.” This multi-factor approach aims to mitigate the bias of any single metric, providing a more robust gauge of the market’s emotional temperature. The Significance of a Neutral Reading in 2025 A score of 50 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index carries substantial weight for analysts and traders. Historically, prolonged periods in the “Neutral” zone (typically 45-55) have often preceded significant directional moves. For instance, the index hovered near neutrality in late 2020 before the massive bull run of early 2021, and again in mid-2023 before a sustained rally. This neutrality suggests a market at a crossroads, where bullish and bearish forces are in relative balance. Market veterans interpret this equilibrium in several ways. Some view it as a cooling-off period after emotional extremes, allowing fundamentals to reassert their influence. Others see it as a consolidation phase where assets build a base for their next major trend. Crucially, a neutral reading often indicates reduced panic selling and diminished FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying, potentially leading to healthier, more technically-driven price action. Expert Analysis on Current Market Dynamics Financial analysts point to several concurrent factors supporting this neutral sentiment. Firstly, Bitcoin’s price has demonstrated relative stability around key psychological levels, reducing volatility. Secondly, trading volume, while healthy, lacks the frenetic pace associated with market tops or bottoms. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in major economies like the EU and partial frameworks in the US have provided a more predictable, if cautious, environment. “A neutral Fear & Greed Index is arguably one of the most interesting signals,” notes a veteran market strategist from a leading blockchain analytics firm. “It tells us the market is digesting information rationally. Investors are neither capitulating in fear nor chasing prices in euphoria. This is often when savvy accumulation or distribution occurs quietly.” This perspective underscores that major institutional moves frequently happen when retail sentiment is calm, not when it is at an extreme. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis To appreciate the current reading, one must examine historical extremes. The index plunged to single digits—indicating “Extreme Fear”—during major sell-offs like the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 and the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in May 2022. Conversely, it soared above 90—into “Extreme Greed”—during the peak of the 2021 bull market and the NFT frenzy. The journey from these extremes back to neutrality often marks a transition in market cycles. The table below illustrates recent key readings and their market context: Index Score Sentiment Approximate Period Market Context 10 Extreme Fear May 2022 Terra-Luna collapse, Celsius issues 85 Extreme Greed November 2021 Bitcoin ATH near $69,000 25 Fear December 2022 FTX bankruptcy aftermath 50 Neutral Current (2025) Post-ETF adoption, regulatory digestion This historical comparison reveals that the market has navigated through profound fear and greed to reach its current balanced state, suggesting a maturation in investor behavior and market structure. Practical Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For individual and institutional investors, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading serves as a strategic tool, not a direct trading signal. It primarily advises on market psychology. In “Extreme Fear” zones, contrarian investors might see a potential buying opportunity, albeit with high risk. In “Extreme Greed” zones, it can act as a caution flag for overexposure. At 50, the index suggests a market where neither contrarian extreme is present. Consequently, investment decisions in a neutral sentiment environment should rely more heavily on other analyses. These include fundamental research on blockchain adoption, technical analysis of price charts, and macro-economic factors like interest rates and inflation. The neutral sentiment effectively removes extreme emotion as a primary market driver, allowing other factors to take precedence. This period is often ideal for portfolio rebalancing, disciplined dollar-cost averaging, and thorough research without the noise of market mania or panic. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 50 represents a significant moment of equilibrium for digital asset markets. This neutral reading reflects a collective pause, where neither overwhelming fear nor unchecked greed dominates investor psychology. By synthesizing data from volatility, volume, social media, and search trends, the index provides a validated, multi-dimensional view of market sentiment. For observers and participants, understanding this tool’s methodology and historical context is essential. While the index does not predict the future, a score of 50 highlights a market in balance—a condition that often sets the stage for the next major phase based on fundamentals and macro developments, rather than emotion alone. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 50 mean? A score of 50 indicates the market is in “Neutral” sentiment. It sits exactly midway between “Extreme Fear” (0) and “Extreme Greed” (100), suggesting a balanced emotional state among investors with no overwhelming bias toward panic or euphoria. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is compiled and published daily by the data provider Alternative. They use an automated system to gather and weight data from its six core components, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment. Q3: Is a neutral Fear & Greed Index a good time to buy cryptocurrency? The index measures sentiment, not value. A neutral reading suggests the market is not driven by extreme emotion, which can be a healthier environment for making rational decisions. However, it is not a standalone buy or sell signal. Investment decisions should combine this data with fundamental and technical analysis. Q4: How accurate has the Fear & Greed Index been at predicting market turns? The index is a descriptive tool, not a predictive one. It reflects current sentiment. Historically, prolonged periods at extreme readings (below 20 or above 80) have often preceded market reversals, as they indicate unsustainable emotional states. Neutral readings often indicate consolidation. Q5: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market dominance is a 10% component, the other metrics—like volatility, volume, and social media—encompass the broader cryptocurrency market. Therefore, it is widely regarded as a sentiment indicator for the crypto asset class as a whole, with Bitcoin as its most significant single influence.

This pivotal policy shift represents one of the most significant integrations of digital assets into traditional American finance to date, potentially opening homeownership doors for millions of crypto investors who have previously faced barriers when applying for conventional mortgages. Crypto Mortgage Policy Details and Implementation Newrez’s new crypto mortgage program specifically recognizes several categories of digital assets during the underwriting process. According to official documentation reviewed by financial analysts, the company will accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. This comprehensive approach covers both direct cryptocurrency ownership and regulated investment vehicles that track crypto prices. However, the implementation includes crucial safeguards and requirements. Applicants must hold their digital assets at regulated U.S. exchanges or financial institutions, ensuring proper custody and verification protocols. Furthermore, Newrez applies specific volatility adjustments during asset evaluation, recognizing the price fluctuations inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Despite accepting crypto for qualification, all loan repayments and associated fees must still be made in U.S. dollars, maintaining traditional currency requirements for the actual mortgage servicing. Technical Framework and Risk Assessment Financial technology experts note that Newrez’s approach incorporates sophisticated risk assessment models. The company reportedly uses a combination of historical volatility data, stress testing scenarios, and conservative valuation methods when evaluating cryptocurrency holdings. For instance, the lender might apply a significant discount to the current market value of crypto assets or use a multi-month average price rather than spot prices to account for market fluctuations. This technical framework represents a substantial advancement from earlier, more tentative approaches to crypto-backed lending. Previously, most financial institutions either completely rejected cryptocurrency holdings or required their conversion to traditional currency before consideration. Newrez’s methodology acknowledges crypto as a legitimate asset class while implementing appropriate risk management protocols. Demographic Drivers and Market Context Newrez explicitly cited demographic trends as a primary motivation for this policy innovation. Company representatives noted that approximately 45% of Generation Z and Millennial investors own cryptocurrency, according to recent surveys from financial research firms. This substantial ownership rate among younger Americans creates both a market opportunity and a potential solution to declining homeownership rates in these age groups. The timing coincides with broader financial industry developments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, creating regulated investment vehicles that have attracted billions in institutional and retail investment. These ETFs provide a bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets, making digital assets more accessible to conventional financial institutions. Additionally, cryptocurrency adoption has reached significant milestones. Recent data from the Federal Reserve indicates that approximately 15% of American adults now own some form of cryptocurrency, with ownership rates highest among younger, college-educated demographics. This growing adoption has created pressure on traditional financial institutions to accommodate digital assets in their service offerings. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Mortgage Requirements To understand the significance of Newrez’s policy, consider traditional mortgage qualification requirements: Asset Type Traditional Mortgage Treatment Newrez Crypto Mortgage Treatment Cash/Savings Full value considered Full value considered Stocks/ETFs Market value with moderate adjustments Market value with moderate adjustments Retirement Accounts Partial value considered Partial value considered Cryptocurrency (Pre-2025) Generally excluded or must be sold Adjusted value considered without selling This comparison highlights how Newrez’s policy creates parity between cryptocurrency and other investment assets in the mortgage qualification process. The approach recognizes that for many younger applicants, cryptocurrency represents a substantial portion of their investment portfolio and net worth. Industry Precedents and Regulatory Landscape While Newrez represents the largest traditional mortgage lender to adopt such a comprehensive crypto policy, several precedents exist in the financial industry. Some smaller lenders and specialized fintech companies have offered crypto-backed loans in various forms since the early 2020s. However, these typically involved using cryptocurrency as collateral for cash loans rather than integrating digital assets into conventional mortgage underwriting. The regulatory environment has evolved significantly in recent years. Key developments include: 2023 Banking Guidance: Federal banking regulators issued clarified guidance on cryptocurrency custody and valuation for financial institutions 2024 ETF Approvals: SEC approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs created regulated investment vehicles State-Level Initiatives: Several states have passed legislation recognizing digital assets in various financial contexts Tax Clarifications: IRS guidance on cryptocurrency taxation provided clearer frameworks for asset valuation These regulatory developments have reduced uncertainty for traditional financial institutions considering cryptocurrency integration. Newrez’s policy appears designed to operate within existing regulatory frameworks while pushing boundaries in product innovation. Potential Impacts on Homeownership Rates Housing economists have begun analyzing the potential effects of crypto-inclusive mortgage policies on broader homeownership trends. Early models suggest that such policies could modestly increase qualification rates among younger applicants, particularly in the 25-40 age range where cryptocurrency ownership is highest relative to traditional assets. However, experts caution that cryptocurrency volatility remains a significant consideration. The substantial price fluctuations characteristic of digital assets could create qualification volatility for applicants whose net worth is heavily concentrated in cryptocurrency. Newrez’s adjusted valuation approach attempts to mitigate this risk, but the long-term stability of such models remains untested through full market cycles. Technical Implementation and Operational Challenges Implementing cryptocurrency valuation in mortgage underwriting presents several technical challenges that Newrez has addressed through its policy framework. Key implementation aspects include: Verification Protocols: The requirement for assets held at regulated U.S. institutions enables proper verification and anti-money laundering compliance Valuation Methodology: Using adjusted values rather than spot prices accounts for market volatility Documentation Standards: Creating standardized documentation requirements for cryptocurrency holdings Staff Training: Educating loan officers and underwriters on cryptocurrency fundamentals and valuation These implementation details demonstrate that Newrez has developed a comprehensive operational framework rather than simply announcing a policy change. The company reportedly began developing this capability in 2023, working with cryptocurrency exchanges, regulatory experts, and financial technology partners to create a robust system. Broader Implications for Financial Inclusion Beyond immediate homeownership impacts, Newrez’s policy has implications for financial inclusion and asset recognition. For years, cryptocurrency advocates have argued that digital assets represent a form of wealth creation outside traditional financial systems, particularly for younger generations and underserved communities. By recognizing cryptocurrency in mortgage underwriting, Newrez validates this perspective within mainstream finance. This recognition could have cascading effects across other financial products and services. If cryptocurrency proves viable in mortgage underwriting, other credit products might follow suit, potentially including auto loans, personal loans, and business financing. Such developments would further integrate digital assets into the broader financial ecosystem. Risk Considerations and Consumer Protection While innovative, Newrez’s crypto mortgage policy includes several risk considerations that potential applicants should understand. The volatility adjustments applied to cryptocurrency valuations mean that applicants cannot necessarily qualify based on peak prices during market rallies. Additionally, the requirement to hold assets at regulated institutions excludes decentralized wallets and some international platforms. Consumer protection advocates have raised questions about how well applicants understand these nuances. There are concerns that some crypto investors might overestimate their qualification potential or misunderstand the valuation adjustments. Newrez has addressed these concerns through enhanced disclosure requirements and applicant education materials that clearly explain the valuation methodology. Furthermore, the policy creates potential complications during market downturns. If cryptocurrency values decline significantly during the loan application process or shortly after approval, applicants might face qualification challenges or need to provide additional assets. These scenarios require careful management through the underwriting and closing processes. Conclusion Newrez’s decision to accept cryptocurrency for mortgage applications represents a significant milestone in the integration of digital assets into traditional finance. This crypto mortgage policy acknowledges the substantial cryptocurrency holdings among younger generations while implementing appropriate safeguards for volatility and verification. The approach could expand homeownership access for crypto investors who have previously faced barriers in traditional mortgage markets. As financial institutions continue adapting to digital asset adoption, Newrez’s initiative may establish precedents for how cryptocurrency integrates with conventional lending practices, potentially influencing broader industry standards for crypto mortgage programs in the coming years. FAQs Q1: What specific cryptocurrencies does Newrez accept for mortgage qualification? Newrez accepts Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, and spot cryptocurrency ETFs that trade on regulated exchanges. The policy does not currently extend to other cryptocurrencies or tokens. Q2: How does Newrez account for cryptocurrency price volatility in mortgage underwriting? The company applies volatility adjustments during asset evaluation, potentially using discounted values, multi-month averages, or stress-tested valuations rather than current spot prices. This conservative approach helps mitigate risk from price fluctuations. Q3: Can I make mortgage payments using cryptocurrency instead of U.S. dollars? No, all loan repayments and associated fees must be paid in U.S. dollars. The policy only allows cryptocurrency holdings to be considered as qualifying assets during the application process, not as payment currency. Q4: Where must I hold my cryptocurrency for it to qualify with Newrez? Cryptocurrency must be held at regulated U.S. exchanges or financial institutions. This requirement ensures proper custody, verification, and compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Q5: How might this policy affect homeownership rates among younger generations? By recognizing cryptocurrency as qualifying assets, the policy could help younger applicants who have substantial crypto holdings but limited traditional assets qualify for mortgages. However, the actual impact depends on adoption rates, cryptocurrency values, and how many lenders follow similar approaches.

This stunning financial milestone, confirmed by founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh in an exclusive interview, traces its origins not to Silicon Valley boardrooms, but to a simple Reddit post and a basement cryptocurrency mining hobby. The company’s journey from a side project to a major player in the competitive AI infrastructure space offers a compelling blueprint for bootstrapped success. Runpod’s Unconventional Path from Basement to Boardroom The genesis of Runpod is a story of adaptation and developer frustration. In late 2021, corporate developers Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh faced a common domestic dilemma. They had invested approximately $50,000 in specialized GPU rigs for Ethereum mining in their New Jersey basements. However, the venture proved financially lackluster and, critically, was facing obsolescence due to the impending Ethereum “Merge” upgrade. More importantly, the founders found the process simply boring after a few months. Simultaneously, their professional work exposed them to the burgeoning field of machine learning, revealing a significant problem: the software stack for managing GPUs was, in Lu’s words, “hot garbage.” This intersection of personal necessity and professional insight became their catalyst. Consequently, they made a pivotal decision to repurpose their mining hardware into AI servers. This move preceded the public explosion of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E 2. As they converted their rigs, they intimately experienced the pain points developers faced when working with GPU infrastructure. They identified a clear market gap for a platform that prioritized developer experience, speed, and easy configuration. Therefore, Runpod was born not from a grand venture capital pitch, but from a practical need to solve a tangible problem they themselves encountered. The Reddit Launch That Sparked Traction By early 2022, Lu and Singh had a basic platform ready. It focused on hosting AI applications with an emphasis on developer tools like APIs and command-line interfaces. However, as first-time founders with no marketing experience or network, they faced the classic chicken-and-egg problem of attracting users. Their solution was ingeniously simple and low-cost. Lu recalled, “I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.” They posted in AI-focused subreddits, offering free access to their servers in exchange for feedback. This direct, community-driven approach worked brilliantly. It provided immediate, authentic user testing and gradually converted those beta testers into paying customers. Astonishingly, within nine months, this Reddit-driven growth enabled them to quit their corporate jobs at Comcast after reaching $1 million in revenue. Navigating Growth and the Shift to Enterprise Initial success brought a new, unexpected challenge. Within six months, business users began requesting to run production workloads on the platform. As Lu recounted, these users explicitly stated they could not rely on servers located in personal basements. This feedback forced a strategic evolution. Initially averse to venture capital, the founders pursued creative, bootstrapped solutions. They formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to rapidly scale capacity without taking on debt or diluting equity. This period was intensely stressful, requiring them to constantly forecast demand and secure hardware in a market where GPU shortages were becoming common. Singh emphasized the pressure, noting that if capacity lagged, user sentiment would shift and customers would migrate to competitors. Meanwhile, their organic community on Reddit and Discord continued to swell, especially following the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT, which ignited global demand for AI compute. This visibility serendipitously caught the eye of venture capitalists scouting for investments. Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, discovered Runpod through Reddit and initiated contact. This first VC interaction was educational for Lu, who admits he didn’t know how to pitch. Malik provided crucial guidance on the venture capital mindset, setting the stage for a future relationship while the company continued its disciplined, revenue-focused growth for nearly two more years without external funding. Strategic Funding and Market Positioning The company’s fortunes accelerated dramatically by May 2024. The AI application boom was in full swing, and Runpod’s early bet on developer-centric AI hosting was yielding massive returns. The platform had grown to serve 100,000 developers. This traction enabled them to secure a $20 million seed round, a significant event co-led by the venture arms of industry giants Dell and Intel. The round also included participation from notable angel investors like Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond—who had discovered the product as a user and reached out via support chat—and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. This funding validated their bootstrap-to-scale model and provided capital for aggressive expansion. Today, Runpod serves an impressive 500,000 developers. Its customer base ranges from individual hobbyists to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multi-million-dollar annual contracts. The platform’s cloud infrastructure now spans 31 global regions and boasts high-profile clients including Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow. The founders are now planning a Series A funding round, entering negotiations from a position of remarkable strength with a proven, high-growth business model. The Competitive Landscape and Runpod’s Developer-Centric Vision Runpod operates in an intensely competitive arena. Developers can choose from hyperscale clouds like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as specialized GPU providers like CoreWeave and Core Scientific. This landscape requires clear differentiation. Runpod’s founders position their platform not merely as infrastructure, but as a foundational tool for the next generation of software development. They argue that while the nature of coding will evolve, it will not disappear. Instead, programmers will increasingly become creators and operators of AI agents. Runpod’s key differentiators include: Developer-First Design: Built by developers for developers, focusing on API simplicity and integration. Serverless GPU Option: Automates configuration to reduce devops overhead. Bootstrapped Discipline: A focus on profitability and avoiding unsustainable free tiers. Community Roots: Maintains a strong connection to its open, community-driven origins. “Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu stated, outlining a vision where Runpod becomes the default platform for building and deploying AI-powered applications. This long-term, product-centric view, forged in the constraints of a New Jersey basement, continues to guide their strategy against well-funded incumbents. Conclusion The Runpod narrative is a powerful case study in modern startup development. It underscores that profound success can originate from solving genuine, personal pain points and engaging directly with a community. The company’s achievement of a $120 million annual revenue run rate, starting from a Reddit post and repurposed mining rigs, challenges conventional startup wisdom. It highlights the value of bootstrapping, product-led growth, and strategic patience. As the AI infrastructure war intensifies, Runpod’s unique origin story and steadfast developer focus position it as a formidable and authentic contender in shaping the future of how AI applications are built and scaled globally. FAQs Q1: What is Runpod’s core business? Runpod is a cloud platform specifically designed for hosting and scaling AI applications. It provides developers with easy access to GPU-powered servers, developer tools, and a serverless option to build and run AI models. Q2: How did Runpod initially attract its first users? The founders, lacking a marketing budget, posted offers on AI-related subreddits in early 2022. They provided free access to their GPU servers in exchange for user feedback, which successfully built an initial community of beta testers who later became paying customers. Q3: Why did Runpod’s founders switch from crypto mining to AI? Their Ethereum mining hobby was becoming unprofitable ahead of “The Merge” network upgrade and was personally unfulfilling. Their professional experience in machine learning revealed a major gap in developer-friendly GPU management software, prompting them to repurpose their hardware. Q4: Who are Runpod’s main competitors? Runpod competes with major public clouds (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) and specialized GPU cloud providers like CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, and Crusoe Cloud. It differentiates through a strong focus on developer experience and tools. Q5: What is Runpod’s current scale and customer base? As of 2025, Runpod serves approximately 500,000 developers. Its infrastructure spans 31 global regions, and its customers range from individual developers to large enterprises like OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow.

This crucial metric, a barometer for alternative cryptocurrency performance, now sits at its highest level in recent weeks, prompting traders and analysts to scrutinize underlying blockchain activity and capital flow patterns with renewed intensity. The movement, though incremental, occurs within a complex macroeconomic landscape characterized by evolving regulatory frameworks and institutional adoption trends, making its implications far-reaching for portfolio strategies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Rise to 27 CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a primary gauge for market sentiment cycles. Fundamentally, the index algorithmically measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have outperformed Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. The calculation deliberately excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus purely on speculative and utility-driven assets. Consequently, a score approaching 100 strongly suggests a broad-based ‘altcoin season,’ where capital rotates from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets seeking higher returns. Conversely, a low score indicates a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where the pioneer cryptocurrency dominates market momentum and risk appetite. The recent ascent to 27, therefore, represents a measurable shift. While still far from the threshold indicating a full altcoin season, the upward trajectory suggests a growing number of altcoins are beginning to outpace Bitcoin’s price action over the medium-term horizon. This movement often correlates with increased on-chain activity for networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, as developers and users engage with decentralized applications. Market data from the past week shows notable volume increases for several major altcoins, potentially foreshadowing the index’s climb. Index Value Market Interpretation Typical Investor Action 0-25 Strong Bitcoin Dominance Capital preservation, focus on BTC 26-50 Early Rotation Signs Research and selective altcoin accumulation 51-75 Developing Altcoin Momentum Diversification into high-conviction alts 76-100 Full Altcoin Season Heightened risk-taking, profit-taking from BTC Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Understanding the current index position of 27 requires examining historical precedents. Previous crypto market cycles have demonstrated that transitions between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance are rarely abrupt. Instead, they typically unfold through phases of accumulation, recognition, and mania. For instance, in the lead-up to the 2021 altcoin season, the index hovered in the 20-40 range for several weeks before a decisive breakout. Analysts often monitor supporting indicators like Bitcoin’s dominance chart, which measures BTC’s share of the total crypto market cap, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. Currently, Bitcoin dominance has shown slight weakness, retreating from recent highs. This minor pullback often provides the necessary liquidity and psychological space for altcoins to rally. Furthermore, the broader financial environment plays a critical role. Rising or falling interest rates, inflation data, and traditional equity market performance directly influence risk asset appetite, including cryptocurrencies. The present increase to 27 may reflect a market cautiously testing the waters for altcoin exposure after a period of consolidation, rather than committing to a full-scale rotation. Expert Insights on Metric Interpretation Seasoned market analysts emphasize that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator, confirming trends already in motion rather than predicting them. ‘A move to 27 is noteworthy, but it’s the sustained direction and velocity that matter,’ notes a report from a major blockchain analytics firm. ‘Investors should cross-reference this with on-chain data, such as exchange net flows and network growth for specific altcoins, to validate the trend.’ The firm’s data indicates that smart money wallets have begun making small, incremental purchases of select altcoins over the past month, a pattern that sometimes precedes larger market moves. Additionally, the structure of the index itself warrants consideration. By focusing on the top 100 assets, it captures established projects with significant communities and development activity. This means a rising index often reflects strength in large-cap altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Polkadot (DOT) first, before potentially trickling down to mid and small-cap tokens. Therefore, the current reading suggests these major alternative networks are starting to demonstrate relative strength, which could build a foundation for a broader rally if sustained. Potential Impacts and Strategic Considerations The rise of the index to 27 carries several immediate and longer-term implications for different market participants. For retail investors, it acts as a signal to review and potentially rebalance portfolios. For institutional entities, it may influence the weighting of crypto assets within a diversified fund. Moreover, project developers often see increased engagement and funding interest when altcoins enter a period of outperformance. Key areas to watch include: Layer-1 Blockchain Activity: Transaction counts and fees on networks like Solana and Avalanche. DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL): An increase often accompanies altcoin strength. Funding Rates: Positive funding rates in perpetual swap markets can indicate bullish sentiment. Regulatory Developments: Clear guidelines can remove uncertainty and boost altcoin investment. Strategically, a prudent approach involves monitoring whether the index can hold above 25 and challenge the 30-35 zone in the coming weeks. A failure to do so might see it revert, reaffirming Bitcoin’s short-term dominance. However, a successful breach could accelerate momentum, drawing more capital into the altcoin space. This dynamic creates a critical observation period for traders, where confirmation from other metrics is essential before making significant allocation changes. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s climb to 27 marks a perceptible, though early, shift in cryptocurrency market dynamics. This movement away from extreme Bitcoin dominance suggests a budding investor appetite for the differentiated risk-return profiles offered by alternative digital assets. While the index remains firmly outside ‘season’ territory, its upward trajectory provides a crucial data point for navigating the complex 2025 market landscape. Ultimately, sustained movement will depend on a confluence of technological innovation, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory clarity. Observers and participants should now watch closely for follow-through in both the index and complementary on-chain datasets to gauge the durability of this emerging trend. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 27 mean? An index value of 27 indicates that a modest, but growing, number of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) are outperforming Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. It suggests early signs of market rotation but does not confirm a full altcoin season has begun. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates the index by tracking the percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (by market cap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have yielded a higher return than Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. The score reflects that percentage. Q3: What is the difference between a Bitcoin season and an altcoin season? A Bitcoin season is characterized by Bitcoin significantly outperforming most other cryptocurrencies, often during periods of market uncertainty or mainstream adoption focus. An altcoin season occurs when the majority of altcoins outperform Bitcoin, typically during phases of high risk appetite and niche narrative speculation. Q4: Should I immediately buy altcoins when this index rises? Not necessarily. The index is a lagging indicator. Prudent investors use it as one tool among many, combining it with fundamental research, technical analysis, and on-chain data before making investment decisions. A rising index suggests a good time for research and due diligence. Q5: Has the Altcoin Season Index been a reliable indicator in the past? Historically, the index has been effective at identifying confirmed trends and market cycle phases. However, like all market indicators, it is not infallible and should not be used in isolation. It works best when confirming trends suggested by other data sources like trading volume, developer activity, and macroeconomic factors.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2029 expects the token to reach a peak price of $12.20. By 2032, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $19.21. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2026? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.13 Market Cap $2.26B Trading Volume $256.16M Circulating Supply 547.24M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.23 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-h High $4.65 24-h Low $4.09 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 9.67% (High) 14-Day RSI 67.91 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $3.37 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $4.44 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is consolidating after a strong breakout, not reversing. Daily momentum is still bullish, but upside is capped for now. Short-term weakness appears if $4.05 fails. ICP 1-day price analysis On the 1-day timeframe for January 17, ICP is trading around $4.14 after a sharp impulse from the $3.10–$3.20 base, with price now stalling just below the upper Bollinger Band near $4.36. The strong bullish candle that pushed the price vertically has been followed by smaller-bodied candles, signaling momentum exhaustion rather than outright reversal. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI has cooled from near-70 to the mid-60s, which reflects healthy consolidation rather than weakness, while MACD remains positive with expanding histogram bars, suggesting bullish momentum is still present but slowing. As long as ICP holds above the $3.85–$3.90 region and the mid-band around $3.38, the daily structure remains bullish, with $4.35–$4.60 acting as the next upside test. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4H chart, price is compressing between the Alligator averages, hovering near $4.13–$4.17, which highlights indecision after repeated rejections from the $4.45–$4.60 zone. OBV has flattened and CMF has slipped slightly negative, pointing to fading demand and mild distribution during this range. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The inability to reclaim and hold above the green Alligator line near $4.22 keeps short-term pressure tilted sideways-to-bearish, with a loss of $4.05 likely opening a retrace toward $3.80–$3.90, where prior demand and dynamic support converge. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $3.94 BUY SMA 5 $3.59 BUY SMA 10 $3.35 BUY SMA 21 $3.20 BUY SMA 50 $3.37 BUY SMA 100 $3.86 BUY SMA 200 $4.44 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 3.38 BUY EMA 5 $ 3.31 BUY EMA 10 $ 3.21 BUY EMA 21 $ 3.19 BUY EMA 50 $ 3.48 BUY EMA 100 $ 3.87 BUY EMA 200 $ 4.47 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is likely to remain range-bound in the short term, but as long as $3.85 holds, the broader bias favors continuation toward $4.60 rather than a full breakdown. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 after 2032. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Though the current internet computer sentiment is sideways, future price movements and market cap are expected to be positive. Will ICP reach $1000?

The company has claimed the money will help them grow and expand their services before share offerings begin publicly. Based in New York, the company provides custody and security services for digital assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Its subsidiary, Anchorage Digital Bank, made history as the first federally chartered digital-asset bank in the United States, giving it official regulatory recognition. Sources have said the company’s valuation has yet to be finalized. A spokesperson for Anchorage Digital declined to comment on fundraising efforts or IPO plans, citing their private nature. Anchorage to launch its own stablecoins Anchorage Digital Bank NA’s federal license allows it to issue stablecoins in the US under the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law in July. In September, the firm announced plans to partner with El Salvador-based Tether Holdings SA, the world’s biggest stablecoin issuer, to launch the USAT token for the US. Thus, stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar and are backed by real money or other assets held by the bank. As a result, stablecoins have gained popularity as consumers and businesses can use digital currency without the worries of sudden price changes. Anchorage announced a major partnership with Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin company, in September. The partnership has culminated in a new stablecoin, USAT Stablecoin for the U.S. Market. Nathan McCauley, the company’s chief executive, said Anchorage aims to expand its stablecoin team substantially over the next year. As digital dollars gain momentum and new regulations open up opportunities to develop innovative banking services. Anchorage’s stablecoins are secure, reliable, and in compliance with all existing laws and regulations, and the company plans to hire experts in technology, finance, and compliance to conduct that work. Anchorage’s foray into stablecoins is also part of a larger trend in the cryptocurrency world. In this context, real cryptocurrencies offer both the comfort and stability traditional currencies do — thus, financial institutions and investors are progressively looking to digital assets backed by real money. Anchorage expands despite market challenges According to Anchorage Digital, the year 2025 has been a year of growth for the company. That growth was achieved partly through acquisitions, new partnerships, and the launch of new services, including stablecoin issuance. Those moves aim to keep the company at the forefront of digital money for large investors and institutions. “2025 was our year of scale. We made a series of acquisitions, inked major partnerships, and launched new business lines like stablecoin issuance to solidify our lead in institutional crypto,” an Anchorage spokesperson said in a statement. The firm secured $350 million in funding from major investors, including KKR, Goldman Sachs, GIC, and Apollo, in late 2021. At that time, the company was valued at more than $3 billion. Even though cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin, dropped later in October, Anchorage is moving forward with fundraising. Many crypto companies are going public, and some, like Tether, are raising record amounts of money. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Priced at $0.04 during Phase 7 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising new crypto investment alternatives to ADA. MUTM is in the early stages of establishing a decentralized lending and borrowing service with interest-yielding assets and liquidity pools. Already, its presale has attracted close to $20 million in investment from more than 18,800 individuals. Cardano Price Analysis ADA is observed to have support points around $0.404-$0.406, with a modestly bullish trend, but has yet to break past the resistance points at $0.408-$0.410. Its bullish trend is rather limited, with possible price movements likely to remain within the range of $0.415-$0.418. For those who are looking for more significant asymmetric gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the newly developing crypto project, is becoming increasingly popular with the presale model, utility approach, as well as the impending launch of the protocol. This further cements its standing as the top crypto for those who are seeking gains beyond conventional assets. MUTM Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance offers rewards to early investors through the sale of tokens at a discount price prior to the initial public offer. From $0.01 at the start of the presale to the current price of $0.04 during Phase 7, this represents a 300% increase. For those who have missed this move, phase 7’s price is the cheapest the token will ever cost. An investor who puts $3,000 into MUTM at $0.04 will see the investment rise to $4,500 when it reaches $0.06 at launch, realizing a profit of $1,500. After the launch, MUTM is expected to rise to $1, thereby growing $3,000 to $75,000 with a 25x ROI. Such investment opportunities make MUTM the top crypto for early-stage investors. Market Interest & High-Profile Participants The presale event is witnessing the participation of both retail and whale investors, along with institutional investors. Some investors who had success stories in the past in projects such as Cardano have also invested substantial amounts in this presale event, with one whale investing over $75,000. This also shows that the roadmap of this new project is appreciated, thus making MUTM the new cryptocurrency being noticed in the DeFi market. Scarcity Creates FOMO The tokenomics of Mutuum Finance are also an added feature that makes it attractive. The total supply of the tokens is fixed at 4 billion, with no minting of more tokens. This ensures that there is no dilution of the existing tokens. Out of the total of 4 billion tokens, 1.82 billion tokens are allocated for the presale stage of the project, with more than 850 million tokens already claimed. This momentum speaks to the project’s FOMO. Real-time Infrastructure Analysis If DeFi is to succeed, proper pricing and risk management are necessary, and in MUTM, Chainlink oracles are utilized in the verification of the price of assets like USD, ETH, and AVAX. In the scenario where a user locks in 10 ETH at a price of $3,000, the user would have a collateral value of $30,000, and at a Loan-to-Value ratio of 70%, the user would get a loan of $21,000. Chainlink then continuously updates the price of ETH as market conditions change, ensuring the protocol always has an accurate view of the collateral’s real-time value. More Adoption Indicates Future Successes Now that the presale is in place and the factor of scarcity is added to the list of strengths of the project on the chain, MUTM is slowly gaining popularity as an alternative to Cardano and other altcoins. As the project offers investment in the early stages of development and the potential for growth post-launch, Mutuum Finance is slowly becoming the top crypto to buy and hold for asymmetrical gains in the coming months.

Their balance sheets grew sharply, and their actions left a clear mark on supply and markets. The numbers tell a story of heavy buying, pause, and then corporate moves to protect share value. Related Reading: Crypto Money Floods US Politics As $21 Million Backs Trump PAC Large Treasury Buying Spree Reports have disclosed that these treasury firms deployed close to $50 billion into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens during 2025. At the start of the year, treasuries held more than $56 billion in crypto. By January one, 2026, that figure had risen to $134 billion — a gain of 137%. This buying helped push institutional ownership higher, with treasuries holding more than 5% of both Bitcoin and Ethereum supply by year-end. Public companies alone raised their Bitcoin reserves from about 598,714 coins to more than 1 million, an increase near 500,000 BTC. Market Drop Came Late In The Year The broader market did not keep its earlier momentum. Total crypto value fell almost 8% in 2025 and finished the year near $3 trillion. Most of the damage came late. 2025 Annual Crypto Industry Report is now LIVE 📊 Last year marked crypto’s first down year since 2022, featuring a brief $4.4T peak in Q4 before a historic $19B liquidation ended the year at $3.0T. Here are 7 key highlights you shouldn’t miss 👇 pic.twitter.com/HLbI5BrzwN — CoinGecko (@coingecko) January 15, 2026 The market shed almost a quarter of its value in the last three months, and a liquidation wave near $19 billion in October sped the decline after total market value briefly hit about $4.4 trillion. Bitcoin slipped roughly 1.4% to near $95,300 at one point as investors weighed policy moves in the US and shifting rate expectations. Supply Now Held By Treasuries By the start of 2026, treasuries were holding more than 1 million Bitcoin and 6 million ETH. That concentration matters because assets put on corporate books are less likely to be traded frequently. When large shares of supply are locked up, price swings can be smaller in calm times, but the effect can flip if selling is forced.

The move was traditional: protect investors’ equity value rather than add more tokens into a weakening market.

This bullish prediction comes after the cryptocurrency has seen years of strong performance, climbing past $126,000 and setting a new all-time high in 2025. With ETFs driving demand, whales accumulating , and global adoption steadily rising, a surge to $200,000 seems inevitable for the crypto founder. Binance Founder Predicts Bitcoin Price Could Hit $200,000 Bitcoin spent the past few years in a major uptrend, reaching multiple ATHs after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Following this, adoption and demand for the cryptocurrency skyrocketed , and for months, its price continued to appreciate with minimal pullbacks. In 2025, Bitcoin hit a peak above $126,000 . While many anticipated this achievement, some raised doubts , especially critics like Peter Schiff. Against this backdrop, the recent statement by CZ foresees another significant milestone for BTC that some analysts still believe won’t happen , at least not for another couple of years. Although Bitcoin has since shed a significant portion of its gains since its peak, the Binance founder has boldly stated that BTC reaching $200,000 is “the most obvious thing in the world.” He emphasized that it was only a matter of time before the Bitcoin price rises to this level, representing almost double its current ATH. While CZ acknowledged that the exact timing of the projected rally remains uncertain, his confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains unwavering. Notably, CZ’s bullish prediction for Bitcoin comes as the US regulatory landscape continues to evolve, aiming to create a safer, potentially bullish environment for digital assets. With bills like the CLARITY Act under consideration , the crypto market could benefit from clearer guidelines, increased institutional adoption, and greater investor confidence. Although the bill was initially scheduled for a vote by the US Senate Banking Committee on January 15, the decision was ultimately delayed , leaving the timeline for regulatory clarity uncertain. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market In addition to his bullish Bitcoin forecast, CZ has also predicted that a crypto “ Super Cycle ” could be approaching. The Binance founder pointed to recent developments involving the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a key factor behind his optimism. He highlighted a report on X, revealing that the SEC had officially removed crypto from its 2026 priority risk list, a move that could provide the industry with greater regulatory relief and create more room for future bullish growth. Analyst Forecasts $200,000 BTC In 2026 Sharing a similar outlook to CZ, a popular crypto analyst, Rekt Fencer, who has over 336,000 followers on X, has also predicted that Bitcoin could surge to $200,000. Despite the broader crypto market still recovering from a prolonged bear market, the analyst remains confident in BTC’s near-term prospects, noting that the cryptocurrency could replicate its explosive growth seen during the 2020 bull cycle . Unlike CZ, who has not provided a specific timeline for his $200,000 forecast, Rekt Fencer believes that BTC could hit this level before the end of 2026.

The tech giant adopted this decision at a time when individuals showed heightened interest in faster internet, driven by surging demand for AI technology and other data-intensive applications. Google seeks to stay competitive in the tech ecosystem This new firm is set to feature Google Fiber’s fiber-optic Internet service, GFiber, as well as Radiate’s business, also known as Astound. Stonepeak is believed to own the largest share of this company. At the same time, Google is expected to retain a smaller stake, said sources familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous, as the talks were private. To verify this claim, these sources cited an earlier statement from Stonepeak noting its plan to allocate approximately $1 billion in preferred equity. This situation prompted reports to reach out to Stonepeak, Google, and Radiate for clarification; however, they did not respond. Notably, talks are still ongoing; therefore, the deal is more likely to undergo amendments. On the other hand, reports from reliable sources reveal that the American technology company has been evaluating options to separate its fiber business. According to a 2024 report, sources familiar with the situation alleged that Alphabet is open to investments from GFiber’s outside investors to back its global adoption. Meanwhile, apart from this fiber project, Google claimed to have made significant investments totaling tens of billions of dollars in AI to strengthen its global position in AI data centers. Towards the end of last year, the tech giant invested about $15 billion in India and $9 billion in South Carolina. This move backs the tech firm’s long-standing goal of becoming a leader in the tech industry. To further illustrate its commitment to achieving this goal, the CEO of Google Cloud, Thomas Kurian, released a statement disclosing that Google intends to allocate around $15 billion over the coming half-decade to build a new AI-driven data center in southern India. With this initiative in place, the tech company seeks to establish a global network of its AI data centers. During an event in New Delhi, Kurian commented that, “This will be the largest AI hub we’re building outside of the United States,” adding that, “it is part of a worldwide network of AI centers across 12 different countries.” Google seeks to explore the tech industry with significant AI innovations Following Google’s focus on AI expansion, sources highlighted that the new AI data center hub, anticipated to begin operations in July 2028, will feature improved AI infrastructure, enhanced fiber-optic networks, and significant energy reserves across three regional sites. Moreover, the company noted that the facility will be geographically located in Visakhapatnam, a major port city and industrial hub in Andhra Pradesh, India. It is set to start with an initial capacity of 1 gigawatt and later increase to several gigawatts. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, weighed in on this development, calling the India-based AI hub a “landmark development that will introduce Google’s AI innovations to the country’s vast population”.

One of the most recent moves making waves in the space is the investment to support LMAX and strengthen market infrastructure. LMAX Gains Major Boost With Ripple Investment A recent report discloses that Ripple has taken yet another significant step in its institutional expansion by investing to support LMAX’s worldwide business strategy. With the aim of reinforcing its commitment to building a robust, enterprise-grade market infrastructure, the firm has invested over $150 million to support this strategy. Ripple’s move underscores its focus on strengthening the railroads that link digital assets with traditional finance, expanding access to regulated trading platforms, and deepening liquidity. Such a move marks the persistent efforts of the company in transforming global trading models. According to market expert and trader Pumpius on X, this is a far bigger move than a simple strategic investment from the payment firm. Instead, it is a strategic integration move aimed at hardwiring the adjacency of XRP to institutional price discovery and execution infrastructure. The expert highlighted that LMAX operates high-performance, low-latency venues for FX, metals, and digital assets, which are being used by banks, funds, and professional liquidity providers. This creates a period where size is traded under stringent regulatory standards , and risk is controlled. By supporting LMAX’s global expansion, Pumpius stated that Ripple is making sure XRP is positioned within venues that institutions already trust for hedging funds, market making, and balance sheet management. This seems to be a better move in comparison to relying on fragmented retail liquidity. Interestingly, this bolsters Ripple’s end-to-end stack across settlement, liquidity provisioning, custody, and execution. While it may seem complex, this is vital since tokenized deposits, compliant stablecoins , and on-chain settlement are shifting into production. However, Pumpius added that the outcome is deeper liquidity, tighter spreads, and routine XRP usage within regulated market infrastructure, long before the wider market notices the underlying shift. XRP Charting Path To New All-Time High? XRP is regaining bullish traction as market structure points to a historical trend that preceded a massive wave up to previous highs. From a weekly timeframe chart shared by ChartNerd, XRP is forming a pivotal Golden Cross pattern, which could shape its next trajectory. It is worth noting that the last time this pattern appeared on the weekly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the altcoin rallied to new all-time highs. With the same structure unfolding, a similar price trend is expected to occur. Currently, the MACD is in oversold territory, and the Golden Cross formation is expected to form in the upcoming weeks. Given that the market structure is protecting a 400-day defense zone, expansion seems likely.",XRP|ChartNerd|FX|Golden Cross Formation|LMAX|MACD|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|ripple|Stablecoins|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 02:00:07

Although the meme coin has since slipped back into negative territory, a crypto analyst believes another bullish reversal may be approaching soon. According to the analyst, a key technical pattern has recently emerged on the chart, suggesting that PEPE has formed a bottom and could be on its way to a massive 3,000% price rally. PEPE Price Prepares For Massive 3,000% Rally In a post shared on X this Thursday, market analyst CryptoLinx outlined a bullish outlook for PEPE, pointing to a key shift on the weekly chart that he believes could trigger a 3,000% rally in the meme coin’s price. He stated that PEPE has just printed a bullish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) cross on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $57,000: The Bullish Path That Could End In Tears The analyst’s chart shows the weekly MACD lines crossing upward with momentum shifting from red to green. This move comes after an extended downtrend and coincides with price stabilizing and starting to curl higher, a pattern often associated with a rounded bottom. In his post, CryptoLinx emphasized that most traders and investors do not fully understand just how powerful the weekly MACD can be when it crosses at a true market bottom. Such moments often mark the market’s transition from an accumulation phase to a sustained uptrend. In previous cycles, similar setups have led to substantial price appreciation in PEPE. Moves of 200% to 300% were recorded in the PEPE price as momentum shifted in favor of buyers. CryptoLinx has suggested that if PEPE has indeed found its true bottom, its potential price rally could be significantly more explosive than past cycles. Based on the analyst’s predictions, the bullish MACD cross would not fuel a simple price recovery for PEPE, but an explosive surge that could completely flip its ongoing downtrend and mark a new ATH. The analysis points to a potential upside of 1,500% to 3,000% for PEPE this year. Such a rally could see the meme coin jump from its current levels around $0.00000585 to $0.0000928 and $0.000179, respectively. An Update On PEPE Price Action In 2025, the Pepe price spent several months in a sustained downtrend, closing the year in the red and extending its losses into the first few days of 2026. However, as meme coins saw a sudden market revival at the beginning of the year, PEPE jumped by more than 30%, briefly rallying before shedding some of its gains. Related Reading: Next XRP Wave Shows Where Price Is Headed Next, But There’s A Catch According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the PEPE price remains down over 68% Year-to-Date (YTD). Despite this broader decline, the meme coin has shown signs of recovery, climbing more than 44% over the past month. At the time of writing, PEPE is down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours and about 4.5% in the past week.

According to a detailed report from DL News, the potential for a so-called ‘Erdoğanization’ of the Fed under a Trump administration presents a structural shift with profound implications for the U.S. dollar and alternative assets like Bitcoin. This analysis draws direct parallels to recent international monetary crises, providing a sobering framework for understanding potential 2025 market dynamics. Federal Reserve Independence Faces a Critical Test The concept of central bank independence remains a cornerstone of modern economic stability. For decades, the Federal Reserve has operated with a mandate to control inflation and maximize employment, theoretically free from direct political interference. However, recent political discourse has placed this long-held principle under intense scrutiny. Analysts now actively debate the resilience of this institutional firewall. André Dragosch, Head of Research for Europe at the asset manager Bitwise, coined the term ‘Erdoğanization’ to describe this risk. He directly references the economic trajectory of Turkey, where government intervention eroded central bank autonomy. Consequently, this led to severe currency devaluation and hyperinflation. Dragosch’s analysis posits a clear causal chain for the United States. Political pressure to artificially lower interest rates could compromise the Fed’s ability to combat inflation effectively. This situation, in turn, would likely devalue the U.S. dollar over the medium to long term. Financial markets historically react negatively to uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. Therefore, investors systematically seek assets perceived as hedges against currency weakness and institutional fragility. Historical Precedent: The Turkish Lira and Bitcoin Demand Understanding the potential ‘Erdoğanization’ thesis requires examining the recent Turkish economic experiment. Beginning around 2018, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly pressured the Turkish Central Bank (TCMB) to slash interest rates despite soaring inflation. He famously described high interest rates as the ‘mother and father of all evil.’ The TCMB eventually capitulated, sacrificing its operational independence. The results were severe and predictable. Currency Collapse: The Turkish lira (TRY) lost over 80% of its value against the U.S. dollar between 2018 and 2023. Hyperinflation: Official inflation rates soared above 85%, devastating savings and purchasing power. Capital Flight: Both domestic and international investors fled lira-denominated assets. In this environment, Turkish citizens and investors turned to alternative stores of value. Gold demand surged, but notably, Bitcoin adoption accelerated dramatically. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volumes in Turkey consistently ranked among the highest globally. Citizens used the cryptocurrency not for speculation, but primarily for wealth preservation. This real-world case study provides a tangible model. It demonstrates how a loss of faith in centralized monetary authority can directly increase demand for decentralized, non-sovereign assets like Bitcoin. André Dragosch’s Structural Analysis for 2025 Dragosch applies this framework to the potential U.S. situation with analytical precision. He avoids speculative price predictions, focusing instead on structural relationships. ‘A weakening of Fed independence structurally implies higher inflation and a weaker dollar,’ Dragosch stated in the DL News report. He views this macroeconomic outcome as fundamentally positive for Bitcoin’s value proposition. His reasoning hinges on Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature. Unlike fiat currencies, no political actor can increase Bitcoin’s supply or mandate its monetary policy. This makes it a pure hedge against currency debasement. The analysis further suggests that the mere perception of compromised Fed independence could trigger market movements. If a Fed Chair were replaced explicitly for not acquiescing to political demands, or if public statements clearly undermined the institution’s autonomy, investor confidence could erode rapidly. In such a climate, Bitcoin could emerge not merely as a speculative tech asset, but as a prominent, legitimate alternative within diversified portfolios. This re-categorization would represent a significant evolution in Bitcoin’s market role. The Mechanics of Dollar Weakness and Crypto Correlations A structurally weaker U.S. dollar creates multiple pathways for Bitcoin appreciation. Firstly, since Bitcoin is globally priced in dollars, a falling dollar makes each bitcoin cheaper for holders of other, stronger currencies. This can increase international buying pressure. Secondly, and more importantly, investors globally hold U.S. dollar-denominated assets as a primary reserve. Perceived dollar weakness prompts a search for non-correlated or inversely correlated assets. Potential Impact Channels of Fed Politicization Channel Mechanism Potential Bitcoin Impact Inflation Expectations Political pressure prevents rate hikes, leading to sustained high inflation. Increased demand for Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Currency Devaluation Weaker dollar reduces purchasing power of dollar reserves. Bitcoin gains appeal as a global, neutral reserve asset. Loss of Institutional Credibility Markets lose trust in the primary anchor of the global financial system. Capital flows toward decentralized systems outside traditional finance. Geopolitical Realignment Other nations reduce dollar reliance, exploring alternative settlement layers. Bitcoin’s network could benefit as a cross-border settlement option. Furthermore, the U.S. Treasury and bond markets deeply interconnect with Fed policy. Any doubt about the Fed’s commitment to price stability could increase yields on long-term Treasuries, reflecting higher inflation risk premiums. This volatility in traditional safe-haven assets could push some institutional capital toward digital assets with different risk-return profiles. It is crucial to note that this relationship is not guaranteed to be immediate or linear. Short-term market reactions can be chaotic. However, the structural argument posits a strengthening long-term correlation between perceptions of fiat currency fragility and Bitcoin’s valuation. Broader Context: The Global Search for Monetary Alternatives The discussion about Fed independence and Bitcoin does not occur in a vacuum. It aligns with a broader, global trend of exploring monetary alternatives. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are in development worldwide, often raising concerns about financial privacy and state control. Simultaneously, several nations continue to diversify their foreign exchange reserves away from the U.S. dollar. Gold purchases by central banks have reached multi-decade highs. This macro backdrop is essential for a complete analysis. Bitcoin exists within this ecosystem as a unique, apolitical, and software-based competitor. Its potential rise in a scenario of Fed politicization would be part of a larger narrative of de-dollarization and financial fragmentation. Other cryptocurrencies might also benefit, but Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, robust security, and clear narrative as ‘digital gold’ position it uniquely to capture this specific type of hedge demand. The 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced new supply issuance, further tightens its economic model just as these macroeconomic questions intensify. Conclusion The analysis highlighting the risk to Federal Reserve independence presents a significant, experience-driven hypothesis for 2025 financial markets. Drawing from the tangible precedent of Turkey, experts like André Dragosch outline a scenario where political pressure leads to dollar weakness, thereby boosting Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative, non-sovereign asset. While the future path of U.S. monetary policy remains uncertain, the structural relationship between institutional credibility, currency strength, and demand for decentralized assets is becoming increasingly clear. Investors and policymakers alike must now consider how the delicate balance of Federal Reserve independence could fundamentally alter the landscape for traditional and digital assets in the coming year. FAQs Q1: What does ‘Erdoğanization of the Fed’ mean? It is an analytical term comparing potential political pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to the documented erosion of central bank independence in Turkey under President Erdoğan, which led to high inflation and currency collapse. Q2: How could a weaker U.S. dollar specifically benefit Bitcoin? A weaker dollar makes Bitcoin cheaper for international buyers using stronger currencies and increases demand for assets perceived as hedges against currency devaluation and inflation, a role Bitcoin is increasingly adopted for. Q3: Is central bank independence legally protected in the United States? While the Federal Reserve was designed to be independent within the government, its board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, creating a potential channel for political influence over time. Q4: Did Bitcoin actually help people in Turkey during the lira crisis? Yes, data shows Turkish Bitcoin trading volumes surged as citizens used it to preserve savings, make international transactions, and hedge against the lira’s rapid devaluation and capital controls. Q5: Are other assets besides Bitcoin considered hedges in this scenario? Yes, traditional hedges include gold, commodities, and real estate. However, Bitcoin offers a digital, borderless, and fixed-supply alternative that appeals particularly to a younger, tech-oriented demographic and for cross-border capital preservation.

USDC, CRCL’s flagship stablecoin, posted 66% YoY revenue growth to $740 million and 57% adjusted EBITDA margin, underscoring strong profitability. Management guides for 40% CAGR in USDC circulation, but acknowledges growth headwinds from lower interest rates and competitive pressures. While not 'dirt cheap,' CRCL’s GARP profile and secular stablecoin adoption thesis support expectations for double-digit returns over the long term. Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) has not escaped the volatility that hit high-growth stocks late last year. That volatility has coincided with lower interest rates and potentially slower USDC growth, which might have contributed to the downward pressure. Yet I still see a clear case for increasing stablecoin adoption long term, with USDC looking positioned to benefit courtesy of its various partnerships. Despite the dampened growth outlook, I reiterate my buy rating as the valuation is looking as reasonable as ever. CRCL Stock Price I last covered CRCL in September , where I initiated coverage as a high-risk, high reward play. The stock has plunged - without hyperbole - since. Data by YCharts The air has left the balloon. In the above report, I had written that “I find the stock buyable at these levels but expect significant volatility as investors may be uneasy about the high valuations given potentially low conviction in the consistency of forward growth rates.” The 40% slide has thoroughly addressed any such reservations. CRCL Stock Key Metrics CRCL is the owner of the stablecoin network ( USDC-USD ). USDC is the second largest stablecoin in the world, behind Tether ( USDT-USD ). Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that do not fluctuate in value due to being backed by reserves of cash and short-term US Treasury bills (or at least this is the case for USDC). Stablecoins are a new frontier, and CRCL is racing to grow its network. 2025 Q3 Presentation CRCL has been working with financial industry leaders to increase adoption and discover new use cases. 2025 Q3 Presentation In my eyes, the overarching thesis behind USDC and stablecoins in general is the lightning fast and secure transaction speeds that they allow for. The potential opportunity may then be viewed as corporations around the world replacing their “checking account cash” (working capital) with USDC. This is cash that corporations otherwise are not expecting to earn significant interest from in the first place. USDC has grown rapidly, helping to offset headwinds from declining short term US Treasury rates. 2025 Q3 Presentation This culminated in revenues growing 66% YoY to $740 million. 2025 Q3 Presentation The company was also significantly profitable, with adjusted EBITDA jumping 57% YoY to $166 million, representing a 57% margin. 2025 Q3 Presentation I note that the company is solidly profitable on a GAAP basis as well, with GAAP operating income coming in at 27.8% of gross profits even after subtracting out “other income.” 2025 Q3 Presentation Management continues to guide for around 40% CAGR in USDC circulation over the medium term. 2025 Q3 Presentation On the conference call , management noted their conviction in taking market share, noting that overall “stablecoin transaction volumes have grown approximately 130% year-over-year with USDC share expanding to 40% in Q3.” Management did note that they are “not focused on monetizing the network” but instead “want the network to grow so that it's creating value for all participants.” Management noted that “over time” there may be “many opportunities for very small fees,” as this is a “winner-take-most market structure.” I may be reading too much into the tea leaves, but I suspect that management may be trying to prepare investors for the potential for profit margins to decline in the near term. Is CRCL Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold? CRCL stock has struggled as of late. I see two primary reasons. First, interest rates continue to move lower as the market makes progress on inflation. Second, the company has seen some struggles to USDC growth in recent months . At recent prices, CRCL traded at just around 5.5x forward revenues. Seeking Alpha At this point, the optimism has let itself out. There are valid concerns with the bullish thesis. Revenues will face pressure if interest rates keep going lower, and that appears to be the current trend. It is possible, if not likely, that management’s guidance for 40% USDC circulation growth proves optimistic, as it is not immediately clear how they came to that target. It is, however, important to remember that USDC is still just around $75 billion. This is lower in comparison to the $700 billion in “trapped working capital” estimated by JP Morgan in 2024 . Of course, one must note that USDT already stands at nearly $200 billion, so a lot of the growth runway indeed has been played out. But that is to be expected at this stage in the bull market. I won’t make the claim that the stock is “dirt cheap.” I continue to assume that the company can achieve at least 15% net margins (implying around 50% margins based on gross profits). That places the valuation at around 37x long term earnings. The company might need to sustain around 15% to 20% growth to justify that valuation, which looks achievable long term, as at this point I view the move from checking account cash to stablecoin as being similar to e-commerce or video streaming. I was clearly early in my previous buy rating, and my growth outlook has dampened since, as I did not expect USDC growth to slow down on a sequential basis so quickly. Even so, the lower stock price has adequately priced-in the slight deterioration in fundamentals, and thus the stock looks like it’s priced for double-digit returns from here. I can see the company delivering around 20% growth at the very least over multi-year periods, as it benefits from its partnership with leading cryptocurrency firm Coinbase ( COIN ). Even after the fall, I do not see an immediate case for multiple expansion, which heightens the potential volatility, but this looks like a “GARP” kind of stock from here. CRCL Stock Risks If short term interest rates continue to decline, then CRCL may eventually see revenue growth compress. I would focus more on the growth of the USDC network, but it is also possible that USDC growth proves volatile or falls far short of management’s guidance. It is possible that USDT or others will win the market. It is possible that governments outlaw the use of stablecoins, preventing further growth. CRCL Stock Conclusion I must reiterate that CRCL is not that cheap here. It’s significantly less expensive than it was just a handful of months ago, but the company may see some volatility as it laps tough comparables and grapples with declining interest rates. That said, I like the GAAP profitability and long-term secular thesis, as stablecoins do appear to offer significant advantages over the slower and more expensive traditional financial system. I do not see “100-bagger” kind of upside potential here, as the real addressable market might be focused on checking account cash instead of all cash, but the valuation looks right given the strong momentum the company is seeing in rising USDC circulation.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-17 02:30:00

57230662,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=896613,1768618009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57230662.jpeg,"JustLend DAO Completes Second JST Buyback and Burn, Removing Nearly 11% of Total Supply",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/justlend-dao-completes-second-jst-buyback-and-burn-removing-nearly-11-of-total-supply/,"Singapore January 16, 2026 — JustLend DAO , TRON’s premier decentralized lending platform, announced the completion of a second buyback and burn of its JST token, permanently removing 525 million tokens, representing an estimated $21 million USD in value, from circulation. The burn represents approximately 5.3% of the total supply, and brings the cumulative reduction to roughly 1.08 billion JST, or 10.96% of total supply, achieved in less than three months. The successful buyback and burn reflect JustLend DAO’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a deflationary token supply. The latest burn was supported by continued growth in activity across the JustLend DAO ecosystem. Total value locked surpassed $7.08 billion, consistently placing the protocol among the three largest decentralized lending markets. Activity in the SBM market reached a new cycle high, and the reserves used for the buyback came from SBM USDT balances created during the first burn, supporting a self-sustaining model for ongoing supply reduction. JustLend DAO continues to expand and diversify its product suite: sTRX Staking : Supports on-chain participation while preserving liquidity for broader DeFi use cases, with more than 9.3 billion TRX staked to date. Energy Rental : Reduced base fees from 15% to 8% in September 2025, contributing to increased on-chain usage. GasFree Smart Wallet : Enables users to pay transaction fees directly from transferred assets such as USDT, supported by a gas subsidy that has lowered costs to approximately 1 USDT per transfer. The wallet has processed $46 billion in transaction volume, delivering meaningful fee savings for users. Additional buyback capacity has been supported by growth within the USDD multi-chain ecosystem. USDD has expanded across major networks including Ethereum and BNB Chain, with total value locked exceeding $1 billion as of January 14, more than doubling in less than two months. The expansion strengthens the linkage between stablecoin adoption, protocol activity, and ongoing JST supply reduction, reinforcing a closed-loop model that supports ecosystem participation and liquidity over time. The reduction in JST supply has transformed the token’s structure by more closely linking its value to protocol activity while increasing overall scarcity. With fewer tokens outstanding, each remaining JST carries greater governance weight, expanding holder influence over protocol parameters, treasury decisions, and future product development. Market data reflected heightened activity following the burns, with CoinMarketCap showing JST’s market capitalization surpassed $400 million for the first time on January 8. On the same day, 24-hour trading volume rose 21.92% to $31.49 million, while the token’s price increased 10.82% over the past month and 3.1% in a single day. The continuation of quarterly buyback-and-burn cycles sets a clear and measurable path for reducing JST supply over time. As the ecosystem continues to grow, the supply of JST is expected to decline in a predictable way, increasing scarcity. The latest burn marks an early stage of this process, with future reductions expected to build over time alongside ongoing product development and broader ecosystem participation.

His comments highlight the complex regulatory landscape confronting digital assets as financial institutions increasingly engage with tokenization and blockchain technologies. This development comes amid growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency markets and increasing pressure for regulatory clarity from traditional finance sectors. Goldman Sachs CEO Details Crypto Bill Challenges David Solomon specifically addressed the Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act, commonly known as the CLARITY Act. He emphasized that Goldman Sachs monitors this legislation carefully due to its potential impact on financial innovation. The bill aims to establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including clear definitions and jurisdictional boundaries. Solomon noted that recent developments suggest considerable time will pass before meaningful progress occurs. His assessment reflects broader institutional concerns about regulatory uncertainty in cryptocurrency markets. Financial analysts immediately recognized the significance of Solomon’s comments. They indicate that major financial institutions remain cautious about expanding cryptocurrency services without clearer regulatory guidelines. The delayed legislation affects planning for tokenized asset platforms and digital custody solutions. Market observers note that regulatory uncertainty may temporarily advantage jurisdictions with more established digital asset frameworks. Consequently, U.S. financial innovation could face competitive pressures from global markets. Legislative Timeline and Recent Setbacks The CLARITY Act experienced a significant setback when the Senate Banking Committee postponed its planned markup session. This delay followed Coinbase’s withdrawal of support for the current draft legislation. The cryptocurrency exchange cited concerns about specific provisions that might hinder innovation. Committee members subsequently requested additional time for revisions and stakeholder consultations. Legislative analysts now predict the bill may not reach committee vote until late 2025 at the earliest. Several factors contribute to the legislative complexity. First, lawmakers must balance consumer protection with innovation facilitation. Second, jurisdictional questions between regulatory agencies require careful resolution. Third, technological developments continuously outpace legislative processes. The table below illustrates key stakeholders and their positions: Stakeholder Position on CLARITY Act Primary Concerns Traditional Banks Generally Supportive Clear regulatory boundaries, compliance frameworks Crypto Exchanges Mixed Support Innovation restrictions, operational requirements Consumer Groups Cautiously Optimistic Investor protection, transparency mandates Regulatory Agencies Seeking Clarification Jurisdictional authority, enforcement mechanisms Historical context reveals that comprehensive financial legislation typically requires multiple congressional sessions. The Dodd-Frank Act, for instance, underwent extensive revisions over several years. Similarly, cryptocurrency regulation involves novel technological considerations that complicate traditional legislative approaches. Committee staff members continue working on technical amendments while maintaining dialogue with industry representatives. Institutional Impact on Tokenization and Stablecoins Solomon specifically highlighted the legislation’s potential effects on tokenization and stablecoin markets. Tokenization refers to representing real-world assets as digital tokens on blockchain networks. Financial institutions increasingly explore this technology for various applications: Asset Fractionalization: Dividing high-value assets into smaller investment units Settlement Efficiency: Accelerating transaction settlement through smart contracts Regulatory Compliance: Embedding compliance requirements directly into token protocols Market Accessibility: Expanding investment opportunities to broader participant groups Stablecoin regulation represents another critical component. These digital assets maintain stable values by pegging to traditional currencies or other reserves. The CLARITY Act proposes specific frameworks for stablecoin issuance and operation. Regulatory clarity would enable traditional financial institutions to engage more confidently with stablecoin technologies. Currently, uncertainty limits institutional participation despite growing market demand for dollar-pegged digital assets. Goldman Sachs has publicly explored tokenization initiatives through various pilot programs. The firm recognizes blockchain technology’s potential to transform traditional financial services. However, regulatory ambiguity creates implementation challenges. Solomon’s comments reflect this practical reality for institutional adoption. Other major banks echo similar concerns about navigating uncertain regulatory environments while pursuing technological innovation. Comparative Global Regulatory Approaches While U.S. legislation faces delays, other jurisdictions advance their cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. The European Union implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in 2024. This comprehensive framework establishes clear rules for cryptocurrency service providers and token issuers. Asian financial centers including Singapore and Hong Kong also developed progressive regulatory regimes. These jurisdictions aim to attract cryptocurrency businesses through regulatory certainty. The United Kingdom recently announced its own cryptocurrency regulatory package. British authorities emphasize innovation-friendly approaches while maintaining robust consumer protections. This global regulatory patchwork creates complex compliance requirements for international financial institutions. Many firms establish operations in multiple jurisdictions to navigate varying regulatory environments. The delayed U.S. legislation may temporarily disadvantage American financial innovation relative to global competitors. International regulatory cooperation continues through organizations like the Financial Stability Board and International Organization of Securities Commissions. These bodies develop global standards for cryptocurrency regulation. However, national implementation varies significantly across jurisdictions. The delayed CLARITY Act complicates U.S. participation in these international coordination efforts. Regulatory divergence could eventually create market fragmentation and compliance challenges for global financial institutions. Expert Analysis and Market Implications Financial regulation experts analyze the delayed legislation’s potential consequences. Dr. Eleanor Vance, former SEC senior counsel and current Georgetown University professor, explains the situation. “Comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation involves unprecedented technical complexity,” she notes. “Lawmakers must understand blockchain fundamentals while addressing legitimate regulatory concerns. This educational process naturally extends legislative timelines.” Market participants already adjust strategies based on regulatory expectations. Institutional cryptocurrency adoption continues through existing regulatory frameworks. However, ambitious projects requiring novel regulatory approvals face implementation delays. Venture capital investment in cryptocurrency infrastructure remains strong despite legislative uncertainty. Investors recognize that regulatory clarity will eventually emerge, creating substantial opportunities for compliant solutions. The delayed legislation affects various market segments differently. Established cryptocurrency exchanges continue operating under existing regulatory interpretations. New financial products involving tokenization await clearer guidelines before full-scale launch. Traditional financial institutions proceed cautiously with blockchain initiatives while monitoring legislative developments. This cautious approach may temporarily slow innovation but potentially reduces regulatory risk exposure. Conclusion Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon’s assessment highlights significant challenges facing U.S. cryptocurrency legislation. The CLARITY Act requires additional time for legislative refinement and stakeholder consensus. This delayed timeline affects institutional planning for tokenization and stablecoin initiatives. While regulatory uncertainty persists, financial institutions continue exploring blockchain applications within existing frameworks. The eventual establishment of comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation will likely accelerate institutional adoption and innovation. Market participants should monitor legislative developments while maintaining flexible implementation strategies for digital asset initiatives. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act represents proposed U.S. legislation establishing comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets. It addresses market structure, consumer protection, and jurisdictional questions for cryptocurrency markets. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the current draft? Coinbase expressed concerns that specific provisions might unnecessarily restrict innovation. The exchange continues advocating for balanced regulation that protects consumers while enabling technological advancement in cryptocurrency markets. Q3: How does delayed legislation affect tokenization? Regulatory uncertainty creates implementation challenges for tokenization projects. Financial institutions hesitate to launch comprehensive tokenization platforms without clearer regulatory guidelines, potentially slowing innovation in this emerging sector. Q4: What are stablecoins and why do they need regulation? Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain stable values, typically pegged to traditional currencies. Regulation establishes standards for reserve management, issuance transparency, and operational reliability to protect users and maintain financial stability. Q5: How does U.S. cryptocurrency regulation compare globally? The United States currently lags behind jurisdictions like the European Union in establishing comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. This regulatory divergence creates compliance complexities for international financial institutions operating across multiple jurisdictions.

This strategic move, first reported by Cointelegraph in May 2025, positions the regulated crypto bank for a significant expansion phase, directly coinciding with a transformative period of regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. The funding round underscores growing investor confidence in compliant crypto infrastructure ahead of a speculated 2026 IPO timeline. Anchorage Digital Funding Strategy and IPO Pathway Anchorage Digital’s pursuit of new capital represents a calculated step in its corporate evolution. The company, which secured a coveted national trust charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in 2021, is now building its war chest. This capital infusion will primarily fuel two parallel objectives: scaling its core institutional services and aggressively expanding into the burgeoning stablecoin sector. Consequently, the firm plans to double the size of its dedicated stablecoin team within the year, a direct response to recent legislative developments. Industry analysts view this pre-IPO round as a bid to solidify market position and achieve a stronger valuation before entering the public markets, a common strategy for late-stage fintech startups. The reported valuation for this round remains undisclosed, but previous funding provides context. Anchorage Digital last raised $350 million in a Series D round in late 2021, achieving a valuation exceeding $3 billion. The current effort suggests the company aims to build upon that foundation significantly. Furthermore, the 2026 IPO window aligns with broader market expectations for a maturation cycle in crypto-focused public listings, following the earlier waves of exchange-based offerings. The Catalytic Impact of U.S. Stablecoin Legislation The timing of Anchorage Digital’s expansion is not coincidental; it is deeply intertwined with regulatory progress. The passage of the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act in early 2025 provided the first comprehensive federal framework for issuers and custodians. This legislation effectively removed a primary source of operational uncertainty for regulated entities like Anchorage Digital. The law establishes clear requirements for reserve composition, redemption policies, and oversight, creating a legitimate playing field for compliant operators. For Anchorage Digital, this regulatory green light transforms its stablecoin ambitions from a speculative venture into a core business line with predictable rules. The company’s existing infrastructure for institutional custody and trading seamlessly integrates with stablecoin services, offering clients a unified platform. This legislative catalyst is prompting a sector-wide shift, as evidenced by the following comparative moves by competitors: Coinbase Custody: Enhanced its stablecoin management tools and regulatory reporting features. Fidelity Digital Assets: Announced research into offering stablecoin yield products for institutional clients. Traditional Banks (e.g., BNY Mellon): Accelerated pilot programs for digital asset custody, including stablecoins. This competitive landscape underscores why Anchorage Digital is moving decisively to capture market share early in the new regulatory era. Expert Analysis on Institutional Crypto Adoption Financial technology experts point to this funding round as a bellwether for the broader institutional adoption of digital assets. “Anchorage Digital’s move is a clear signal that sophisticated capital sees long-term value in regulated crypto banking rails,” notes Dr. Elena Vargas, a fintech professor at Stanford University. “The focus on stablecoins is particularly telling. It indicates that the near-term growth vector is in tokenized real-world assets and payment systems, not just speculative crypto trading.” This perspective is supported by data from PwC’s 2024 Global Crypto Report, which projected that institutional investment in crypto infrastructure would grow by over 150% between 2023 and 2026, with custody and compliance services being the largest segment. The potential IPO also carries symbolic weight for the industry. A successful public listing for a chartered crypto bank would demonstrate to traditional finance that compliant digital asset business models can achieve mainstream capital market success. It would provide a tangible benchmark for profitability and governance, aspects that have historically concerned institutional investors. Core Business Lines: Custody, Trading, and Staking To understand the significance of the funding, one must examine Anchorage Digital’s established business model. The company operates as a full-service platform for institutions like hedge funds, venture capital firms, and corporations. Its three pillars are: Digital Asset Custody: Provides secure, insured storage for cryptocurrencies using a combination of hardware security modules and multi-party computation (MPC) technology. This eliminates single points of failure for private keys. Institutional Trading: Offers a liquid marketplace for large-volume trades, connecting clients with a network of counterparties while ensuring settlement finality. Staking Services: Allows institutions to earn yield on their proof-of-stake assets (like Ethereum) through a non-custodial, slashing-insured service, which maintains compliance. The new capital will likely be deployed to enhance these core offerings through technological upgrades, geographic expansion, and increased sales and compliance personnel. The goal is to create an unrivaled, holistic platform that serves as the primary gateway for any traditional institution entering the digital asset space. Conclusion Anchorage Digital’s reported pursuit of a $200 million to $400 million funding round is a pivotal event at the intersection of finance, technology, and regulation. It highlights a strategic push to dominate the institutional crypto custody and emerging stablecoin market, empowered by new U.S. legislation. This pre-IPO maneuver sets the stage for a potential 2026 public listing that could serve as a landmark moment, validating the maturity and viability of regulated cryptocurrency banking. The success of this Anchorage Digital funding effort will be closely watched as a key indicator of institutional capital’s enduring commitment to the digital asset ecosystem’s infrastructure layer. FAQs Q1: What is Anchorage Digital? Anchorage Digital is a federally chartered digital asset bank and platform that provides custody, trading, staking, and financing services exclusively to institutional clients like asset managers and corporations. Q2: Why is Anchorage Digital raising new funds now? The company is raising capital to expand its business, particularly its stablecoin operations following new U.S. laws, and to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of a potential Initial Public Offering (IPO) targeted for 2026. Q3: How does recent stablecoin legislation affect Anchorage Digital? The 2025 Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act created a federal regulatory framework, giving compliant firms like Anchorage Digital clear rules to operate stablecoin services, which the company is now prioritizing for growth. Q4: What makes Anchorage Digital different from a regular crypto exchange? Unlike consumer exchanges, Anchorage Digital holds a national trust charter, allowing it to operate as a regulated bank. It focuses solely on institutional clients, offering higher security standards, insurance, and services tailored to large-scale investors. Q5: What would an Anchorage Digital IPO mean for the crypto industry? A successful IPO would be a major milestone, demonstrating that regulated crypto-native financial institutions can achieve public market success, potentially attracting more traditional investors and legitimizing the sector further.

57230775,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=876191,1768618817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/57230775.jpeg,"XRP Breakout Possible Before The Weekend, Expert Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-breakout-possible-before-weekend/,"XRP could be approaching an inflection point as a closely watched chart pattern tightens into its apex and broader “risk-on” signals in equities flash green, according to XRPL developer Bird (@Bird_XRPL). In a series of posts on X, Bird, the developer behind XRPL meme coin DROP, pointed to XRP’s hourly structure as setting up for a decisive move “before the end of the week,” arguing that a technical breakout could accelerate quickly toward a nearby upside objective. “Take a look at XRP on the hourly. A move is about to happen before the end of the week,” Bird wrote alongside a chart showing a contracting triangle with price compressing into the tip. “A measured move if we send upwards could push us straight to that $2.69 mark which finally gets us into ‘bull run’ mode.” Russell 2000 Breakout Puts XRP on Alert Beyond the short-term pattern, Bird anchored his thesis to US small caps, arguing that the Russell 2000’s behavior has historically mattered for XRP and the broader altcoin complex. Related Reading: XRP In A ‘Super Cycle’? SuperTrend Suggests Another Story “The Russell 2000 is about to close its highest weekly close in history. That matters ALOT for XRP,” Bird said. “Historically, XRP and altcoins have always tracked the Russell 2000 extremely closely. It’s the true risk on index for mid caps (not mega caps like the S&P or MAG7 where most capital has been parked).” Bird’s argument is that XRP still trades more like a mid-cap risk asset than a mega-cap “store of value” proxy, making the Russell’s breakout a useful macro tell for when speculative capital rotates back into higher beta exposures. He described the current backdrop as “capital rotating” and “risk … back on,” suggesting that the market may be entering a window where positioning can change quickly if narratives align. In a longer follow-up thread, Bird described XRP’s extended consolidation as increasingly out of sync with what he views as constructive macro conditions across risk assets. “We’re at a genuinely clinical moment for XRP. We’ve gone sideways for over a year, yet the Russell 2000 is now in full price discovery, other stock markets have been at all time highs for a long time, metals are elevated, and Bitcoin dominance is chopping at levels that historically dumps at,” he wrote. Related Reading: Ripple Builds XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’: Developer Claims ‘Billions Incoming’ Bird also pointed to a prior episode as a reference point: “In November ’24, the Russell turned green and XRP went parabolic roughly 10 days later,” he said, arguing that this time the Russell has gone further by reclaiming highs and holding strength across timeframes. In his view, the remaining constraint is rotation, not necessarily a sharp drawdown in metals or other assets, but simply a pause that allows risk appetite to re-price. On XRP and Ripple specific context, Bird said “acquisitions done, partnerships rolling out, NDAs lifting, legal clarity forming,” and argued that the market is nearing a point where “a single narrative, catalyst, or push can ignite XRP fast.” The key near-term test is whether the tightening technical structure resolves upward as Bird expects and whether cross-asset risk appetite continues to support alt beta. If both align, Bird’s framework suggests traders will be watching for a momentum break that could carry XRP toward the $2.69 objective and, in his view, potentially open the door to a faster path toward fresh cycle highs. At press time, XRP traded at $2.06.

57232019,658071,1768618822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57232019.jpeg,A New Bitcoin Market Regime: Spot Absorption Offsets Futures Noise,https://bitcoinist.com/new-bitcoin-market-spot-absorption-offsets-futures/,"Bitcoin is facing a critical test as bulls try to push price above a key resistance zone, hoping to confirm that the recent rebound has real traction. After weeks of choppy trading and repeated rejections, the market is again pressing into levels that could decide whether BTC transitions back into recovery mode or slips into another leg of consolidation. While momentum has improved in recent sessions, the broader structure still reflects uncertainty, with investors split between breakout expectations and caution after the latest correction. A report from XWIN Research Japan suggests Bitcoin is not currently in a strong directional trend, but instead remains trapped in a consolidation phase defined by range-bound price action and ongoing structural rebuilding. In this environment, the market is attempting to reset positioning after heavy volatility, while supply and demand continue to balance out near major technical levels. According to the analysis, the bias remains conditionally bullish, meaning upside continuation is still possible if Bitcoin can secure acceptance above resistance and hold it as support. However, the report also warns that short-term overheating risks persist, especially if leverage builds too quickly or price surges without sustained spot demand behind it. With Bitcoin approaching a pivotal inflection point, the next move could be decisive for broader market sentiment. Whales Take Control as Retail Activity Stays Muted The report adds that one of the most important shifts in Bitcoin’s current structure is the change in participant quality. CryptoQuant data suggests retail involvement in both spot and futures markets remains muted, while “Big Whale Orders” continue to appear across spot exchanges and derivatives venues. This points to a market that is being driven less by impulsive speculation and more by larger players gradually positioning through size and patience, shaping liquidity conditions around key price levels. This trend is reinforced by the 90-day Spot Taker CVD, which has flipped back into Taker Buy Dominant territory. In simple terms, aggressive market buying is increasing again, yet price has not accelerated sharply. That combination often implies that sell-side pressure is being absorbed, and available supply is being quietly taken off the table at lower levels. Rather than signaling euphoric demand, the behavior aligns more with structural accumulation and controlled risk-taking. At the same time, futures markets are heating up. Rising volumes and taker buying in derivatives suggest a more speculative layer is returning, raising the risk of short-term volatility if leverage becomes overcrowded. Still, spot flows indicate whales are absorbing supply, meaning futures-driven shakeouts can occur while underlying accumulation continues. The base case remains retail fading as whales take control, unless leverage distorts the structure again. Bitcoin Faces Heavy Moving Average Resistance Bitcoin is holding near $95,500 after a sharp recovery rally that began from the late-November lows. The chart shows BTC rebounding aggressively from the $85,000–$88,000 area, forming a clean sequence of higher lows and higher highs into mid-January. This move suggests that buyers have regained short-term control, but the market is now entering a key resistance zone where rallies have repeatedly stalled since the breakdown in November. The most immediate level to watch is the cluster between $95,000 and $98,000, where price is now pressing into overhead supply. BTC is also approaching the declining medium-term moving averages, which are acting as dynamic resistance and signaling that the broader trend is still recovering, not fully reversed. A clean daily close above this zone would strengthen the case for continuation toward the $100,000 psychological level and potentially a retest of the $105,000 area. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above $94,000–$95,000, the breakout risks turning into another liquidity sweep followed by consolidation. In that scenario, support sits near $92,000, with a deeper pullback targeting the $88,000–$90,000 range where buyers previously stepped in. For now, the trend is improving, but confirmation depends on reclaiming resistance with sustained volume.

He warned that proposed changes to a Senate market structure bill could slow economic growth by stifling innovation, limiting certain cryptocurrencies, and preventing Americans from earning interest on their stablecoins. During an in-depth interview with Fox Business under the host of Maria Bartiromo on Mornings With Maria, Armstrong highlighted that the most recent version of the Senate Banking Committee’s proposed legislation serves the interest of banks, therefore, cautioned that this could result in over-regulation, ending up harming recent bipartisan moves concerning crypto policy. Consequently, the industry executive stated that Coinbase carefully reviewed the Senate Banking Committee draft over the last 48 hours and concluded that it cannot support the bill in its current form. To further explain this decision, the CEO indicated that specific parts of the bill would come close to prohibiting tokenized securities, implement comprehensive regulatory constraints on the DeFi sector, weaken the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and eliminate rewards for stablecoins. Armstrong identifies several risks associated with the recently shared Senate Banking draft Armstrong expressed gratitude for the Senate’s collective efforts, particularly those of Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis. However, the industry executive sparked concern after alleging that the draft shared recently posed serious threats that would be difficult to address upon reaching a final vote on the Senate floor. According to him, the primary issue concerns the rewards associated with stablecoins. Regarding this problem, Armstrong asserted that recently enacted crypto regulations, such as the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act), which Trump signed into law, permitted stablecoin issuers to offer interest. He perceived this as crucial for enabling Americans to acquire returns on their investments. “The banks are really trying to undermine the president’s crypto plans,” Armstrong stated. “They want to protect their profits by taking money from hardworking Americans and putting it into the hands of big banks that are making record profits.” Afterwards, Coinbase’s CEO contrasted stablecoins that the GENIUS Act requires to be fully backed by short-term US Treasuries with traditional fractional-reserve banking, arguing that cryptocurrencies pose minimal risk to the financial system. To further elaborate on this point, he stated that these stablecoins do not rely on fractional reserves; therefore, they should not be regulated similarly to banks. Following his remarks, host Bartiromo asked Armstrong whether crypto platforms should be subject to regulations similar to those of banks. Examples of these regulations include deposit insurance and safeguard measures for investors. Responding to this question, he noted that these regulations primarily aim to manage risks associated with fractional-reserve lending, and that FDIC insurance covers deposits up to $250,000 per depositor. “If customers choose to lend out their funds, they can do so,” he said. “You don’t need a bank license for that. A bank license is necessary when you lend someone else’s money without their permission.” Armstrong expressed disapproval of the proposed change regarding the CFTC and the SEC Some analysts raised concerns that stablecoins pose a serious risk to community banks. Nonetheless, Armstrong called this claim false, describing it as a calculated distraction employed by major financial institutions. Based on his argument, assertions that stablecoins are draining community bank deposits lack substantiated evidence, and he noted that the consolidation driven by major banks poses a far greater risk since the Dodd-Frank era. Moreover, the industry executive condemned the Senate proposal that would make the CFTC subordinate to the SEC. In this approach, digital assets must pass through SEC oversight before potentially falling under CFTC control. “I can’t understand why the Senate Ag Committee would make the CFTC a subsidiary of the SEC,” he said, citing the CLARITY Act , which the House passed.

This signals significant concerns about the bill’s alignment with the interests of cryptocurrency firms compared to traditional banking institutions, not only for the exchange but also for broader market participants. Coinbase CEO’s Concerns Over Fair Competition On Friday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong elaborated on the rationale behind the exchange’s withdrawal in an appearance on FOX Business, expressing his frustration with the notion that banks could use regulatory means to stifle competition in their favor. “It just felt deeply unfair to me that one industry [banks] would come in and get to do regulatory capture to ban their competition,” Armstrong stated. He also underscored the importance of a level playing field, asserting that competition should thrive without undue interference from powerful financial entities. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bill Draft Criticized For Allowing Continued Developer Prosecution Coinbase CEO emphasized that his concerns resonate with “much of the industry,” highlighting his obligation to advocate for customers who he believes are being shortchanged by the provisions of the proposed market legislation. “I declined to opine on the exact—whether the hearing, the markup should happen or not… But I did feel like I had to speak up on behalf of our customers and all Americans here,” he articulated. Debate Heats Over CLARITY Act Central to the ongoing debate surrounding the CLARITY Act is a critical disagreement between banks and crypto firms regarding the fate of stablecoin holders and whether they should be entitled to receive reward payments. Armstrong has previously raised alarms that the bill might prohibit tokenized equities, impose restrictions on decentralized finance (DeFi), and expand governmental access to financial data, thereby compromising individual privacy. Furthermore, he warned that the legislation could shift regulatory authority away from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and towards the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), sidelining competition within the crypto space. Armstrong Critiques Banking Lobbying Tactics Armstrong noted the irony in the current situation, pointing out that while banks are indeed leveraging the advantages of cryptocurrency, their lobbying efforts seem aimed at restricting competing firms. “Many of these banks are actually very smart,” he acknowledged, referencing the commercial side of banking that is increasingly engaging with crypto. “They’re actually doing deals with Coinbase. We’re powering a lot of crypto and stablecoin infrastructure for them on the commercial side.” Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto ETFs Set To Attract $130 Billion-Plus Inflows This Year, JPMorgan Predicts Despite his criticisms of the banking sector’s lobbying tactics, Armstrong expressed optimism that legislators could ultimately resolve the outstanding issues within the crypto market structure bill: And then their lobbying arm comes to D.C. and thinks of it as very zero-sum and is trying to kill the competition. So, I suspect, like many things, if we get the principles in the room, we can actually get this figured out and make a good deal.

This discussion is always around how it can realistically trade at huge price levels in the double and triple digits with such a huge total supply. However, discussion around its burn rate has resurfaced due to current figures showing a steady reduction in the cryptocurrency’s total supply. According to data shared by an expert on X, XRP’s supply has declined by more than 2 million tokens over the past two years, with comments about how the burn mechanism works, what it actually means for long-term supply, and how it fits into discussions about its valuation and use in large-scale payments. XRP Burns: Millions Are Gone Forever XRP does not rely on a discretionary burn program or periodic token destruction events. Instead, the XRP Ledger permanently destroys a small amount of the token every time a transaction is processed. This fee is not paid to validators or any network participant. Once it is consumed by the protocol, it is removed from circulation permanently. According to numbers shared on X by 24HRSCRYPTO, the total supply stood at 99,988,313,728 about 806 days ago. Today, that number is closer to 99,985,726,061. The difference is 2,587,667 XRP that no longer exist, meaning a little over 3,200 of the altcoin is destroyed per day. That number may not look dramatic compared to its nearly 100 billion maximum supply. However, it shows consistent on-ledger usage leading to a steady reduction in supply. This has led to the cumulative amount of the token burned slowly moving higher over the full lifetime of the Ledger. Pre-Mined, How Institutions Fit Into The Design The post by 24HRSCRYPTO also revisits a long-standing aspect of XRP’s structure. The token’s entire supply of 100 billion tokens was created at inception, although not all were released at launch. Furthermore, its supply has always been fixed, and burns will continue to reduce the total number of the token in existence. This is in contrast to networks like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana that see their total circulating supply increase over time. Furthermore, Ripple, which developed the Ledger, has consistently framed the altcoin from a payments and financial infrastructure perspective. This trend is also unlike most other cryptocurrencies, which are built to work in parallel against traditional finance. 24HRSCRYPTO notes that this design reflects an institutional mindset, noting that supply certainty is something banks and large financial players tend to prefer. When trillions start to flow into the altcoin, the circulating supply will continue to decrease. According to the analyst, $100 per XRP is inevitable in this case. This viewpoint is based on the fact that higher price targets for the token are not speculations but a functional requirement for global-scale usage.",XRP|24HRSCRYPTO|dogecoin|Ethereum|ripple|solana|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 04:00:48

The frontier has experienced remarkable growth in the last few years due to the influx of financial institutions such as BlackRock and J.P. Morgan. Tokenized assets now emerge as a rapidly evolving sector in the crypto ecosystem. The sector has attracted major financial institutions and corporations, including BlackRock and J.P.

The firm noted that these platforms have become strategic hubs for crypto start-ups and global financial institutions to launch financial products for users worldwide. The data platform highlighted that more than 2,100 tokenized assets have been deployed as of January 16. Token terminal also noted that the sector has grown to have more than 140 issuers across more than 80 different blockchains and more than 12 standardized metrics per asset. Cryptopolitan reported that the value of real-world assets on blockchain networks has skyrocketed by 232% in 2025, reaching $18.6 billion, up from $5.6 billion in 2024. The report credits the sudden growth to the recent increase in institutional adoption and investments. The year saw traditional assets such as bonds, commodities, and private credit undergo tokenization. The report noted that tokenized equities witnessed significant growth in RWAs, bringing traditional stocks and ETFs onto the blockchain. Metals such as Gold and Silver can also be traded publicly as perpetual contracts on exchanges such as Hyperliquid. In Asia, the United Arab Emirates exported its real estate tokenization expertise to Georgia earlier this week. PRYPCO Mint, the first licensed real estate tokenization platform in the UAE, partnered with the Dubai Land Department and VARA (Dubai’s Virtual Regulatory Authority) to tokenize ownership certificates. The first tokenized certificate attracted 224 investors from over 40 different nationalities with an average investment of $2,900. The report noted that PRYPCO signed an MOU with the Ministry of Justice of Georgia, which mandates both parties to explore, develop, and implement an innovative real estate tokenization initiative in the U.S. state. In Europe, Swift announced it had completed a tokenized assets pilot with BNP Paribas Securities Services, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Société Générale. The coalition developed mechanisms for the exchange and settlement of tokenized bonds. Crypto execs predict tokenization will continue to grow in 2026 According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, tokenized assets will redefine global trading activities. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan on January 11, the Coinbase executive mentioned that tokenized stocks will expand their international access and continue to offer fractional stock purchases and round-the-clock trading. He added that they will provide perpetual futures, real-time settlement, and novel governance innovations. Armstrong said Coinbase developers are building an all-inclusive exchange platform that will include different financial markets outside crypto, such as stocks and commodities, in 2026. The plan is set to position Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, as a competitor in the stock and equities brokerage industry. Coinbase recently partnered with Kalshi, a rapidly growing prediction market, to advance tokenization of betting and prediction markets. Last year, the Head of Operations at Bitfinex Securities, Jesse Knutson, also mentioned that emerging markets are expected to drive strong growth in real-world asset tokenization this year. According to Knutson, tokenization allows retail investors to access investments that would otherwise be costly to them by owning a fraction of the asset. He also revealed that organizations find it easy to provide fixed returns to investors but struggle to acquire stable traditional funding to benefit most from asset tokenization.

OpenAI said on Friday it will begin testing ads inside chatbot responses for free users in the U.S. and those on its new $8 Go plan. That includes a lot of people. If you’re not paying for Plus, Pro, or Enterprise, you’re going to start seeing ads in your chatbot replies. The company said these ads will show up at the bottom of ChatGPT’s responses, and they’ll be clearly labeled so users know exactly what’s an ad and what’s AI output. If you’re under 18, you won’t see any ads at all. Ads also won’t appear near things like politics, health, or mental health topics, OpenAI said. OpenAI expands testing and keeps paid plans ad‑free Sam Altman’s team is already deep into spending mode. OpenAI locked in over $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals last year, and they’re now aiming to cover that kind of commitment. Sam had said back in November that OpenAI was already reaching a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate. So yeah, this isn’t about pocket change. To keep that growth going, OpenAI is finally turning to digital ads, just like Google and Meta have done for years. Sam posted Friday on X: “It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don’t want to pay, so we are hopeful a business model like this can work.” Translation: if you want AI for free, you’re going to see some ads. The Go plan, which launched Friday in the U.S., is OpenAI’s low-cost $8 tier, and it’ll include ads too. That’s now the entry point for anyone who wants access to more advanced features than the free tier but doesn’t want to pay $20 a month. But again, ads are part of the deal. Want to skip ads? You’ll need to go Plus or higher. Sam’s always had mixed feelings about putting ads into ChatGPT. He’s warned before that it could mess with user trust, saying publicly that he didn’t want ads to change how people felt about the product. But he also said back in November that OpenAI would probably try ads “at some point,” even if he didn’t expect it to be the biggest money-maker. OpenAI said ChatGPT’s answers won’t be changed by the ads, and they also vowed that they’re not selling user data to advertisers. Users will also be able to dismiss ads, learn why they’re seeing them, and send feedback. According to the company, “We’ll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won’t change.” Don’t just read crypto news.

Recent data tracking the most searched cashtags on the platform shows XRP consistently appearing among the dominant assets drawing user attention. Interestingly, this surge in visibility is not happening in isolation but in tandem with a series of regulatory, institutional, and ecosystem developments within the XRP ecosystem. XRP Surges Into The Top Cashtags On X Data tracking the most-searched cashtags on the social media platform X shows XRP climbing alongside other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a closer look at the data shows that XRP has received many more cashtags compared to other cryptocurrencies. This trend was revealed by Nikita Bier, head of product at X, who shared a visualization chart of recent search behavior on X. The chart data shows that XRP has consistently appeared among the most queried assets on X since December 2025. Throughout the period depicted, top cashtag traffic has been fluctuating with daily rhythm as X users scan the platform and post on X with cashtags. The share of searches attributable to $xrp slices into a larger portion of the total during days in early January 2026, which indicates extended interest. On some dates, XRP’s presence in the search mix rivals that of $btc and $eth, which are typically the dominant anchors of crypto attention on social media. The chart also shows how other tags wax and wane alongside XRP’s performance. Some days show greater fragmentation, where interest is spread across stocks such as $iren (IREN), $tesla (Tesla), $gme (GameStop), and $asts (AST SpaceMobile Inc.). Nonetheless, the trajectory for XRP in the first half of January shows a growing base of people actively getting involved in the cryptocurrency. Top Cashtags Searched On X Why XRP Is Commanding So Much Attention Social interest on X is a mix of speculation and ecosystem developments, which XRP is currently sitting at the center of. Behind this spike in attention are tangible developments surrounding Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. One recent example is how Ripple secured regulatory approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, obtaining both an Electronic Money Institution license and cryptoasset registration. Ripple’s regulatory buildout is expanding across Europe, with additional approvals in Luxembourg as part of its push to operate on both sides of the continent. Interestingly, there are also indications of deeper engagement with Ripple’s ecosystem on the institutional side. Rumors and mentions on X indicate that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has started to use Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin (RLUSD) as collateral. However, this move is yet to be confirmed by BlackRock. These updates, combined with many others, help explain why social interest and cashtag searches for XRP have recently been on the rise on X and other social media platforms.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 05:00:46

A high-timeframe trader has identified a fractal that closely mirrored Bitcoin’s behavior ahead of the 2021 bull run. He argues that the current cycle is unfolding in line with a well-established structural script observed across multiple market cycles spanning more than a decade. Bitcoin’s Fractal: Rooted In High-Timeframe Structure The fractal highlighted by the trader is based on a direct structural comparison between Bitcoin’s current cycle and the 2021 setup, illustrated in a chart he attached to his analysis. The chart aligns both periods to show how price advanced into a broad distribution range, rolled over into a sharp corrective phase, and then attempted to recover while capped by descending resistance. In both cases, Bitcoin retraced to the 0.382 Fibonacci level before stabilizing, marking a shared technical inflection point rather than a coincidental price overlap. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Approaching A Key Decision Zone, But Structure Is Still Firmly Bullish This structural symmetry extends beyond price levels into timing. According to the trader, the current cycle has tracked the rhythm of prior four-year cycles with notable consistency, allowing historical all-time highs and lows to be mapped objectively. Using that same framework, the data previously supported a high-probability short near the peak candle around $123,000, reinforcing his view that recurring market structure continues to guide directional risk. By comparing the two cycles directly, the trader argues that Bitcoin’s behavior is being evaluated through a recurring structural pattern that has remained intact for more than 12 years, rather than through subjective bias. $100,000 As A Structural And Psychological Ceiling Within the identified fractal, psychological resistance is a key determinant of Bitcoin’s upside potential. Looking back at 2021, Bitcoin failed to decisively reclaim the $50,000 level and instead front-ran it before reversing, establishing a behavioral precedent for how traders respond to significant round-number thresholds. Applying this pattern to the current cycle, $100,000 now functions as the analogous psychological ceiling. As a result, some participants may act preemptively, which could generate selling pressure from underwater holders and distribution by larger players. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals The Biggest Enemy Of XRP Investors As Price Struggles At $2 This potential resistance is reinforced by diagonal trendlines that mirror the caps observed in 2021, creating a structural limit on upside momentum. Within this context, short-term extensions into the $98,000–$99,000 range remain plausible and are fully compatible with the fractal, as price can approach the psychological ceiling. Moreover, positioning data from the past six to eight months indicates that the median short-term buyer cost basis has clustered between $95,000 and $100,000, highlighting zones where profit-taking and defensive selling are likely to intensify. These elements suggest a scenario where price may test resistance, experience temporary stalls, and respect structural limits without invalidating the broader high-timeframe thesis. However, the trader notes that the framework is probabilistic: only a sustained move above $104,000–$105,000 would break the fractal pattern and necessitate a full reassessment of the high-timeframe trend.

The 10% credit card plan sits inside a broader affordability agenda. That agenda includes blocking institutional investors from buying single‑family homes and allowing savers to tap 401(k) plans for home down payments. Timing remains uncertain, but Trump said more details will come when he speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Fox Business that talks with major banks are active. “They think that the president’s on to something,” Kevin said during the interview. At the same time, housing policy is also under review. Officials are discussing whether to block stock buybacks by publicly traded homebuilders. Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, raised the idea earlier this week in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. No decisions have been finalized. White House officials say discussions are still moving. The administration did not respond to requests for comment as talks continued behind closed doors. Late last week, Trump called for a one‑year 10% cap on credit card rates and set January 20 as the deadline. His team has also met with homebuilders to discuss affordability. Financial firms spent days trying to figure out how the order would work. Industry trade groups began planning responses and warned the cap could hit lower‑income borrowers and disrupt lending. Pressure increased when Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt spoke on Thursday. She said companies are expected to lower rates by the deadline. She called it a “demand” from Trump. Banks push back as consumers and lobbyists weigh outcomes The issue dominated earnings calls at major banks this week. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America all raised concerns. Executives said they lack enough detail to measure the impact on their businesses. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said a government‑mandated cap could slow economic activity. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said it could limit access to credit if banks pull back. Bank trade groups also pushed back. “We’re talking about unsecured lending, so it’s not like an auto loan or a mortgage loan where there’s something you can take back,” said Rob Nichols, head of the American Bankers Association. Lobbyists spent the week trying to understand how Trump might implement the order. One option under discussion is using the interstate commerce clause to override state usury limits, according to a lobbyist involved in the talks. Some consumer advocates warned that a 10% cap could be too low and lead banks to cut lending. Others pointed to federal credit unions, which already operate under rate caps. “It’s about finding a reasonable rate that doesn’t undermine the ability of consumers who are struggling to get by,” said Adam Rust of the Consumer Federation of America. Kevin also floated the idea that banks could voluntarily launch new Trump cards. Bilt rolled out three cards earlier this week with rates capped at 10%, though the limit lasts one year and applies only to new purchases. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This development marks a significant escalation in the ongoing debate about how to regulate digital assets in the United States, potentially derailing years of legislative progress. White House Crypto Bill Faces Unprecedented Challenge The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Liquidity, and Institutional Transparency (CLARITY) Act represents the most comprehensive cryptocurrency market structure legislation proposed in Congress. Lawmakers designed the bill to establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance platforms. However, recent developments threaten to undermine this legislative effort completely. According to multiple sources familiar with the negotiations, the White House expressed serious concerns about Coinbase’s withdrawal from discussions. Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, first reported this development. Administration officials characterized Coinbase’s move as unexpected and potentially damaging to both regulatory progress and industry stability. The legislation’s future now depends heavily on whether Coinbase returns to negotiations with acceptable terms regarding stablecoin yields for traditional banking institutions. This specific issue has emerged as the primary sticking point in recent weeks. Coinbase’s Concerns About the CLARITY Act Coinbase officially rescinded its support for the legislation last week, citing several substantive concerns about the bill’s current language. The company identified four primary issues that prompted their withdrawal from negotiations: Tokenized Stock Restrictions: Provisions that could effectively ban tokenized traditional securities DeFi Limitations: Language that might block decentralized finance platforms from operating legally Financial Surveillance: Sections permitting unlimited access to user financial information Regulatory Authority Shifts: Provisions weakening CFTC authority while strengthening SEC oversight Coinbase representatives particularly emphasized concerns about stablecoin reward functions. They argued that certain provisions could prevent stablecoin issuers from offering yield-generating products. This limitation would significantly impact the economic viability of many stablecoin models currently operating in the market. Regulatory Jurisdiction Battle Intensifies The legislation’s treatment of regulatory authority has sparked considerable debate among industry observers. Currently, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees cryptocurrency derivatives and certain spot markets. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains jurisdiction over securities offerings and exchanges. The CLARITY Act proposes shifting more authority to the SEC, a move that concerns many cryptocurrency advocates. They argue that the SEC’s traditional securities framework doesn’t adequately address the unique characteristics of digital assets. This regulatory tension represents a fundamental challenge for cryptocurrency legislation in the United States. Key Regulatory Differences Between CFTC and SEC Approaches Aspect CFTC Approach SEC Approach Primary Framework Commodities Regulation Securities Regulation Registration Requirements Generally Lighter Extensive and Complex r> Disclosure Standards Market Transparency Focus Investor Protection Focus Innovation Philosophy More Accommodating More Restrictive Stablecoin Yield Negotiations Reach Impasse The most immediate conflict centers on stablecoin yield provisions for traditional banks. Banking institutions seek regulatory clarity about how they can offer yield-generating stablecoin products. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency companies worry about unfair competitive advantages for traditional financial institutions. Stablecoins represent digital assets pegged to stable reserves like the U.S. dollar. These cryptocurrencies have grown tremendously in recent years, with total market capitalization exceeding $150 billion. The yield debate specifically concerns how these assets generate returns for holders through various mechanisms. Traditional banks argue they need clear regulatory pathways to compete with cryptocurrency-native companies. Conversely, cryptocurrency firms express concerns about regulatory capture. They fear established financial institutions might use regulation to disadvantage innovative competitors. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Legislation This legislative effort follows years of regulatory uncertainty in the cryptocurrency space. Congress first began serious discussions about comprehensive digital asset legislation in 2022. Multiple bills have since been introduced, but none have reached the president’s desk for signature. The CLARITY Act emerged from bipartisan negotiations in 2024. Lawmakers from both parties worked with industry stakeholders to craft balanced legislation. Their goal was to provide regulatory clarity while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem. Previous legislative attempts faced similar challenges regarding regulatory jurisdiction and stablecoin treatment. However, the current dispute represents the most significant threat to legislative progress in recent memory. Industry observers note that without Coinbase’s support, the legislation faces substantial obstacles in Congress. Potential Impacts on Cryptocurrency Markets The uncertainty surrounding this legislation could have immediate effects on cryptocurrency markets. Regulatory clarity represents a crucial factor for institutional investment in digital assets. Many traditional financial institutions have delayed significant cryptocurrency investments pending legislative outcomes. Market analysts identify several potential consequences if the legislation stalls: Continued Regulatory Uncertainty: Extended period without clear rules for market participants Reduced Institutional Participation: Traditional financial firms may remain cautious Innovation Migration: Cryptocurrency companies might relocate to more favorable jurisdictions Market Volatility: Increased price fluctuations due to regulatory uncertainty International competition represents another significant consideration. Other jurisdictions, including the European Union and United Kingdom, have advanced their own cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. The United States risks falling behind in the global competition for digital asset innovation if legislation continues to stall. Broader Implications for Financial Innovation This dispute extends beyond immediate regulatory concerns to fundamental questions about financial innovation. The cryptocurrency industry represents one of the most significant technological disruptions in finance since the internet. How regulators approach this innovation will shape financial markets for decades. Traditional financial institutions increasingly recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Many major banks now explore various blockchain applications. However, regulatory uncertainty creates significant barriers to meaningful adoption and integration. The current impasse highlights the tension between innovation and regulation that characterizes technological disruption. Finding the appropriate balance remains challenging for policymakers worldwide. The United States’ approach will likely influence regulatory developments in other major economies. Conclusion The White House’s potential withdrawal of support for the crypto bill represents a critical juncture for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. The dispute between the administration and Coinbase over stablecoin yields and market structure provisions threatens to derail years of legislative progress. As negotiations reach this impasse, the future of comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation remains uncertain. Market participants, regulators, and policymakers now await Coinbase’s next move and the administration’s final decision regarding the White House crypto bill. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Liquidity, and Institutional Transparency (CLARITY) Act represents comprehensive legislation designed to establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance platforms in the United States. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the legislation? Coinbase cited concerns about tokenized stock restrictions, DeFi limitations, financial surveillance provisions, regulatory authority shifts, and stablecoin reward function limitations as reasons for withdrawing support. Q3: What are stablecoin yields? Stablecoin yields refer to returns generated by holding certain stablecoins, typically through mechanisms like staking, lending, or other interest-generating activities within decentralized finance platforms. Q4: How might this legislation affect cryptocurrency markets? Continued regulatory uncertainty could reduce institutional participation, increase market volatility, and potentially drive innovation to more favorable jurisdictions if comprehensive legislation fails to pass. Q5: What happens if the White House withdraws support? Without White House support, the legislation faces significant obstacles in Congress, potentially delaying comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation for years and extending the current period of regulatory uncertainty.

The comparison many economists are making is not subtle.In 2019, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey, fired central bank governor Murat Çetinkaya after he refused to cut rates.The result was brutal.The lira collapsed and inflation surged. Even then, Erdoğan never claimed the banker was a criminal. In the United States, Jay Powell, the Fed chair, is now facing a federal investigation over a $2.5bn renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Powell breaks protocol as Trump pressure escalates As Cryptopolitan reported , Powell had released a short video on the Fed’s website, saying the investigation was a pretext designed by Trump to force deep interest rate cuts. That public response broke decades of Fed tradition and what has been Powell’s own personal style. Larry Kudlow, who previously ran the National Economic Council, said Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in Washington, “may have pulled the trigger” on Powell “a little too fast.” Markets stayed calm. Stocks barely moved. Bond yields were steady. Investors are betting the Fed will resist pressure to cut rates to near zero. Still, economists called the moment alarming. Since World War II, the White House and the Fed have acted as anchors of global stability. Now they are openly clashing. Klaas Knot, former head of the Dutch central bank, said the U.S. once supported institutions needed for a market economy to work. “It was leading by example,” he said. “They have apparently chosen to set an entirely different example.” The timing matters. Trump is traveling to Davos to sell his economic agenda as the Supreme Court hears arguments in the case of Lisa Cook. She is a Fed governor he tried to fire over mortgage fraud claims. Lisa denies them and has not been charged. Political backlash complicates Trump plans for the Fed The conflict between Trump and Powell is long-running. After appointing Powell, the president turned on him following rate hikes. During his second term, attacks intensified. Trump called Powell a “stubborn mule” and a “numbskull.” He said he would “love to fire” him for refusing to cut rates to 1 per cent. The White House later focused on the Fed building project, now $700mn over budget, which sits at the center of the DOJ probe. Powell stayed silent for months, even when Trump attempted to remove Lisa Cook. That changed with the video. Capitol Hill reacted. Thom Tillis of North Carolina backed Powell. Lisa Murkowski and John Kennedy followed. On Wall Street, Jamie Dimon joined Christine Lagarde in calling for central bank independence. Glenn Hubbard, former chair of George W Bush’s economic council, said Powell handled the video well. “He clarified what had happened,” Hubbard said. “He didn’t editorialise.” Hubbard also signed a letter condemning the probe, alongside every living former Fed chair. Inside the administration, cracks appeared. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, publicly backed a review of the Fed but privately urged Trump not to pursue the investigation. Treasury officials later said there was “zero daylight” between Bessent and the president. Hubbard called the episode an “own goal of epic proportions.” The probe has made it harder for Trump to reshape the Fed. Powell’s chair term ends in four months, but he can stay on the board until January 2028. Allies say Powell is now reconsidering whether to step down. His exit would allow Trump to appoint another ally. Senate approval is another obstacle. Tillis has threatened to block any nominee until the probe is dropped. If that drags on, Powell could remain chair. The controversy has also hurt Kevin Hassett, a close Trump ally. Hassett backed the probe early, then said, “I expect that there’s nothing to see here.” Later, Trump hinted he might keep Hassett in his current role. Other names are floating. Kevin Warsh, Chris Waller, and Rick Rieder have stayed silent. Stephen Miran, already approved by the Senate, joined the Fed board last year. James Egelhof of BNP Paribas said the Fed would stick to its policy framework. Still, some funds are hedging. Pimco, which manages $2.2tn, is reducing exposure to the dollar. Paul Diggle warned of creeping politicisation. Adam Posen said governments are planning paths “not dependent on the US.” Even if the DOJ case fails, economists warn the damage may linger. Lael Brainard said officials may hesitate to speak freely. “Everybody is nervous,” she said, “that they too could be the subject of a criminal investigation.” Get seen where it counts.

Not because they don’t want to. They literally don’t have the tools. “We don’t have enough equipment to expand production of these chips, and we can’t put it together fast enough,” Jim said on his CNBC segment Friday night. Micron’s stock jumped 7.76% on Friday. Not a small move. The company makes memory and storage tech, especially for artificial intelligence. Its CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, told Jim there’s no sign of things slowing down. “AI driven-demand is accelerating. It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand,” Sanjay said. They just started building a 600,000-square-foot site in upstate New York. It’s part of their plan to spend $200 billion on new chip production in the U.S. Micron, Seagate and others can’t keep up with AI orders That massive site? It’s not saving anything tomorrow. It’s years away. And Jim pointed that out. The only reason this kind of construction is even happening is because of the CHIPS Act. That law gives U.S. chipmakers government support to build locally. But laws don’t pour concrete. It’ll take time. That means the shortage isn’t getting fixed right away. And as long as demand stays hot, Jim says prices will just keep rising. Besides Micron, Jim called out other chip stocks that are already up big. Western Digital, Seagate, Sandisk are all benefiting from this crunch. He also said the shortage didn’t show up out of nowhere. Last year, everyone thought there were too many chips. Now? Total reversal. Jim said only one company saw this coming: Nvidia. “Only Nvidia really saw it coming,” Jim said . “They teamed up with the best of the best, Taiwan Semiconductor, to make all the high-end chips that are needed. There’s no bottleneck there. There’s no shortage, at least not in comparison to memory.” Markets stay up as global chaos is mostly ignored Even with everything going on around the world, stocks are still going up. The S&P 500 is higher. So is the Dow Jones, with a 3% gain this year. The Nasdaq is up 1.2%. Nobody’s pulling out of the market, even with Trump talking about military action or Greenland. Anthony Esposito, who runs AscalonVI Capital, told CNBC that markets haven’t cared about geopolitical risk for a while now. “Israel bombs Iran — the S&P 500 was down 1% overnight and closed down just 50bps. U.S. bombs Iran — almost no reaction,” he said. Venezuela and Greenland, he added, could even help U.S. markets because of energy, rare-earths and infrastructure. Europe’s Stoxx 600 is up almost 4%, even while everyone’s guessing what Trump might try with Greenland. Over in Asia, the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index just hit a new high after jumping more than 5% this year. Japan’s Nikkei 225 and South Korea’s Kospi both hit records too. One last thing. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on Trump’s tariffs. It hasn’t happened yet. But investors don’t seem to be waiting.

This consistent pattern, derived from data provided by the analytics firm Farside Investors, signals a potential stabilization phase for these novel financial instruments following their highly anticipated launch. The data reveals a compelling divergence beneath the headline figure, however, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) attracting $14.9 million while the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) experienced an outflow of $10.2 million. Analyzing the Ethereum ETF Inflow Streak The five-day inflow streak for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs represents a notable milestone in the short history of these products. Analysts often scrutinize consecutive flow data to gauge underlying market sentiment and product differentiation. This period of consistent net inflows suggests a growing, albeit measured, comfort level among institutional and retail investors with gaining direct exposure to Ethereum’s native asset, Ether (ETH), through a regulated, exchange-traded structure. The structure of these ETFs is crucial; they hold the actual cryptocurrency, unlike futures-based products, which track derivative contracts. Market observers point to several contextual factors that may be contributing to this trend. Firstly, the broader cryptocurrency market has shown signs of consolidation after a period of volatility, potentially encouraging entry at perceived stable levels. Secondly, increasing discussion around Ethereum’s ongoing technological upgrades, particularly its full transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, may be renewing long-term investor interest. Finally, the sheer novelty of the product category means early adoption curves are still being established, making multi-day trends particularly informative. The Divergence Between Major Fund Providers A deeper analysis of the January 16 data uncovers a significant narrative of competition and investor preference. The performance split between the two largest funds by asset base is stark. BlackRock’s ETHA, managed by the world’s largest asset manager, posted a robust single-day inflow of $14.9 million. Conversely, Grayscale’s ETHE, which converted from a long-standing closed-end trust into an ETF, saw $10.2 million leave the fund. This divergence can be attributed to several key factors familiar to ETF analysts: Fee Structures: Management fees are a primary driver of ETF flows. BlackRock’s ETHA launched with a highly competitive fee, while Grayscale’s ETHE, carrying over from its trust structure, initially had a significantly higher fee. Although Grayscale has since reduced its fee, the initial disparity created a powerful first impression. Brand and Distribution Power: BlackRock’s iShares platform boasts unparalleled distribution networks among financial advisors and institutional platforms, facilitating easier access for a vast swath of investors. Tracking Efficiency and Liquidity: Newer funds like ETHA were built from the ground up as ETFs, potentially offering tighter tracking to the net asset value (NAV) and efficient creation/redemption processes. Converted funds can sometimes face initial technical arbitrage. The table below summarizes the key contrasts between the two funds based on available public data: Fund (Ticker) Provider Jan 16 Flow Primary Consideration iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) BlackRock +$14.9M Inflow Competitive fee, strong distribution Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) Grayscale -$10.2M Outflow Legacy fee history, conversion from trust Expert Perspective on Flow Dynamics Financial analysts specializing in fund flows emphasize that this pattern is not uncommon in nascent ETF markets. “The early days of a new ETF category are always a battleground for assets,” notes a veteran ETF strategist whose commentary is frequently cited in financial media. “Investors are rationally moving toward the combination of lowest cost and strongest brand credibility. The consistent net inflow for the category is the more telling macro story—it shows the product concept itself is gaining traction, even as assets shuffle between providers.” This expert view underscores that while individual fund competition is fierce, the aggregate positive flow is a stronger indicator of the Ethereum ETF market’s health. Furthermore, data from Farside Investors provides an evidence-based foundation for this analysis. The firm’s independent tracking of daily fund flows is a widely referenced source within the investment community, adding a layer of verifiable authority to the reported figures. The five-day streak provides a small but meaningful dataset that begins to move beyond launch-day anomalies and toward revealing sustained investor behavior. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets The steady inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs carry implications beyond the funds themselves. Firstly, they represent a continuous, incremental source of buying pressure on the underlying Ether asset. Each dollar flowing into ETFs like ETHA requires the fund’s authorized participants to purchase an equivalent amount of Ether to back the new shares, creating a direct link between traditional finance capital and the crypto market. Secondly, this activity validates the regulatory pathway established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in approving these products. The approval process was lengthy and scrutinized, making their subsequent market performance a point of interest for policymakers and future applicants, such as those proposing funds for other digital assets. The demonstrated investor demand supports the argument for a regulated access point to crypto assets. Finally, the flow data contributes to the maturation narrative of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The ability to track daily inflows and outflows with the same tools used for traditional equity or bond ETFs normalizes Ethereum as an asset class for a broader audience. It shifts the discussion partially away from pure price speculation and toward metrics like product adoption, fee competition, and market structure. Conclusion The fifth consecutive day of net inflows for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, culminating in a $4.7 million addition on January 16, 2025, underscores a building, if cautious, wave of investor adoption. While the headline Ethereum ETF flow number is positive, the internal dynamics reveal a competitive landscape where low fees and powerful distribution, exemplified by BlackRock’s ETHA, are winning significant assets. In contrast, Grayscale’s ETHE continues to navigate its transition from a legacy product. This ongoing streak provides critical, early-stage evidence of demand for regulated crypto exposure. As the market for these innovative funds evolves, sustained flow data will remain a key barometer for measuring their integration into the mainstream financial portfolio. FAQs Q1: What does a ‘net inflow’ mean for an Ethereum ETF? A1: A net inflow occurs when the total amount of new money invested into an ETF over a period exceeds the amount withdrawn. For a spot Ethereum ETF, this typically means the fund’s manager must buy more of the underlying Ether to create new shares, directly increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. Q2: Why is there a difference between BlackRock’s ETHA and Grayscale’s ETHE flows? A2: The difference is primarily driven by factors like the fund’s expense ratio (fee), brand recognition, distribution network, and structural history. BlackRock’s ETHA launched with a very competitive fee and the power of the iShares platform, while Grayscale’s ETHE converted from a higher-fee closed-end fund, leading some investors to reallocate. Q3: How does Farside Investors track this data? A3: Farside Investors aggregates daily flow data from publicly available sources and fund issuers. They calculate net flows by estimating the creation and redemption activity of ETF shares, a standard methodology in the traditional ETF industry now applied to crypto ETFs. Q4: Do inflows into the ETF guarantee the price of Ethereum will rise? A4: No, while inflows create direct buying pressure for Ether, the price is influenced by a vast array of other factors including broader market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, technological developments on the Ethereum network, and trading activity on global crypto exchanges. Q5: What is the significance of a ‘five-day streak’ of inflows? A5: In the context of a new financial product, a multi-day trend helps distinguish sustained interest from one-day volatility or launch hype. It suggests a pattern of accumulating interest rather than a fleeting reaction, providing a more reliable signal of early product-market fit.

This pivotal movement, reported by Farside Investors, decisively ended a four-day period of consecutive net inflows, prompting immediate analysis from market observers. The data provides a granular look at investor behavior across the major funds, revealing divergent strategies in a dynamic regulatory landscape. Breaking Down the Bitcoin ETF Outflow Data Farside Investors’ detailed flow data for January 16 presents a clear picture of the day’s activity. The figures highlight a notable divergence among the leading fund providers. While BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) managed to attract a modest $15.1 million in new capital, several other major funds saw substantial redemptions. Consequently, the aggregate effect tipped the scales toward a net negative flow for the entire product category. The specific outflows were led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which recorded a $205.2 million withdrawal. Similarly, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) posted outflows of $90.4 million and $69.4 million, respectively. Interestingly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which had previously dominated outflow figures since its conversion to an ETF, reported a comparatively lower $44.8 million outflow on this day. This shift in distribution suggests a potential rotation or a broadening of the factors influencing investor decisions. Contextualizing the Shift in ETF Flows To understand the importance of this single day’s data, one must consider the broader timeline. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024. The initial launch period saw massive inflows as institutional and retail investors gained a regulated, accessible pathway to Bitcoin exposure. The four-day inflow streak immediately preceding January 16 had buoyed market sentiment, suggesting sustained demand. However, ETF flows are inherently volatile and respond to multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific signals. Potential catalysts for the January 16 outflow include routine portfolio rebalancing by large institutions, profit-taking after a short-term price rally, or reactions to broader financial market conditions, such as movements in treasury yields or equity indices. Analysts consistently note that daily flow data represents a snapshot, not a long-term trend. Therefore, interpreting a single day’s movement requires caution and context. Expert Perspective on Market Mechanics Market structure experts often explain that ETF creation and redemption activity involves Authorized Participants (APs). These large financial institutions create new ETF shares by depositing the underlying asset—in this case, Bitcoin—with the fund issuer. Conversely, they redeem shares by returning them to the issuer in exchange for the underlying Bitcoin. The net flow figure represents the balance between these two processes across all funds. A net outflow indicates that share redemptions exceeded creations, leading to a reduction in the total Bitcoin held collectively by these ETFs, all else being equal. This mechanism directly links to on-chain Bitcoin movement. When an AP redeems shares, the trust must send Bitcoin to the AP, which may then sell it on the open market. This potential selling pressure is a key metric watched by traders. Data from blockchain analytics firms can often corroborate ETF flow data by tracking transfers from known custodian wallets, adding a layer of verifiable evidence to the reported figures. Comparative Analysis of Fund Performance A closer examination of the individual fund flows reveals strategic narratives. BlackRock’s IBIT maintaining a positive inflow, even if small, underscores its position as a market leader with strong brand recognition among traditional investors. Meanwhile, the significant outflow from Fidelity’s FBTC, a similarly trusted name, may point to specific client actions rather than a broad loss of confidence. The changing pattern for Grayscale’s GBTC is particularly noteworthy. In the weeks following its conversion from a closed-end fund, GBTC experienced billions in outflows, primarily attributed to investors exiting at a lower fee structure after being locked in at a premium or discount. The relatively smaller $44.8 million outflow on January 16 could signal that this major wave of exits is subsiding, allowing other funds’ flows to have a more pronounced impact on the daily net figure. The following table summarizes the key flow data for clarity: ETF Provider (Ticker) Net Flow for Jan. 16, 2025 Notable Context BlackRock (IBIT) +$15.1 Million Consistent inflow leader since launch. Fidelity (FBTC) -$205.2 Million Largest single-fund outflow of the day. Bitwise (BITB) -$90.4 Million Notable shift from prior inflow trends. ARK Invest (ARKB) -$69.4 Million Reflects volatility in growth-focused strategies. Grayscale (GBTC) -$44.8 Million Outflow magnitude has decreased significantly from initial post-conversion waves. Total Net Flow -$394.7 Million Ends a four-day net inflow streak. Potential Impacts and Forward Outlook The immediate impact of such an outflow often manifests in market sentiment and short-term price action. Traders monitor this data closely as an indicator of institutional demand. A single day of outflows, however, does not invalidate the structural success of the Bitcoin ETF product class. Since their launch, these funds have collectively gathered tens of billions in assets under management, representing a monumental shift in Bitcoin’s integration with traditional finance. Looking ahead, analysts will watch for whether January 16 marks an isolated event or the beginning of a new pattern. Key factors to monitor include: Fee Structures: Competitive fee wars among providers influence long-term asset gathering. Macro Environment: Interest rate expectations and inflation data affect all risk assets. Bitcoin Halving Cycle: The next Bitcoin block reward halving, anticipated in 2024, historically influences long-term market cycles. Regulatory Developments: Clarity from U.S. regulators on digital asset frameworks can boost or hinder confidence. Ultimately, the true test for Bitcoin spot ETFs will be their performance over quarterly and annual horizons, not daily fluctuations. Their ability to provide transparent, secure, and liquid exposure to Bitcoin for a vast investor base remains their core value proposition. Conclusion The $394.7 million net outflow from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 16, 2025, serves as a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility and the complex factors driving institutional capital movements. While the day ended a positive four-day inflow streak, the data offers nuanced insights into shifting dynamics among the major funds. The event underscores the importance of analyzing ETF flows within a broader context of market structure, investor behavior, and macroeconomic trends. As the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem matures, such data points will continue to provide critical, real-time indicators of sentiment in the evolving intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional finance. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed from an ETF exceeds the value of shares created. For a spot Bitcoin ETF, this typically means the fund’s managers must sell some of the Bitcoin held in custody to return assets to investors redeeming their shares. Q2: Why did Grayscale’s GBTC have a smaller outflow compared to previous weeks? Many analysts believe the initial, massive wave of outflows from GBTC was driven by investors who were previously trapped in the closed-end fund structure, often selling to realize losses for tax purposes or moving to lower-fee competitors. That initial pressure may be easing. Q3: Can a single day of ETF outflows impact the Bitcoin price? Yes, it can contribute to short-term selling pressure. If the Bitcoin supporting the redeemed shares is sold on the open market by the Authorized Participants, it increases the available supply for sale, which can push the price down, all else being equal. Q4: Is Farside Investors the only source for this ETF flow data? No, while Farside is a widely cited and trusted source, other data firms like Bloomberg and ETF.com also track and publish this information. Analysts often cross-reference data for accuracy. Q5: How should long-term investors interpret daily ETF flow data? Long-term investors should view daily flows as noise within a larger trend. They are more indicative of short-term trader activity and institutional rebalancing than a fundamental shift in the asset’s long-term value proposition. Sustained multi-week or monthly trends hold more significance.

This analysis examines the fundamental and technical factors that could determine BCH’s market performance, drawing from historical data, current adoption metrics, and verifiable blockchain developments. Market analysts particularly focus on Bitcoin Cash’s unique value proposition as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, especially as global payment networks undergo significant transformation. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Landscape Bitcoin Cash enters 2026 with several established advantages in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The network consistently processes transactions with lower fees than its Bitcoin counterpart, according to blockchain data from 2024. Furthermore, merchant adoption continues expanding across multiple continents, particularly in regions seeking affordable digital payment solutions. Technical analysis of BCH’s price history reveals established support levels that provide crucial context for future projections. Market sentiment toward Bitcoin Cash often correlates with broader cryptocurrency cycles, yet the asset demonstrates distinct characteristics during market fluctuations. Several measurable factors will influence Bitcoin Cash’s price trajectory in 2026. Network upgrade implementations, including potential smart contract enhancements, could significantly impact developer activity. Additionally, regulatory developments in major economies will affect institutional adoption rates. Historical volatility patterns suggest that Bitcoin Cash typically experiences heightened price movements during quarterly contract expirations on major exchanges. The relationship between Bitcoin’s dominance index and alternative cryptocurrency performance remains a critical analytical framework for predicting BCH behavior. Expert Perspectives on 2026 Price Ranges Financial institutions and blockchain analysts present varied but evidence-based projections for Bitcoin Cash in 2026. For instance, recent technical analysis reports reference Fibonacci retracement levels from previous market cycles. Meanwhile, fundamental analysts emphasize on-chain metrics like active address growth and transaction volume trends. The consensus among technical analysts suggests that Bitcoin Cash must maintain specific support zones to sustain bullish momentum. Conversely, breaking below established technical levels could trigger different market scenarios that analysts continuously monitor. Bitcoin Cash 2027 Forecast: Adoption Versus Competition The 2027 outlook for Bitcoin Cash involves complex interactions between technological development and market competition. Payment processor integrations announced throughout 2025 will reach full implementation, potentially increasing real-world utility. However, competing payment-focused cryptocurrencies continue evolving with their own technological improvements. Network effect becomes increasingly crucial as cryptocurrency payment adoption reaches potential inflection points. Bitcoin Cash’s development roadmap includes scalability enhancements that could differentiate its value proposition from both traditional payment systems and newer blockchain projects. Market analysts particularly watch Bitcoin Cash’s performance relative to other major payment cryptocurrencies. Comparative transaction speed and cost data from 2024-2025 provides benchmarks for evaluating competitive advantages. Furthermore, cross-border remittance partnerships established in developing economies could drive substantial volume increases. The technological architecture of Bitcoin Cash, with its emphasis on larger block sizes, faces ongoing tests as transaction volumes potentially approach new thresholds. These technical limits will influence both network reliability and investor confidence throughout the forecast period. Institutional Factors Influencing 2027 Valuation Institutional cryptocurrency adoption trends significantly impact Bitcoin Cash’s potential 2027 valuation. Investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and regulated custody solutions create new access points for traditional investors. Regulatory clarity emerging from legislative processes in multiple jurisdictions reduces uncertainty for institutional participants. Additionally, corporate treasury adoption of cryptocurrencies for payment systems and balance sheet diversification introduces new demand dynamics. These institutional factors interact with retail market sentiment to create complex price discovery mechanisms that analysts must carefully evaluate. The 2028-2030 Horizon: Long-Term Technical and Fundamental Drivers Projecting Bitcoin Cash prices toward 2030 requires analyzing both cyclical patterns and structural market evolution. Historical cryptocurrency market cycles suggest potential periodicity in price peaks and troughs, though each cycle demonstrates unique characteristics. The Bitcoin halving event scheduled for 2028 will likely influence the entire cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin Cash’s valuation. Long-term adoption curves for digital payment systems provide contextual frameworks for estimating Bitcoin Cash’s market penetration potential. Technological innovations in layer-two solutions and interoperability protocols could further enhance Bitcoin Cash’s utility beyond its current capabilities. Demographic shifts in cryptocurrency adoption present another crucial consideration for long-term projections. Younger generations increasingly familiar with digital assets may drive different usage patterns than early adopters. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations continue influencing institutional investment decisions toward cryptocurrencies with specific technical characteristics. Bitcoin Cash’s energy consumption profile relative to proof-of-work alternatives remains a subject of ongoing analysis and technological development. These multifaceted factors collectively shape the probability distribution of potential price outcomes through the decade’s end. Quantitative Models and Scenario Analysis Financial analysts employ various quantitative models to project Bitcoin Cash prices through 2030. Time-series analysis incorporating volatility clustering and mean reversion characteristics provides statistical frameworks for price forecasting. Monte Carlo simulations generate probability distributions for potential price outcomes based on historical volatility and correlation data. Furthermore, network value models relating price to measurable adoption metrics like transaction count and active addresses offer fundamentally-grounded valuation approaches. These analytical methods consistently emphasize the inherent uncertainty in long-term cryptocurrency price predictions while identifying key variables that drive potential outcomes. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction Summary 2026-2030 Year Key Drivers Potential Scenarios 2026 Regulatory developments, network upgrades, Bitcoin market correlation Consolidation within established ranges or breakout based on adoption metrics 2027 Payment integration expansion, competitive landscape evolution Significant movement based on real-world utility milestones 2028-2030 Halving event impacts, generational adoption shifts, technological innovation Potential for exponential growth or stabilization based on market maturity The $1000 Question: Analyzing Probability Factors The possibility of Bitcoin Cash reaching $1000 involves specific technical and fundamental prerequisites. Market capitalization calculations indicate the required valuation increase relative to current levels and circulating supply. Historical resistance levels and psychological price barriers create technical hurdles that Bitcoin Cash must overcome. Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization would need to expand significantly to support such valuations across multiple assets. The $1000 price point represents not just a numerical threshold but a symbolic milestone that could influence market psychology and media coverage. Several measurable conditions could increase the probability of Bitcoin Cash achieving $1000 valuation. Sustained increases in daily transaction volume would demonstrate growing utility beyond speculative trading. Major payment processor integrations reaching critical mass could drive consistent demand unrelated to market sentiment. Technological innovations successfully addressing scalability while maintaining security would strengthen the fundamental investment thesis. Additionally, regulatory frameworks that legitimize cryptocurrency payments without stifling innovation could accelerate adoption curves. These factors interact in complex ways that defy simple linear projection but establish boundary conditions for potential outcomes. Risk Factors and Alternative Scenarios Realistic Bitcoin Cash price prediction must acknowledge significant risk factors and alternative scenarios. Technological vulnerabilities or successful attacks on the network could undermine confidence and valuation. Regulatory crackdowns in major markets could restrict access and utility, depressing prices. Furthermore, superior competing technologies could capture market share in the payment cryptocurrency segment. Macroeconomic conditions including interest rate environments and traditional market performance influence cryptocurrency valuations through risk appetite channels. These risk factors necessitate probabilistic thinking rather than deterministic prediction when considering long-term price targets like $1000. Conclusion Bitcoin Cash price prediction for 2026 through 2030 involves analyzing interconnected technological, regulatory, and market dynamics. The potential for BCH to reach $1000 depends on multiple factors aligning favorably, including adoption acceleration, technological robustness, and supportive market conditions. While historical patterns and current fundamentals provide analytical frameworks, cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile and unpredictable. Investors should consider Bitcoin Cash’s unique value proposition as electronic cash alongside rigorous risk assessment when evaluating long-term price projections. The evolving cryptocurrency landscape will undoubtedly present both opportunities and challenges as Bitcoin Cash approaches these forecast horizons.

Now, they are advocating for Coinbase to get back on board with lawmakers after the exchange’s CEO said it “can’t support the way the law is written.” According to a source close to the administration, the White House is prepared to walk away from the legislation if Coinbase does not return to negotiations and agree to a yield framework that satisfies banking interests and brings all parties back to consensus. On Wednesday through Thursday, senior administration officials, lawmakers, and industry figures were prepared to vote on the nearly 300-page Clarity Act. Coinbase’s word that it would not be part of its supporters forced the committee to postpone the vote and hold more discussions, much to the disappointment of the Oval Office. White House is angry over Coinbase’s surprise withdrawal Speaking to Crypto In America journalist Eleanor Terrett, the source said Coinbase made a “unilateral” move that blindsided the White House and other stakeholders. The White House has privately called Coinbase’s action a “rug pull” against the administration and the crypto industry, according to the source. Washington has blasted the crypto exchange for trying to “dictate the fate of industry-wide legislation,” reiterating that the bill was negotiated by a coalition of lawmakers, regulators, and market participants. “This is President Trump’s bill at the end of the day, not Brian Armstrong’s,” the source said. President Trump has been very supportive of digital asset innovation since his return to the US top seat, and his administration backed the House version of the Clarity Act earlier this year. But the POTUS’s camp is now willing to let the bill fail rather than accept “pressure from a single company.” Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong defended his company’s decision in a CNBC interview on Thursday, saying the firm had identified provisions that would harm consumers. “The high-level principle is that you can’t really have banks come in and try to kill their competition at the expense of the American consumer,” he told the news outlet. Armstrong had first publicized Coinbase’s opposition in a post on X late Wednesday, writing: “Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written. This version would be materially worse than the current status quo. We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill.” As Cryptopolitan reported on Friday, he explained that traditional savings accounts pay about 14 basis points on average, and stablecoin rewards that can reach 3.8%, which is an opportunity for banks to innovate with no risks to their business models. Months of discussions halted by one company Congressional staff had reportedly worked with industry representatives for months to craft the Clarity Act, meant to define regulatory boundaries for trading, custody, issuance, and decentralized finance. Coinbase, now publicly traded on Nasdaq with a market value near $70 billion, helped finance a network of political action committees that spent more than $130 million during the 2024 election cycle to back crypto-friendly candidates. Some netizens think the support may have gotten the company its loud influence on crypto-related bills. “Coinbase alone does not speak for the crypto industry and should not have a stranglehold on legislation. I also do not believe that the yield on stablecoins should be the deciding factor. This bill, at its core, has nothing to do with yield on stablecoins,” said one proponent of the market structure bill on X. When asked whether talks had resumed after the surprise withdrawal, Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s head of US policy, said the pause was a “shock to the system.” “We want to be respectful of the fact that blood, sweat, and tears have gone into this bill. I can’t stress enough how impressive it has been for the Senate staff and the Senators themselves who met for hundreds of hours at the member level to discuss these details…We want to make sure we are at the table working through this details, that we are going to get this done, and I don’t think anyone is walking away, Democrat, Republican, and I think even the industry is still absolutely united,” she said in an interview with Crypto In America.

This strategic acquisition, confirmed by corporate filings in Indianapolis, Indiana, on April 2, 2025, follows the company’s earlier pledge to accept BTC payments and hold all received cryptocurrency. Consequently, this action transforms the restaurant operator into a notable participant in the corporate digital asset treasury landscape. Steak ‘n Shake Bitcoin Strategy: From Payments to Treasury Reserve The recent $10 million Bitcoin purchase represents a significant escalation of Steak ‘n Shake’s public cryptocurrency strategy. Initially, the company announced it would begin accepting Bitcoin for customer payments. Importantly, the firm stated it would not immediately convert these crypto payments to fiat currency. Instead, management planned to hold them as a long-term strategic reserve on its balance sheet. Therefore, this latest direct market purchase of $10 million in BTC demonstrates a committed, multi-pronged approach to Bitcoin accumulation. Corporate treasury adoption of Bitcoin has evolved through distinct phases. First, pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla made headline-grabbing allocations. Subsequently, a second wave focused on payment integration and balance sheet hedging emerged. Steak ‘n Shake’s strategy uniquely combines both approaches. The company now sources Bitcoin directly from operational revenue and through deliberate treasury allocation. This dual-path method potentially mitigates price volatility risks associated with a single acquisition method. Analyzing the Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Timeline The journey of Bitcoin into corporate treasuries provides essential context for Steak ‘n Shake’s decision. Notably, MicroStrategy began its aggressive accumulation strategy in August 2020. Since then, dozens of publicly traded companies have followed, albeit with varying levels of commitment. For a traditional consumer brand like Steak ‘n Shake, this move signals a maturation of the thesis beyond the technology sector. Several key factors typically drive these corporate decisions: Inflation Hedging: Companies seek assets uncorrelated to traditional monetary policy. Long-Term Store of Value: Bitcoin’s finite supply contrasts with expansive fiat currency systems. Strategic Differentiation: Adoption can attract new customer demographics and signal innovation. Operational Integration: Using Bitcoin for payments tests future financial infrastructure. Steak ‘n Shake’s announcement explicitly connects its payment system to its treasury strategy. This creates a closed-loop ecosystem where cryptocurrency circulates within the brand’s economic sphere. Furthermore, holding customer-paid Bitcoin aligns corporate and customer interests in the asset’s long-term performance. Financial Implications and Balance Sheet Considerations From an accounting perspective, Steak ‘n Shake’s Bitcoin holdings introduce specific considerations. Under current U.S. accounting standards, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are typically classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. This classification requires impairment testing if the market price falls below the carrying value. However, upward revaluations are not recognized until the asset is sold. Therefore, the $10 million purchase will appear on the balance sheet at cost, subject to potential impairment charges. This accounting treatment creates a notable asymmetry. Significant price increases do not boost quarterly earnings, while declines can trigger impairment losses. Nevertheless, companies like MicroStrategy have maintained this approach, prioritizing long-term holding over short-term earnings impact. Steak ‘n Shake’s management appears to embrace a similar long-term horizon, viewing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve rather than a trading asset. The following table compares recent corporate Bitcoin purchases in the consumer sector: Company Sector Approximate BTC Purchase Announcement Date Stated Strategy Steak ‘n Shake Fast Food / Restaurants $10 Million April 2025 Treasury Reserve & Payment Acceptance A publicly traded gaming company (2024) Entertainment $25 Million Q3 2024 Inflation Hedge & Diversification A regional retail chain (2024) Consumer Retail $5 Million November 2024 Technology Investment & Brand Positioning Market Impact and Industry Reaction The announcement immediately generated discussion among financial analysts and industry observers. Many experts highlight the symbolic importance of a mainstream, legacy brand making such an allocation. While technology companies often lead innovation adoption, consumer-facing brands like Steak ‘n Shake operate closer to the everyday economy. Their embrace of Bitcoin potentially normalizes cryptocurrency for a broader audience. Market reaction also extends to Bitcoin’s perceived role as a corporate asset. Each public company addition to the Bitcoin treasury club adds validation to the underlying investment thesis. Moreover, it creates a growing cohort of businesses with aligned interests in the development of supportive regulation and infrastructure. This collective advocacy could influence future policy decisions regarding digital asset accounting, custody, and disclosure. However, critics consistently point to Bitcoin’s price volatility as a primary risk. Quarterly earnings could experience unnecessary volatility due to impairment charges. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty remains a concern for all corporations holding digital assets. Steak ‘n Shake’s management presumably conducted thorough risk assessment before proceeding. Their decision to proceed indicates a calculated acceptance of these risks in pursuit of potential long-term strategic benefits. The Practical Mechanics of Payment Integration Beyond the treasury purchase, the operational aspect of accepting Bitcoin payments presents its own challenges and opportunities. Steak ‘n Shake must implement a point-of-sale solution that can securely process Bitcoin transactions. This likely involves a partnership with a established cryptocurrency payment processor. These processors typically instantly convert the Bitcoin to fiat at the time of sale, shielding the merchant from price fluctuations during the transaction. Steak ‘n Shake’s model differs significantly. The company intends to retain the Bitcoin received. Therefore, it must manage private key security, a non-trivial operational responsibility. Best practices involve using qualified custodians or institutional-grade cold storage solutions. The company’s willingness to undertake this operational complexity underscores the strategic nature of its commitment. It is not merely a marketing gimmick but a foundational shift in how it views a portion of its assets. This approach could also influence customer behavior. Patrons who own Bitcoin might be incentivized to spend it at Steak ‘n Shake, knowing the company becomes a long-term holder alongside them. This creates a novel form of brand alignment and community. Furthermore, it introduces Bitcoin as a practical medium of exchange for a tangible good—a hamburger and milkshake—moving beyond abstract investment discussions. Conclusion Steak ‘n Shake’s $10 million Bitcoin purchase represents a consequential step in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency. By combining direct treasury allocation with a customer payment integration strategy, the company has crafted a multifaceted approach to Bitcoin exposure. This move provides real-world evidence of Bitcoin’s evolving role from speculative asset to potential corporate reserve asset. While risks related to volatility and regulation persist, Steak ‘n Shake’s decision reflects a growing trend among diverse businesses to explore digital assets as a component of long-term financial strategy. The success of this Steak ‘n Shake Bitcoin initiative will undoubtedly influence other consumer brands considering similar pathways into the digital economy. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin did Steak ‘n Shake purchase? Steak ‘n Shake purchased an additional $10 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This follows its earlier strategy to hold all Bitcoin received from customer payments. Q2: Why would a fast-food company buy Bitcoin? Companies like Steak ‘n Shake may allocate to Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve, a potential hedge against inflation, and to integrate innovative payment technologies that align with future financial systems. Q3: Can I pay for my meal at Steak ‘n Shake with Bitcoin? According to the company’s announcements, Steak ‘n Shake plans to accept Bitcoin for payments. The specific rollout timeline and store locations for this feature should be confirmed directly with the company. Q4: How does this purchase affect Steak ‘n Shake’s financial statements? Under current accounting rules, the Bitcoin will be held as an intangible asset on the balance sheet at its purchase cost. The company may need to record impairment charges if Bitcoin’s market value falls below its carrying value, but increases in value are not recorded until sale. Q5: Is this a common practice for restaurants? While a growing number of companies across sectors hold Bitcoin, it remains relatively uncommon for major fast-food chains. Steak ‘n Shake’s move places it among the early adopters in the restaurant industry exploring corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy.

57234583,658099,1768629603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57234583.jpeg,Belarus Opens Door To Crypto Banks With New Presidential Decree,https://bitcoinist.com/belarus-opens-door-to-crypto-banks-with-new-presidential-decree/,"Belarus took a major step on January 16, 2026, when President Aleksandr Lukashenko signed Decree No. 19 to set rules for so-called “cryptobanks.” The move creates a clear legal spot for companies that want to mix token services with classic banking and payment work. Decree Defines Cryptobanks And Rules According to the decree, a cryptobank is a joint-stock company that may carry out token operations alongside banking, payment and other financial services. Reports have disclosed that these firms must be residents of the Belarus High-Tech Park (HTP) and will be listed in a special register kept by the National Bank. The new document ties cryptobank status to HTP residency, which aims to concentrate activity inside a known tech zone. That requirement also means the HTP’s rules will play a role in daily oversight. Requirements For Market Entry Based on reports from regulators, cryptobanks will face dual supervision: oversight from both the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus and the HTP’s governing bodies. This twin structure is meant to let token services grow while keeping closer control of financial risks. Officials say cryptobanks will follow many of the rules that apply to non-bank credit and financial organizations, including standards for capital, risk controls and anti-money-laundering checks. That suggests applicants will need to show robust compliance systems before being accepted into the register. Belarus: Short-Term Business Plans National Bank officials said that the decree could be followed by real market steps fast. Aliaksandr Yahorau, the First Deputy Chairman of the National Bank, said Belarus could see its first operating cryptobank within six months after laws and rules are aligned. He added that cryptobanks may be able to issue loans secured by cryptocurrency, provide payment cards linked to crypto accounts, and allow self-employed people to receive salaries in tokens. What Comes Next For Belarus The decree builds on earlier efforts to attract tech and crypto business to Belarus, and it clearly signals a state interest in bringing token activity under formal control. The next steps will include drafting implementing rules, creating the special registry at the National Bank, and deciding capital and licensing thresholds for applicants.

This analysis provides a data-driven, long-term forecast for RNDR, examining the fundamental technological adoption, market dynamics, and macroeconomic factors that will shape its trajectory over the next six years. The decentralized GPU rendering marketplace has evolved from a niche solution to a vital infrastructure component for industries ranging from Hollywood visual effects to architectural visualization and artificial intelligence training. Render (RNDR) Price Prediction: Foundation and Market Context Launched by Jules Urbach’s OTOY in 2017, the Render Network fundamentally reimagines digital rendering. The platform connects users needing GPU power with providers who have idle capacity, creating a decentralized marketplace. Consequently, RNDR tokens facilitate all transactions on this peer-to-peer network. The network’s migration to the Solana blockchain in late 2023 marked a pivotal upgrade, drastically improving transaction speed and reducing costs. This technological shift provides essential infrastructure for scaling, a critical factor for any long-term RNDR price prediction. Market analysts from firms like Messari and CoinShares frequently highlight Render’s unique position at the intersection of blockchain and the high-growth digital creation economy. Current Adoption Metrics and Network Growth Render’s adoption provides concrete evidence of its utility. According to public network data, the platform has completed millions of rendering jobs for major studios and independent creators. Furthermore, partnerships with industry-standard software like OctaneRender create a powerful ecosystem lock-in. The network’s total value locked (TVL) and quarterly job volume serve as key performance indicators. These metrics, rather than pure speculation, form the basis for a rational RNDR price prediction. For instance, increased adoption by AI companies for model training could represent a new, massive addressable market beyond traditional media. Analyzing Key Drivers for RNDR’s 2026-2030 Trajectory Several interdependent factors will primarily determine the Render token’s price movement through the end of the decade. First, the exponential growth in demand for GPU compute, driven by AI, metaverse development, and high-fidelity rendering, creates a powerful tailwind. Second, the network’s ability to scale efficiently and maintain competitive pricing against centralized cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud is crucial. Third, broader cryptocurrency market cycles and regulatory developments for utility tokens will inevitably influence investor sentiment. Finally, the execution of the Render Network’s roadmap, including proposed features like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs, will impact its perceived future value. GPU Compute Demand: The global shortage of high-end GPUs and rising cloud costs benefit decentralized alternatives. Network Scalability: Solana’s infrastructure must support exponentially more transactions without congestion. Market Sentiment: RNDR remains correlated, though not perfectly, with major crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Roadmap Execution: Timely delivery of promised technical upgrades builds trust and utility. Render RNDR Price Prediction: Year-by-Year Forecast Model (2026-2030) The following table presents a scenario-based forecast model. It synthesizes historical volatility, projected network usage growth, and analyst consensus from institutional reports. Importantly, these figures represent potential ranges based on current data and should not be considered financial advice. They assume continued technological execution and no catastrophic regulatory intervention in the decentralized compute sector. Year Conservative Scenario Base Case Scenario Bullish Scenario Primary Catalyst 2026 $12 – $18 $18 – $28 $28 – $40 Mainstream AI studio adoption 2027 $20 – $30 $30 – $45 $45 – $65 Integration with major 3D software suites 2028 $35 – $50 $50 – $75 $75 – $110 Network effects and significant market share capture 2029 $50 – $70 $70 – $100 $100 – $150 Ubiquity in real-time rendering for immersive media 2030 $65 – $90 $90 – $130 $130 – $200+ Establishment as core Web3 infrastructure Expert Insights and Comparative Analysis Industry experts emphasize the total addressable market (TAM) as a core valuation metric. “The cloud rendering market alone is projected to exceed $20 billion by 2030,” notes a senior analyst from a fintech research firm. “Render’s model captures value from this and adjacent AI training markets.” Comparatively, other decentralized compute projects like Akash Network (AKT) operate in a broader cloud marketplace, while Render’s specialized focus provides deeper vertical integration. This specialization could command a premium valuation multiple if execution succeeds. Technical analysts also monitor on-chain data, such as token holder concentration and exchange flow, to gauge long-term investor conviction versus short-term trading activity. Potential Risks and Challenges to the Forecast Any long-term RNDR price prediction must acknowledge substantial risks. Technological competition is fierce, with both traditional cloud giants and new blockchain projects vying for market share. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding the classification of utility tokens persists in major economies like the United States and the European Union. Additionally, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency asset class means macroeconomic events, such as interest rate shifts or geopolitical tensions, can cause severe price dislocations unrelated to Render’s fundamentals. Finally, execution risk remains; any failure to scale the network or a critical security vulnerability could severely impact trust and token value. Conclusion This Render (RNDR) price prediction for 2026 through 2030 outlines a growth trajectory fundamentally tied to the network’s real-world utility and adoption. The expansion of the digital creation economy, coupled with rising demand for efficient GPU compute, positions RNDR as a potentially critical infrastructure token. While price targets provide a framework, the ultimate valuation will depend on the Render Network’s execution against its roadmap, its competitive positioning, and the broader maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Investors and observers should prioritize monitoring network usage metrics, partnership announcements, and technological milestones over short-term price fluctuations to assess the long-term health of the project. FAQs Q1: What is the main utility of the RNDR token? The RNDR token is the exclusive medium of exchange on the Render Network. Clients use it to pay for GPU rendering jobs, and node operators earn it for providing their spare computational power. It functions as a utility token within this specific ecosystem.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Have Made Profit Transactions To Exchanges In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the exchange deposit transactions of Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs). Related Reading: XRP In A ‘Super Cycle’? SuperTrend Suggests Another Story STHs include the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. They make up for one of the two main sides of the network divided on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as long-term holders (LTHs). Historically, the STH cohort has proven to represent the weak hands of the market, who easily react to market volatility. In contrast, LTHs include the diamond hands of the sector. Bitcoin has witnessed a recovery rally recently, so, considering the track record of STHs, some selling from them is likely to have occurred. One way to track distribution from the group is through its exchange inflow data. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the exchange deposit transactions that Bitcoin STHs have made over the last couple of months. In the graph, the STH exchange inflows are shown separately for profit and loss transactions, based on whether holders held an unrealized gain or loss before sending the tokens to exchanges. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 24-hour sum of the STH exchange deposit transactions in profit has shot up as the cryptocurrency has gone through its rally, reaching a high of 41,800 BTC. Meanwhile, loss exchange inflows have shrunken, falling to a low of 1,800 BTC. Thus, it would appear that selling focus from STHs has largely shifted to profit-taking. Though, while some STHs may be harvesting profits, the cohort has a whole is still in a state of net unrealized loss as Bitcoin is trading below the STH Realized Profit, as highlighted by the analyst in another X post. The “Realized Price” is an on-chain metric that measures the average cost basis of Bitcoin investors or addresses as a whole. The STH version specifically tracks the break-even level of the supply purchased within the past 155 days.

This transaction, occurring just nine hours before reporting, represents one of the most notable institutional acquisitions of 2025 and provides critical insights into evolving market dynamics. Furthermore, this purchase follows a pattern of accumulating behavior from similar addresses, suggesting a coordinated strategy rather than an isolated event. Bitmain ETH purchase reveals institutional accumulation pattern Blockchain analysts identified the transaction through on-chain tracking tools that monitor large wallet movements. The purchase occurred at approximately $3,270 per ETH, representing a slight premium to the market price at the time of execution. Consequently, this substantial acquisition immediately impacted market sentiment, with derivatives data showing increased bullish positioning following the news. Moreover, the transaction’s timing coincided with broader market consolidation, suggesting strategic accumulation during price stability periods. Lookonchain, the blockchain analytics platform that reported the transaction, has established credibility through accurate wallet identification methodologies. The firm correlates wallet activity with known exchange addresses and previous transaction patterns to establish probable ownership. Additionally, their reporting includes verification through multiple blockchain explorers, ensuring data accuracy before publication. This meticulous approach provides the transparency necessary for market participants to make informed decisions based on reliable information. Ethereum accumulation trends among institutional investors Institutional interest in Ethereum has accelerated throughout 2025, driven by several fundamental developments. The network’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus has reduced its environmental impact by approximately 99.95%, addressing previous concerns about energy consumption. Simultaneously, Ethereum’s scaling solutions have achieved significant adoption, with layer-2 networks now processing more transactions than the base chain. These technological advancements have created a compelling investment thesis for institutions seeking exposure to blockchain infrastructure with real-world utility. The cryptocurrency market has witnessed increasing institutional participation since 2023, with several notable trends emerging: Exchange-traded product growth: Global ETH ETP assets under management surpassed $45 billion in early 2025 Corporate treasury allocations: Multiple publicly traded companies added Ethereum to balance sheets following Bitcoin adoption Infrastructure investment: Venture capital flowing into Ethereum ecosystem projects exceeded $8 billion in 2024 Regulatory clarity: Improved framework definitions in major jurisdictions reduced institutional adoption barriers These developments collectively created an environment conducive to large-scale accumulation by sophisticated market participants. The Bitmain-linked transaction fits within this broader institutional narrative, representing continued confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition despite short-term market volatility. Historical context of Bitmain’s cryptocurrency involvement Bitmain Technologies, founded in 2013, initially gained prominence as the world’s largest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware. The company’s Antminer series dominated the Bitcoin mining industry for years, controlling significant market share. However, following Bitcoin’s 2020 halving and subsequent mining profitability challenges, Bitmain diversified its strategy. The company gradually increased its cryptocurrency treasury holdings while expanding into artificial intelligence chips and other semiconductor applications. Previous blockchain analysis reveals that addresses associated with Bitmain have accumulated cryptocurrencies systematically since 2022. The company’s investment strategy appears focused on established assets with clear utility cases, particularly those supporting the broader blockchain infrastructure ecosystem. Ethereum’s position as the primary platform for decentralized applications, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized finance makes it a natural allocation choice for technology-focused investors like Bitmain. Recent Large Ethereum Purchases by Institutional Entities Entity Date ETH Amount Approximate Value Source Exchange Bitmain-linked address March 2025 20,000 ETH $65.4 million Kraken European Asset Manager February 2025 15,000 ETH $48.1 million Coinbase Institutional Asian Technology Fund January 2025 12,500 ETH $39.5 million Binance US Family Office December 2024 8,000 ETH $24.8 million Gemini Market impact and analytical perspectives The immediate market response to the reported transaction included a 2.3% price increase in Ethereum over the following six hours, though broader market movements contributed to this movement. More significantly, options market data revealed increased demand for Ethereum call options with strike prices between $3,500 and $4,000 expiring in the second quarter of 2025. This derivatives activity suggests that sophisticated traders interpreted the Bitmain-linked purchase as a bullish signal for medium-term price appreciation. Market analysts emphasize that large purchases from identifiable entities often create positive sentiment cascades. Retail investors frequently monitor whale activity through blockchain explorers and analytics platforms, using this data to inform their own positioning decisions. Therefore, transparent reporting of institutional accumulation can create self-reinforcing bullish cycles, particularly when accompanied by supportive fundamental developments. However, analysts also caution against overinterpreting single transactions, noting that market dynamics remain influenced by macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments. Kraken’s role as the source exchange for this transaction highlights the platform’s continued importance for institutional cryptocurrency trading. The exchange has developed specialized services for large-volume traders, including over-the-counter desks with personalized liquidity solutions. These institutional offerings have positioned Kraken as a preferred venue for discreet large transactions, with the exchange reportedly handling over $12 billion in institutional volume during the first quarter of 2025 alone. Technical analysis of Ethereum’s current market position Ethereum’s technical chart structure presented an accumulation opportunity at the time of the Bitmain-linked purchase. The cryptocurrency had consolidated between $3,100 and $3,300 for approximately three weeks following a rally from January lows near $2,400. This consolidation represented a healthy pause within a broader uptrend, allowing the market to absorb previous gains while establishing support levels. Large buyers often target these consolidation phases to accumulate positions without significantly impacting prices through slippage. On-chain metrics provided additional context for the accumulation decision. Ethereum’s network realized profit/loss ratio had returned to neutral levels following a period of profit-taking in February. Meanwhile, the percentage of ETH supply in profit remained above 85%, indicating strong underlying holder confidence. These metrics, combined with reduced exchange balances and increasing staking participation, created favorable conditions for strategic accumulation by long-term oriented investors. Regulatory environment and institutional adoption The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency investments has evolved significantly since 2023, with clearer frameworks emerging in major jurisdictions. The United States approved multiple spot Ethereum exchange-traded products in late 2024, following the earlier approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Similarly, European Union markets implemented the comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, providing legal certainty for institutional participants. These regulatory advancements reduced compliance uncertainty for traditional financial entities considering cryptocurrency allocations. Institutional adoption typically follows a predictable pattern, beginning with treasury allocation and progressing to more sophisticated investment strategies. The Bitmain-linked Ethereum purchase represents a middle phase in this adoption curve, where technology companies with cryptocurrency expertise expand their strategic holdings. The next phase likely involves traditional asset managers and pension funds allocating to Ethereum through regulated vehicles, potentially creating additional demand pressure throughout 2025 and 2026. Industry experts note that institutional cryptocurrency investment decisions increasingly incorporate environmental, social, and governance considerations. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus directly addresses environmental concerns that previously limited institutional participation. The network’s energy consumption now compares favorably with traditional financial systems, with recent estimates suggesting the entire Ethereum network uses less electricity than the country of Uruguay. This environmental efficiency has become a significant factor in investment committee discussions at sustainability-focused institutions. Conclusion The Bitmain-linked address purchase of 20,000 ETH for $65.4 million represents a significant data point in cryptocurrency market analysis. This transaction highlights continued institutional confidence in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition and long-term growth potential. Furthermore, the purchase aligns with broader accumulation patterns among sophisticated investors throughout early 2025, suggesting coordinated positioning ahead of anticipated network developments and regulatory milestones. Market participants should monitor similar large transactions while maintaining perspective on the multifaceted factors influencing cryptocurrency valuations. The Bitmain ETH purchase ultimately reinforces Ethereum’s position as a core institutional allocation within diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. FAQs Q1: How do analysts link cryptocurrency addresses to specific companies like Bitmain? Blockchain analysts use multiple methodologies including transaction pattern analysis, exchange withdrawal tracking, and wallet clustering techniques. They correlate addresses with known company wallets through historical transactions, exchange interactions, and sometimes through unintentional disclosures in regulatory filings or corporate communications. Q2: Why would Bitmain purchase Ethereum rather than just mine it? While Bitmain manufactures mining hardware, Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022, eliminating traditional mining. Purchasing ETH directly provides exposure to the asset’s potential appreciation and allows participation in staking rewards, which currently offer approximately 3-4% annual yield on staked Ethereum. Q3: How significant is a $65.4 million purchase in the context of Ethereum’s total market? Ethereum’s market capitalization exceeded $400 billion in March 2025, making this purchase approximately 0.016% of total market value. While not market-moving by itself, such transactions signal institutional sentiment and often precede similar accumulation by other large investors. Q4: What risks do institutional investors consider when allocating to Ethereum? Primary considerations include regulatory uncertainty, technological execution risk (particularly regarding scaling solutions), competitive pressure from alternative smart contract platforms, market volatility, custody solutions, and the evolving staking economics following Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. Q5: How does this purchase affect ordinary Ethereum investors? While direct price impact is typically limited, institutional accumulation generally supports price stability and reduces volatility over time. Additionally, institutional participation often leads to improved infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and mainstream adoption, which can benefit all ecosystem participants through network effects and increased utility.

57234906,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262428,1768630511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Crypto Fraud: Devastating $13.8M Scheme Leads to Prison Sentences in Landmark Appeal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-crypto-fraud-sentencing-appeal/,"BitcoinWorld AI Crypto Fraud: Devastating $13.8M Scheme Leads to Prison Sentences in Landmark Appeal In a landmark ruling that underscores the escalating global crackdown on digital asset fraud, a South Korean appeals court has upheld prison sentences for perpetrators of a sophisticated $13.8 million AI crypto fraud. This decisive legal action, reported by Yonhap News, sends a powerful message to would-be scammers exploiting the convergence of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency markets. Anatomy of the $13.8M AI Crypto Fraud The convicted group orchestrated a complex scheme that defrauded investors of approximately 19 billion won. They specifically targeted individuals by promoting a seemingly revolutionary investment opportunity. The perpetrators claimed their proprietary AI-powered computer system could generate guaranteed, high-frequency profits. This system allegedly exploited minute price differences, known as arbitrage, between various global cryptocurrency exchanges. However, investigators later revealed the operation as a classic Ponzi structure. Consequently, the promised AI technology was either non-existent or grossly misrepresented. Early investors received payouts funded solely by capital from newer victims, creating a facade of legitimacy. This fraudulent activity continued until the scheme inevitably collapsed under its own weight, leaving numerous investors with significant losses. The Legal Reckoning and Appeal Process The initial trial resulted in convictions and prison terms for the key organizers. Following this, the defendants pursued an appeal, likely challenging the severity of their sentences or the specifics of the fraud charges. The appellate court’s recent decision to uphold and potentially reinforce the original sentences marks a critical juncture. This outcome demonstrates the judiciary’s growing sophistication in handling technologically complex financial crimes. Legal experts note that such cases often hinge on proving deliberate deception. Prosecutors successfully demonstrated that the group’s claims about their AI trading bot’s capabilities were knowingly false. Evidence presented included internal communications, financial audits tracing the flow of funds, and testimony from defrauded investors. The court’s firm stance in the appeal reinforces a zero-tolerance policy for fraud disguised as technological innovation. Expert Analysis: A Warning for the Crypto Industry Financial compliance analysts point to this case as a textbook example of “technobabble” fraud. Scammers increasingly use buzzwords like “AI,” “machine learning,” and “algorithmic trading” to lend credibility to otherwise unsustainable schemes. The promise of exploiting arbitrage is particularly seductive, as it suggests a low-risk, high-reward model. In reality, genuine arbitrage opportunities in mature crypto markets are fleeting and require immense capital and speed, not a secret bot sold to retail investors. This sentencing aligns with a broader international regulatory trend. Authorities worldwide are prioritizing investor protection in the digital asset space. Furthermore, the case highlights the importance of due diligence. Investors must scrutinize claims of guaranteed returns, especially when they involve opaque technology. Key Case Details: AI Crypto Fraud Sentencing Element Detail Total Fraud Value ~19 Billion KRW ($13.8 Million USD) Core Deceptive Promise AI-powered arbitrage trading bot Scheme Type Ponzi/Pyramid Structure Legal Stage Appeals Court Upholding Sentences Primary Impact Significant financial loss for investors Broader Impacts and Investor Lessons The repercussions of this fraud extend beyond the courtroom. Affected investors face a long and uncertain path to potential restitution. Moreover, such high-profile cases can erode public trust in legitimate AI and blockchain projects. They create regulatory headwinds for ethical startups operating in the fintech space. For individual investors, the case offers several crucial lessons: Scrutinize “Guaranteed” Returns: Promises of consistent, high profits with no risk are a universal red flag in investing. Understand the Technology: If you cannot understand how a proposed investment works, it is prudent to avoid it. Verify Licenses and Audits: Legitimate investment firms operate under regulatory oversight and undergo independent financial audits. Beware of Social Proof Manipulation: Scammers often fabricate testimonials and use pressure tactics to create false urgency. Regulators are increasingly leveraging technology themselves, using blockchain analytics tools to trace illicit fund flows. This technological arms race between fraudsters and authorities is intensifying globally. Conclusion The upheld prison sentences for this $13.8 million AI crypto fraud represent a significant victory for financial justice and a stern warning to the industry. This case perfectly illustrates how cutting-edge terminology can mask age-old fraudulent schemes. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, robust legal frameworks and informed investor vigilance remain the strongest defenses against such sophisticated deception. The finality of the appeal court’s decision underscores that exploiting technological hype for criminal gain carries severe and lasting consequences. FAQs Q1: What was the main promise used in this AI crypto fraud? The fraudsters claimed to have a proprietary artificial intelligence computer system that could generate risk-free profits by automatically exploiting price differences (arbitrage) between cryptocurrency exchanges. Q2: Why is an “arbitrage” promise common in crypto scams? Arbitrage sounds technically plausible and low-risk, making it an attractive hook. Scammers exploit the complexity of crypto markets to convince investors that a secret algorithm can consistently find these opportunities. Q3: What does the appeals court decision signify? The appeals court upholding the sentences strengthens the legal precedent for prosecuting complex, technology-based financial fraud. It signals that higher courts are backing stringent punishments for such crimes. Q4: How can investors avoid similar AI crypto fraud schemes? Investors should be extremely skeptical of guaranteed returns, research the team and technology behind any project, check for proper regulatory licenses, and remember that genuine AI trading tools are not sold as mass-market investment products. Q5: Are all AI-related cryptocurrency projects fraudulent? No. Many legitimate projects research AI applications in crypto, such as for market analysis or security. The key differentiators are transparency, realistic claims, regulatory compliance, and the absence of guaranteed profit promises.

According to the stablecoin issuer’s press statement published on Friday, Ripple University’s Blockchain Research Initiative is launching a University Digital Asset Xcelerator (UDAX) that promises to provide founders with hands-on technical support, direct mentorship, and access to capital networks. Ripple is adding its academic footprint through UBRI, the multi-year program based at UC Berkeley that has been contributing to blockchain research and talent. UDAX debuts after a six-week pilot cohort at Berkeley According to Ripple, the first iteration of UDAX launched in fall 2025 as a pilot cohort hosted at UC Berkeley. The program was a product of a collaboration between Ripple engineers and a multidisciplinary group of Berkeley faculty and lecturers. Over six intensive weeks, nine startups worked alongside mentors to develop their concepts into solutions for market deployment. The program began with a launch summit held in Berkeley, where founders were introduced to the XRP Ledger’s architecture and the Ripple ecosystem. It all concluded with a closing summit and demo day at Ripple’s San Francisco headquarters, featuring words of encouragement from Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and CTO Emeritus David Schwartz, placing the startups in front of XRP Ledger developers, Ripple executives, and representatives from 13 venture capital firms. One of the several startups involved in the program is WaveTip. This platform provides instant tips for Twitch streamers, which completed its transition to the XRP Ledger Mainnet during the accelerator and is now available through the Chrome Web Store. X-Card, another startup that converts physical collectibles into liquid digital assets, onboarded more than $1.5 million in inventory during the six-week period. The team also secured partnerships with merchant communities and thousands of collectors, according to program disclosures. UDAX helped BlockBima, which is developing automated climate-risk microinsurance products for vulnerable communities, triple its active user base. The teams worked with mentors, including Andrea Barrica, to sharpen their pitches enough that they could appeal to investors. Ripple reported that participating teams hit an average 67% increase in product maturity and a 92% average increase in fundraising confidence after the program. Moreover, the accelerator also supported institutional finance and cross-border capital flow projects like CRX Digital Assets, which used UDAX for exporting Brazilian credit products and increased its tokenized asset volume from $39 million to $58 million. Stablecoin-based financial services Blockroll launched stablecoin-backed virtual cards for African freelancers in global markets. “Blockroll will use RLUSD as the institutionally accepted stablecoins to streamline remittance settlements from Sub-Saharan Africa’s leading source, and enable financial access use cases such as stablecoin-backed debit cards that work globally.” Sadiq Isiaka, Blackroll, CEO commented. “This also unlocks world-class wealth-building opportunities for African users, including stablecoin yields and tokenized US stocks.” Other teams addressed infrastructure and compliance challenges. WellArrive refined its platform into a dual-sided marketplace model after working with legal and corporate affairs mentors. Spout finalized a complex equity tokenization model and secured meetings with venture capital firms, while Mintara Labs worked to validate its go-to-market strategy for crypto-bank insurance. UC Berkeley and Ripple’s partnership grows The California University, Berkeley’s College of Engineering announced the launch of a new Center for Digital Assets in conjunction with Ripple Labs last October, Cryptopolitan reported . At the time, UCB stated that the research center would be used to study how blockchain and digital twin technologies can capture, value, verify, and exchange physical assets in digital form. Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative contributed $1.3 million in Ripple USD, the company’s US dollar-backed stablecoin. A 2025 report from the International Data Corporation estimates that worldwide data volumes will reach 175 zettabytes, with some projections mentioning 181 zettabytes. “Digital content has been part of our human experience and economic systems for decades,” said Tarek Zohdi, associate dean for research at Berkeley Engineering and the center’s faculty director. “The overall mission of the center is to foster pioneering research, education, innovation, and entrepreneurship within the broader digital asset technology landscape.” UCB engineers are also studying the “twinning” of physical assets, making replicas that can be analyzed, tested, and assigned present and future value to be traded onchain.

This substantial liquidation event highlights the ongoing volatility in crypto derivatives markets, particularly affecting Bitcoin traders who faced the most severe losses. Market analysts immediately noted the disproportionate impact on long positions, suggesting a potential shift in short-term sentiment despite broader bullish trends. Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations: The 24-Hour Breakdown Perpetual futures contracts represent one of the most popular derivative instruments in cryptocurrency trading, allowing participants to speculate on price movements without expiration dates. These instruments typically use funding rates to maintain their price alignment with spot markets. Consequently, when prices move sharply against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses, triggering what traders commonly refer to as liquidations. The recent 24-hour liquidation data reveals distinct patterns across different assets. Bitcoin, as the market leader, naturally experienced the highest absolute liquidation volume. Meanwhile, Ethereum followed with significant but comparatively lower figures. Interestingly, RIVER displayed a contrasting pattern that warrants deeper examination. The following table summarizes the key liquidation metrics: Asset Total Liquidations Long Position % Short Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $41.59 million 89.52% 10.48% Ethereum (ETH) $18.95 million 73.11% 26.89% RIVER $9.15 million 43.09% 56.91% These figures demonstrate that Bitcoin and Ethereum traders predominantly faced losses on long positions during this period. Conversely, RIVER traders experienced more significant losses on short positions. This divergence suggests varying market dynamics and trader positioning across different cryptocurrency assets. Market observers typically interpret such data as indicators of local tops or bottoms, though correlation doesn’t imply causation. Bitcoin’s Dominant Liquidation Pattern Explained Bitcoin’s $41.59 million liquidation volume, with nearly 90% coming from long positions, represents a substantial market event. This pattern typically emerges during rapid price corrections after extended upward movements. Traders using excessive leverage on long positions become vulnerable when prices decline even modestly. Several factors potentially contributed to this scenario: Overleveraged bullish sentiment : Extended bullish periods often encourage traders to increase leverage Technical resistance levels : Bitcoin may have encountered strong selling pressure at key price points Macroeconomic triggers : Traditional market movements or regulatory announcements can cascade into crypto markets Funding rate adjustments : Extremely positive funding rates can precipitate long squeezes Historical data from previous market cycles shows similar liquidation clusters often precede consolidation periods. However, they don’t necessarily indicate trend reversals. The cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility means such events occur regularly, though the magnitude varies based on market conditions and overall leverage in the system. Expert Analysis: Understanding Liquidation Cascades Market structure experts emphasize that liquidation events rarely occur in isolation. Instead, they often create cascading effects through several mechanisms. First, large liquidations can create immediate selling pressure as exchanges close positions. Second, they trigger stop-loss orders from other traders. Third, they can influence market sentiment, prompting additional selling from risk-averse participants. Derivatives analysts note that the concentration of liquidations in long positions suggests the market was overly optimistic before the correction. This pattern aligns with traditional contrarian indicators that sometimes identify crowded trades. Nevertheless, experienced traders caution against overinterpreting single data points, recommending instead to examine liquidation patterns within broader market contexts including: Open interest changes across exchanges Funding rate histories and extremes Spot market volume and price action Options market positioning and implied volatility Ethereum and RIVER: Contrasting Market Dynamics Ethereum’s $18.95 million in liquidations followed Bitcoin’s pattern but with slightly less long dominance at 73.11%. This moderate percentage suggests Ethereum traders maintained somewhat more balanced positioning. The correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidations remains historically strong, though divergence occasionally occurs during ecosystem-specific developments. RIVER’s distinctive pattern, with 56.91% of liquidations coming from short positions, presents an intriguing counter-narrative. This suggests RIVER experienced what traders call a “short squeeze,” where rising prices force short sellers to cover positions, accelerating upward momentum. Several factors could explain this phenomenon: Positive project developments : Protocol upgrades or partnership announcements Relative outperformance : Capital rotation from larger to smaller cryptocurrencies Low liquidity environments : Smaller markets can experience exaggerated moves Technical breakout patterns : Price movements triggering algorithmic trading This divergence highlights the importance of analyzing each cryptocurrency’s unique ecosystem rather than assuming uniform market behavior. Different assets attract distinct trader demographics with varying risk appetites and strategies. The Broader Context: Crypto Derivatives Market Evolution The perpetual futures market has evolved significantly since its inception, growing into a multi-trillion dollar ecosystem. Several developments in 2024 and 2025 have shaped current market conditions: Increased institutional participation : Traditional finance entities now constitute approximately 35% of derivatives volume Enhanced risk management tools : Exchanges have implemented more sophisticated liquidation mechanisms to reduce cascade risks Regulatory clarity advancements : Several jurisdictions have established clearer frameworks for crypto derivatives Cross-margin and portfolio margin adoption : These features allow more efficient capital usage but can increase interconnected risks Market infrastructure improvements have generally reduced but not eliminated liquidation volatility. The fundamental nature of leveraged trading ensures that rapid price movements will continue triggering position closures. However, better risk management across the ecosystem has decreased the frequency of extreme multi-hundred million dollar liquidation events compared to previous cycles. Historical Perspective: Learning from Past Liquidation Events The cryptocurrency market has experienced numerous significant liquidation events throughout its history. The May 2021 downturn saw over $10 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Similarly, the November 2022 FTX collapse triggered approximately $3 billion in liquidations. These historical precedents provide valuable context for understanding current market dynamics. Comparative analysis reveals that while absolute liquidation volumes have increased with market growth, relative percentages of total open interest have generally decreased. This trend suggests improving risk management practices among traders and exchanges. Nevertheless, the psychological impact of liquidation events remains substantial, often creating temporary market dislocations that savvy traders can potentially exploit. Risk Management Strategies for Perpetual Futures Traders Professional traders employ numerous strategies to navigate liquidation risks in perpetual futures markets. These approaches have evolved through multiple market cycles: Position sizing discipline : Limiting leverage to manageable levels, typically below 5x for most professionals Diversification across exchanges : Spreading positions to mitigate platform-specific risks Active monitoring of funding rates : Avoiding positions during extreme positive or negative funding periods Using stop-loss orders strategically : Placing stops at logical technical levels rather than arbitrary percentages Hedging with options or spot positions : Creating balanced portfolios that withstand volatility Educational resources from major exchanges now emphasize these practices, contributing to gradually improving trader sophistication. However, the accessibility of high leverage continues attracting inexperienced participants who often bear the brunt of liquidation events. Conclusion The recent $69.69 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidations provides valuable insights into current market dynamics and trader positioning. Bitcoin’s overwhelming long liquidations suggest localized excessive optimism, while RIVER’s short-dominated liquidations indicate unique ecosystem dynamics. These crypto perpetual futures liquidations events, while substantial, represent normal market functioning within an evolving derivatives landscape. Market participants should interpret such data within broader contexts including technical analysis, fundamental developments, and macroeconomic factors. As the cryptocurrency market matures, liquidation patterns will continue offering important, though not definitive, signals about market sentiment and potential turning points. FAQs Q1: What causes liquidations in crypto perpetual futures? Exchanges automatically close leveraged positions when traders’ collateral falls below maintenance margins, preventing further losses. Rapid price movements trigger most liquidations. Q2: Why were Bitcoin liquidations mostly long positions? This pattern typically occurs during price corrections after bullish periods when overleveraged long positions become vulnerable to modest downside moves. Q3: How do RIVER’s liquidations differ from Bitcoin and Ethereum? RIVER experienced majority short liquidations (56.91%), suggesting a short squeeze where rising prices forced short sellers to cover positions. Q4: Are liquidation events predictors of market direction? While liquidation clusters sometimes coincide with local tops or bottoms, they aren’t reliable standalone predictors. Professionals analyze them alongside other indicators. Q5: How can traders reduce liquidation risks? Strategies include using lower leverage, diversifying across exchanges, monitoring funding rates, implementing stop-loss orders, and hedging with other instruments. Q6: Have liquidation mechanisms improved over time? Yes, exchanges have implemented better risk management including partial liquidations, bankruptcy fund protections, and more sophisticated price oracle systems.

According to aggregated metrics from the top three futures platforms by open interest, short positions currently maintain a slight but persistent edge over long positions, creating important implications for market structure and potential price movements in the coming trading sessions. Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Show Consistent Short Bias Over the past 24-hour period, comprehensive data analysis reveals a clear pattern across major cryptocurrency derivatives platforms. The aggregate long/short ratio for Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts stands at 49.13% long positions versus 50.87% short positions. This seemingly marginal difference actually represents significant capital allocation when considering the substantial open interest across these exchanges. Furthermore, the consistency of this pattern across multiple platforms suggests a coordinated market sentiment rather than exchange-specific anomalies. Market analysts typically monitor these ratios as sentiment indicators because perpetual futures represent leveraged positions that sophisticated traders utilize for directional bets. The current data indicates that professional traders, who predominantly use these instruments, exhibit slightly bearish expectations for Bitcoin’s near-term price trajectory. However, the narrow margin between long and short positions also suggests market uncertainty rather than strong conviction in either direction. Exchange-Specific Analysis Reveals Uniform Patterns Detailed examination of individual exchange data shows remarkably consistent patterns across all three major platforms. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, reports a ratio of 47.63% long positions to 52.37% short positions. Similarly, OKX displays 47.88% long versus 52.12% short, while Bybit shows 47.58% long compared to 52.42% short. This uniformity across geographically diverse platforms with different user bases indicates a global rather than regional sentiment pattern. The consistency becomes particularly noteworthy when considering the substantial open interest involved. According to recent market data, these three exchanges collectively represent over $15 billion in Bitcoin perpetual futures open interest. Consequently, even the slight percentage differences translate to hundreds of millions of dollars in directional bias. Market structure analysts emphasize that such uniform patterns across exchanges typically precede periods of increased volatility as opposing positions eventually require resolution. Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratios (24-Hour Data) Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 47.63% 52.37% Short +4.74% OKX 47.88% 52.12% Short +4.24% Bybit 47.58% 52.42% Short +4.84% Aggregate 49.13% 50.87% Short +1.74% Historical Context and Market Implications Current positioning data gains additional significance when examined against historical patterns. Throughout 2024 and early 2025, Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios have fluctuated between extreme bullish and bearish positioning, often preceding significant price movements. The current slight short bias follows a period of elevated long positioning that persisted through much of the previous quarter. Market historians note that similar transitions from net long to net short positioning have frequently preceded consolidation phases before directional moves. Several fundamental factors potentially contribute to the current sentiment. Institutional adoption continues expanding, with traditional finance entities increasingly participating in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Regulatory developments across major jurisdictions have created both opportunities and uncertainties for market participants. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions, including interest rate policies and inflation metrics, continue influencing cryptocurrency as an alternative asset class. These factors collectively create the backdrop against which traders position their perpetual futures contracts. Understanding Perpetual Futures Mechanics Bitcoin perpetual futures represent sophisticated financial instruments that differ significantly from traditional futures contracts. Unlike conventional futures with set expiration dates, perpetual contracts continue indefinitely, utilizing funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. This structure makes them particularly popular among active traders seeking continuous exposure without managing contract rollovers. The funding rate mechanism involves periodic payments between long and short position holders, creating additional dynamics that influence trader behavior and positioning. Key characteristics of perpetual futures include: No expiration dates enabling continuous position maintenance Funding rate payments every eight hours between counterparties High leverage availability up to 100x on some platforms Direct price correlation with underlying Bitcoin spot prices Liquidity provision through market makers and arbitrageurs These features make perpetual futures particularly sensitive to market sentiment shifts. The current slight short bias suggests traders anticipate potential downward pressure or at least limited upside in the near term. However, the narrow margin indicates uncertainty rather than strong conviction, potentially setting the stage for rapid sentiment shifts if market conditions change. Expert Analysis on Current Positioning Derivatives market specialists emphasize that current positioning represents typical market behavior during consolidation phases. According to institutional trading desk analysis, the slight short bias often develops when markets approach technical resistance levels or when uncertainty increases around macroeconomic events. The uniformity across exchanges particularly interests analysts because it suggests coordinated institutional behavior rather than retail trader sentiment. Historical data analysis reveals important patterns about similar positioning scenarios. During the past three years, slight short biases in perpetual futures have preceded both significant price declines and powerful rallies, depending on subsequent market catalysts. The current environment features several potential catalysts including regulatory decisions, institutional adoption announcements, and macroeconomic policy shifts. Consequently, traders appear positioned cautiously while awaiting clearer directional signals. Market Structure and Liquidity Considerations The current derivatives positioning occurs within a broader market structure context. Spot market volumes have remained relatively stable while derivatives open interest has gradually increased throughout 2025. This divergence suggests growing sophistication among market participants who increasingly utilize derivatives for hedging and speculation. The concentration of activity on three major exchanges reflects ongoing market consolidation as regulatory clarity drives volume toward compliant platforms. Liquidity metrics across these exchanges remain robust despite the slight positioning bias. Order book depth analysis shows sufficient liquidity for large position entries and exits without significant market impact. Funding rates have remained relatively neutral, indicating balanced interest between long and short positions despite the slight quantitative bias. This balanced funding environment reduces the cost of maintaining positions and encourages continued participation from market makers and institutional players. Market surveillance data indicates normal trading patterns without signs of excessive leverage or position concentration that might signal impending volatility events. Open interest distribution analysis reveals well-diversized positioning across various leverage levels rather than concentration at extreme multiples. This distribution suggests responsible risk management among participants rather than speculative excess that sometimes precedes sharp market movements. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Markets The cryptocurrency derivatives market continues evolving toward greater sophistication and correlation with traditional financial instruments. Current Bitcoin perpetual futures positioning shows similarities to traditional equity index futures during uncertain market periods. The slight short bias mirrors behavior often observed in S&P 500 futures when investors hedge against potential downside while maintaining core long exposure. Important distinctions remain, however, between cryptocurrency and traditional derivatives markets. Cryptocurrency markets operate continuously without traditional market hours, creating different dynamics around news events and position adjustments. Regulatory frameworks continue developing, creating additional considerations for institutional participants. Despite these differences, the maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives markets increasingly allows similar analytical approaches to those used in traditional finance. Risk Management Perspectives Professional trading firms emphasize disciplined risk management approaches given current market positioning. The slight short bias creates potential for rapid sentiment shifts if unexpected positive catalysts emerge. Consequently, risk managers recommend position sizing that accounts for potential volatility in either direction. Historical volatility metrics suggest typical daily ranges, but positioning data indicates potential for expanded movements if sentiment shifts decisively. Funding rate monitoring becomes particularly important in current conditions. Neutral to slightly negative funding rates reduce the cost of maintaining short positions but could quickly shift if long interest increases. Experienced traders typically monitor funding rates alongside positioning data to anticipate potential sentiment reversals. Current funding rate patterns show no extreme readings that might signal imminent positioning squeezes or forced liquidations. Conclusion Bitcoin perpetual futures data reveals a market in cautious equilibrium with a slight but consistent short bias across major exchanges. This positioning reflects professional trader sentiment during a period of market consolidation and uncertainty about near-term catalysts. The uniformity across exchanges suggests coordinated institutional behavior rather than fragmented retail sentiment. While the quantitative difference appears marginal, its consistency and the substantial capital involved make it significant for market structure analysis. Current conditions suggest continued range-bound trading potential until clearer directional catalysts emerge, though the slight positioning bias indicates professional expectations leaning toward limited near-term upside. Market participants should monitor these Bitcoin perpetual futures metrics alongside spot market developments and broader financial market conditions for comprehensive market assessment. FAQs Q1: What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? Bitcoin perpetual futures are derivative contracts that track Bitcoin’s price without expiration dates, using funding mechanisms to maintain alignment with spot prices. They allow continuous trading without contract rollovers. Q2: Why does the slight short bias matter if it’s only 1-2%? Even small percentage differences represent significant capital allocation given the billions in open interest. Consistent patterns across multiple exchanges also indicate coordinated market sentiment rather than random fluctuations. Q3: How do perpetual futures differ from regular futures contracts? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding rate payments between traders to maintain price correlation. Regular futures have set expiration dates requiring position rolling. Q4: What typically happens when perpetual futures show short bias? Historical patterns show varied outcomes. Sometimes short biases precede price declines, but they can also indicate hedging that precedes rallies. Context including funding rates and spot market conditions determines implications. Q5: How reliable are these ratios for predicting price movements? They indicate current sentiment rather than predict future prices. Extreme positioning often signals contrarian opportunities, while balanced positioning like current conditions suggests uncertainty and potential for volatility in either direction.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.3438 Market Cap $669.24M Trading Volume $72.85M Circulating Supply 1.944B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.3448 24-hour Low $0.3267 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.60% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3052 14-Day RSI 58.66 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.5304 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Buyers are cautious right now, but sellers are not in control yet. The $0.35–$0.36 area decides whether the price goes higher or pulls back. As long as the price stays above $0.316, the trend is still healthy. Optimism 1-day price chart As of January 17, OP is trading around $0.345, up roughly 1.3% on the session, after an aggressive expansion from the $0.31 region earlier this week. The price briefly pushed into the upper Bollinger zone near $0.368 and has since pulled back about 6–7% from that swing high, signaling profit-taking rather than outright trend failure. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView As long as price continues to rotate above the Bollinger mid-band near $0.316, the daily structure remains constructive. However, the slowing MACD momentum suggests upside continuation now needs fresh participation rather than volatility alone. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP is rebounding from the $0.325–$0.33 demand pocket and is now pressing into the Alligator cluster around $0.34–$0.345, a recovery of roughly 5% from the local dip. This reclaim improves short-term structure, but CMF staying negative and OBV still heavy show that buying pressure is tentative. The $0.35–$0.36 zone remains the key short-term ceiling; failure there likely sends price back toward $0.33, while acceptance above it would reopen the path to $0.38. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3474 SELL SMA 5 $0.3331 BUY SMA 10 $0.3175 BUY SMA 21 $0.3037 BUY SMA 50 $0.3052 BUY SMA 100 $0.3670 SELL SMA 200 $0.5304 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3250 BUY EMA 5 $0.3196 BUY EMA 10 $0.3079 BUY EMA 21 $0.2991 BUY EMA 50 $0.3214 BUY EMA 100 $0.3936 SELL EMA 200 $0.5355 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is transitioning from expansion into consolidation. Holding above $0.33 keeps the bias mildly bullish, but a clean push through $0.36 is required to restart momentum. Losing $0.316 would shift focus to a deeper corrective leg. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

In a detailed letter on January 15, 2026, addressed to SEC Chair Paul S. Atkins, Democratic lawmakers expressed deep concern about the agency’s recent decisions to dismiss, close, or put on hold more than a dozen high-profile crypto enforcement actions filed since early 2025. This development has prompted questions about the SEC’s commitment to protecting investors and enforcing securities laws in the digital asset space. Allegations of Enforcement Retreat and Political Influence The letter , authored by Representatives Maxine Waters, Brad Sherman, and Sean Casten, asserts that the SEC’s dismissal of over twelve major crypto cases, including those against Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, represents a dramatic shift away from robust enforcement. According to the lawmakers, in each of these matters,s the SEC had previously secured favorable court rulings or had established substantive allegations of regulatory violations, yet opted to walk away from litigation or agreed to dismiss enforcement actions on discretionary or procedural grounds. Within the text of the letter, the Democrats characterized the timing of these enforcement retreats as particularly troubling, given that many of the companies whose cases were dropped had made substantial political contributions to President Donald Trump’s campaign and inauguration events . The lawmakers stated that firms such as Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple , Robinhood, and Crypto.com each contributed significant sums in the context of these political activities, a pattern that, in their view, creates what they described as an inference of “pay-to-play” dynamics influencing regulatory outcomes. BREAKING: House Democrats just blasted SEC Chair Atkins in a scathing Jan 15, 2026 letter accusing the SEC of dropping 12+ major crypto cases (including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken… and Ripple!) since 2025 amid massive Trump donations & “pay-to-play” concerns. They demand… pic.twitter.com/PMtQYFUaqE — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) January 16, 2026 Focus on the Justin Sun Litigation The letter places particular emphasis on the SEC’s handling of its enforcement action against Justin Sun , the founder of the Tron Foundation. The SEC initially filed civil charges against Sun in 2023, alleging that he orchestrated unregistered securities offerings, manipulated trading volumes, and improperly promoted digital assets. In February 2025, the agency requested that a federal court stay the proceedings to explore a potential settlement, and that stay has remained in place for approximately eleven months. Democrats argue that the extended pause in the Sun case undermines confidence in the consistent application of securities laws. They contend that this situation sends a concerning signal to market participants about selective enforcement, particularly given Sun’s significant investments of tens of millions of dollars in crypto ventures linked to the Trump family and affiliates. The lawmakers called on the SEC either to lift the stay and pursue litigation consistent with the strength of its original complaint or to negotiate a settlement that adequately reflects the gravity of the alleged misconduct.

Lawmakers demanded documentation and communications relevant to the agency’s choices to dismiss or halt these cases, including any external contacts or influences that may have played a role. Their communication underscores a wider concern that inconsistent enforcement threatens investor protection and the credibility of the SEC’s regulatory mission. Stakes for Crypto Oversight The House Democrats’ letter represents a significant moment in the intersection of public policy, financial regulation, and digital asset markets. By challenging the SEC’s recent actions and calling for transparency and accountability, these lawmakers have signaled heightened legislative scrutiny of federal crypto enforcement practices and raised fundamental questions about the integrity of U.S. securities regulation in the digital era.

ChatGPT Analyzes the Most Recent Ripple Price Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-at-10-this-month-chatgpt-analyzes-the-most-recent-ripple-price-predictions/,"Given the sheer size of the XRP Army, it’s no wonder that the underlying asset is often the subject of some mind-blowing price predictions. In this article, we will review one of the latest, which represented a forecast of a double-digit price pump within the next couple of weeks. John Squire, among the most popular and vocal members of the XRP Army, posted a picture of the token and asked whether a $10 price tag is possible as early as this month. $10 XRP in January? From where we are standing, the answer is obvious. And it’s not good for the Ripple bulls. After all, the asset currently trades below $2.10, so it would require a nearly 400% surge within just 14 days to reach such a massive target. Given our pessimistic views, we decided to ask ChatGPT for its perspective to see if it’s more optimistic. Well, it wasn’t. Its short answer was, “extremely unlikely.” It noted that several things would need to happen simultaneously for such a far-fetched goal to be reached: A broad crypto market breakout led by Bitcoin Massive, sudden institutional inflows into XRP specifically A clear regulatory or adoption shock that redefines XRP’s valuation overnight. It admitted that none of those are currently in place. Additionally, even when XRP had posted some of its biggest rallies, it took months, not mere weeks. “Without an extraordinary black-swan catalyst, a $10 XRP this month falls firmly into the low-probability, hype-driven narrative category,” concluded the AI solution. $10 XRP in 2026? On the question of whether Ripple’s cross-border token can reach that same target at any point in 2026, ChatGPT said, “The conversation changes dramatically.” Although it still believes it’s more of a speculative goal, it noted that “it’s not impossible.” XRP would still need some major catalyst, including: Sustained institutional adoption of Ripple’s payment infrastructure Continued expansion of XRP’s role in cross-border settlements Favorable regulatory clarity in major markets A broader bull market that lifts larger-cap altcoins OpenAI’s platform concluded that, in such a strong macro and crypto environment, the asset’s more realistic target would be somewhere around $5-$7, with “$10 representing the upper extreme of a bull-case scenario, not the base expectation.” It believes the actual odds for going to the low double digits at any point in 2026 are around 20%.

Analyst Forecasts 1,250% Expansion",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-to-repeat-its-2017-playbook-analyst-forecasts-1250-expansion/,"While XRP retests a crucial support area, some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is preparing for a massive expansion in the coming months, as a potential trend reversal begins to form and its 2017 formula repeats. Related Reading: CME Group To Launch Cardano, Chainlink, Stellar Futures Amid Crypto Lineup Expansion – Details XRP Gears Up For Massive Expansion On Friday, XRP reached a 12-day low, falling to the $2.02 area before bouncing. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2.05-$2.35 area for nearly two weeks, moving between the mid and lower zones of this price range for most of this period. Amid its recent performance, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that the altcoin “is starting to look better, especially after that bullish market structure break with a fresh higher high.” The analyst highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been consistently trending lower since August, exclusively printing lower lows and lower highs. However, it has broken out of this structure and recorded a higher high for the first time in months after the start-of-the-year rally, setting the stage for a potential reversal. “Now, we have to maintain this bullish structure at any cost and form a higher low on the next dip,” Sjuul warned. Meanwhile, market observer ChartNerd pointed to a striking similarity between XRP’s 2017 playbook and its current performance. In an X post, the analyst affirmed that the altcoin is repeating its 2016-2017 formula, which led to a massive rally toward its previous all-time high (ATH). At the time, XRP saw a textbook multi-year symmetrical triangle formation breakout, followed by a multi-month ABC consolidation before its 1,500% mark-up. This time, the cryptocurrency has repeated a similar symmetrical triangle pattern breakout, and it is currently in Wave C of its ABC consolidation period. To the analyst, a deeper Wave C retracement is possible if the multi-month $1.80 support is lost. Nonetheless, he added that “cycle formula repetition signals XRP is gearing up for expansion towards $8/$13/$27,” which would be a 300%-1,250% increase from the current levels. Q1 Close To Define XRP’s Future Despite his bullish forecast, ChartNerd also shared an important warning for the next two months. According to the analyst, “XRP has just over 2 months to invalidate this 3M bearish Heikin-Ashi candle formation,” or it will risk a massive correction. In a video analysis, he explained that, in the past, whenever the altcoin saw massive rallies followed by a red bearish candle on the three-month timeframe, it would “normally indicate the start of a downtrend or a macro consolidation period.” In 2014, XRP saw a bearish candle print in the three-month timeframe after a remarkable pump, which was followed by a correction and consolidation “for quite a couple of years,” he explained. “The same happened again in 2018. We had this massive rally for XRP, and as soon as we printed a three-month bearish candle in the Heikin-Ashi Candle formation, (…) we entered into the bear market,” ChartNerd continued. Related Reading: Analyst Says It’s Time For Ethereum’s ‘Big Test’ – Is ETH Season Loading? Similarly, the cryptocurrency repeated the same performance in 2021. Now, XRP is starting to form a red candle in this timeframe and has approximately 2 months and 16 days to close the quarter on a positive note. “We have until March before this candle closes. (…) So, what we don’t want to see is this full-bodied three-month Heikin-Ashi Candle, because if we see it, this is where we are likely to see a deeper correction for the next six to nine and even 12 months,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.05, a 1.7% decline in the weekly timeframe.

57235899,658111,1768633234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57235899.jpeg,CRYPTO Act Proposal: Unlicensed Operations In New York Could Lead To 15 Years In Prison,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-act-unlicensed-operations-could-lead-prison/,"On Thursday, a new legislation was proposed in New York that aims to impose additional regulations on digital asset firms. The proposed law, known as the “CRYPTO” Act—short for “Cryptocurrency Regulation Yields Protections, Trust, and Oversight”—would make it illegal for digital asset firms to operate without the necessary licenses. The announcement came from Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Alvin L. Bragg, Jr., and New York State Senator Zellnor Myrie, who emphasized the urgency of regulating the cryptocurrency marketplace in the State. NY’s Proposed Crypto Bill According to the duo’s press statement , organizations that exchange, trade, or transport cryptocurrencies in New York are required to register for a virtual currency license. Failure to do so has resulted in merely civil sanctions. In contrast, the proposed CRYPTO Act would introduce criminal penalties for operating without a license, bringing New York’s regulatory framework closer to that of the federal system, where unauthorized conduct can result in up to five years in prison. The new Act aims to ensure that digital asset businesses adhere to the same levels of diligence and transparency as traditional money transmitters. Under the new legislation , unlicensed operations would fall under the category of Unlicensed Virtual Currency Business Activity, leading to a series of graduated penalties based on the value of the transactions involved. Offenders could face charges ranging from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class C felony for activities involving $1 million or more within a year, potentially resulting in sentences of 5 to 15 years in state prison. A “Shadow Financial System” District Attorney Bragg expressed concern about the growth of cryptocurrency, describing it as a “shadow financial system” that facilitates money laundering and other criminal activities. “Crypto is the go-to means for bad actors to move and hide the proceeds of crime,” he stated. Bragg further urged that the time has come for unlicensed cryptocurrency businesses to face criminal repercussions for not adhering to due diligence requirements. Senator Myrie echoed Bragg’s sentiments, noting, “As the use of crypto has grown, so has illicit activity.” He emphasized that New York, as a major financial hub, must take seriously its regulatory responsibilities. Myrie’s bill aims to align the state with the 18 other jurisdictions that have made unlicensed virtual currency transactions criminal offenses, to enhance consumer protection against potential fraud and scams. This legislative push coincides with a letter from House Democrats to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, in which several lawmakers urged the reinstatement of enforcement actions against digital asset firms. The letter sent on Thursday and signed by Representatives Maxine Waters, Sean Casten, and Brad Sherman, expressed deep concerns regarding the SEC’s recent retreat from prosecuting violations related to “digital asset securities.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|crypto|Crypto firms|crypto news|crypto regulation|cryptocurrencies|Cryptocurrency|DeFi|New York crypto|NEW York Crypto regulations|U.S. crypto firms,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 07:00:34

In his post, Bird conveyed that long-term supporters of XRP are worn down, suggesting that the prolonged period of limited price movement has taken an emotional toll on those who have remained committed over the years. While brief in form, his statement “We are tired, boss” reflected a sentiment that has persisted among holders who have endured multiple market cycles without the outcomes they once anticipated. The message did not focus on market metrics or technical analysis. Instead, it focused on emotional endurance, recognizing that maintaining patience through prolonged periods of stagnation can be mentally taxing. I think I speak for every single XRP holder when I say this: We are tired, boss. — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 15, 2026 A Response Highlighting Detachment and Emotional Discipline An X user known as The White Horse responded by offering a contrasting perspective. According to this view, exhaustion often results from constant attention to price movements and allowing investment performance to dominate daily life. The user suggested that emotional detachment is essential, arguing that long-term success in cryptocurrency markets depends on the ability to mentally step away after committing capital. From this standpoint, fatigue is avoidable if investors reduce their emotional exposure and adopt a passive, long-term approach. Bird Clarifies His Position as a Builder on the XRPL Bird replied by distinguishing between passive investors and those actively developing within the ecosystem. He explained that his own exhaustion stems from sustained effort rather than price observation. Bird stated that he is currently engaged in building a large-scale project on the XRP Ledger , dedicating extensive daily hours to its development. According to him, the fatigue he experiences is intentional and tied directly to a broader mission rather than market frustration. He emphasized discipline and consistency, noting that he has maintained this pace for more than a year without abandoning the underlying objective. Bird also pointed to the potential impact of the work, indicating that the project is designed to onboard hundreds of thousands of new users onto the XRPL, positioning his efforts as infrastructure-focused rather than speculative.

This user described holding XRP through multiple hype cycles and prolonged periods of minimal activity, noting that the experience gradually leads to exhaustion rather than frustration. The comment underscored that despite the fatigue, commitment remains intact. Together, these exchanges illustrate a divide within the XRP community between passive holders who manage emotional endurance and active builders who channel fatigue into development, both shaped by long-term involvement in the same ecosystem.

This pivotal moment, reported by CoinDesk in January 2025, illuminates a crucial crossroads where artificial intelligence development nearly intersected with blockchain fundraising at an unprecedented scale. The proposal emerged during cryptocurrency’s peak frenzy, offering a fascinating glimpse into alternative funding paths for transformative technologies. The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO Proposal Details Internal documents from January 2018 reveal specific parameters for the proposed OpenAI initial coin offering. Elon Musk and OpenAI founders discussed creating a token that would grant holders access to future AI services or computing resources. The $10 billion target would have dwarfed most traditional venture capital rounds, potentially distributing tokens to thousands of global investors. This approach mirrored contemporary blockchain projects that promised utility rather than equity. Historical context clarifies why this method gained consideration. The 2017-2018 period witnessed extraordinary ICO activity, with projects like Filecoin raising $257 million and Telegram securing $1.7 billion through private token sales. Regulatory frameworks remained ambiguous globally, creating a window for innovative fundraising. Meanwhile, OpenAI faced substantial computational costs for training advanced models, estimated at millions monthly for cloud infrastructure. 2018 Major ICO Comparisons Project Amount Raised Date Primary Focus Telegram $1.7B Feb-Mar 2018 Encrypted Messaging EOS $4.1B Jun 2018 Blockchain Platform Filecoin $257M Aug 2017 Decentralized Storage Proposed OpenAI ICO $10B (Target) Jan 2018 Artificial Intelligence Musk’s Rapid Reversal and Departure Elon Musk withdrew his support within weeks of the initial proposal. Multiple factors likely influenced this reversal. First, regulatory scrutiny intensified dramatically in early 2018 as the SEC began classifying certain tokens as securities. Second, Tesla’s own challenges demanded increased attention, particularly regarding Model 3 production and Autopilot development. Third, Musk expressed growing concerns about AI safety and commercialization timelines. His subsequent resignation from the OpenAI board in February 2018 created significant organizational shifts. Musk cited potential future conflicts with Tesla’s AI work as the primary reason. This departure occurred just as OpenAI transitioned from a non-profit to a “capped-profit” structure, a move that would eventually enable Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in 2019. The abandoned ICO proposal represents a road not taken in the organization’s funding evolution. Expert Analysis: The ICO Landscape in 2018 Blockchain analysts note the proposal’s timing coincided with peak ICO enthusiasm but increasing regulatory pressure. “The first quarter of 2018 saw both record fundraising and mounting SEC warnings,” explains Dr. Sarah Chen, cryptocurrency historian at Stanford University. “Projects began facing legal challenges for unregistered securities offerings, creating substantial risk for high-profile initiatives.” Several key developments shaped this period: Regulatory Shifts: The SEC’s DAO Report in July 2017 established that some tokens qualified as securities, followed by multiple enforcement actions in early 2018. Market Correction: Cryptocurrency valuations declined approximately 80% from January to December 2018, reducing investor appetite. Technical Limitations: Blockchain scalability issues became apparent, with networks struggling under transaction loads. Scam Proliferation: Numerous fraudulent ICOs damaged the mechanism’s reputation among serious investors. Alternative Funding Paths for AI Development The abandoned OpenAI ICO proposal highlights fundamental questions about financing transformative technologies. Traditional venture capital, while substantial, often imposes different constraints and expectations than token-based fundraising. ICOs theoretically enable broader participation and align incentives through utility tokens rather than equity. However, they also introduce regulatory complexity and market volatility. OpenAI ultimately pursued hybrid funding approaches. The organization secured: $1 billion from Microsoft in 2019 Additional funding through strategic partnerships Revenue from API access to models like GPT-3 Investment from venture firms like Khosla Ventures This diversified strategy contrasts sharply with the single massive ICO initially contemplated. Each approach carries distinct advantages regarding control, regulatory exposure, and community building. The ICO model might have created a decentralized ecosystem of developers and users invested in the platform’s success through token ownership. The Tesla AI Priority Shift Elon Musk’s redirected focus toward Tesla’s artificial intelligence initiatives proved prescient. Tesla began developing custom AI chips in 2018, leading to the Full Self-Driving computer’s 2019 deployment. The company’s Dojo supercomputer project, announced in 2021, represents another massive AI infrastructure investment. These parallel developments suggest Musk channeled his AI ambitions toward vertically integrated applications rather than general research platforms. Financial analysts note Tesla’s market capitalization grew from approximately $60 billion in early 2018 to over $800 billion by 2025. This valuation increase provided resources far exceeding the proposed ICO’s $10 billion target. However, the funding mechanisms differ fundamentally—public market equity versus token sales—with implications for investor rights, liquidity, and regulatory oversight. Historical Significance and Modern Parallels The revealed OpenAI ICO discussions gain new relevance amid 2025’s AI and blockchain convergence. Modern decentralized AI projects like Bittensor and SingularityNET employ token-based models for coordinating distributed computation. These initiatives face similar questions about governance, incentive alignment, and regulatory compliance that the 2018 proposal encountered. Several key differences distinguish current approaches: Enhanced Regulation: Clearer frameworks exist for security versus utility token classification Technical Maturity: Layer-2 solutions and specialized blockchains improve scalability Market Sophistication: Investors better understand token economics and risks AI Progress: Proven commercial applications increase token utility potential The proposal’s $10 billion scale remains extraordinary by contemporary standards. For comparison, the largest cryptocurrency venture rounds in 2024 reached approximately $500 million. This magnitude reflects both the period’s exuberance and AI infrastructure’s substantial capital requirements. Training advanced models like GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million, with future generations requiring exponentially more resources. Conclusion The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO proposal represents a fascinating historical footnote with enduring implications. This $10 billion fundraising plan, briefly supported then abandoned, highlights critical moments in both artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency evolution. The decision to pursue traditional investment instead shaped OpenAI’s development path and governance structure significantly. Meanwhile, Musk’s redirected focus toward Tesla’s AI ambitions produced substantial autonomous driving advancements. As AI and blockchain technologies continue converging, this revealed proposal offers valuable perspective on funding mechanisms for transformative technologies. The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO consideration ultimately demonstrates how financing choices can redirect technological trajectories in profound ways. FAQs Q1: What was the proposed purpose of the OpenAI ICO tokens? The documents suggest tokens would provide access to future AI services or computing resources, creating a utility-based ecosystem rather than equity ownership. Q2: Why did Elon Musk withdraw support for the ICO? Multiple factors likely contributed, including increasing regulatory scrutiny of token sales, Tesla’s growing AI priorities, and concerns about AI safety and commercialization timelines. Q3: How does this proposal compare to modern AI crypto projects? Current decentralized AI initiatives employ more sophisticated token economics and operate under clearer regulatory frameworks, but share similar goals of democratizing access and aligning incentives. Q4: What fundraising path did OpenAI ultimately pursue? The organization secured traditional venture funding, including Microsoft’s $1 billion investment, alongside revenue from API access and strategic partnerships. Q5: How might AI development differ if the ICO had proceeded? A token-based model might have created more decentralized governance and broader community participation, potentially accelerating certain applications while introducing different regulatory challenges.

In the meantime, the firm has also filed a notice to postpone the court order requiring it to share its data with rival firms as a remedy for its illegal monopoly. Alphabet’s owned search engine firm filed the appeal on Friday alongside the request to pend the implementation of the remedies to reduce its competitiveness against other search engine firms. The U.S. Court of Appeals is likely to hear the case, which, based on statistics, may take about a year to issue a decision after the appeal notice. This means if the appeal goes through, Google still has about a year to continue its operations without sharing data with rival firms. Google asks a U.S. Court Judge to postpone the ruling to share data with rivals U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled in 2024 that Google used unlawful tactics to maintain a monopoly against other search engine firms in the online search and advertising business. The case was first filed in 2020 during Trump’s first term before entering trial in the fall of 2023. According to Mehta’s ruling , Google signed deals with smartphone companies, including Samsung Electronics Inc. and Apple Inc., to make Google’s search engine the default. The search engine firm pays roughly $20 billion for those deals, which denied other companies key distribution channels. The U.S. Justice Department filed to sell Google’s Chrome browser, a move Judge Mehta rejected in a second trial held last year. Instead, Mehta ruled that Google must continue to pay for its search engine and AI apps to be the default on its smartphone partners, but with the condition that the deals be rebid annually to allow its competitors an equal opportunity to compete. Additionally, Google was asked to share its company data with rivals. According to a Cryptopolitan report , the U.S. District Court ordered the firm to begin sharing specific data with its rivals, excluding exclusive deals that secure its default status on devices. The ruling meant that competitors, especially AI companies developing their own search engines, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, may directly benefit from Google’s market insights. Mulholland says the Court ignored the fact that people use Google willingly Google confirmed that it’s prepared to do everything in its power to overturn the ruling that would require it to share its trade secrets while the appeal is pending. The firm believes that the remedies imposed by the court were unwarranted and should never have been imposed in the first place. As of now, the U.S. Justice Department and other complainants have until February 3 to appeal Mehta’s ruling, which rejected strong remedies such as the sale of its Chrome browser and its Android partnerships. “As we have long said, the Court’s August 2024 ruling ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they’re forced to. The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded startups.” Lee-Anne Mulholland , Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs According to Mulholland, Mehta’s ruling discounted compelling testimony from browser makers like Apple and Mozilla, who confirmed that they chose to feature the Alphabet firm because it provides the highest quality search experience for its consumers. Alphabet’s stock price has dropped 1% following the announcement, trading at $330.34 at the time of publication. The stock has also recorded an approximately 78% increase since July, with the acceleration in September following the ruling, and investors hope that the firm will take the lead in the AI search business.

The systemic importance of bank-funded lending makes stablecoin yield a likely compromise point in order to secure passage of the broader framework. Elon Musk’s X has banned InfoFi apps that pay users to post in an effort to curb AI-driven spam and low-quality engagement, showing growing backlash against attention-based crypto incentives that have distorted online discussion. Vitalik Buterin argues that decentralized stablecoins remain fundamentally fragile due to dollar dependence, oracle vulnerabilities, and staking-related risks, while we think that decentralized models are unlikely to achieve adoption and that stablecoins should instead remain U.S. dollar–pegged. This week’s newsletter examines the growing frictions in the industry, from the stalling of U.S. market structure legislation amid clashes over stablecoin yield, to Elon Musk’s X cracking down on InfoFi-driven attention farming, and Vitalik Buterin’s critique of decentralized stablecoins. Market Structure Bill Halts as Banks & Crypto Clash Over Yield The U.S. Senate Banking Committee has cancelled the scheduled markup of crypto market structure bill this week due to the growing fractures in negotiations among lawmakers, regulators, and industry groups. At the center of the debate is a fierce lobbying battle between the banking industry and the crypto sector. Banks argue that stablecoin rewards and yield programs siphon deposits away from the banking system, undermining the funding base that supports lending. Crypto firms counter this, claiming stablecoins are not deposits; rewards are not interest paid by issuers. The latest draft of the crypto market structure bill walks back earlier expectations by restricting stablecoin rewards when tokens are passively held in a way that resembles a saving account, while still allowing rewards tied to activity and transaction. Regarding the timeline, the Senate Banking Committee is set to consider amendments and hold a markup vote, while the Senate Agriculture Committee has postponed its own markup until later this month. After both committees advance their versions, the bill must be reconciled into a single Senate package before a full floor vote. Key Take The Market Structure Bill is the most important policy advance to watch this year, as it will draw clearer lines between the SEC and CFTC around when a digital asset is treated as a security or a commodity and how assets can evolve from security to commodity. It also builds on the GENIUS Act, sets rules about issuance, custody, and rewards, leading to the battle between banks and crypto. The criteria used to determine whether a token is treated as a commodity or a security will have direct market consequences. Tokens that qualify as commodities are likely to benefit from simpler regulatory treatment, while security tokens would face much higher compliance burdens. For the debate whether stablecoins can offer yield, it touches a foundational layer of the current financial system. Bank lending remains a primary source of funding for the whole economy, and lending is funded by deposits. If stablecoins meaningfully divert deposits away, it could hamper a bank's ability to extend credit. Therefore, the crypto sector is likely to compromise on the stablecoin yield in order to get the bill passed. Elon Musk’s X Bans InfoFi Apps That Pay Users to Post Elon Musk's X cracks down on so-called ""InfoFi"" projects, which monetize user attention through digital assets. X has announced that API access is revoked for applications that reward users for posting on the platform. X's Head of Product, Nikita Bier, said the decision is intended to curb AI-generated spam and low-quality engagement, which has flooded the platform with repetitive and inorganic content. InfoFi, short for Information Finance, gained popularity in 2024-2025, focusing on monetizing information and user attention through crypto mechanisms. Early adopters viewed it positively; it provided income opportunities for content creators and offered projects an efficient way to build awareness without relying on traditional KOLs. However, by mid-2025, there is growing criticism regarding InfoFi due to an explosion of low-quality, AI-generated content, to game the mechanism rather than provide real value. The move led to an immediate market impact. Kaito, one of the largest InfoFi projects, which tokenizes user engagement through its ""Yaps"" scoring system, saw its token fall more than 15% after the announcement. Key Take InfoFi has increasingly distorted crypto content by incentivizing attention farming, spam, and AI-generated content, bringing negative impact to information quality and credibility across social platforms, and at the same time reinforcing negative external perception of the crypto industry. This week's featured chart below showed the declining social metric across X and YouTube. While part of the slowdown reflects a lack of compelling industry narratives, the proliferation of low-quality content has also discouraged users from engaging with crypto-related discussions. Another reason for declining content quality on crypto Twitter is the shift in crypto's growth narrative from speculative, high-upside opportunities to stablecoins, tokenized assets, and financial infrastructure. While these areas have real potential to revolutionize the current financial system, they offer little excitement to retail participants. Vitalik Buterin’s Critique of Decentralized Stablecoin Design Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that the crypto industry has yet to resolve several foundational flaws in how to design decentralized stablecoins, arguing that many existing models depend on fragile assumptions that may fail in the long run. Buterin identified three core problems. First, he questioned the reliance on the U.S. Dollar as a reference asset, stating stablecoin should not be tied to a single national currency. Secondly, he pointed to Oracle dependence as a major vulnerability. Because decentralized systems rely on external data feeds for pricing, oracle feeds could be manipulated. Decentralized stablecoins protocols often rely on economic design to defend against these kinds of attacks by making attacks prohibitively expensive through fees or inflation. The third issue involves staking-backed collateral. When staked ETH is used as collateral for stablecoins, the staking yield needs to compete with returns users could get in other places, and slashing risk can erode collateral value. Key Take There are few novel decentralized stablecoins emerging in this cycle. The only example is Ethena's USDe, but it does not fully meet the criteria for decentralization, as its mechanism relies on a delta-neutral strategy executing on centralized exchanges to maintain stability. Contrary to Vitalik Buterin’s view, we believe stablecoins should remain pegged to a national currency, particularly the U.S. dollar. As a medium of exchange, a stablecoin’s primary function is transactional utility, not maintain purchasing power, and the U.S. dollar remains the dominant unit of account for global trade and everyday economic activity. A stablecoin pegged to an index or some other reference point will not gain mainstream adoption. We also do not expect a truly decentralized stablecoin to ever work, or even if it appears to work, it will not achieve real adoption, particularly as the regulatory environment becomes increasingly central, where regulators around the world recognize and legitimize only centralized, issuer-backed stablecoins. A decentralized stablecoin has to rely on some kind of mechanism, and this mechanism is often complex, where no regulators can confidently assess whether it is safe and stable in any market situation. Weekly Market Chart: Social Metrics as Leading Indicators Social metrics are a critical indicator category for the crypto industry, as they capture retail engagement and narrative momentum. Since mid-2025, social activity across YouTube and X, the two most important platforms for crypto, has been on a clear downward trend per data from The Block, suggesting weakening attention. More broadly, this reflects a shift in investor focus away from crypto toward other asset classes, particularly precious metals and technology firms, which have continued to grind higher and absorb attention. The deterioration in social engagement well ahead of the market peak in Q4 demonstrates the role of social metrics as leading indicators. As such, continued weakness in these indicators suggests limited upside momentum, while a reversal in social engagement would likely be an early signal of renewed market sentiment and a potential market rebound.

Large caps are still taking over headlines, but the most powerful multipliers may be those that are represented by new assets entering the market with actual utility and real adoption strategies. Mutuum Finance is one of the names that have been building momentum within this category, as the lending protocol is on the verge of unlocking the main milestones of the roadmap that may change the perception of value attributed to it in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol, which will enable users to provide and borrow crypto assets with the help of smart contracts. Suppliers will receive interest and get a yield and deposit-value-tracked mtTokens once live. Passive income is generated in this system without the necessity to source individual borrowers. To provide a basic example, when a user transacts ETH worth of $1,200 at an APY of 4%, their mtTokens would start to increase gradually with time as borrowers are paying interest to the pool. This is in line with the operation of major DeFi money markets in previous cycles. Mutuum Finance will as well facilitate isolated borrowing of assets which should be under closer control. In this case, users put collateral and draw loans using Loan to Value regulations. When a borrower pledges a collateral of $1000 with an LTV of 70%, he will be able to access up to 700 dollars of borrowed assets. The liquidators will intervene at unsafe situations in the sense they will repay part of the debt and purchase the collateral at a discount. This solvency is maintained in the system in times of volatility and is a common provision in advanced lending procedures. Allocation and Market Supply Mutuum Finance did not make an individual open sale. Rather, the token has gone through pricing phases where each stage has a fixed allocation. It is tailored to incentivize early involvement and replicate the manner in which a number of past DeFi releases distributed tokens. The project has already collected over $19.7 million and currently has over 18,800 holders all over the world. 1.82 billion tokens out of the 4 billion total supply are distributed to the presale. A strong percentage of that allocation has already been bought. At Phases 7, MUTM is being sold at $0.04. It started at 0.01 in the first stage and this implies that the early entrants are already enjoying about 300% MUTM appreciation. The subsequent pricing round is already announced, and will subsequently make the token price rise again upon the filling of the remaining allocation. In order to maintain the activity on engagement, the project will have a leaderboard that awards the highest daily purchaser with $500 in MUTM. Card payments are also enabled, and this increases its participation with other wallet users. According to analysts, these two characteristics have produced demand in the mid and late stages of the offering. Roadmap Catalysts As per the official X version, the V1 protocol is about to be ready to deploy testnet before the mainnet activation. It is interesting since lending platforms tend to reprice in instances where usage is evident. Traders have real measures to value rather than by speculation alone through borrowing, liquidation and revenue data. Security preparation has not been left out of the rollout. The V1 code has been audited by Halborn Security and the MUTM token has been given a score of 90 out of 100 by the token scan of CertiK. Bug bounty There is an active bug bounty of $50,000 to discover bugs before mainnet. There is a range of analysts who model the conservative valuation between $0.18 and 0.24 within the first post-launch window. At the current level of $0.04, that would represent about 350 percent to 500 percent growth should things work out. These estimates do not represent guarantees, yet they demonstrate the reason why focus has turned to the new crypto assets whose utility is less than 0.05. The important borrowing assets will be stablecoins. They enable the borrowing of funds against security without creating volatility in price in repaying them. Mutuum Finance intends to support Layer 2 networks as well to lower the liquidation cost and accelerate the speed of execution. These elements are identified by analysts as the scalability required in the long term in the DeFi crypto sector. As V1 approaches and as supply continues to tighten, Mutuum Finance is emerging as one of the best crypto under $0.05 to buy in case of those looking to buy utility and roadmap execution over hype.

This development, announced on March 15, 2025, from the company’s San Francisco headquarters, represents the exchange’s ongoing commitment to diversifying its cryptocurrency portfolio while maintaining rigorous compliance standards that have become increasingly important in the evolving regulatory landscape of digital finance. Understanding Coinbase’s Listing Roadmap Strategy Coinbase introduced its public listing roadmap in 2022 as a transparency initiative. This forward-looking document provides the cryptocurrency community with advance notice about digital assets under consideration for potential listing. Importantly, inclusion on the roadmap does not guarantee eventual listing. The exchange must complete comprehensive technical, security, and compliance reviews first. This process typically involves multiple stages of evaluation. The company examines factors including blockchain security, regulatory compliance, and market demand. Furthermore, the exchange assesses project team background and token distribution methodology. This systematic approach has become increasingly important as regulatory scrutiny intensifies globally. The roadmap serves several crucial functions for market participants. First, it provides early visibility into the exchange’s strategic direction. Second, it allows projects to prepare necessary documentation and technical requirements. Third, it enables investors to conduct preliminary research on emerging assets. Fourth, it demonstrates Coinbase’s commitment to transparent operations. The exchange has listed over 250 assets since its inception. However, the selection process has become more rigorous following increased regulatory guidance from agencies including the SEC and global financial authorities. The Technical Evaluation Framework Coinbase employs a multi-stage technical evaluation for all potential listings. The process begins with initial screening against the exchange’s Digital Asset Framework. This framework evaluates several critical dimensions. Security assessment examines blockchain consensus mechanisms and network resilience. Compliance review analyzes regulatory alignment across multiple jurisdictions. Market structure evaluation considers liquidity and trading dynamics. Project evaluation assesses team expertise and development roadmap. Finally, the exchange considers broader ecosystem impact and innovation potential. Only assets passing all evaluation stages proceed to listing consideration. SKR Token: Background and Market Context The SKR token represents the native cryptocurrency of the Sekuritance platform, a regulatory technology provider focusing on compliance solutions for blockchain businesses. Founded in 2021, Sekuritance developed a comprehensive regtech ecosystem. This ecosystem addresses critical compliance challenges in cryptocurrency operations. The platform offers automated KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) solutions. Additionally, it provides transaction monitoring and regulatory reporting tools. The SKR token facilitates access to these compliance services. Token holders can utilize SKR for platform fee payments and service subscriptions. Sekuritance has established partnerships with several financial institutions. The platform currently serves clients across Europe and Asia. The project completed a successful initial exchange offering in 2021. Since then, the development team has consistently delivered platform upgrades. The most recent update introduced enhanced transaction screening capabilities. This improvement addresses evolving regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions. Market analysts note the project’s focus on compliance aligns with broader industry trends. Regulatory technology solutions have gained significant importance following increased oversight of cryptocurrency markets. The following table outlines key SKR token metrics based on available public data: Metric Detail Blockchain Platform Ethereum (ERC-20) Total Supply 500,000,000 SKR Current Circulation Approximately 350,000,000 SKR Primary Use Case Regulatory compliance service payments Notable Feature Integrated with multiple compliance APIs FIGHT Token: Gaming and NFT Integration The FIGHT token serves as the utility cryptocurrency for the Crypto Fight Club ecosystem, a blockchain-based gaming platform combining non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with competitive gaming mechanics. Launched in 2022, Crypto Fight Club developed a play-to-earn fighting game. This game allows players to collect, train, and battle digital fighter NFTs. The FIGHT token functions as the primary in-game currency. Players earn tokens through competitive victories and tournament participation. Additionally, token holders can stake FIGHT for governance rights and platform rewards. The gaming platform has demonstrated consistent growth since its initial release. Active user counts increased by approximately 300% throughout 2024. The development team recently announced partnership agreements with several esports organizations. These partnerships will facilitate competitive tournament series beginning in late 2025. Industry observers note the project’s alignment with growing interest in blockchain gaming. The global blockchain gaming market is projected to exceed $65 billion by 2027 according to recent industry reports. Crypto Fight Club distinguishes itself through several innovative features: Cross-platform compatibility: The game supports mobile and desktop play Interoperable NFTs: Fighter characters function across multiple gaming environments Sustainable tokenomics: The ecosystem implements controlled inflation mechanisms Community governance: Token holders participate in development decisions Competitive infrastructure: The platform supports ranked matches and tournaments Market Impact and Trading Considerations Historical data indicates that Coinbase roadmap announcements frequently influence market dynamics. Assets added to the roadmap typically experience increased trading volume on existing platforms. This volume increase often precedes formal listing decisions. However, market analysts caution against assuming automatic listing outcomes. Several assets have remained on the roadmap for extended periods without progressing to full listing. Investors should conduct independent research before making trading decisions. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile despite increasing institutional participation. Regulatory Compliance and Listing Implications Coinbase operates within an increasingly complex regulatory environment. The exchange must navigate requirements from multiple jurisdictions simultaneously. United States regulations require particular attention following recent SEC guidance. The exchange has developed sophisticated compliance protocols to address these challenges. Each potential listing undergoes rigorous legal analysis. This analysis examines securities law considerations and consumer protection requirements. Additionally, the exchange evaluates anti-money laundering compliance and sanctions screening capabilities. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency exchanges evolved significantly throughout 2024. Several jurisdictions implemented comprehensive digital asset frameworks. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation took full effect in December 2024. This regulation establishes harmonized rules across EU member states. Similarly, the United Kingdom implemented its cryptoasset regulatory regime in early 2025. These developments have increased compliance requirements for all market participants. Exchanges must demonstrate robust compliance programs to maintain operating licenses. Coinbase’s listing decisions reflect this regulatory reality. The exchange prioritizes assets with clear compliance characteristics. Projects demonstrating regulatory awareness receive particular consideration. This approach aligns with the exchange’s long-term strategy. Coinbase aims to establish cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Regulatory compliance represents a fundamental component of this objective. Market observers note the exchange’s careful balance between innovation and compliance. This balance has become increasingly important as regulatory scrutiny intensifies globally. Broader Market Context and Industry Trends The cryptocurrency exchange landscape continues evolving rapidly throughout 2025. Several trends are shaping market development and platform strategies. Institutional participation has increased significantly following regulatory clarity. Traditional financial institutions are allocating more resources to digital assets. This institutional interest has elevated compliance standards across the industry. Exchanges must demonstrate robust security and regulatory adherence. Additionally, technological innovation continues driving platform development. Layer 2 scaling solutions and cross-chain interoperability have gained prominence. Consumer preferences are also influencing exchange offerings. Demand for diverse asset selection has increased substantially. Investors seek exposure to various cryptocurrency sectors. These sectors include decentralized finance, gaming, and infrastructure projects. Exchanges are responding by expanding their available trading pairs. However, this expansion occurs within regulatory boundaries. The industry has matured beyond its early speculative phase. Sustainable growth now depends on legitimate use cases and regulatory compliance. Recent market data illustrates several relevant trends: Exchange-traded product volumes increased 45% year-over-year Regulatory technology investments reached $5.2 billion in 2024 Blockchain gaming user counts exceeded 50 million globally Institutional custody solutions managed over $150 billion in digital assets Cross-chain transaction volumes grew 300% throughout 2024 Conclusion Coinbase’s addition of SKR and FIGHT tokens to its listing roadmap represents a strategic expansion of the exchange’s potential digital asset offerings, reflecting both the growing diversification of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the platform’s commitment to providing investors with regulated access to emerging blockchain projects. This development occurs within a maturing market environment where regulatory compliance and legitimate use cases increasingly determine long-term viability. While roadmap inclusion does not guarantee eventual listing, it provides valuable visibility into the exchange’s evaluation process and strategic direction. Market participants should monitor official announcements for updates regarding these assets while recognizing that all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent volatility and risk. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a token is added to Coinbase’s listing roadmap? A1: Inclusion on Coinbase’s listing roadmap indicates the exchange is formally evaluating the asset for potential future listing. This represents an early stage in a multi-phase review process that includes technical, security, and compliance assessments. Roadmap addition provides transparency but does not guarantee eventual listing. Q2: How long does it typically take for a roadmap asset to get listed on Coinbase? A2: The timeline varies significantly based on multiple factors. Some assets progress to listing within weeks, while others remain on the roadmap for months without advancement. The evaluation process depends on technical complexity, regulatory considerations, and market readiness. Coinbase does not provide specific timelines for roadmap assets. Q3: Can I trade SKR and FIGHT tokens on Coinbase immediately? A3: No, roadmap addition does not enable immediate trading. These tokens are currently under evaluation for potential future listing. Investors can trade these assets on other cryptocurrency exchanges where they are already listed, but not yet on Coinbase platforms. Q4: What factors does Coinbase consider when evaluating potential listings? A4: Coinbase evaluates multiple dimensions including blockchain security, regulatory compliance, market structure, project team background, token distribution, liquidity characteristics, and broader ecosystem impact. The exchange uses a comprehensive Digital Asset Framework to guide these assessments. Q5: How does Coinbase’s roadmap announcement affect token prices? A5: Historical data shows roadmap announcements often increase trading volume and price volatility for affected assets on other exchanges. However, this effect varies significantly based on market conditions and specific token characteristics. Investors should exercise caution and conduct independent research before making trading decisions based on roadmap announcements.

Buterin made the declaration in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), stating that the Ethereum community will focus on reclaiming user autonomy and trustlessness that have eroded over time due to design trade‑offs in pursuit of mainstream adoption. “2026 is the year that we take back lost ground in terms of self‑sovereignty and trustlessness,” Buterin wrote, signaling a renewed emphasis on empowering users over third‑party intermediaries He added that the transformation will take time to materialize fully, noting that not all goals will be achieved in the next Kohaku release or even in subsequent hard forks. Nevertheless, he argued that the gradual progress will ultimately shape Ethereum into an ecosystem worthy not only of its current standing, but of a far greater role in the broader blockchain landscape. Vitalik says they hope to introduce social recovery wallets and timelocks Over recent years, Ethereum’s developers have quietly put the pieces in place for the needed enhancements. For starters, earlier this year, the Ethereum founder had noted that the ZK-EVM had progressed to alpha status, achieved production-level benchmarks, and shifted its focus to security. In his latest post, he explained that the network will now prioritize a setup that allows users to run nodes locally and independently verify the chain using ZK-EVM and BAL. He also asserted that users on the network can move away from trusting RPCs by default and toward actively verifying the data they deliver. Additionally, he shared that their plan to improve the user experience includes introducing social recovery wallets and timelocks — wallets that prevent losing everything if a seed phrase is lost. Buterin has backed social recovery wallets since at least 2021, and that vision began taking shape last year with the launch of EIP-7702 in Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade. In the last few months, he has also been increasingly vocal about the importance of privacy at both the user and protocol level. In a Friday post, he said privacy-focused design should let users send private payments as easily as standard transactions. So far, even the Foundation has stepped up its privacy agenda, refocusing internal teams and initiating development of the Kohaku wallet framework. It also introduced ERC-4337 and FOCIL, which could enhance the system’s resistance to censorship. Buterin also emphasized that users should be able to access dapps without relying on servers that might become unavailable or compromised. Buterin stressed the need for quantum-resistant cryptography On Monday, the Ethereum founder also stressed the urgent need to implement quantum-resistant cryptography for long-term security. In his earlier post, Buterin expressed his concerns about delaying quantum resistance for the sake of efficiency. He stressed that Ethereum should be able to pass the walkaway test, underlining its purpose as a home for trust-minimized apps. He also outlined the network’s main goals: ensuring complete quantum security quickly; building a scalable system for ZK-EVM and PeerDAS; maintaining a sustainable state model; implementing full account abstraction; designing a DoS-resistant gas pricing system; creating a durable decentralized PoS model; and developing a censorship-resistant block-building method. He argued that completing these infrastructure enhancements over the coming years would be essential for Ethereum’s enduring technological and community strength. He further noted, “Being able to say ‘Ethereum’s protocol, as it stands today, is cryptographically safe for a hundred years’ is something we should strive to get to as soon as possible.” Before, the crypto mogul had also insisted that the network should focus more on decentralization and resilience over efficiency and convenience.

Key Takeaways: The DOJ confirmed it has not sold any Bitcoin forfeited in the Samourai Wallet case. The clarification follows scrutiny over a 57.5 BTC transfer that sparked sale rumors. The forfeited Bitcoin will remain part of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as accumulation plans continue. Patrick Witt, executive director of the White House President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, said he received direct confirmation from the US Department of Justice that the assets were neither liquidated nor earmarked for sale. “We have received confirmation from DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated,” Witt wrote on X on Friday , adding that the Bitcoin would remain part of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 57.5 BTC Transfer Sparks Questions Over US Government Bitcoin Sales Questions first surfaced in November after blockchain analysts flagged a transfer of 57.5 BTC from a government-controlled wallet to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. The movement prompted speculation that US authorities may have sold or planned to sell the funds, drawing criticism from market participants who pointed to Executive Order 14233. Signed by President Donald Trump in March, the order requires that any Bitcoin obtained through criminal or civil forfeiture “shall not be sold” and instead be retained for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Some observers accused the US Marshals Service of violating the directive, allegations now denied following the DOJ clarification. Public data suggests the US government remains one of the world’s largest Bitcoin holders. Figures from Bitcoin Treasuries show federal authorities control 328,372 BTC, valued at more than $31 billion at current prices. UPDATE: we have received confirmation from DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated, per EO 14233. They will remain on the USG balance sheet as part of the SBR. https://t.co/v2GchC3vk8 — Patrick Witt (@patrickjwitt) January 16, 2026 That total includes 127,271 BTC forfeited in October from a Cambodia-based entity accused of running a so-called pig-butchering investment scam. Witt reiterated that expanding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve remains a policy priority. In a recent interview, he said progress depends on coordination between the Treasury and Commerce departments to address outstanding legal and operational issues. Legislative efforts are also underway. A bill sponsored by Cynthia Lummis proposes accelerating reserve accumulation, targeting the acquisition of up to 1 million Bitcoin over five years. The proposal emphasizes budget-neutral methods, with officials saying any accumulation would avoid costs to taxpayers. Trump Signals Possible Pardon for Samourai Wallet Developer Two developers behind Samourai Wallet were sentenced to prison in November after prosecutors said the privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet processed more than $237 million in criminal proceeds. Keonne Rodriguez received a five-year sentence on Nov. 6, while his co-developer, Hill, was sentenced to four years on Nov. 19. Both were also ordered to forfeit roughly $6.3 million in fees earned through the platform. The case took a political turn in December when Donald Trump said he would consider pardoning Rodriguez. Speaking to reporters during an Oval Office event on Dec. 16, Trump said he had “heard about it” and instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the case. Rodriguez later welcomed the remarks, arguing on social media that the prosecution reflected “lawfare” and a weaponized Justice Department under the Biden administration. Trump has previously pardoned Ross Ulbricht and Changpeng Zhao in related crypto cases, and has raised optimism of a similar pardon for Rodriguez.

Lawmakers Amend Framework For Tokenized Securities On Thursday, South Korea’s National Assembly passed key amendments to the Capital Markets Act and the Electronic Securities Act, creating a legal framework for the issuance and distribution of tokenized securities. According to an official government release , the revised rules define tokenized securities as a broad category that extends to both debt and equity products, and recognize them as legitimate financial instruments. The amendments to the Electronic Securities Act will allow qualified issuers to launch tokenized securities using distributed ledger technology. Meanwhile, the Capital Markets Act changes will enable the products to be traded as investment contract securities on brokerages and other licensed intermediaries. Notably, the existing Capital Markets Act prohibited the distribution through securities firms, deeming investment contract securities “unsuitable for distribution due to their non-standard characteristics.” The changes are “expected to enhance accessibility to investments and improve the provision of investment information for these securities,” the official government release stated. After legislative approval, the bill will be submitted to the State Council, followed by official presidential promulgation. Therefore, the legislation is expected to be enacted one year after being signed into law, tentatively in January 2027. Moreover, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is set to lead the implementation, forming a joint “Token Securities Council” with relevant agencies to ensure seamless preparatory work, including the development of supporting infrastructure and enhanced safeguards. The consultation body will comprise the FSC, the Financial Supervisory Service, the Korea Securities Depository, the Financial Investment Association, industry participants, and experts. South Korea’s Crypto Regulatory Push Continues This major step follows South Korea’s efforts to develop and establish clear, comprehensive rules to regulate the local crypto industry. Last week, the government shared its 2026 Economic Growth Strategy, which included a plan to open its market to Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) this year. Crypto-based ETFs have been banned in South Korea since 2017. In 2024, the country’s regulator reaffirmed its stance after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the investment products. However, it has now cited the success of the US and Hong Kong’s crypto funds as a key factor for their shift. The FSC will also accelerate the next phase of its digital asset legislation this quarter to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. As reported by Bitcoinist, South Korea’s Second Phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act was delayed until the start of 2026 due to an ongoing disagreement between the FSC and the Bank of Korea (BOK). The financial authorities have been clashing for months over rules related to the issuance and distribution of stablecoins, disagreeing on the extent of banks’ role in the issuance of won-pegged tokens. Nonetheless, the main policies of the crypto framework have been decided, set to include investor protection measures, such as no-fault liability for crypto asset operators and isolation of bankruptcy risks for stablecoin issuers. Moreover, the country is lifting its long-standing ban on institutional crypto trading, which is anticipated to begin later this year. According to local reports, the FSC is considering a rule to limit corporate cryptocurrency investments at 5% of a company’s equity capital. Under the latest proposal, eligible firms would be able to allocate up to 5% of equity capital per year to digital assets, limited to the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The final draft version could be released as early as January or February.",Crypto News|crypto ETFs|crypto regulation|Financial Services Commission|FSC|South Korea|South korea stablecoins|south korean lawmakers|tokenized securities|total|total crypto market cap,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 08:00:34

For January 2026 alone, the XRP Ledger recorded 1.45 million daily transactions, following a steady upward trend in network usage that began in late 2025, coinciding with the introduction of new payment corridors through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platform and the integration of stablecoins such as RLUSD. Gaps Between XRP Demand And Price Market expert Sam Daodu highlighted in a recent report for 24/7 Wall St. that historical trends suggest that gaps between rising demand and stagnant prices often precede sharp rallies. With exchange reserves at eight-year lows and increasing institutional inflows seen with XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the current situation indicates that the altcoin may be quietly gearing up for its next breakout. Related Reading: XRP Will Skyrocket Beyond $18: Analyst Suggests 800% Growth Potential In 2026 Despite a slight rebound to $2.42 on January 6, which represented a nearly two-month high for the token, its price has since retraced to approximately $2.048 at the time of writing. This decline occurred despite the transaction surge, suggesting that XRP has yet to capitalize on its increased usage. Daodu noted that the discrepancy between XRP’s price and its on-chain activity isn’t unusual. He asserts that such gaps between usage and price have often been precursors to significant price movements, while also pointing out several factors contributing to the current delay in price reaction. Market-wide consolidation is one of the key reasons, as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded sideways in early 2026, dampening momentum for altcoins like XRP. In addition, profit-taking pressure has emerged following XRP’s July 2025 rally up to $3.65. Many short-term holders have cashed out, creating strong resistance levels in the $2.20 to $2.50 range. Until new catalysts arise, Daodu claims XRP may remain confined to this range without breaking out. Is A Major Price Breakout Ahead? Looking forward, Daodu posits that XRP has a historical tendency to lag behind its on-chain progress before initiating explosive price moves. In both 2017 and 2020, spikes in transaction volume and wallet activity preceded significant rallies for the token’s price by several weeks.

A similar scenario unfolded in late 2017, where heightened usage metrics preceded a jump in XRP’s price from $0.30 to $3.30 by early January 2018. This suggests that the current surge in on-chain transactions could be a leading indicator of a delayed price breakout for XRP.

This metric may be used as a proxy for the behavior of the network validators. When the value of the Hashrate goes up, it means new miners are joining the chain and/or old ones are expanding their facilities. Such a trend implies BTC mining is looking attractive to these validators. On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests some of the miners have decided to disconnect their rigs from the network, potentially because they are finding the cryptocurrency to be unprofitable. Now, here is a chart from Blockchain.com that shows the trend in the 7-day average value of the Bitcoin Hashrate over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate set a new all-time high (ATH) around 1,151 exahashes per second (EH/s) back in October. Since this record, however, the indicator’s value has gone down. What’s behind this trend? The answer to that question could lie in the miner revenue. Miners earn their income through two means: block subsidy and transaction fees. Out of these, the former contributes the largest portion to their revenue. Block subsidy remains fixed in terms of BTC value (outside of Halving events, during which they permanently get slashed in half), but its USD value changes alongside the cryptocurrency’s price. Thus, miner revenue is more-or-less dependent on the asset’s price action. Back in October, Bitcoin rallied to a new ATH, so miners responded by upgrading their facilities. When the bullish price action didn’t continue, however, the cohort started pulling back. As a result, the 7-day average Hashrate has fallen to around 998 EH/s, its lowest level in more than three months. Interestingly, the latest continuation of the decline in the indicator has come despite the fact that the cryptocurrency has made some recovery recently. This may be a possible sign that miners aren’t yet convinced by a return of bullish momentum. A potential consequence of the Hashrate decline may be a drop in the Bitcoin mining Difficulty during the next network adjustment. According to data from CoinWarz , miners have taken an average of 10.6 minutes per block since the last adjustment, which is notably slower than the blockchain’s target of 10 minutes. To correct for this, Bitcoin could be forced to decrease its Difficulty by 5.6% in the next biweekly adjustment. However, something to note is that there is still about a week to go until this event, so the network’s response could change depending on how the Hashrate behaves in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $95,500, up more than 5% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin hashrate|Bitcoin Miners|Bitcoin Mining Hashrate|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 08:00:37

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-coach-xrp-will-leave-a-dent-in-the-universe-heres-why/,"In a recent tweet accompanied by a detailed video commentary, finance coach and market commentator Coach JV argued that XRP will play a significant role in what he described as a fundamental transformation of the global financial system. He described digital assets not as short-term trading vehicles, but as components of an infrastructural shift that is already underway. According to Coach JV, the existing financial system is approaching its limits, and new technologies are being integrated to address structural inefficiencies. Coach JV stated that assets such as XRP, Bitcoin, Solana , HBAR, and others should be viewed through the lens of long-term system design rather than speculative opportunity. He emphasized that his focus is not on rapid wealth accumulation but on financial literacy and understanding how money, payments, and custody are evolving. In his words, “the system can’t continue the way it is,” and investors must recognize the depth of the change taking place. XRP Will Leave a Dent in The Universe… pic.twitter.com/CYHi4R0hXa — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 16, 2026 Speed, Regulation, and Institutional Adoption A central theme of Coach JV’s commentary was the alignment between technological progress and financial infrastructure. He drew comparisons between the rapid evolution of communication technology and the need for money to move with similar efficiency. From his perspective, regulation will be a defining factor in determining which digital assets endure, noting that survival through established regulations is essential for institutional adoption. He also argued that traditional banks are repositioning themselves. Institutions that once criticized digital assets, he said, are now preparing to offer custody services and investment exposure. Coach JV suggested that financial advisors will increasingly recommend small allocations to assets such as XRP and Bitcoin , reflecting a shift in institutional attitudes. ETFs, Accessibility, and Market Structure Coach JV devoted significant attention to exchange-traded funds as a likely entry point for mainstream participants. He explained that most individuals will gain exposure to digital assets through regulated products rather than self-custody, describing ETFs as a practical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. While he stated a personal preference for holding the underlying asset, he acknowledged that ETFs offer convenience, regulatory clarity, and reduced operational risk for many investors. He highlighted a Nasdaq MarketSite segment featuring Evernorth and its plans for a public listing, noting comments from Evernorth CEO Asheesh Birla that positioned XRP as a core component of the firm’s digital asset treasury. Birla stated that Evernorth is designed to simplify access for institutions by handling custody, compliance, and security, allowing investors to gain exposure through public markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Strategy Over Speculation Throughout the video, Coach JV returned to the importance of discipline, concentration, and cycle awareness. He cautioned against spreading capital too thin or chasing short-term trends, instead advocating a focused approach centered on assets he believes can withstand regulatory scrutiny. He also emphasizes combining offensive and defensive financial strategies, stressing that markets move in cycles and that preparation matters more than prediction. Coach JV wrapped up his message with an appeal for structured thinking rather than optimism-driven decision-making. His core argument was that understanding systemic change, rather than reacting to price movements, is what positions individuals to navigate the next phase of the financial system effectively.

The exchange and its CEO blamed banks for intervening and pushing for changes that prevent or limit users from earning yields on stablecoins. However, other industry experts disagreed. White House Threatens By citing a source close to the Trump administration, Terrett said the White House expects Coinbase to return with a more suitable agreement that “satisfies the banks and gets everyone to a deal.” She explained that the administration is “said to be furious” with the exchange’s “unilateral” decision on Wednesday, as they reportedly didn’t notify in advance. Moreover, the White House reportedly called the move a “rug pull” against it and the rest of the crypto industry. SCOOP: The White House is considering pulling its support for the crypto market structure bill entirely if @coinbase does not come back to the table with a yield agreement that satisfies the banks and gets everyone to a deal, a source close to the Trump administration tells me.… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 17, 2026 The source further asserted that this is “President Trump’s bill at the end of the day, not Brian Armstrong’s.” Recall that Coinbase pulled its support earlier this week after blaming banks for implementing too many changes that tend to limit users from earning yields on stablecoins. CEO Armstrong outlined numerous issues with the current draft, including: – A de facto ban on tokenized equities – DeFi prohibitions, giving the government unlimited access to your financial records and removing your right to privacy – Erosion of the CFTC’s authority, stifling innovation, and making it subservient to the SEC – Draft amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins, allowing banks to ban their competition Undermining the Bill? Coinbase’s decision caused a lot of controversy outside and inside the cryptocurrency industry. While some experts, such as Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, remained mostly on the sidelines, others, such as Citron Research, directly blamed Armstrong for undermining the bill. They argued that Coinbase’s official reasoning shows fear of competition from tokenized securities firms, as it seeks to benefit from regulatory clarity without opening the door to rivals. The Senate Banking Committee postponed its scheduled markup of the bill on January 15, and no new date has been set yet.

57237331,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262451,1768637411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Binance Delisting: Strategic Removal of BID, DMC, ZRC, and TANSSI Perpetual Futures Shakes Trading Landscape",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-delisting-perpetual-futures-contracts/,"BitcoinWorld Binance Delisting: Strategic Removal of BID, DMC, ZRC, and TANSSI Perpetual Futures Shakes Trading Landscape In a significant market development, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has announced the strategic delisting of four perpetual futures contracts, sending ripples through the digital asset trading community and prompting immediate portfolio reassessments. Binance Delisting Announcement: Key Details and Timeline Binance officially confirmed the removal of four specific perpetual futures trading pairs from its platform. The exchange will delist BID/USDT, DMC/USDT, ZRC/USDT, and TANSSI/USDT contracts precisely at 09:00 UTC on January 21, 2025. Consequently, all pending orders will automatically cancel at that time. Furthermore, traders cannot open new positions for these contracts after the announcement. The exchange strongly recommends users close any existing positions before the deadline to avoid automatic liquidation. This decision follows Binance’s standard quarterly review process for all listed trading products. Perpetual futures contracts, unlike traditional futures, lack an expiry date. Traders use them for leveraged speculation on cryptocurrency price movements. Binance regularly evaluates all listed products against rigorous performance metrics. These metrics include trading volume, liquidity, network stability, and regulatory compliance. The exchange’s review framework aims to protect users and maintain market quality. Therefore, contracts failing to meet these standards face removal from the platform. This process ensures a healthy trading ecosystem for all participants. Understanding the Affected Cryptocurrency Projects The delisting affects four distinct digital assets, each with unique characteristics and market positions. BID (Bidao) functions as a blockchain platform focusing on decentralized finance and stablecoin issuance. DMC (DataMarketCoin) supports data marketplace and storage solutions. ZRC (ZrCoin) originally linked to zirconium dioxide production but has evolved. TANSSI (Tanssi Network) provides appchain infrastructure services for developers. Market data shows declining trading volumes for these assets throughout 2024. Industry analysts note several common factors among delisted assets. Typically, these projects exhibit sustained low liquidity and diminished developer activity. They also often face increased regulatory scrutiny in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, competing projects with stronger fundamentals frequently outperform them. Exchange delistings can significantly impact a project’s visibility and accessibility. However, projects sometimes recover on other trading platforms or through protocol upgrades. The cryptocurrency market naturally experiences continuous evolution and consolidation phases. Historical Context and Exchange Governance Trends Binance has established a clear precedent for periodic contract reviews and removals. The exchange delisted multiple spot and futures trading pairs throughout 2023 and 2024. For instance, it removed ANKR/USDT and MULTI/USDT perpetual contracts in November 2024. These decisions consistently align with the platform’s risk management framework. Major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken follow similar governance practices. They regularly assess listed assets against evolving compliance standards. Regulatory developments significantly influence exchange listing policies. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in the European Union sets stringent requirements. Similarly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission maintains active enforcement posture. Consequently, exchanges proactively manage their product offerings. They aim to preempt potential regulatory challenges and protect user assets. This trend toward stricter governance reflects the industry’s maturation process. Market participants now expect more rigorous standards from leading platforms. Immediate Market Impact and Trader Response Strategies The announcement triggered immediate market reactions across several trading venues. Spot prices for BID, DMC, ZRC, and TANSSI experienced increased volatility following the news. Some traders initiated rapid position closures to avoid last-minute liquidity crunches. Others explored arbitrage opportunities between Binance and other exchanges still listing these assets. Derivatives traders particularly focused on managing their leverage exposure before the deadline. Professional trading firms recommend specific action steps for affected users. First, traders should immediately review all open positions involving these contracts. Second, they must decide whether to close positions manually or wait for automatic settlement. Third, users should explore alternative platforms if they wish to maintain exposure. Fourth, portfolio rebalancing can help mitigate concentration risks. Finally, staying informed about potential relisting announcements on other exchanges is crucial. Risk management remains paramount during such transitional periods. Recommended trader checklist: Audit all current perpetual futures positions Set reminders for the January 21 deadline Research alternative trading venues for these assets Adjust overall portfolio risk parameters Monitor official exchange channels for updates Liquidity and Settlement Process Mechanics Binance will execute the delisting process through a standardized technical procedure. The exchange will disable these trading pairs at the specified time. Then, it will cancel all remaining open orders automatically. Next, the system will settle any open positions at the final mark price. Users will receive their remaining equity in their futures wallets. The entire process typically completes within minutes after the cutoff time. Historical data from previous delistings shows minimal technical disruptions. Liquidity providers and market makers adjust their strategies before such events. They gradually reduce their exposure to affected markets. This action helps prevent sudden liquidity gaps that could disadvantage retail traders. The exchange’s risk management systems monitor order book depth continuously. Binance may intervene if volatility exceeds predetermined thresholds. These protective measures aim to ensure fair and orderly market conditions during the transition. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Market Structure This delisting event reflects larger trends within the digital asset ecosystem. The market continues consolidating around higher-quality projects with sustainable fundamentals. Exchanges increasingly prioritize assets with robust technology and clear regulatory compliance. This evolution benefits long-term investors seeking reduced counterparty risk. However, it may limit access to more speculative early-stage projects. The industry appears moving toward greater institutionalization and standardization. Market analysts observe several structural implications. First, exchange governance decisions now significantly influence asset valuations. Second, projects must maintain strong exchange relationships alongside technological development. Third, cross-exchange liquidity becomes increasingly important for asset resilience. Fourth, regulatory alignment emerges as a critical success factor. Fifth, transparent communication between projects and exchanges gains paramount importance. These developments collectively shape a more mature digital asset marketplace. Conclusion The Binance delisting of BID, DMC, ZRC, and TANSSI perpetual futures contracts represents a calculated governance decision aligning with broader market evolution. This action underscores the exchange’s commitment to maintaining high-quality trading products and protecting user interests. Affected traders must take proactive steps to manage their positions before the January 21, 2025 deadline. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry continues its maturation journey toward greater stability, compliance, and institutional participation. Market participants should view such delistings as natural ecosystem adjustments rather than anomalous events. FAQs Q1: What exactly is Binance delisting on January 21, 2025? Binance will remove four perpetual futures trading pairs: BID/USDT, DMC/USDT, ZRC/USDT, and TANSSI/USDT. The delisting occurs at 09:00 UTC, automatically canceling all open orders. Q2: What should I do if I hold positions in these contracts? You should actively close all positions before the deadline. If positions remain open, Binance will automatically settle them at the final mark price, potentially at less favorable terms. Q3: Will the delisting affect the spot trading of these tokens on Binance? This announcement specifically concerns perpetual futures contracts. However, spot trading pairs for these assets may undergo separate reviews. Monitor official Binance announcements for updates. Q4: Can these tokens get relisted on Binance in the future? Yes, potential relisting remains possible if the projects demonstrate improved trading volume, liquidity, and compliance. Projects must reapply and meet Binance’s current listing criteria. Q5: Where can I trade these assets after the Binance delisting? You may find these perpetual contracts or spot pairs on other cryptocurrency exchanges. Conduct thorough research to identify platforms that list these assets and ensure they operate in your jurisdiction legally.

California AG released the cease-and-desist letter on Friday in response to allegations that Grok was being used to create unlawful content involving kids and nonconsensual adult photographs, which prompted a California state inquiry. Bonta argued that it is illegal to create, distribute, publish, and display CSAM. California AG targets xAI over alleged misuse of Grok Earlier this week, the California attorney general’s office declared that it was looking into xAI due to allegations that the startup’s chatbot, Grok, was being used to produce nonconsensual, inappropriate pictures of women and children. In response, the government sent the corporation a cease-and-desist letter. “Today, I sent xAI a cease and desist letter, demanding the company immediately stop the creation and distribution of deepfakes, nonconsensual, intimate images, and illegal child abuse material. The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to comply immediately. California has zero tolerance for illegal child abuse imagery.” – Rob Bonta , California Attorney General. The AG’s office further asserted that xAI seems to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual, inappropriate photos, which are then “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” According to the AG’s office, one research found that over half of the 20,000 photos produced by xAI between Christmas and New Year’s showed persons wearing very little clothing, some of whom looked like children. Rob Bonta claimed in the announcement that the corporate practices violated California civil laws, including California Civil Code section 1708.86, California Penal Code sections 311 et seq. and 647(j)(4), and California Business & Professions Code section 17200. The California Department of Justice anticipates xAI will affirm its efforts to address these issues and take immediate action to resolve them over the next five days. However, X’s safety account had previously condemned this type of user behavior. It clarified on January 4 that it takes action against illicit content on X, such as CSAM, by deleting it, suspending accounts indefinitely, and collaborating with law authorities and municipal governments as needed. Notably, on January 4, Elon Musk warned that anyone using or prompting Grok to create illegal content will face the same consequences as if they uploaded it. Attorneys general intensify pressure on AI firms over child safety An unsettling increase in non-consensual adult content has resulted from the development of free generative AI tools. This issue has been plaguing several platforms, not only X. For instance, Attorney General Bonta and Attorney General Jennings of Delaware met with OpenAI in September of last year to voice their serious concerns about the growing number of reports about how OpenAI’s products interacted with youth. In August of the same year, AG Bonta, along with 44 other Attorney Generals, sent a letter to 12 leading AI companies following reports of inappropriate interactions between AI chatbots and children. The letters were sent to Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Google, Luka Inc., Meta , Microsoft, Nomi AI, OpenAI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI. AG Bonta and the 44 Attorney Generals informed the companies in the letter that states across the country were closely monitoring how companies develop their AI safety policies. They also emphasized that these businesses have a legal duty to children as consumers since they profit from children using their products. In 2023, AG Bonta joined a bipartisan coalition of 54 states and territories in sending a letter to congressional leaders advocating for the establishment of an expert committee to investigate the potential use of AI to exploit children through CSAM. The coalition requested that the expert commission suggest laws to shield kids from such mistreatment. “The production of CSAM creates a permanent record of the child’s victimization,” according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Evernorth aims to change that by bringing XRP to Wall Street as a familiar, publicly traded asset. Evernorth aims for a Q1 2026 Nasdaq IPO under ticker XRPN, offering investors direct XRP exposure without the hassle of wallets or compliance. Unlike typical crypto firms, it will actively manage an XRP treasury , buying from the open market and deploying assets into regulated yield strategies. During a recent interview, Evernorth CEO Asheesh Birla acknowledged that today's crypto landscape is unlike past cycles: institutions now benefit from clearer regulations, supportive policies, and growing investor demand for digital assets within familiar market framework. Birla said, “It was a record-breaking few weeks with XRP ETFs. That’s great news. That shows that there is a demand from the public market to gain exposure to XRP, a digital asset that is at the forefront of the financial revolution on blockchain.” Well, Evernorth leverages existing momentum by offering XRP exposure through a Nasdaq-listed public-equity structure, sidestepping the compliance and custody hurdles of direct crypto ownership. Investors simply buy Evernorth shares, while the company manages XRP holdings, treasury strategy, and DeFi participation behind the scenes. This model mirrors how institutions access commodities or digital assets via public vehicles, creating a compliant bridge for pensions, asset managers, and funds restricted from holding crypto directly. Beyond passive holdings, Evernorth plans to actively manage its XRP treasury, deploying assets into vetted DeFi strategies to generate yield and boost shareholder value. If executed successfully, the company could serve as both an XRP proxy and a digital asset income engine. With a potential Q1 2026 IPO, Evernorth could redefine XRP’s institutional story, offering regulated, stock-like exposure to the token and making it as accessible as buying shares on Wall Street. Conclusion Evernorth’s Nasdaq IPO could transform institutional crypto access. By offering XRP through a regulated, publicly traded vehicle, it eliminates custody and compliance hurdles, providing investors a secure, familiar gateway to the booming digital asset market.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 08:24:03

Steak ’n Shake made the announcement on Saturday through the company’s official X account, eight months after it began accepting Bitcoin payments in its US restaurants. The rollout began in May after weeks of teasers, and the company says it has seen improvements in same-store sales thanks to the Bitcoin initiative. “Eight months ago today, Steak n Shake launched its burger-to-Bitcoin transformation when we started accepting bitcoin payments. Our same-store sales have risen dramatically ever since.” The post added that all Bitcoin payments are funneled directly into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, with the latest purchase increasing exposure by “$10,000,000 in notional value,” the fast food company wrote . Steak ‘n Shake boasts of being the first restaurant with a Bitcoin reserve Steak ’n Shake is claiming a first-mover position among restaurant chains, saying it “made history as the first major restaurant to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” The company did not disclose the timing or execution details of the $10 million Bitcoin acquisition, nor whether it was purchased in a single transaction or accumulated over time. Our newly remodeled Steak n Shake leans hard into nostalgia. Funded by beef tallow and bitcoin 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/2Z0gfRjMgp — Steak 'n Shake (@SteaknShake) August 29, 2025 At the Bitcoin 2025 conference held that month, Chief Operations Officer Dan Edwards told attendees that the bitcoin payments had delivered immediate financial benefits for the Steakburgers maker. He mentioned that Bitcoin payments were cutting processing costs by 50% compared to fiat payment methods, while increasing transaction speeds at the register. “Bitcoin is a win for the customer, it’s a win for us as the merchant, and it’s a win for you in the Bitcoin community,” Edwards said during his remarks at the event. Steak ’n Shake confirmed all Bitcoin payments received will be retained in their digital currency form instead of being converted to dollars, a policy that directly feeds the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The firm reported an increase of about 10.7% in sales during the second quarter, followed by a 15% increase in the third quarter. Per Dan Edwards, its third-quarter performance exceeded that of competitors in the fast-food category, including McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Starbucks. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey lauded the restaurant by sharing images in June showing he had spent $100 in Bitcoin for meals. Steak ’n Shake has also woven Bitcoin into its menu and promotions through the Bitcoin Burger, a menu item featuring a bun stamped with the Bitcoin logo, alongside a Bitcoin Meal program, which takes funds from purchases to charitable and customer rewards. Last October, Steak ’n Shake said it would donate 210 satoshis from every Bitcoin Meal sold to Open Sats Initiative, Inc. over the next 12 months. However, the company has yet to provide an estimated total donation amount. Those who purchase and register a Bitcoin Steakburger or Bitcoin Meal can receive $5 in Bitcoin through the Fold app. The process requires customers to upload their receipt to a dedicated website, receive a redemption code, and activate an account within the Fold app to claim the reward. In November last year, the fast food chain took its operations into El Salvador after participating in the country’s Bitcoin Histórico event. El Salvador was the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a decision that executives purportedly resonated with. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This demand, first reported by Bloomberg on March 15, 2025, emerges not from financial necessity for the world’s wealthiest individual but from a profound dispute over the founding principles of artificial intelligence. The case, set for trial in late April in Oakland, California, represents one of the most consequential legal battles in tech history, pitting a visionary founder against the AI giant he helped create. Elon Musk OpenAI lawsuit: Unpacking the $134 billion damages calculus Financial economist C. Paul Wazzan, an expert witness with extensive experience in complex commercial litigation, prepared the damages analysis for Musk’s legal team. Wazzan’s calculation rests on a foundational premise: Musk should receive compensation equivalent to what an early investor would typically earn when a startup achieves extraordinary success. Specifically, Wazzan determined Musk deserves a substantial portion of OpenAI’s current estimated $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation in 2015. This methodology yields a potential 3,500-fold return on Musk’s initial investment. Furthermore, Wazzan’s analysis incorporates more than just financial contributions. It accounts for Musk’s technical expertise and business guidance during OpenAI’s formative years. The economist calculated wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI itself and an additional $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, its major partner. Musk’s attorneys argue this compensation framework reflects standard startup economics. Early investors who provide capital and strategic direction during a company’s vulnerable initial phase typically expect outsized returns if that company becomes a market leader. Consequently, they contend Musk’s requested damages represent the financial value of his early, risk-taking support. The contextual backdrop of unprecedented wealth The sheer magnitude of Musk’s damages demand becomes even more remarkable when viewed against his current financial standing. According to the latest Forbes billionaires list, Musk’s personal fortune now approaches $700 billion. This figure exceeds the wealth of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by approximately $500 billion. In November 2024, Tesla shareholders separately approved a historic $1 trillion compensation package for Musk. This corporate pay deal remains the largest in recorded business history. Against this backdrop of almost incomprehensible wealth, a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a significant sum by any ordinary measure. However, it would constitute a relatively modest percentage increase to Musk’s existing net worth. This financial context fuels OpenAI’s characterization of the lawsuit as strategic rather than financial. Company representatives have described Musk’s legal actions as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment.” They suggest the case serves purposes beyond monetary recovery, potentially involving competitive positioning or philosophical disagreement about AI’s future direction. Expert analysis: Legal precedents and valuation challenges Legal experts following the case note several unprecedented aspects. First, damages calculations in breach-of-contract or fraud cases typically focus on actual financial losses, not hypothetical investment returns. Second, valuing a private company like OpenAI at $500 billion involves substantial estimation, as the firm hasn’t conducted a recent public funding round. Third, attributing specific valuation increases to individual founders presents complex causal challenges. Technology companies grow through collective efforts of teams, market conditions, and technological breakthroughs. Isolating one person’s contribution, especially from the earliest days, requires sophisticated economic modeling that courts may scrutinize heavily. Finally, the case intersects with evolving legal standards for nonprofit organizations that transition toward commercial models. OpenAI began as a nonprofit research lab dedicated to developing safe artificial intelligence for humanity’s benefit. Its subsequent creation of a for-profit subsidiary and partnership with Microsoft forms the core of Musk’s allegations about mission abandonment. The core allegation: Mission drift and breached trust Musk’s lawsuit fundamentally alleges that OpenAI defrauded him by departing from its original nonprofit mission. When Musk co-founded the organization in 2015 alongside Sam Altman and others, the stated goal was to develop artificial intelligence safely and distribute its benefits widely. The organization’s charter explicitly prioritized humanity’s welfare over shareholder returns. The complaint argues that OpenAI’s 2019 restructuring and subsequent Microsoft partnership violated these founding principles. Specifically, Musk contends the organization effectively became a closed-source, for-profit entity primarily serving Microsoft’s commercial interests. This alleged shift, according to the lawsuit, constitutes a fundamental breach of the trust and agreement under which Musk provided his early support. OpenAI has consistently defended its evolution. Company statements emphasize that the partnership with Microsoft provided essential resources for developing advanced AI systems like GPT-4. They maintain that their work continues to prioritize safety and broad benefit, even within a structure that includes commercial elements. Comparative perspective: Tech industry founder disputes The Musk-OpenAI conflict follows other notable disputes between founders and the companies they helped establish. For instance, Facebook’s early legal battles with the Winklevoss twins involved allegations of stolen ideas rather than mission drift. Similarly, Uber’s conflicts with former CEO Travis Kalanick centered on governance and culture, not fundamental purpose. What distinguishes the current case is its focus on ethical and structural transformation. The lawsuit alleges not merely contractual breach but betrayal of a philosophical commitment to AI safety and accessibility. This dimension introduces novel questions about how courts evaluate promises made during a technology organization’s idealistic beginnings. Furthermore, the involvement of Microsoft adds another layer of complexity. As a strategic partner providing substantial computing resources and investment, Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s direction becomes relevant to the damages calculation. The lawsuit suggests Microsoft benefited improperly from OpenAI’s alleged mission shift, hence the inclusion of Microsoft in the damages claim. Broader implications for AI governance and ethics Beyond the immediate legal and financial stakes, the case raises profound questions about AI development governance. If successful, Musk’s lawsuit could establish precedent regarding the obligations of AI organizations to their founding principles. It might influence how courts view transitions from nonprofit to commercial structures in the technology sector. The trial also highlights ongoing debates about concentrated power in artificial intelligence. With a handful of companies controlling advanced AI capabilities, questions about accountability, transparency, and equitable access grow increasingly urgent. Musk’s allegations touch directly on whether commercial incentives inevitably undermine commitments to safety and broad benefit. Additionally, the case demonstrates how personal relationships among tech leaders can shape industry trajectories. Musk, Altman, and other OpenAI founders initially collaborated based on shared concerns about AI risks. Their subsequent divergence illustrates how strategic disagreements among influential figures can escalate into legal confrontations with industry-wide consequences. Conclusion The Elon Musk OpenAI lawsuit represents far more than a financial dispute between billionaires. At its core, the case grapples with fundamental questions about innovation, ethics, and accountability in artificial intelligence development. The staggering $134 billion damages figure underscores the immense value created in the AI sector, while the contrast with Musk’s $700 billion fortune reveals the suit’s symbolic and strategic dimensions. As the trial approaches in Oakland, California, the technology world watches closely. The outcome could influence how AI companies structure their organizations, how they honor founding commitments, and how courts evaluate damages in cases involving rapidly evolving technologies. Regardless of the verdict, this legal battle has already illuminated the tensions between idealism and commercial reality that define contemporary artificial intelligence development. FAQs Q1: Why is Elon Musk suing OpenAI for $134 billion? Elon Musk alleges that OpenAI defrauded him by abandoning its original nonprofit mission to develop safe AI for humanity’s benefit. His lawsuit claims the organization’s shift to a more commercial model, including its partnership with Microsoft, violated founding agreements. The $134 billion damages figure represents what an expert witness calculates as Musk’s rightful share of OpenAI’s current value based on his early contributions. Q2: How does Musk’s $700 billion fortune affect the lawsuit? Musk’s extraordinary wealth makes the financial damages less significant to his personal net worth, reinforcing OpenAI’s argument that the lawsuit constitutes “harassment” rather than legitimate financial grievance. The contrast highlights that the case primarily concerns AI ethics, governance, and alleged breach of trust rather than monetary need. Q3: What is OpenAI’s response to the allegations? OpenAI has characterized Musk’s legal actions as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment.” The company defends its evolution, arguing that partnership with Microsoft provided necessary resources for developing advanced AI safely. OpenAI maintains it continues to prioritize beneficial AI development despite structural changes. Q4: Who is C. Paul Wazzan and how did he calculate the damages? C. Paul Wazzan is a financial economist specializing in valuation and damages in complex commercial litigation. He calculated Musk’s potential damages by estimating what return an early investor would receive from OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation, considering both Musk’s $38 million seed funding and his non-financial contributions during OpenAI’s founding period. Q5: What broader implications does this case have for AI development? The lawsuit raises fundamental questions about AI governance, ethical commitments, and how organizations transition from nonprofit ideals to commercial realities. The outcome could influence legal standards for founder agreements, AI safety accountability, and how courts evaluate damages in rapidly evolving technology sectors.

Democratic Party representatives in the Financial Services Committee sent a letter to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, asking the regulator if it knowingly retreated from enforcing laws on Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. The policymakers, led by Rep Maxine Waters, said the commission has dismissed or closed at least a dozen crypto-related cases, including actions it had previously deemed legally sound. Several of those cases had already survived motions to dismiss and received favorable rulings from federal judges. “Given the industry’s history of investor-harm and the clear mandate of the securities laws to protect market participants, this turn raises troubling questions about the SEC’s priorities and effectiveness. Frankly, it puts both investors and the US economy at risk,” wrote the representatives. SEC left cases with clear probable cause, lawmakers argue In the letter, Democrats bashed the SEC for turning away from “meritorious” litigation even though the courts had already validated the commission’s claims. The lawmakers said this pattern has fueled perceptions that enforcement decisions are being influenced by outside interests and the Trump administration. Waters and her colleagues mentioned that the Commissions’ actions occurred while crypto executives and firms gave financial support to the US president and his allies. But according to the letter, securities laws require the Commission to protect market participants, regardless of their political biasness. They devoted significant attention to the SEC’s dismissal of its case against Binance after it sued the crypto exchange and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, in June 2023 for securities violations. The entity accused the company of deceptive practices, conflicts of interest, and running businesses in America without proper registration. Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to Bank Secrecy Act violations in Binance’s compliance failures and served a prison term, which he was pardoned for by US President Trump last year. In June 2024, US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson upheld most of the SEC’s allegations and allowed the case to proceed. The court found that the regulator had plausibly alleged fraud and unregistered securities activity in its token listings and services. Despite that ruling, the SEC dismissed the case with prejudice in May 2025 while “exercising discretion,” away from a judgment on the merits of its claims. Liberals said the dismissal was concerning, given the seriousness of the allegations and the court’s findings, in addition to the Trump administration’s pardon of Zhao, claiming the POTUS was making sure he and his companies “would avoid accountability.” Coinbase and Kraken cases were also dropped The documents also talked about the Commissions’ retreat from its actions against Coinbase and Kraken, where federal judges had also shunned the companies’ attempts to dismiss the lawsuits, much like the Binance case. The SEC charged Coinbase in June 2023 with operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, alongside failing to register its staking services. In the following year, a federal judge sided with the Commission and ruled that certain tokens sold on Coinbase qualified as securities under federal law. Fast forward to February last year, the commission reached an agreement with the US-based crypto trading platform to dismiss the case, citing the pending work of its Crypto Task Force as justification for ending the litigation. Kraken was facing similar allegations in a lawsuit filed in 2023, but the Commission and Kraken jointly moved to dismiss the case last March. FSC members Rep. Waters, Sean Casten, and Brad Sherman surmised that the choice to drop cases against crypto firms came at a time when political donations were pouring into the US government, with at least $85 million to President Trump’s reelection campaign. The firms whose cases or investigations were dismissed included Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, Robinhood, and Crypto.com, which all supposedly donated at least $1 million to Trump’s inauguration each.

Key Takeaways: Anchorage Digital is seeking $200 million to $400 million in funding as it prepares for a potential IPO next year. Its federally chartered crypto bank status positions the firm to benefit from new U.S. stablecoin and digital asset rules. Anchorage is expanding stablecoin, custody and wealth management services as institutional demand grows. The company is seeking between $200 million and $400 million in fresh funding, with an initial public offering under consideration for sometime next year, according to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter . Anchorage’s Federal Bank Charter Gives It an Edge Anchorage’s growing ambitions are tied closely to its regulatory standing. Its affiliate, Anchorage Digital Bank National Association, became the first federally chartered crypto bank in the United States in 2021. That status has increasingly set Anchorage apart from rivals, particularly as Washington moves to formalize rules around stablecoins and digital asset infrastructure. Following the passage of the GENIUS Act in July, Anchorage is positioning itself to play a central role in stablecoin issuance and related services. Chief executive Nathan McCauley said in September that the firm plans to double the size of its stablecoin team over the next year, anticipating a surge in demand for dollar-backed digital tokens from banks, fintech firms and global institutions. “2025 was our year of scale,” an Anchorage spokesperson told Bloomberg, pointing to a series of acquisitions, new partnerships and the launch of stablecoin issuance as key milestones. ANCHORAGE DIGITAL SEEKS $200M FUNDING ROUND AS IPO PLANS TAKE SHAPE Crypto custodian Anchorage Digital is seeking to raise $200 million in new funding as it moves forward with plans for a potential public listing. The fundraising effort underscores continued institutional… pic.twitter.com/7Un0hfBw4a — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) January 17, 2026 One of the most notable partnerships involves Tether, with the two firms announcing plans last year to launch a U.S.-focused stablecoin known as USAT. Beyond stablecoins, Anchorage has built a broad suite of services aimed at institutional clients, including custody, trading and staking for banks, hedge funds and venture capital firms. The company has also expanded into wealth management, acquiring Securitize for Advisors and integrating token lifecycle management through Hedgey to deepen its reach across tokenized assets. Anchorage is not new to large funding rounds. In late 2021, the firm raised $350 million in a round led by KKR & Co, with participation from Goldman Sachs, GIC and Apollo credit funds, valuing the company at more than $3 billion at the time. Crypto Firms Line Up for IPOs as Anchorage Prepares Public Debut Anchorage’s IPO ambitions come as other major crypto firms also line up for public listings. Custody rival BitGo filed confidential IPO paperwork last year, while crypto exchange Kraken submitted its own filing in November and is targeting a debut in early 2026. Bitpanda is also lining up for a Frankfurt stock market debut in the first half of 2026, putting one of Europe’s biggest retail crypto platforms on a path from bull market beneficiary to public market test. Last year, tZero Group, a New York–based blockchain infrastructure firm focused on tokenized securities and real-world assets, announced that it is preparing to go public in 2026 . Before that, BitGo officially filed for an initial public offering , becoming the first dedicated crypto custodian to pursue a listing on a US stock exchange.

Whale inflows to Binance have hit their lowest since 2021, with the 30-day moving average dropping to 48–56M XRP. This signals minimal selling pressure and a strong HODL mindset among the largest holders. This trend signals rising XRP scarcity on exchanges. As whales hold rather than move tokens, liquidity tightens and supply shrinks, reflecting investor confidence and patience, often a precursor to major rallies. Notably, U.S. trading hours have emerged as a key catalyst in sparking these price surges. Market sentiment shows cautious optimism as XRP holds $2.06 , well above the key $2 support. Low whale activity and steady price action signal accumulation over selling, boosting trader confidence. Why does this matter? Well, retail investors should take note that XRP whales are holding, signaling confidence in an imminent price surge. With supply tightening on exchanges, the token may be primed for its next upward move. Therefore, XRP’s on-chain data signals a bullish surge as whale inflows to Binance hit multi-year lows, accumulation rises, and price stability builds investor confidence. Historically, low selling from major holders often sparks explosive rallies. With supply tightening and committed holders, XRP could be primed for its next major move, making it a key watch for traders and long-term investors alike. Conclusion Whale activity indicates a shift from short-term trading to long-term holding. With XRP above $2 and inflows at multi-year lows, supply tightens as confidence grows. Historically, such quiet accumulation precedes major rallies, signaling a potential upward leg and making whale behavior a key market indicator.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 08:50:35

The dispute has raised fresh doubts about whether Washington can reach a compromise between crypto firms, banks, and lawmakers. White House Signals It Could Walk Away A source close to the Trump administration said the White House could drop its backing for the bill if Coinbase refuses to agree on yield rules. The source said the administration wants an outcome that satisfies banks and keeps negotiations moving. Besides, officials reportedly felt blindsided by Coinbase’s actions this week. They viewed the move as a setback for the wider push to pass the bill. The source also suggested the White House sees the bill as a national policy effort, not a single-company campaign. Consequently, the administration does not want any firm to shape the process alone. The anger reportedly stems from what officials described as an unexpected and independent shift by Coinbase. Coinbase Pushes Back on the Draft On Wednesday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the company cannot support the Senate Banking Committee draft as it stands. He argued the proposal could damage innovation across key crypto sectors. Additionally, he warned that parts of the bill could restrict tokenized equities and tighten rules around decentralized finance. Armstrong also raised concerns about broader government access to financial records. He said the draft could weaken privacy protections for users. Moreover, he criticized the balance of power between regulators. He argued the bill could reduce the CFTC’s role while giving more influence to the SEC. Stablecoins have also become a central point of tension. Armstrong said the bill could limit yield-style rewards on stablecoins. Hence, he suggested lawmakers may aim to shield banks from stronger competition. Banking groups have warned that stablecoin yields could pull deposits away from traditional savings products. Lawmakers Look for a Path Forward The wider crypto community has split over Coinbase’s approach. Some users supported its stance and blamed banks for blocking change. However, others worry that the conflict could stall progress at a critical moment. Several senators have said they still want to move the bill forward. Senator Mark Warner said lawmakers can find a way to keep talks alive. Still, the timing remains unclear, and some observers expect delays into February. Senator Cynthia Lummis also signaled the process may slow down as stakeholders reassess next steps. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz predicted the CLARITY Act could pass within two weeks after recent Senate meetings.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 08:52:39
57238400,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=876224,1768640420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/57238400.jpeg,"XRP Poised To Move On Its Own, Separate From Bitcoin: CEO",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-poised-to-move-on-its-own-separate-from-bitcoin-ceo/,"For a market that usually moves in one direction, some voices are starting to say this time might look a little different. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg said XRP could move on a different path from Bitcoin this year, pointing to enterprise use cases as a key reason. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 He made the remarks during a podcast with host Paul Barron, and outlined a cautious view of Bitcoin while singling out protocols tied to real-world tokenization. According to McClurg, the shift in focus toward practical applications may help a small set of tokens behave differently than the wider market. XRP And Hedera Seen As Practical Picks McClurg named the XRP Ledger and Hedera as examples of networks that could benefit from enterprise adoption and tokenization efforts. He argued that platforms with clear utility — like payment rails, tokenized assets, or stablecoin infrastructure — have a better chance of holding value when speculative momentum fades. Reports have disclosed that he does not expect these assets to race higher; instead, modest gains are the likeliest outcome, with growth described as low double-digit rather than explosive. Bitcoin Faces Additional Downside McClurg turned more negative on Bitcoin. He said he believes Bitcoin peaked on October 6, 2025, at $126,200. Since that date Bitcoin has slipped roughly 35% to about $95,800. He warned that prices could fall another 20–30% over the next six to nine months, which would place BTC roughly between $65,000 and $77,000 before the end of the cycle. Based on his view, a new all-time high is not expected in 2026 and the market may be entering a deeper correction. Markets Could Still Move Together Critics point out that altcoins often suffer greater losses when the market experiences a downturn, and history supports that caution. Liquidity tends to dry up during big Bitcoin sell-offs, and even assets with real use cases can be pushed lower in a broad risk-off episode. In layman’s phrasing, XRP might fall less than Bitcoin and therefore look stronger in comparison, but outright independence from Bitcoin is rare and usually temporary. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps Relative Outperformance The More Likely Outcome According to McClurg’s perspective, what is most realistic is relative outperformance rather than complete separation. That means XRP and similar tokens could remain flat or show modest positive returns while Bitcoin weakens. Such a pattern would still be notable for holders and for enterprises planning tokenization projects, but it falls short of a dramatic price surge.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-this-xrp-pattern-changes-everything-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) has published a video outlining a comparison that links XRP’s current positioning to a major commodity reversal from recent history. His focus was not on short-term noise. He pointed to a pattern that unfolded when oil markets faced widespread doubt, then moved sharply higher. In the video, Steph compared XRP’s current position to that of oil in 2020. Sentiment leaned heavily against oil before the price accelerated rapidly. Steph presented this parallel as a way to think about XRP’s current price structure and potential upside. This #XRP pattern changes everything! pic.twitter.com/TYnqdaR2Xl — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 14, 2026 Context Around XRP’s Position XRP trades at $2.09 at the time of his analysis. The asset experienced a slight resurgence in early 2026 , but it remains close to the $2 support level. Despite this, XRP remains one of the most liquid digital assets in the market. It also sits at the center of Ripple’s payment-focused infrastructure. Long-term holders continue to track XRP as a macro asset rather than a speculative token. Steph did not dwell on short-term indicators. He treated XRP as an asset that has already endured an extended period of compression . This set the stage for the oil comparison that followed. The Oil Comparison From 2020 Steph highlighted the oil market between 2020 and 2022. During that period, oil prices surged roughly 1,450%. The move followed a phase in which sentiment collapsed, and confidence disappeared. Oil then entered a sustained expansion that caught many observers off guard. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steph argued that XRP now occupies a comparable psychological and structural position. He noted that when everyone thought it was over for oil, its price exploded. He immediately connected that thought to the present. He believes that XRP is about to explode because many market participants have discarded it and are selling too early . Where is XRP Going? A 1,450% move represents a 14.5x increase from the starting price. Applying that scale to XRP’s current price of $2.09 produces a projected level near $32.4. Steph’s analysis centered on how markets behave after extended disbelief phases, especially when liquidity and visibility already exist, and it shows a strong correlation between both assets. Steph’s thesis places XRP in a longer cycle narrative. He presented oil’s recovery as evidence that deeply discounted assets can reprice aggressively once conditions align. The video positions XRP as an asset that could experience a similar breakout if the cycle he outlined plays out.

According to reports, the dissatisfaction was expressed to company executives at a recent meeting held in the country. This puts Ireland on a long list of countries worried about the implications of the actions of the chatbot. Over the last few weeks, countries and their leaders have called out the platform, its owner, Elon Musk, and its chatbot, Grok. This is because some users are now taking advantage of the chatbot to generate sexualized images of women and children. While some countries have threatened legal sanctions, others have called on the platform to take measures to protect children and women from being digitally abused. Ireland wants X to take corrective measures In the meeting, Artificial Intelligence Minister Niamh Smyth hailed the corrective measures that the company said it had taken to curb the menace. This was after the executives told her that Grok had been disabled from removing or reducing clothing on individuals worldwide. The new development came after the platform confirmed that it will ‘geoblock’ the ability of X and Grok users to create images of people in limited outfits. In its statement, the platform mentioned that these requests will be halted only in regions where the actions have been deemed illegal. During the meeting, the Irish AI Minister expressed her concerns that nonconsensual intimate imagery and child sexual abuse materials were being generated and posted on the public platform. She told the company executives that the sophistication of the safeguards needs to match the sophistication of the technology. However, Smyth noted that her concerns remain regarding Grok as a standalone application, noting that the Irish government will need to examine it further. She added that she will continue to monitor the situation closely. Niamh also added that she is scheduled to hold an in-person follow-up meeting with executives from X in the future to ensure that adequate and enduring protections against the technology remain in place. Countries continue to criticize X and its Grok chatbot The renewed criticism comes after the platform allegedly failed to curb the generation of the menace after it pledged to halt and suspend users who generate them. During the period, UK communication watchdog Ofcom noted that it had made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what they are doing to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. The regulatory body mentioned at the time that it would assess whether an investigation is necessary. After its statement, the government of Indonesia announced that it had taken decisive action concerning the chatbot. The country mentioned that the chatbot will remain temporarily banned, citing the need to protect its women and children from the dangers of AI-generated explicit content. “The government views non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and citizens’ security in the digital space,” the country said. The development came after Australian PM Anthony Albanese threw his weight behind countries criticizing the platform, calling on them to do what is right in terms of protecting its vulnerable users. The eSafety Office of Australia mentioned that the number of reports it received was relatively small; it noted that there has been a rise in reports in relation to the incident compared to previous years. The watchdog vowed to use its powers as defined in the Australian Online Safety Act to remove these contents. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The movement, involving 18.32 million LAYER valued at approximately $3 million, occurred just 26 minutes prior to the report’s publication, highlighting the real-time nature of blockchain transparency. Consequently, this event provides a critical case study in project treasury management and market signaling. Analyzing the Solayer LAYER Deposit to Binance The core transaction data reveals precise figures. According to the on-chain intelligence platform Onchainlens, the specific wallet address transferred exactly 18,320,000 LAYER tokens. Based on prevailing market prices at the time, this equated to a substantial $3 million valuation. Following this Binance crypto deposit, the same wallet retains a significant balance of 16.56 million LAYER, worth an estimated $2.7 million. This residual holding indicates the move was not a full liquidation but a strategic partial transfer. Blockchain analysts routinely monitor such wallets associated with project teams, as their actions can signal various operational needs, from treasury diversification to preparing for exchange liquidity provisions. Contextualizing Team Wallet Activity in Crypto Transactions from wallets linked to core development teams are never viewed in isolation. Instead, they form part of a broader narrative concerning project health and insider confidence. Typically, team token movements fall into several predictable categories: funding operational expenses, providing liquidity on decentralized or centralized exchanges, or executing planned vesting schedules. For instance, a large, unexpected deposit to a major exchange like Binance can sometimes precede increased selling pressure, potentially affecting the LAYER token’s market price. However, it may also simply facilitate necessary financial operations. The table below outlines common reasons for team-controlled wallet movements: Reason for Movement Typical Market Interpretation Vesting Schedule Unlock Planned, predictable, often neutral Liquidity Provision Generally positive for ecosystem growth Operational Funding Neutral, seen as standard business practice Large, Unplanned Exchange Deposit Can signal caution, leading to short-term volatility Therefore, understanding the context behind this Solayer team wallet activity is crucial for accurate assessment. The Solana ecosystem, which hosts the Solayer project, has established itself as a hub for high-throughput decentralized applications. Projects within it are often held to high standards of transparency regarding token allocation and team holdings. Expert Perspective on Treasury Management Signals Industry observers emphasize the importance of communication following such events. “A transparent project often pre-announces large treasury movements or provides a clear rationale shortly after they occur on-chain,” notes a veteran crypto-economist who specializes in tokenomics. This approach builds trust within the community. The lack of immediate public commentary from the Solayer team, while not unusual in the immediate aftermath, will likely prompt questions. Analysts will now monitor for follow-up transactions, official statements, or changes in exchange order book depth for LAYER. Furthermore, they will compare this action to the project’s original token distribution plan outlined in its documentation. Key metrics for watch include: Remaining Treasury Balance: The $2.7 million still held suggests ongoing runway or future planned use. Exchange Inflow Metrics: Aggregators will track if this deposit correlates with a spike in overall LAYER exchange inflows. Price Action Correlation: Analysts will study any immediate or lagged effect on the LAYER/USD trading pair. This event underscores a fundamental principle of decentralized finance: blockchain data is public, but interpretation requires nuance. A single transaction does not define a project’s trajectory but serves as one data point in a complex financial landscape. The Broader Impact on Solayer and Market Perception The immediate impact of this $3 million deposit extends beyond the transaction itself. Market participants use tools like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana to track these flows in real-time. Consequently, the speed at which Onchainlens reported the activity demonstrates the mature infrastructure for blockchain surveillance. For the Solayer project, this event tests its relationship with its holder community. Proactive communication can mitigate potential fears of a sudden sell-off. Historically, projects that maintain open dialogues about treasury management, even for routine operations, foster stronger, more resilient communities. Moreover, this incident highlights the evolving expectations for project teams in 2025, where sophisticated on-chain analytics are accessible to all market participants. Conclusion The reported deposit of $3 million in LAYER tokens from a Solayer team-linked wallet to Binance represents a significant on-chain event worthy of analysis. While the exact motive remains unconfirmed by official sources, the transaction provides a clear window into the continuous and transparent nature of blockchain-based asset movement. Monitoring the Solayer LAYER deposit and the team’s subsequent communication will be essential for understanding its strategic implications. Ultimately, this event reinforces the critical importance of transparency and well-communicated tokenomics in building sustainable cryptocurrency projects within the modern digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened with the Solayer team wallet? A wallet identified by on-chain analysts as belonging to the Solayer team transferred 18.32 million LAYER tokens (worth $3M) to the Binance exchange. The wallet still holds an additional 16.56 million LAYER. Q2: Why do people monitor team wallets? Team wallet activity can provide insights into a project’s financial strategy, signal potential future selling pressure, or indicate routine operational moves like vesting or liquidity provisioning. Q3: Does this mean the Solayer team is selling their tokens? A deposit to an exchange like Binance often, but not always, precedes a sale. It could also be for other purposes like providing liquidity or converting tokens for operational expenses. The intent is not confirmed solely by the deposit. Q4: How was this transaction discovered so quickly? Blockchain intelligence firms like Onchainlens use automated systems to track large transactions from known wallets, especially those linked to project founders or treasuries, and report them in real-time. Q5: What should LAYER token holders do in response to this news? Holders should seek official communication from the Solayer team for context, monitor credible market analysis for interpretation, and avoid making impulsive financial decisions based on a single data point.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2026? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2026 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.08181 Market Cap $235.62M Trading Volume (24-hour) $17.74M Circulating Supply 3.22B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.08262 24-h Low $0.07907 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.56% (High) 50-Day SMA $ 0.08855 14-Day RSI 43.11 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) 200-Day SMA $ 0.2173 Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : SONIC Price is consolidating after a recent move with mixed momentum Key support is being tested while resistance caps upside A clearer trend depends on stronger volume confirmation Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Sonic’s daily chart shows a short-term corrective phase following a strong early-January rally. Price surged toward the $0.095–$0.10 area but failed to hold above that zone, triggering profit-taking and a gradual pullback toward $0.082. Recent candles show smaller bodies, suggesting selling pressure is slowing. The MACD histogram has faded toward neutral, indicating weakening bullish momentum rather than a full bearish reversal. As long as Sonic holds above the $0.078–$0.080 support range, the broader structure remains constructive. A period of consolidation is likely before the next directional move, with buyers watching for stabilization and renewed volume. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the price has recently bounced after testing a lower support zone, suggesting buyers are stepping in at discounted levels. Momentum appears mixed, with the market struggling to maintain a clear upward trajectory after the rebound. Short-term highs are getting capped near a nearby resistance area, indicating some selling pressure still exists. Price is forming smaller candles, which signals indecision and potential consolidation rather than a strong breakout. If the current support holds, a gradual recovery could develop, but a breakdown below it would likely invite further downside. Overall, the structure leans toward range-bound movement with cautious sentiment. Sonic technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.09121 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.08464 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.08495 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.08334 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.08855 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.1233 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.2173 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.09059 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.08977 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.08653 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.08484 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.09848 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.1389 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.2162 SELL What can you expect from the Sonic (prev.FTM) price analysis next? Based on the current technical structure, Sonic is likely to enter a period of short-term consolidation as the market digests its recent moves. Price may oscillate between nearby support and resistance levels rather than trending in a straight line, reflecting mixed momentum and cautious trader sentiment. If buyers can defend key support, a gradual recovery attempt could follow with higher lows forming. However, failure to hold this level would increase the risk of a deeper pullback toward the next demand zone. Volume will be important, as a clear breakout requires stronger participation. Overall, expect choppy movement in the near term before a more decisive trend develops. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.1518 price by 2026 and $0.6729 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Why is Sonic (Prev FTM) down today? Sonic is down today because short-term profit-taking is outweighing buying interest after the recent upside attempt. Price approached resistance near the prior high and was rejected, triggering sellers to step in and cap further gains. Momentum indicators on the 4-hour chart have flattened and turned mildly bearish, suggesting buyers are losing short-term conviction. Additionally, lower trading volume on green candles compared with red ones indicates weaker demand. This, combined with broader market caution in risk assets, has led traders to reduce positions, resulting in intraday downside pressure. Until Sonic reclaims resistance with confirmation, downward moves remain more likely. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $0.5624 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $0.6729. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2032, S could attain a price of about $1.45. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $0.5624 and $1.45, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

In this context, a TradingView analysis shared on January 16 by TradingShot was based on a long-term cycle model that combines halving timelines, moving averages, and Fibonacci time extensions. The analysis suggested that Bitcoin is approaching a key technical test at the daily 200-day moving average ( MA ), a level that has historically triggered the second phase of bear cycles. Past behavior indicates that such rejections often lead to extended downside pressure rather than short-lived pullbacks, signaling a shift from a distribution phase into a deeper retracement. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, the rainbow cycle chart supports this view by aligning price action with halving events and Fibonacci time extensions . The next major time target is the 4.618 Fibonacci extension in the final week of September 2026, a zone that has previously marked cycle lows. At that point, the model projects Bitcoin trading around $60,000, a sharp decline from cycle highs but still consistent with its long-term uptrend. Notably, the outlook added that this projected bottom would occur well ahead of the next halving, estimated for April 2028, meaning the market would remain far from the next profit-taking phase. Bitcoin’s failure to hit $150,000 Additionally, Bitcoin’s failure to reach the upper orange rainbow band in the latest bull cycle above $150,000 reinforces the idea of diminishing returns, with each cycle delivering smaller percentage gains. This bearish outlook comes at a time when Bitcoin has attempted to target the $100,000 level before slightly retreating. The asset briefly reignited bullish optimism earlier this week, mainly driven by institutional inflows after breaking out of a prolonged consolidation near $90,000 and rallying to nearly $98,000. The move raised expectations that traders positioned for sideways or lower prices would be forced to unwind, potentially pushing the cryptocurrency back above the $100,000 mark. However, the momentum has faded just as quickly. Instead of extending the rally, Bitcoin has reversed course and is now showing signs of weakness, increasing the likelihood of a pullback toward the low-$90,000 range. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,123, down about 0.4% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe, the leading digital asset was up more than 5%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a moving average perspective, the 50-day SMA at $90,095 remains below the current price, signaling short-term bullish momentum as Bitcoin trades above this level, potentially indicating near-term upward pressure. In contrast, the 200-day SMA at $105,657 remains above the current price, suggesting longer-term bearish undertones or an ongoing correction from prior highs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s 14-day RSI of 63.30 remains neutral, avoiding overbought territory and implying room for further gains without immediate reversal risks, although it warrants monitoring for shifts in buying strength.

This is coming after UK ministers responded to the backlash faced by Grok, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot, by fast-tracking legislation to ban the generation of non-consensual intimate images. According to the former UK lawmaker, the country is following a “what-a-mole” approach to regulating big technology companies. While there has been increased support for the law, experts have also warned that the changes may not go far to limit the harms posed by generative AI chatbots. “It looks like we are behind the curve, because we are,” says Harriet Harman, a former deputy Labour leader. “And it looks like we’re running to catch up, because we are. And it looks like we’ve got a scattergun approach, because we have.” Former lawmaker says the UK is behind in AI regulation According to the former UK lawmaker, this includes the country failing to clarify what the law should classify as “intimate” imagery. Although in the US, lawmakers have described it as depicting nudity or underwear, backbenchers and ministers have argued that the creation of non-consensual images of women and children in bikinis and wet T-shirts using Grok shows a significant weakness in the approach. Technology secretary Liz Kendall has also noted that the law is being aimed at nudification applications and may not even apply to Grok. According to Clare McGlynn, a professor of law at Durham University, the nudification ban is not a solution that will tackle the generation of sexual images with Grok, noting that it won’t even apply to the chatbot. The offense is designed to apply only to applications developed for the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery. On the other hand, Grok is seen as a general-purpose artificial intelligence model capable of predicting images, text, and code, and would most likely be outside the scope of the law. In a letter to Labour MP Chi Onwurah, Kendall mentioned that Grok might not be covered under the proposals. She mentioned that during the analysis, they identified that not all chatbots were covered under the scope of the law. However, she noted that officials have been commissioned to look into it so as to address the gap. Experts warn about the risks of AI chatbots Last Wednesday, X released a statement, noting that it would geoblock the ability for users to generate images of real people in skimpy outfits, like bikinis, underwear, and similar attire, in areas where it is currently illegal. It remains to be seen if similar images can still be generated using the standalone Grok application or the website. xAI , Grok’s parent company, did not disclose if that would be the case or if the enforcement would cover these parts. The debate is unfolding against rising concerns about violence against women and girls (VAWG) carried out using technologies. Reports claim that around one in 10 recorded offenses involving VAWG already has a digital element, something that experts believe significantly underestimates the true scale. Younger people are prone to more risks as they spend more time online. According to campaigners, artificial intelligence can be a harm accelerant. The group also mentioned that AI allows abuse to be generated and shared on a larger scale. Meanwhile, experts have warned that other AI-chatbot controversies are likely to emerge in the future. Michael Birtwistle, associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute, an AI research body, mentioned that future flashpoints could include children being targeted with sexual interactions from chatbots or AI assistants dispensing questionable health or financial advice to their users.

Most big caps that have been already valuing years of growth are slowing down. Smaller assets that have real utility and those that are underdeveloped tend to exhibit more upside on entering major roadmap events. A recent crypto that attracts attention within this category can be Mutuum Finance, and analysts believe that it can be among the cheapest opportunities available prior to its protocol becoming live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Space Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol which will enable users to provide and issue crypto assets using smart contracts. The project follows a systematic presale system with the fixed pricing stages. The first market entrants bought at $0.01, and the token is being sold at the current stage of Phase 7 at $0.04. The price that is established is assured to be launched at $0.06. The presale has brought up more than $19.8 million and has increased the number of holders to more than 18,800 investors. Over 825 million out of the 4 billion tokens have been bought. Approximately 45.5% or 1.82 billion tokens are to be distributed in presale. Analysts observe that the demand has not been volatile since players are placing bets before the activation window of the protocol as opposed to listing. V1 Launch Mechanics Based on the official X announcement , the V1 protocol is fixed to launch testnet before mainnet. This is significant since lending platforms are usually priced at first when their use becomes evident. Markets can now have real data on which to value rather than make guesses about narrative power when users start to post collateral, borrow money, and repay interest. The deposits will be issued as mtTokens by Mutuum Finance. These tokens are the deposit value and the interest that is generated on borrowers. The model builds supplier yield and promotes holding, rather than selling. Mutuum Finance will also involve a buy and distribute mechanic in the future. Some of the protocol revenue will be spent to purchase MUTM in the open market. MUTM sold at the market is recredited to the users who commit mtTokens at the safety module. This model matches the buy pressure and actual use and not the short-lived hype cycles. Those analysts following the adoption models indicate that at early valuation cycles, MUTM has the potential to reach between $0.18 and $0.24 in case V1 acquires moderate activity. At the current price of $0.04, this would be an increase of between 350% and 500%. These estimates indicate how analysts are setting up scenarios when lending revenues are the basis of a projection and not just sentiment. Roadmap Milestones The main asset of borrowing within the protocol will be stablecoins. Borrowers are able to gain access to liquidity without selling long-term assets. Borrowing of stablecoins usually increases during bull cycles as traders borrow more in order to get leverage as the value of collateral gains. Mutuum Finance also intends to incorporate the Layer 2 networks to minimize the liquidation expenses and enhance the speed of executing the operations. To uphold solvency, liquidations should occur swiftly in the fluctuating markets. The layer 2 support will enhance the likelihood of effective collateral management during such times. Chainlink and fallback valuation Oracle price feeds will ensure precision in valuation during such liquidation events. Post-launch valuation modeling analysts believe that once the stablecoin borrowing and Layer 2 activity goes to magnitude in 2027, MUTM could be trading between $0.26 and $0.30. This is an implication of the fact that range suggests an increase of about 550% to 650% relative to the current presale price of $0.04. Security and Infrastructure Before deployment, a number of security steps have been undertaken at Mutuum Finance. Halborn Security conducted an audit of V1 lending code. CertiK token scan gave 90 out of 100 points to the MUTM token. There is a bug bounty of $50,000 currently in place to find more vulnerabilities prior to mainnet activation. There has also been good participation infrastructure. A leaderboard with rewards of 500$ of MUTM to the best daily contributor is created to encourage contributions. The card payments are encouraged in cases where users want to onboard without going through the complicated wallets. The token is currently valued below $0.05, and V1 is on the verge of launching, so analysts consider that Mutuum Finance can be one of the most inexpensive deals in the new crypto and DeFi lending market in 2026.

Belgium’s KBC Bank has opened regulated crypto trading, Iran’s ecosystem surged past $7.8 billion amid unrest, and a Jefferies strategist warns of quantum computing risks. Together, these developments highlight Bitcoin’s dual role as a growth asset and hedge, while technical charts point toward a possible breakout. Belgium Bank Opens Crypto Trading Belgium’s KBC Bank will allow customers to trade Bitcoin and Ether starting February 16 through its Bolero platform. The move coincides with the full rollout of the Markets in Crypto‑Assets (MiCA) framework, which went live in January 2026. KBC says it’s the first Belgian bank to offer crypto trading directly under its own custodial system, giving retail investors a regulated and secure entry point.

The launch underscores growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin in Europe, even as regulatory details remain in flux. Iran’s $7.8B Crypto Surge Iran’s cryptocurrency ecosystem expanded to $7.78 billion in 2025, with activity peaking during nationwide protests and economic unrest. As the rial collapsed and internet blackouts spread, citizens turned to Bitcoin as a store of value and financial lifeline. Daily withdrawals from exchanges surged, highlighting crypto’s role in bypassing traditional banking restrictions.

BTC Chart Shows Bullish Flag and EMA Support Near $95K Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC is trading near $95,188, holding firm above the $95,150 support zone. The 4‑hour chart shows a clear ascending structure with higher lows and a potential bullish flag formation just below $97,700 resistance. A breakout above this level could open the path toward $99,000 and the psychological $100,500 barrier. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview BTC remains above short‑, medium‑, and long‑term EMAs, all sloping upward, signaling sustained momentum. RSI readings at 57.94 and 53.56 are neutral but lean bullish, leaving room for continuation. Candlestick action adds weight to this view, with a recent bullish engulfing pattern near $93,000 and small‑bodied candles suggesting consolidation before another push higher. Candlestick behavior supports this view. Recent formations include a bullish engulfing pattern near the $93,000 level and a series of small-bodied candles, potentially signaling a pause before continuation. If price holds above $95,150 and breaks above $97,700 with volume confirmation, traders may consider long setups targeting $99,000 and $100,500, with stop-losses below $93,000. If price holds above $95,150 and breaks $97,700 with volume confirmation, traders may eye long setups targeting $99,000–$100,500, with stops below $93,000. With sentiment stabilizing and adoption expanding, Bitcoin looks poised for a fresh bullish leg. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $30.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013585 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

According to the official website of Ukraine’s cyber police unit, two Ukrainian nationals were revealed as active members of the group, with an unnamed Russian citizen as the alleged organizer. That individual has been placed on an international wanted list through Interpol, German authorities confirmed. The actions came through a joint investigation by Ukraine, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Europol , which was also part of the supporting agencies in the probe, said Black Basta is one of the most dangerous cybercrime operations in recent years. Russian-based ransomware network involved in years of cyberattacks According to Ukraine’s investigative unit, Black Basta has been active since at least early 2022. The group is accused of launching ransomware attacks against corporations, hospitals, and public institutions in Western countries it considers “economically viable.” The group supposedly caused damages estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros between 2022 and 2025 on industrial and healthcare organizations in Europe and the United States, and distributed private information to hacking networks. The two Ukrainian suspects had mounted their base in western Ukraine, working with other hackers to breach the security of corporate systems and extract login credentials. After obtaining employee authorization data, they used it to enter internal company systems and expand admin privileges and access to company files. The stolen access was used to disable critical systems, and malicious software was deployed to encrypt data for the attackers to demand ransom in exchange for restoring access. Raids in western Ukraine uncover digital and crypto evidence As reported by the Ukrainian police, authorized searches were carried out at residences in the Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv regions, suspected to have been where the cyber criminals lived. During the raids, officers seized crypto , although they did not disclose the value or type of digital assets seized. The authorities had previously conducted searches at the request of foreign partners in Kharkiv and surrounding areas, which targeted other suspected group members. The German investigations team believes a Russian national founded and led the group, and he was part of another notorious ransomware and cyber-extortion operation. At the request of Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office and Frankfurt prosecutors, Interpol channels were used to issue the wanted notice. “Black Basta as a top-tier cybercrime threat, Law enforcement agencies from multiple countries and a significant threat to global cybersecurity,” Ukraine cyber police wrote in its statement . Concluding its report on the case, the agencies reiterated that no single country could dismantle such networks alone and urged more nations to open doors for sharing intelligence reports. Ukraine and Russia’s crime syndicate extends to Austria Almost two months ago, Austrian police arrested two suspects linked to a fatal crypto robbery, identified as Ukrainian men aged 19 and 45. The victim was a 21-year-old Ukrainian national whose body was discovered burnt shortly after midnight hour mark of November 26. The remains were found inside a burned Mercedes with Ukrainian license plates in the Donaustadt district of Vienna. When emergency responders arrived at the scene, they found the charred vehicle, but forensic police later recovered a melted gasoline canister from the back seat. Per the reports of local news outlets, the crime began earlier that night near the SO/Vienna hotel at an underground parking garage. Security footage showed a confrontation between the victim and two men, with witnesses reporting a loud exchange of words in the garage. A hotel guest contacted the front desk, who then alerted police, but officers got there well after the individuals had already left the scene. The victim was supposedly forced into his own vehicle and driven to the Donaustadt district. He was then assaulted and forced to surrender passwords to two cryptocurrency wallets that were later emptied. Austrian media reported the victim suffered severe injuries during the assault and died before the vehicle was set on fire.

Key Takeaways: Newrez will begin counting certain crypto holdings as qualifying assets for mortgages starting in February. Borrowers will be able to use Bitcoin, Ether and stablecoins without selling them, subject to risk adjustments. The move targets younger buyers and aligns with ongoing US policy discussions on crypto in mortgage underwriting. The change is expected to take effect in February and will apply across the lender’s non-agency products, including home purchases, refinancings and investment properties. Newrez to Count Bitcoin, Ether and Stablecoins as Mortgage Assets Under the new approach, Newrez will allow eligible crypto holdings to be considered alongside traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, removing a long-standing requirement for borrowers to liquidate their digital assets before applying. At launch, the lender said it will recognize Bitcoin, Ether, spot exchange-traded funds backed by those assets, and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. The assets must be held with US-regulated crypto exchanges or fintech platforms, brokerages, or nationally chartered banks. Newrez said crypto valuations used in underwriting may be adjusted to reflect market volatility, while borrowers will still need to cover closing costs and make mortgage payments in US dollars. The lender emphasized that the policy is designed to integrate crypto within existing risk controls rather than overhaul its underwriting standards. Chief commercial officer Leslie Gillin said the decision reflects changing investor behavior, particularly among younger buyers. JUST IN: Major US lender Newrez to recognise crypto for mortgage qualification. Bitcoin is the new collateral pic.twitter.com/1GEyMzHuoT — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 16, 2026 About 45% of Gen Z and Millennial investors hold cryptocurrency, Gillin said, adding that recognizing digital assets could help broaden access to homeownership for groups that have struggled to enter the housing market. Newrez’s move comes as US policymakers continue to debate how cryptocurrencies should factor into mortgage risk assessments. In June 2025, the Federal Housing Finance Agency directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to study how crypto assets could be considered in single-family mortgage underwriting without first being converted into dollars. Shortly afterward, Cynthia Lummis introduced the 21st Century Mortgage Act, which would codify that directive into law. Lummis argued that housing affordability challenges are increasingly affecting younger Americans, many of whom hold a significant share of their savings in digital assets. The bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, where it has yet to advance. Interactive Brokers Enables 24/7 Account Funding With Stablecoins Interactive Brokers has expanded its crypto services by allowing clients to fund brokerage accounts with stablecoins that are automatically converted into US dollars. The new feature enables 24/7 deposits using USDC across multiple blockchain networks through a partnership with zerohash, removing delays tied to traditional wire transfers. Once received, stablecoins are converted into dollars and credited directly to client accounts, letting investors begin trading within minutes. Interactive Brokers said support for Ripple USD and PayPal USD will launch next week, building on USDC funding that was first introduced for retail clients in December. The brokerage said the move addresses a key friction point for global investors, as wire transfers can be slow and costly.

57239725,https://timestabloid.com/?p=95191,1768644056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 Penny Cryptos That Could Lead the 2026 Bull Run,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-penny-cryptos-that-could-lead-the-2026-bull-run/,"The next crypto bull cycle is already taking shape, and attention is shifting toward affordable tokens that combine community power, real utility, and mass adoption potential. Penny cryptos have always been magnets for retail investors because small price movements can create outsized returns. As markets mature, projects that blend hype with infrastructure are positioned to dominate 2026. Among the leading contenders are Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), and the rising newcomer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , whose presale momentum is drawing serious interest from long-term builders and yield-focused users. The project has a total supply of 4 billion tokens and has already generated around $19.80 million across all presale phases combined. The current presale price stands at $0.04 in phase 7, where 180 million tokens are allocated and 7% of this phase has already been sold. More than 18,850 holders are already participating across all phases, showing strong early demand. The token remains at a discounted stage, meaning investors who buy now are positioned better than those who wait for later phases when the price will rise again. For example, someone purchasing at $0.04 in phase 7 will pay less than buyers in phase 8 at $0.045 or phase 9 at $0.05, creating a clear advantage for early entry. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) entered the market as a playful experiment but evolved into one of the largest retail communities in crypto. Millions of holders, constant social activity, and regular ecosystem upgrades keep SHIB relevant even in quiet markets. Its Layer-2 network Shibarium is designed to lower fees and support real applications, which is gradually shifting SHIB from pure meme status toward utility-based relevance. Looking toward 2026, several market analysts expect SHIB to benefit from renewed retail participation during the next bull run. If broader market liquidity returns and Shibarium adoption expands, SHIB is positioned to revisit previous highs and potentially push beyond them. A realistic path suggests SHIB could move toward the $0.00005 to $0.00008 range by 2026, driven by burn mechanisms, transaction growth, and stronger exchange activity. While this would still be a fraction of a cent, the%age gains would be significant for long-term holders. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) stands apart from most penny tokens because it focuses on academic research, scalability, and real-world use cases rather than short-term hype. Its proof-of-stake design makes it energy efficient, and its layered architecture allows continuous upgrades without breaking existing systems. Over the past few years, Cardano (ADA) has expanded into smart contracts, decentralized applications, and defi crypto solutions that attract developers and institutions. By 2026, Cardano (ADA) is expected to be far more mature in terms of adoption. With improvements like Hydra scaling, better interoperability, and deeper DeFi liquidity, ADA could see substantial price growth. Many market projections place ADA in a range between $3 and $6 during a strong bull market, especially if institutional partnerships increase and network usage accelerates. Unlike meme coins, Cardano (ADA) grows through steady development rather than viral trends. This makes it a safer bet for investors who want long-term stability combined with high upside potential. In a mixed portfolio of penny cryptos, ADA represents reliability while still offering strong appreciation potential in the next cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters this landscape with a clear mission: to build a lending and borrowing ecosystem that rewards real participation. Unlike speculative tokens, its value is anchored in utility. The platform is developing its V1 of the protocol on the Sepolia Testnet, which will include a core liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial assets such as ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral use. A key innovation is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending models, which include Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users interact directly with a smart contract liquidity pool, making deposits and withdrawals simple and automated. Interest rates adjust based on supply and demand, ensuring efficiency. In the P2P model, lenders and borrowers connect more directly, allowing customized terms while still using blockchain security for settlement. Together, these systems give users flexibility, transparency, and control. Security has been a major focus for the project. In November 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts underwent a formal audit by Halborn, a respected blockchain security firm. The review identified six issues, including one high-severity finding, all of which were fully resolved before final approval. Halborn confirmed that 100% of the reported findings were remediated, strengthening confidence as the project moves toward its official launch. Growth for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be driven by real usage. Every lending, borrowing, or staking activity will create demand for the token. Users who deposit assets will receive mtTokens representing their share of the pool and earned interest. These mtTokens can also be used as collateral for further borrowing. At the same time, mtToken holders will be able to stake them in special smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards. The platform will also introduce a buy-and-distribute mechanism that supports long-term price growth. A portion of revenue generated from lending and borrowing will be used to repurchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to stakers, creating continuous buy pressure and encouraging loyalty. As activity increases, more revenue flows back into token purchases, reinforcing upward momentum. A beta version of the platform is expected to launch alongside the official release. This early access will allow users to test lending, borrowing, and staking features before full deployment. As more participants interact with the system, confidence and word-of-mouth promotion are expected to rise, which should naturally support price movement shortly after launch. Community Incentives and Daily rewards Community engagement is another pillar of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already built a following of more than 12,000 on Twitter. A $100K giveaway is going on, with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The project dashboard is already live, allowing investors to track holdings and calculate returns in real time. A Top 50 leaderboard rewards the largest investors with bonus tokens, while a new 24-hour leaderboard offers a daily $500 MUTM prize to the top-ranked user who completes at least one transaction before the reset at 00:00 UTC. When comparing the three projects, each serves a different purpose. Shiba Inu (SHIB) offers cultural momentum and retail excitement. Cardano (ADA) delivers technological strength and institutional credibility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines real DeFi utility with community rewards, audited security, and a growing ecosystem that directly ties usage to token demand.

Time Is Running Out,https://timestabloid.com/xrpl-validator-owning-xrp-will-be-a-dream-to-many-time-is-running-out/,"XRP often appears widely distributed on paper. Wallet counts suggest millions of holders. However, a closer look tells a different story. Recent data shared by an XRP Ledger validator, 24HrsCrypto (@24hrscrypto1), challenges mass ownership and shifts attention to where meaningful XRP supply sits. The distinction is important because raw wallet numbers hide concentration. They also shape expectations around future demand. When ownership narrows, market dynamics change. Owning XRP will be a dream to many..and time is running out. When you strip out dust wallets and count meaningful XRP holders (1,000 – 500,000 XRP) you’re left with ONLY 1.2 million accounts. Even if you assume 1 wallet = 1 human (which is generous)… 1,118,000 ÷ 8.2bn =… https://t.co/O7RiWfDMrw pic.twitter.com/a6bAB141Gc — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) January 14, 2026 What the Wallet Data Shows The charts highlight wallet distribution , showing XRP account balances by range. Millions of wallets hold between 0 and 20 XRP. Another large block sits below 1,000 XRP. These wallets add little weight to ownership analysis. They represent dust balances, inactive accounts, or testing wallets. Once those are removed, the picture tightens fast. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 500,000 XRP total roughly 1.2 million accounts. 24HrsCrypto described this group as “meaningful XRP holders.” He went further. “Even if you assume 1 wallet = 1 human,” he wrote, that group equals “0.0135% of humanity.” The math leads to a clear ratio. “That’s 1 out of every 7,395 people.” The commonly cited figure of over 4 million XRP wallets remains technically accurate. It just lacks context. As 24HrsCrypto put it, “The ‘4M XRP holders’ number is inflated by millions of 0 – 1,000 XRP dust wallets.” This makes XRP holders a class among the population . Concentration Changes the Narrative The charts also show where XRP supply concentrates. Wallets holding 10,000 to 100,000 XRP control billions of tokens. Larger tiers above that hold even more, despite far fewer accounts, and these whales are constantly moving billions of tokens within the ecosystem. This structure points to ownership depth rather than breadth. XRP does not trade like a retail-saturated asset. It trades like one still building its holder base. That matters for price behavior. It also matters for liquidity shifts during periods of increased demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Comes Next for XRP? Narrow ownership creates optionality. New participants do not need to replace existing holders. They only need to join a relatively small group. That dynamic favors expansion phases over saturation. As infrastructure matures, access improves. Custodial platforms, institutional rails, and regulatory clarity all lower friction. Each step widens the potential holder pool without diluting existing supply concentration. The charts show XRP supply already positioned. Large balances sit idle across defined tiers. If demand increases, supply does not need to be reshuffled across millions of wallets. It can move through far fewer hands. That structure supports stability during accumulation phases. It also allows sharp upward repricing when conviction builds. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The government and Holocaust memorial institutions have asked social media platforms to stop the spread of fake images, which they claim are distorting and trivializing history. Concerns were expressed by concentration camp memorial sites and documentation centers in a recent letter, criticizing the surge in so-called AI slop or falsified images, around the Nazis’ killing of more than six million Jews in Germany during World War II. These images include emotional illustrations of invented incidents, such as meetings of concentration camp inmates and their liberators or children behind barbed wire fences. Germany wants to halt the spread of false AI holocaust images In the letter sent by the organizations, they noted that AI-generated content distorts history by trivializing serious events that happened a long time ago. They mentioned that such images could help fuel mistrust among users of authentic historical documents. Wolfram Weimer, Germany’s state minister for culture and media, mentioned that he supported the steps and efforts taken by the memorial institutions in this case, revealing that it is the right step to take. Wolfram also mentioned that he supported their decision to have AI-generated imagery of the ancient incidents marked and, in the cases where necessary, removed from social media platforms. He mentioned that it is a matter of respect for millions of people who were killed and persecuted under the Nazi Germany regime of terror. According to the memorial institutions’ letter, they noted that the creators of the imagery appeared to use it to generate attention online and earn money. The organizations also mentioned that the perpetrators also partly intended to dilute facts, shift victim and perpetrator roles, and spread revisionist narratives. The institutions include memorial centers for Belsen, Buchenwald, Dachau, and other concentration camps where Jews, as well as others, including Roma and Sinti people, were killed. They asked social media platforms to move proactively against fake AI imagery around the Holocaust rather than waiting for users to report it. Holocaust organizations want AI-generated images labeled In addition, they asked the platforms to label them clearly, as they believe it will prevent the users who generated the images from being able to monetize them. The spread of low-quality AI slop, which includes fake text, images, or video, has raised alarm among many experts. They believe it would pollute the information landscape and make it hard for users to separate the truth from falsehood. The incident follows the one that AI firms, notably Elon Musk’s xAI, which owns chatbot Grok, are currently grappling with. The company has been under pressure over the last couple of weeks over certain users generating thousands of sexualized deepfake images of women and minors and spreading them across several social media platforms. The menace has seen several leaders of countries call the company to order, with others asking them to develop the appropriate safeguards to tackle the incidents. Countries like Indonesia have also announced a temporary ban on the chatbot till all is resolved. Meanwhile, the platform has confirmed that it will geoblock the ability of Grok and X users to generate deepfakes of people in locations where the actions are branded as illegal. However, it remains to be seen if the new safeguards will apply to its standalone application or its website. It also remains to be seen if the measures will stop users from generating these kinds of images or will push them to look for new ways to access the service.

Most larger-cap alts are sluggish as well, with little to no movement from ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, and ADA. XMR, though, has plunged hard after its recent rally. BTC Calms at $95K The primary cryptocurrency had a quiet previous weekend but went on the offensive on Monday, surging from $90,000 to $92,000 only to be stopped on a couple of occasions. It finally broke through that barrier on Tuesday and kept climbing to a new multi-month peak of $98,000 on Wednesday evening. This meant that it had added $8,000 in just a few days, and roughly $10,000 since the start of the year. Following such an impressive increase, BTC was due for a pullback, which transpired on Thursday and Friday. The culmination took place yesterday when BTC slipped below $94,500 after reports that Kevin Hessett won’t be nominated by Trump to be the next Fed Chair. Nevertheless, bitcoin bounced off and has remained above $95,000 since then. Its market cap has stalled at $1.9 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins stands still at 57.4%. BTCUSD Jan 17.

Ethereum continues to trade sideways around $3,300, while XRP has defended the $2.05 support.

Monero’s token went on the run in the past week or so, surging to a new all-time high of almost $800. However, it was rejected there and now struggles at $620 after another 12% decline in the past day. ICP has also plunged hard daily, losing 9% of value.

Early Saturday morning, a member of program staff, Jeffrey Weichsel, announced on X that xAI is hiring experienced accountants to help train Grok on tax and accounting matters. “Do you want to prepare taxes for the next 3 months, or would you rather do something meaningful with purpose, helping create a truth-seeking AI that roots out corruption, fraud, and waste? Apply now,” he wrote , sharing a Greenhouse website link to the job application. xAI is training Grok on US taxes As seen in the Greenhouse job link, the Elon Musk-led firm xAI said it is searching for an “AI Accounting tutor” who would help improve Grok’s understanding of accounting, financial reporting, and tax-related issues. They would be required to train the chatbot using proprietary software to label and curate high-quality data, while supporting the development of new AI tasks together with xAI’s technical staff. According to the job description, the trainer will select and solve complex accounting problems from real-world corporate environments like consolidations, internal controls, and compliance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Candidates will also refine annotation tools used in AI training and regularly interpret and execute tasks based on instructions, and critique Grok’s responses to mould its accuracy and consistency in accounting scenarios. Applicants must have at least three years of experience at a Big Four accounting firm working on corporate or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clients. Alternatively, they may qualify through senior corporate positions such as controller, assistant controller, or technical accounting manager at enterprises with reporting requirements. Moreover, the company issued educational requirements that included a master’s degree or doctorate in institutional accounting, or equivalent credentials as a licensed Certified Public Accountant. They must also be comfortable handling accounting resources like regulatory filings, financial databases, and enterprise resource planning systems. Teaching experience and published academic work in accounting journals were also listed as desirable attributes. The position is based either in Palo Alto, California, or on a fully remote basis, and the compensation would range from $45 to $100 per hour, depending on experience, education, and location. However, xAI said it cannot hire candidates based in Wyoming or Illinois and does not offer visa sponsorship. xAI training plea grows amid deepfake lawsuits The hiring push comes at a time when xAI is facing lawsuits over Grok’s generation of sexualized and nonconsensual images. Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, filed a lawsuit against xAI in New York on Thursday, blaming the firm for allowing Grok to generate sexually explicit images of her that were shared on X. “X users dug up photos of St Clair fully clothed at 14 years old and requested Grok undress her and put her in a bikini. Grok obliged,” St Clair’s attorneys surmised, adding that the imagery generated was “de facto non-consensual” and Grok’s developers had “explicit knowledge” that consent was absent. xAI has denied responsibility and countersued Ms St Clair, claiming she violated the company’s terms of service. Even with all the drama going on, the firm announced it raised $20 billion in a funding round held last week, surpassing its initial $15 billion target.

His remarks come at a time when the U.S. crypto industry is facing heightened uncertainty over how future regulation will be structured and enforced. Coinbase’s Withdrawal Shakes Legislative Momentum The debate intensified when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the exchange could no longer support the CLARITY Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at clarifying regulatory oversight of digital assets. The announcement came just hours before a scheduled markup by the Senate Banking Committee , disrupting what had appeared to be coordinated industry engagement with lawmakers. Armstrong described the draft legislation as “materially worse than the status quo,” arguing that it introduced new risks rather than resolving existing regulatory ambiguity. His criticism focused on provisions he said would effectively prohibit tokenized equities, impose restrictions on stablecoin incentives, and raise unresolved privacy issues. The decision marked a sharp reversal from Coinbase’s earlier participation in discussions surrounding the bill. Garlinghouse’s Response Garlinghouse weighed in on the issue during a panel discussion at the CfC St. Moritz conference in Switzerland on January 15. The session examined whether crypto-native firms can coexist with traditional public markets, a topic that closely mirrors the broader regulatory debate unfolding in Washington. During the discussion, Garlinghouse acknowledged that Coinbase’s move caught him off guard. He said he was surprised by how forcefully the exchange rejected the legislation so late in the process. Nevertheless, he stopped short of dismissing Armstrong’s objections, suggesting that several of the concerns raised deserved fair consideration. While recognizing the validity of some of Coinbase’s criticisms, disagreement over legislative language should not derail broader efforts to achieve regulatory clarity . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Industry Support Remains Despite Setback Coinbase’s withdrawal does not represent a collapse of industry support. Garlinghouse revealed that several major players, including Ripple, Circle, Kraken, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, remain committed to working with policymakers to improve the legislation rather than abandoning it. The CLARITY Act aims to define the respective roles of the SEC and CFTC, an issue that has long contributed to regulatory uncertainty for crypto firms operating in the U.S. Garlinghouse had previously expressed optimism about the bill’s potential before it stalled following Coinbase’s exit. While the industry has not yet reached a consensus on the path forward, much of the sector continues to advocate for engagement rather than withdrawal from the regulatory process.

The transaction involved a withdrawal from the Kraken exchange, showing 20,000 ETH moved to the firm’s wallet. Based on on-chain data, withdrawals made by whales from exchanges have historically suggested accumulation rather than liquidation. The withdrawal reflects the intent to move funds to a cold storage for long-term holding rather than immediate sale. Bitmine ETH accumulation hits 4.07M ETH Bitmine recently accumulated another 24,068 ETH on Wednesday, valued at approximately $80.57 million. The firm now holds 4.07 million ETH worth approximately $13.37 billion and represents 3.36% of ETH’s total supply. Tom Lee’s firm now ranks as the second-largest crypto treasury, behind Strategy, which holds 687,410 BTC, worth approximately $65.4 billion. It seems that Tom Lee( @fundstrat )'s #Bitmine bought another 20,000 $ETH ($65.4M) from #Kraken 3 hours ago. https://t.co/TQmP08vgjv https://t.co/DPN3ZPwXAk pic.twitter.com/ovs3VUqJu6 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 16, 2026 The Ethereum token has jumped over 6% over the past week following a series of accumulations recorded by the treasury firm. At the time of publication, ETH was down 0.64% to $3,293. The recent moves follow Bitmines’ plans to launch its MAVAN (Made in America Validator Network) staking solution this year, in order to maintain its lead as a global crypto treasury firm. Tom Lee, chairman of Bitmine , pitched the MAVAN solution as a design strategy that moves the treasury firm from accumulation to monetization through validator operations. “We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN). This will be the ‘best-in-class’ solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026.” – Tom Lee , Chairman of Bitmine The launch of the MAVAN solution will help move his firm to become the largest staking provider across the crypto landscape, according to the Chairman. During the recent annual meeting on 15th January, Tom Lee urged Bitmine’s shareholders to vote to increase the authorized shares. He explained that Bitmine’s charter has an unusual feature requiring 50% of all outstanding shares to support a share increase. According to him, the clause limits the authorized share increase; therefore, there is a need to pursue the increment immediately to avoid slowing accumulation. Bitmine’s stock jumps over 4% this week Bitmine’s current total staked ETH stands at 2,155,656, valued at $7 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence data . This represents an increase of more than half a million since last week. So far, the CESR (Composite Ethereum staking rate) is 2.81% according to Quatrefoil data . Tom Lee outlined that if ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners, the firm could realize an annual staking fee of $374 million at a 2.81% CESR. Bitmine’s stock has jumped 0.94% today following the news of accumulation trading at $31.16. The stock has recorded an over 4% increase, with an average volume of $45.39 million over the past five days following a series of accumulations. Meanwhile, Ethereum-focused treasuries hold approximately 13.1 million ETH , including those focused on staking and ETF strategies. Sharplink is the largest competitor to Bitmine, with current accumulation standing at 863.02 K ETH valued at $2.84 billion, followed by The Ether Machine treasury firm. The Ether Machine now holds 496.1K ETH, valued at $1.64 billion. U.S. Ethereum ETFs now hold approximately 6.31 million ETH valued at approximately $20.67 billion. That is roughly 5.2% of the total ETH supply. Based on data delivered by SoSoValue, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted $12.94 billion since its launch, representing more than 50% of the market share across ETH ETFs.

The flagship cryptocurrency reignited debates about the current phase of the market in its latest attempt to reclaim its six-figure valuation. Having surpassed the previously formidable $94,000 technical level, the Bitcoin price seemed set to cross the $100,000 mark again. However, recent on-chain evaluation has brought focus on an ongoing phenomenon among a specific set of investors in the market. Bitcoin Price Action Could Hinge On STH Realized Price In a January 16 post on the X platform, pseudonymous crypto analyst Darkfost revealed that the average realized price of the Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs) is another key level to watch. This price level represents the average price where the most recent (1-3 months) set of BTC investors acquired their coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tailwind: Cathie Wood Sees ‘Reaganomics On Steroids’ Ahead According to data highlighted by Darkfost, this STH realized price currently sits at around $102,000, meaning that the majority of the Bitcoin short-term investors are at a loss. The market pundit noted that this particular evaluation is adjusted to account for the 800,000 BTC recently moved by Coinbase. Darkfost noted that, as the Bitcoin price approached the realized price of the short-term holders, the investors are caught between two primary choices. It is either this group of investors holds and hopes for further upside, or they exit once they break even. Given that they are the most reactive set of investors, the Bitcoin short-term holders have not hesitated in taking short-term profits, as indicated by the latest exchange inflows. Darkfost, however, noted that the STH realized price level will be crucial to watch once all the profit-taking is done. Darkfost said that the Bitcoin price trading below this cost basis historically represents a good accumulation opportunity. Nevertheless, the analyst warned that bear market periods should be excluded, as short-term holders tend to witness prolonged drawdowns and pain during this season. STH Cost Basis Key For Momentum To Re-Accelerate Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish agreed in a recent post on X that the STH average realized price is a key inflection point. According to the market pundit, the Bitcoin price reclaiming this cost basis would signal that recent buyers are back in profit. Beamish stated that reclaiming the STH realized price would be necessary for bullish momentum to re-accelerate, while failure to do so would keep the BTC market in recovery mode. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around at $95,300, reflecting no significant change in the past day.

At the same time, market charts show mixed short-term forecasts for NVDA and renewed focus on the Ethereum–Nvidia ratio as traders assess shifting relative momentum. Jefferies Lifts Nvidia Target to $275 as CES Pipeline Extends to 2028 Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis raised the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $275 from $250 and kept a Buy rating on the stock. He pointed to the company’s rollout of new accelerator builds and the related model roadmap, which he said now stretches through 2028. Curtis framed the update around fresh product signals coming out of CES and the start of the new year. He said the expanded roadmap supports Jefferies’ higher valuation view as Nvidia pushes deeper into next generation data center demand. Nvidia Forecast Signals Near-Term Volatility as Longer Outlook Stays Mixed A price forecast chart for Nvidia shares shows uneven momentum heading into early 2026, with short-term signals pointing higher while longer horizons remain softer. The model projects a five-day price of about $188.82, marking a modest upside from recent levels. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast and Price Prediction 2026 to 2027. Source: CoinCodex However, the tone shifts when extending the view. The one-month and three-month forecasts edge lower, both clustering near $182.60 to $182.70. That divergence suggests near-term resilience followed by cooling momentum as the timeline stretches out. Meanwhile, the longer-range outlook remains gated, with six-month, one-year, and 2030 projections locked. Still, the visible price path shows Nvidia trading in a wide range through late 2025, peaking above $200 before sliding back toward the mid-$180s. As a result, the chart reflects a market balancing strong recent gains against expectations of consolidation in the months ahead. Ethereum–Nvidia Ratio Chart Highlights Fresh Breakout and Retest After Years-Long Downtrend A TradingView chart shared on X tracks the weekly ETHUSD NVDA ratio and marks two prior peaks, labeled “2018 top (January)” and “2021 top (May).” The chart draws a long, descending red trendline from those highs and shows the ratio breaking above that line twice, with a “breakout!” label near the 2020–2021 period and another “breakout!” label near 2025.

During a virtual forum on Thursday, Nadine Chakar stated that DTCC values interoperability and is not in the business of creating a setting where technical constraints prevent digital assets from moving smoothly between blockchains. Chakar said in a statement, “We’re not building walled gardens.” She added, “Interoperability, for me, is being able to move things seamlessly from one chain to another, without risk or extra expenses.” Chakar added that Messaging protocols that facilitate communication within the traditional financial system may one day become a relic of the past. However, they will serve DTCC well as the company moves forward into a world where “every single day, you’ve got somebody launching a new L1,” she added. DTCC expands tokenized securities across multiple blockchains Chakar confirmed that DTCC is dedicated to collaborating with the institutional finance and digital assets sector on interoperability . However , her remarks highlighted the careful approach the incumbent is adopting as it enters a market where North Korea has stolen billions of dollars through sophisticated cyberattacks. To successfully tokenize digital assets, DTCC signaled last month that it will partner with Canton Network, a permissioned blockchain designed specifically for institutions. The firm’s managing director, Brian Steele, explained that the decision to partner with Canton Network was in response to Wall Street’s operational demands by providing after-hours financing and enhancing market makers’ liquidity. According to Steele, each blockchain will likely have distinct features and an environment that make it suitable for its intended use. However, Steele noted that DTCC will use evaluation criteria for future expansions, including security and resilience, while also taking customer demand into account. “DTCC’s partnership with Digital Asset and the Canton Network is a strategic step forward as we collaborate across the industry to build a digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges the traditional and digital financial ecosystems and provides unmatched scalability and safety.” – Frank La Salla , CEO of DTCC. Frank further claimed that the partnership develops a path for bringing real-world, high-value tokenization use cases to market, beginning with U.S. Treasury securities and eventually extending to a wide range of DTC-eligible assets across network providers. However, several crypto-natives criticized the concept. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, a digital asset securities company funded by BlackRock, cast doubt on the tokens’ status as representations of protected assets rather than “native” to the network. In response, DTCC reiterated that its top objective is to allow customers to select from a variety of blockchains, as long as they adhere to strict security and institutional resiliency standards. Apart from Canton , DTCC announced it intends to provide tokenized securities on “AppChain,” an open-source, permissioned network for apps that is compatible with Ethereum . SEC approves DTCC’s expanded ACS Triparty clearing service While DTCC advances its tokenized securities strategy on multiple blockchains, the firm is simultaneously expanding its traditional clearing services. On January 7, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized DTCC to offer the ACS Triparty Service as part of its current Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Agent Clearing Service (ACS) offering. This action marked another phase in the organization’s efforts to optimize both traditional and digital financial infrastructure. The U.S. securities settlement firm revealed that FICC filed a regulation with the SEC to provide the ACS Triparty Service in September 2025. The company said that, with SEC approval, FICC is now able to provide Agent Clearing Members and their Executing Firm Customers with a Triparty Agent Clearing Service. In particular, DTCC stated that FICC’s Agent Clearing Members will be able to submit for clearing eligible triparty repo transactions between their Executing Firm Customers and either the Agent Clearing Member (“done-with”) or another Government Securities Division (GSD) Netting Member. FICC will use BNY’s global collateral infrastructure to provide the ACS Triparty Service in order to facilitate both “done-with” and “done-away” cleared triparty repo trades, according to the U.S. securities settlement firm.

The metal briefly climbed above record highs at $93 earlier in the week before pulling back. That move marked a historic breakout that pushed silver into price discovery. Market participants now focus on whether the $90 level can act as support. Can this zone hold under pressure? Pullback Follows Shift in Risk Sentiment Silver prices have eased inthe last 24 hours as investors rotate toward risk assets. Comments from U.S. President Donald Trump helped calm geopolitical concerns after he signaled a step back from potential military action following assurances of reduced violence abroad. Those remarks softened demand for safe-haven assets across the board. Market confidence also improved after Trump confirmed he has no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . That stance reduced concerns about central bank independence, which had supported precious metals during recent uncertainty. At the same time, the absence of immediate new tariff actions on strategic products helped cool trade tensions. Together, these developments pressured silver in the short term. Macro Forces Still Shape Price Action Despite the pullback, broader macro conditions continue to influence silver trading. Expectations for higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates weigh on non-yielding assets. Recent employment data showed resilience in the U.S. labor market, reinforcing the case for restrictive monetary policy. Elevated bond yields continue to compete with precious metals for capital. Even so, investors remain alert. Federal Reserve communications and geopolitical developments still carry the power to shift sentiment quickly. Short-term profit-taking explains much of the current move, rather than a fundamental change in demand dynamics. Volatility remains part of the story. Investor Demand and Search Interest Surge Silver prices have already climbed about 25% in early 2026 , following a near-150% gain in 2025. That momentum has drawn widespread attention. Online search interest for silver doubled after the $90 breakout, reflecting growing retail and institutional engagement. Why does this matter? Attention often follows capital, and recent data show strong participation. Source: Google Trends Vanda data revealed that retail investors spent $921.8 million on silver-linked ETFs over the past month. The iShares Silver Trust recorded 169 consecutive days of positive inflows, a record streak. Researchers at Vanda described the trend as structural accumulation rather than speculative chasing. They noted that investors now treat silver as a core macro asset, not a short-term trade. Source: Vanda via X Physical Markets Add Another Layer Physical demand also plays a role. Heavy buying in 2025 led to rising stockpiles in U.S. warehouses, which disrupted traditional global silver flows. London, the historic hub for silver trading, faced tighter availability as a result. These shifts followed concerns about potential U.S. tariffs on precious metals, which prompted buyers to secure supply early. Although tariff threats eased this week, inventory patterns continue to influence pricing behavior. Technical Signals Point to Ongoing Correction From a technical perspective, silver shows signs of a corrective phase rather than a trend reversal. Prices approach a descending trendline on shorter timeframes, with resistance near the $91.00 to $90.80 zone. Analysts monitor support around $88.50, with deeper demand zones near $86.00 where prior buying emerged. Price structure remains bearish in the short term, though broader momentum still reflects strength. Source: TradingView via X CoinCodex forecasts suggest a possible price continuation toward $122 by mid-February 2026, after the current short-term corrective phase. Silver recorded green sessions on 83% of days over the last 30 days, alongside elevated volatility. That combination highlights an active, crowded market. As silver consolidates after its $90 breakout, investors continue to watch sentiment, macro signals, and technical levels. The rally captured global attention.

Recently, the suppliers had been working nonstop in anticipation of more than a million orders from China, aiming to meet March delivery targets . This week, however, Chinese customs officials informed agents that shipments of the H200 would not be allowed into the country. Government authorities also warned local technology companies not to acquire the chips unless required, without specifying whether the ban is temporary or permanent. Analysts say China wants to foster local chip development Despite eager Chinese demand for Nvidia H200 chips, analysts suggest Beijing could be considering restrictions to advance local chip development or strengthen its negotiating position with the U.S. Some also claim the government wants to regulate which organizations can obtain top-tier computing resources and for what purposes, particularly in matters of national interest. Earlier, Washington had restricted H200 shipments over fears they might give China an advantage in technology and defense. However, on Tuesday, officials from the Department of Commerce permitted Nvidia to sell its high-end AI chips in China, provided there’s enough supply in the US. Before this, in December, President Trump had said he would only allow Nvidia to supply its H200 processors to designated customers in China and impose a 25% fee , stressing that he intended to protect national security and the nation’s AI dominance. Over the course of 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lobbied U.S. officials to allow sales of Nvidia’s powerful chips to China, arguing that global market participation is key to America’s competitive edge. Thus, the firm on Tuesday welcomed the recent approval, saying it will benefit US manufacturing and jobs. Nonetheless, the green light came with conditions: chips must pass independent testing, sales to Chinese clients are capped relative to U.S. buyers, military use is restricted, and certain amounts must remain for domestic use. Plus, the recent Chinese block on shipments only complicates the matter further. Taiwan-produced H200 chips still have to pass through the US for testing Current events also add another layer to a complex scenario in which the U.S.-designed, Taiwan-manufactured H200 chips can now be exported to China, with the U.S. government reportedly receiving part of the profits. Rather than being shipped straight from Taiwan to China, the U.S. government noted that the chips first go through a U.S. lab for testing, where a 25% tariff is imposed. This also affects AMD’s MI325X processor. Analysts are split over whether selling the H200 to China makes strategic sense. Supporters argue it could slow China’s domestic chip development, while critics highlight its potential use in weapons systems. According to Austin Lyons, a semiconductor analyst, China is concerned about its over-dependence on Nvidia, but local companies are expected to continue pursuing H200 chips until homegrown versions advance. Nvidia, he added, will be glad to gain revenue from China, even with lower margins caused by the U.S. government’s share. Marc Einstein at Counterpoint Research also argued the proposal to take a cut of Nvidia’s sales might set a benchmark for Trump’s negotiations on other tariffs. He remarked, “It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|CNY|Nvidia|TWD|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|RESEARCH|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 10:50:45

The assets will remain held by the government under its strategic reserve plan, the adviser said on social media. White House Advisor Confirms No Sale Reports have disclosed that about 57.55 BTC — roughly $6.3 million at recent prices — moved through addresses that some observers tracked, which sparked claims the coins had been sold. The White House adviser, Patrick Witt, stepped in to clear up the matter, saying the Department of Justice confirmed there was no sale. The coins will be kept in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in line with Executive Order 14233 , signed in March 2025 by US President Donald Trump. That order directs that seized Bitcoin be held rather than auctioned off. UPDATE: we have received confirmation from DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated, per EO 14233. They will remain on the USG balance sheet as part of the SBR. https://t.co/v2GchC3vk8 — Patrick Witt (@patrickjwitt) January 16, 2026 Movement Of Coins Triggered Questions Based on reports from blockchain analysts, a transfer to a Coinbase Prime address led to speculation about a disposal. Market watchers noticed the trail and raised alarms because a sale could have put extra downward pressure on prices. Some traders reacted quickly to the noise. But officials explain that transfers between custody systems do not always mean liquidation. In this case, the DOJ and related agencies say the transfer was an internal custody step and not a sale to private buyers. Background On The Case The legal action against the Samourai Wallet developers centered on charges tied to running an unlicensed money-transmitting service and aiding money laundering through mixer tools. Those charged pleaded guilty. The forfeiture order followed those convictions, and the Bitcoin in question became part of the assets the government controls after the court rulings. How the government manages such holdings has been a fast-moving policy issue since Executive Order 14233 was issued, which set new rules for seized crypto. Policy And Market Effects According to officials, holding seized Bitcoin in a national reserve is meant to avoid sudden market shocks that could follow large government sales. Some critics argue the reserve gives the government a powerful financial tool, while supporters say it prevents volatile swings. The announcement eased some short-term market worries because uncertainty about a possible sale had been cited as a potential pressure point for crypto prices. Reactions From Industry Observers Based on reports and social posts from crypto advocates, opinions remain split. Some welcomed the clarification as stabilizing. Others want more transparency on how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be run and when, if ever, coins might leave it. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle may ask for hearings or written briefings to get clearer answers about custody practices and future plans.

The bill has faced criticism from Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley, who has raised concerns alongside ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) about a section of the crypto bill. According to reports, they claimed that the section of the crypto bill would exempt certain software developers from financial licensing requirements. They also mentioned that the language would limit the ability of law enforcement to go after money laundering and illicit financing in the crypto industry. Their complaints were noted in a private letter addressed to Scott and Senate Banking ranking member Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Tim Scott’s crypto bill encounters a stumbling block In the letter, which was obtained by POLITICO, the pair mentioned that the language in Section 604 of the crypto bill was the type of legislative change that falls within the Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction, adding that the panel was not involved in it before the since-postponed markup. Scott had plans to hold a vote on the crypto market structure legislation this week, but moved the mark-up amid surprise opposition from a leading crypto firm and other uncertainties. The section is similar to the standalone bipartisan legislation known as the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that is led in the House by Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and in the Senate by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). A spokesperson for Scott mentioned that the South Carolina Republican appreciates the engagement from Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Durbin on the issue. “As the parliamentarian has ruled, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act falls squarely within the Banking Committee’s jurisdiction,” said the spokesperson, Jeff Naft. “The Chairman remains committed to protecting software developers while ensuring that law enforcement has the necessary tools to prosecute actual illegal money transmission operations.” In his statement, Grassley mentioned that he appreciates the work done by Chairman Tim Scott and his staff as they work through the important bill. Grassley mentioned that the country needs to protect its national and financial security while ensuring that crypto and other industries play by the same rules as everyone else. He also plans to work with Scott to reach a sound outcome. According to reports, Grassley and Durbin are warning that the provision exempts a dangerously broad category of actors from treatment under the current criminal law. They also say the language would have likely stopped the government from bringing charges against the founder of Tornado Cash . Lawmakers want to review the draft legislation The pair claimed that the co-founder of Tornado Cash, a platform allegedly used to launder stolen funds, was operating as a mixer and was found guilty of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business last year, although crypto proponents and some congressional Republicans have criticized the conviction. They also mentioned that Scott’s draft legislation would create a big enforcement gap for decentralized digital asset platforms. “Such a gap risks attracting illicit actors—like cartels and other sophisticated criminal organizations—to decentralized platforms. Criminals already use tactics to obscure unlawful transactions. This bill would make prosecuting this conduct even more difficult,” the letter said. The concerns were shared by some law enforcement. The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys mentioned that the crypto bill could limit the ability of prosecutors to pursue financial crimes involving the movement of funds outside established regulatory guidelines. The issue also centers around how the market structure bill should treat the sectors of the industry known as decentralized finance or DeFi. That aspect uses software to facilitate trading and lending, cutting out centralized entities like exchanges. Senators have been talking and have raised concerns about DeFi platforms being a hotbed for illicit finance. They have called for changes to the BRCA language and were preparing to amend it during the markup. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Market participants no longer argue only about charts or short-term volatility. Instead, attention has shifted toward infrastructure readiness, regulatory resolution, and the role digital assets may play inside real financial systems. As traditional finance seeks faster and cheaper cross-border settlements, XRP stands at the center of that conversation. That broader perspective shaped a recent commentary from market analyst X Finance Bull, who challenged persistent bearish narratives around XRP. Rather than framing XRP as a speculative token, the pundit positioned it as a liquidity tool waiting for full institutional adoption once regulatory barriers are fully cleared. Ripple’s Institutional Network Is Already Built Ripple has spent more than a decade integrating its payment technology with regulated financial institutions worldwide. Banks, payment service providers, and remittance firms across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America already use Ripple’s infrastructure for messaging and settlement coordination. These integrations involve real compliance checks, internal identifiers, and operational testing, not informal partnerships. Seriously, you’re still bearish on $XRP ?! Ripple has already assigned banking IDs to 500+ banks. These are real institutions! Once regulatory clarity hits, they flip the switch and $XRP becomes the bridge. It’s not if, it’s when. You’re either early or late. So which… pic.twitter.com/bIAYZ8J3kY — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 16, 2026 Crucially, this network exists independently of XRP’s immediate use. Ripple designed its system to allow institutions to adopt the technology first and enable XRP-based liquidity later, when regulatory and risk approvals are in place. That structure permits XRP’s integration into existing payment flows without forcing institutions to rebuild their systems. Regulatory Clarity as the Activation Point X Finance Bull emphasized regulation as the decisive trigger for XRP’s next phase. With Ripple’s U.S. legal battle now fully concluded and appellate proceedings withdrawn, XRP operates under far clearer legal conditions than during the years of uncertainty that previously constrained adoption. This clarity matters because large institutions do not experiment lightly. Compliance teams require explicit regulatory comfort before approving live liquidity solutions. As those barriers fall, institutions that already tested Ripple’s rails can move from prefunded accounts to on-demand liquidity models. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Function as a Bridge Asset XRP’s core utility centers on bridging fragmented global liquidity. Traditional cross-border payments rely on nostro and vostro accounts that lock up capital across jurisdictions. XRP offers an alternative by sourcing liquidity in real time, reducing settlement time and capital inefficiency. This function does not depend on retail adoption or consumer usage. It depends on whether institutions choose efficiency over legacy friction. In that sense, XRP competes less with other cryptocurrencies and more with outdated financial plumbing. Timing, Not Possibility, Defines the Outcome The argument presented by X Finance Bull frames XRP’s future as a question of timing rather than feasibility. The infrastructure already exists. Regulatory clarity has materially improved. Institutional relationships remain active. Once institutions decide, conditions align with their risk frameworks, XRP can move from optional to operational. In that scenario, the market does not witness a gradual shift but a rapid transition. From this viewpoint, investors face a simple choice: position early or react late when the switch finally flips.

According to the South China Morning Post, a debate ensued in the country following two high-profile investigations on a former senior central bank official and an alleged scam network operator accused of leading one of the largest Bitcoin-linked fraud schemes ever uncovered. The extradition of alleged crypto scam billionaire Chen Zhi has dominated chatter on Chinese social media and state media outlets. Chen, the founder of Prince Holding Group, was arrested in Cambodia on January 6 at the request of Chinese authorities. China talks Chen Zhi, arrest makes citizens woeful of crypto Cambodian officials detained three Chinese nationals, including Chen, before transferring them to China, according to the Cambodia China Times. Last year, the United States prosecutors seized about $15 billion in Bitcoin that supposedly belonged to Chen, Cryptopolitan reported . According to Chinese investigators, Chen was part of a large-scale crypto fraud operation, though full details of the charges have not yet been publicly disclosed. Last Wednesday, state broadcaster China Central Television aired a documentary on how authorities tracked down bribes paid in cryptos to Yao Qian. Yao previously headed the People’s Bank of China team responsible for developing the digital yuan, Beijing’s flagship central bank digital currency project. This has led the public to question if blockchain technology is truly anonymous and secure, and how transparent transaction records expose illicit financial activity. On China’s RedNote social media platform, users are having a back-and-forth discussion between strong encryption protecting private keys and the fact that all Bitcoin transactions are visible on public ledgers. Strict bans on the mainland, openness in Hong Kong Digital asset transactions have been banned for years in mainland China, as authorities seek to control capital flows and reduce financial risks. The central bank has consistently warned that virtual currencies lack legal tender status and cannot function as money within China’s markets. In October, the People’s Bank of China reiterated its commitment to cracking down on virtual money, even as some market participants called for the introduction of yuan-denominated stablecoins. A meeting convened by the People’s Bank of China last November brought together 13 government agencies to coordinate enforcement actions against illegal digital currency activities. Foreign-issued stablecoins were flagged as posing risks related to money laundering, fraud, and illegal cross-border fund transfers. But in its special administrative jurisdiction, Hong Kong, crypto businesses have licenses and regulatory clarity to freely operate. Some industry observers say Hong Kong is a “litmus test” for how cryptocurrencies would fare in the mainland, although the sentiment from the government says this won’t come any time soon. Genevieve Donnellon-May, a Vasey Fellow at the Pacific Forum, believes the arrest of Chen is “a successful crackdown on criminal misuse of crypto,” and should not be deemed a flaw in Bitcoin itself. “Such actions may actually help strengthen longer-term confidence by curbing scams and illicit flows that harm the asset’s reputation,” she denoted.

According to ChatGPT’s assessment, the most likely trading range for XRP by that date is between $2.25 and $2.60. This base-case scenario reflects expectations that the token will continue consolidating slightly above current levels, supported by steady market participation but without a decisive breakout. In a more optimistic scenario, ChatGPT sees XRP rising into a $2.60 to $3.10 range. This outlook assumes stronger momentum across the broader crypto market , improved investor sentiment, and positive catalysts such as regulatory progress or renewed strength in major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Under these conditions, XRP could challenge higher resistance levels and briefly trade near or above the $3 mark. XRP downside outlook On the downside, ChatGPT noted that XRP could slip back toward the $1.90 to $2.20 area if momentum weakens. This bearish scenario is linked to potential muted trading volumes or renewed uncertainty that could keep the token locked in its recent consolidation zone. The price ranges are informed by a combination of technical trends, model-based projections, and broader market sentiment. Short-term technical views suggest XRP may hover around the low-to-mid $2 range if resistance levels are gradually tested and broken. This outlook comes as XRP continues to record notable on-chain changes. In particular, the network has recorded its highest level of daily transactions in nearly six months. Data from January 2026 shows that the XRP Ledger is processing about 1.45 million transactions per day, extending a steady rise in network activity that began in late 2025. The increase has been linked to the expansion of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity payment corridors and the integration of stablecoins such as RLUSD, which have boosted transaction flows across payment and decentralized finance use cases. On the other hand, on-chain data indicates that the XRP network has seen a notable drop in the number of new addresses created on the platform in 2026. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.06, having made modest gains of less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the asset is down about 1.5%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At its current price, XRP is sitting just above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.02. This positioning suggests short-term price action is relatively stable, with the 50-day SMA acting as nearby support rather than resistance. However, the much higher 200-day SMA at $2.54 highlights a clear longer-term downtrend, indicating that XRP remains structurally weak and would need a sustained move higher to shift its broader technical outlook. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI stands at roughly 51, firmly in neutral territory. This indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions and signals a lack of strong directional momentum.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stressed the Trump administration’s intensified efforts to attract more foreign investment in a statement dated January 17, informing chip makers based in South Korea and Taiwan to allocate a significant amount of funds to the US for investments or face a massive tariff rate of 100% on their imports to the country. An exception to this tariff rate applies to the company increasing its product in the United States. During a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Micron Technology Inc. facility near Syracuse, New York, the Secretary of Commerce stated that potential tariffs envisioned in a trade deal with Taiwan might also bring about significant effects on South Korean chipmakers. Following this statement, reporters reached out to Lutnick seeking clarity on this move. Responding to this, the industry executive highlighted that “Anyone who wants to manufacture memory has two options: They can either pay a 100% tariff or build their operations in America,” adding that “That’s what we call industrial policy,” without specifically mentioning the firms. His remarks aligned with a warning issued on Thursday, January 15, which offered lower tariff rates on imports for foreign companies that expand manufacturing in the US. Notably, this decision came after the Taiwan trade deal was signed. Still, Lutnick kept insisting that if these companies do not comply with this warning, they will face a 100% tariff on imports to the US. Foreign chip makers express heightened worries about Trump’s tariff decision As of now, US President Donald Trump has delayed the imposition of tariffs on imported semiconductors, primarily from Taiwan and South Korea, as he gives Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative, time to strike a deal with trade partners to reduce US reliance on foreign semiconductors. In the meantime, the White House hinted that Trump will soon announce new tariff rates and an incentive program designed to foster and expand local manufacturing. Notably, Micron rivals the world’s two largest memory chip manufacturers, Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. These companies are considered South Korean giants vying for market leadership in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip market. These chips are key elements for running data center processors, fueling the AI boom. These three global manufacturing firms have recently raised concerns about limited chip supplies amid a surge in AI data center development. Regarding the Trump administration’s recent move, a Commerce Department representative elaborated that “Secretary Lutnick is dedicated to bringing back American manufacturing strength, starting with semiconductors.” However, when reporters requested comments from SK Hynix, Samsung, and Taiwan’s representative office in Washington, D.C., they declined to respond. Trump’s tariff policies spark uncertainties in the market Regarding the US-Taiwan trade agreement made public on Thursday, reports indicated that the deal gives Taiwanese firms establishing a local presence in the US the chance to import up to 2.5 times their current production capacity tariff-free during the construction phase. Interestingly, shipments that exceed this limit will be subject to a reduced tariff rate. Upon the completion of these production facilities, the cap will decline to 1.5 times for their current production capacity In the meantime, under this deal, which imposes a 15% tariff on Taiwan’s imported goods, the Asian tech industry vowed to make significant investments of at least $250 million in the US. Apart from this pledge, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest and most advanced dedicated contract chip manufacturer, made clear its intentions to develop at least four more manufacturing facilities in Arizona, a US state. This project is expected to consume an additional $100 billion in funding, sources close to the situation said, who wished to remain anonymous. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Experts Highlight a New Crypto With 10x Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-xrps-1000-run-experts-highlight-a-new-crypto-with-10x-potential/,"Each crypto cycle makes winners out of those projects that appeared in the right stage of the market development. Ripple XRP was one of the largest surprises to the early holders in the previous cycle. However, 2026 is coming near and many traders are posing the same question: what crypto buy before it is too late that can bring the next asymmetric move. Analysts are pointing to an up-and-comer low-cost altcoin which remains early in its infancy and has not yet been valued by usage or utility. Ripple (XRP) The XRP of Ripple has served to popularize the initial narrative of institutions and international settlements. XRP has become more than a speculative token, and one of the leading names in the best crypto sector in boom times. In the present day, XRP has a significant market cap and has extensive liquidity. Its valuation is only in the tens of billions, and its price movement indicates that maturity. This is the point at which analysts refer to the limitation. Once an asset has attained a large market size, there is slow growth in price. XRP is no longer a small cap capable of making fast percentage returns. The forward growth analysts now project a muted outlook with regard to the XRP. According to some of the projections, XRP can grow only 1.5x by Q4 2026 assuming that the overall crypto market remains bullish. Quite the opposite of the 1000% moves which were observed years ago when it was in its first cycle window. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto asset developing a decentralized lending system that will enable users to lend out and borrow crypto assets in the form of smart contracts when it becomes operational. Suppliers will receive interests and earn mtTokens which are a representation of deposit value and yield. Borrowers will pledge security and access liquidity without selling long term assets. MUTM is said to be in its structured presale phase. The token sells at $0.04 in Phase 7. The actual price of launching will be $0.06. Over $19.7 million has been raised and more than 18,800 holders have taken positions. The total supply of tokens that are distributed is 4 billion, of which more than 825 million were given out. An approximation of 45.5% of that supply is used in presale distribution. Why Analysts Think MUTM May Follow Early XRP Steps To start with, XRP rewarded holders in its pre-institutional phase in which valuation had not priced future adoption. MUTM is also in a comparable early window, prior to the emergence of the usage metrics. After becoming operational, the lending platforms reveal interest streams, collateral amounts, foreclosures and re-payments information. The protocol can then be appreciated in markets by quantifiable activity. Second, XRP experienced a gain of utility instead of sheer hype. Analysts consider MUTM as a utility anchored asset. mtTokens enable deposits to receive yield from borrowers. A buy and distribute mechanic will purchase some protocol revenue on the open market using MUTM, and redistribute this to stakers. This could cause buy pressure based on usage and not sympathy. Third, similar is the timing window. XRP went up before its story had grown. MUTM will enter into its V1 protocol deployment window. The official X account is that V1 will roll out testnet before rolling out mainnet. The assets that are lent out are most likely to reflect the future anticipations before the activation. It is a 10x scenario that some analysts model should usage grow by 2026 and 2027. These models are not guaranteed, but they indicate the ways in which markets price the early-stage lending protocols, when they start operating. Phase Progression and Security Framework Phase 7 of MUTM has been selling faster than others. This is viewed by analysts as tightening behavior of allocations. Higher wallet entries have been reported too. This trend tends to occur towards the end of token distributions which are structured. The roadmap also has involved security preparation. The V1 codebase underwent an audit by Halborn Security . CertiK tokens can award the MUTM token a score of 90 out of 100. There is a bug bounty of $50,000 that operates to detect bugs before the launch. Growth has also been aided by participation infrastructure. A 24 hour leaderboard will be used to give the highest daily contributor $500 in MUTM. The card payments are offered to the users who do not want to undergo complicated wallet-based onboarding. As XRP has entered its mature level of the valuation range, analysts are considering what crypto can provide early stage utility pricing. Mutuum Finance belongs to that category and it still has roadmap milestones in front of it as well as revenue mechanics.

Addresses numbered 10 to 50 control 24.85% more, and the rest, 56.59%, is spread out among millions of smaller wallets. Ripple Labs remains the single largest owner of XRP when all company-linked wallets are added together. When escrow wallets count toward rankings, seven of the top ten XRP wallets belong to Ripple. Ripple Labs Escrow is at the top of the list with 45% of the total supply, which manages predictable releases. The second-largest holder of XRP is Ripple Labs (operational), which holds nearly 1% of the total XRP supply. Max XRP ownership goes to Ripple, institutions, and crypto exchanges Since the launch, XRP supply stands at 100 billion tokens. There is no mining or staking process for the token. Instead, it is distributed through methods including escrow, allocation, and market transactions. Each month, up to 1 billion XRP is unlocked, with unused amounts returned to escrow. Data from on-chain analytics shows that the maximum XRP ownership is held by whales, including institutional buyers, Ripple founders, and others. Japan’s SBI Holdings owns about $10.4 billion in XRP. Just after Ripple Labs, large XRP wallets belong to centralized exchanges that hold XRP on behalf of users instead of as proprietary assets. Binance is the biggest holder with approximately 1.8 billion XRP. South Korea’s Bithumb ties closely with approximately 1.8 billion XRP after increasing its balance by roughly 30% in 2025. Uphold and Upbit also rank among the top custodians. As reported by Cryptopolitan, these numbers reflected that XRP’s trading volumes on Binance, Upbit, and Uphold did well in 2025. XRP did better than Bitcoin and Ethereum on Upbit, making up 28% of the exchange’s 24-hour trading volume rise, which hit $13.39 billion. Uphold’s data also revealed XRP as the most traded asset in 2025, bolstered by yield products tied to the Flare Network. Meanwhile, the Binance XRP/USDT pair, by trade volume, saw a 69% increase as the year began. Meanwhile, the coin is steady with a minor decline of 0.17% now trading at $2.06. In comparison to the other assets, XRP has also seen a decline in the last week as its peers see small gains, which has caused it to be overtaken by Binance after slipping to a market cap of approximately $125 billion Ripple execs take over 4% of the XRP supply Ripple execs are the biggest holders of the individual wallets. Ripple co-founder and executive chairman Chris Larsen publicly linked wallets have an estimated 2.5 to 2.7 billion XRP, which translates to approximately 4-5% of the total supply. Although exact figures fluctuate with market prices, reports suggest that the co-founder has realized over $760 million in profits since 2018. Brad Garlinghouse is also suspected of having one of the largest personal XRP holdings. However, these are not publicly disclosed. Jed McCaleb, another Ripple co-founder, was given 9 billion XRP in 2012. However, he completed the sale of his XRP holdings after leaving the company in 2014 for approximately $3.2 billion. Other large wallets are associated with anonymous addresses. One of them holds approximately 1.2 billion XRP , while another controls more than 700 million XRP. In total, the top 50 XRP addresses control approximately 43% to 50% of the circulating supply. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-investors-we-are-closer-to-major-breakout-heres-the-signal/,"Long-term market structures often become clearer only after extended consolidation. That is the setting Amonyx (@amonyx) points to in his latest XRP analysis. The analyst shared a multi-year XRP chart that maps a repeating cycle, broken into clearly labeled phases. He believes it is closer to a major breakout. The chart covers more than a decade of price action. It presents XRP as a market that moves through expansion, compression, continuation, and then acceleration. Each cycle follows the same sequence. Phase 1 marks the initial impulse. Phase 2 shows a sharp corrective range. Phase 3 compresses price into a consolidation triangle . Phase 4 resolves with a breakout and trend continuation. We’re getting close. As mentioned earlier, patience is key with $XRP now. pic.twitter.com/THrJbsxHL2 — Amonyx (@amonyx) January 15, 2026 How the Current Cycle Compares In the most recent segment, XRP has already exited Phase 3. The digital asset broke upward from a multi-year consolidation pattern in late 2024. That structure mirrors earlier periods on the chart. After the breakout, the digital asset entered Phase 4. Its price then pushed above prior resistance and established a new consolidation zone. At the time of the chart, XRP traded around $2.15. This area sits above the former wedge resistance, now acting as support. The chart shows XRP holding within a rising channel rather than retracing into the prior range. Despite some dips in late 2025 , XRP has held strong. This behavior aligns with previous Phase 4 periods marked on the chart. Volume expansion accompanied the breakout. Momentum indicators beneath the chart also show cyclical resets rather than exhaustion. This analysis suggests that the cycle will continue, and XRP has not completed Phase 4. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Levels Highlighted on the Chart Amonyx marks two major targets. TP 1 stands at the all-time high of $3.65 , which the asset hit in July 2025. He labels this level directly on the chart. The second target appears much higher. TP 2 is marked at the Fib. 6.618 extension level, with a corresponding price of $21.5. These targets are not presented as short-term objectives. The chart context suggests a full cycle continuation similar to past expansions. Earlier Phase 4 moves on the chart led to exponential upside once the price cleared historical resistance. Previous cycles show brief pauses before continuation. Price stability above $2 reinforces the structural breakout already in place. Amonyx’s message backs the view. “We’re getting close” signals progression within the cycle, not completion. He emphasized that “patience is key” for the current cycle, and market participants wait for XRP to complete this phase.

AI Reveals the 3 Things PI Needs for a Rally,https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-pi-networks-price-stuck-ai-reveals-the-3-things-pi-needs-for-a-rally/,"The cryptocurrency markets experienced a wild start to the new year, with BTC surging by almost ten grand to a two-month peak of $98,000 before it was stopped. Many altcoins posted even more impressive gains mid-week but have failed to double down. Pi Network’s native token, though, cannot say the same. It has been stuck in consolidation for several weeks, without any clear indication whether it will be able to break out of the $0.20 and $0.22 range. As such, we decided to ask ChatGPT what is needed for PI to finally move out of this rather dull trading zone. What’s Holding You Down, PI? The Core Team behind the controversial project already released its first major update for the year, which promises to slash the needed time for PI payment integrations under ten minutes. However, it failed to impact the underlying asset. ChatGPT believes there’s reason to this (lack of) madness. First, it said supply overhang is crushing the momentum. Unlike most other liquid altcoins, PI is dealing with heavy unlock pressure. As more tokens become transferable, any upside attempt quickly runs into selling from early participants who had waited a long time for their assets. Data from PiScanUnlock shows that over 4.5 million tokens on average will be freed in the next 30 days, which is expected to intensify the immediate selling pressure. ChatGPT also said there are no external capital inflows. Most altcoin rallies have been fueled by new capital rotating out of BTC, but PI remains largely isolated. Lastly, the AI noted that the ecosystem growth hasn’t translated to price gains. So, What Do You Need, PI? The AI solution believes PI will “require one or more major catalysts, not just routine updates” to break out of the $0.20-$0.22 range. It listed a clear, unavoidable use case that creates real demand, such as at least one of the following: Large-scale merchant adoption using PI as payment A widely used PI-native application that requires the token to function Network mechanics that reduce circulating supply (burns, locks, staking) Second, ChatGPT outlined liquidity expansion beyond the Core Community. This doesn’t necessarily mean a listing from a big exchange, such as Binance or Coinbase, but it requires capital from outside the PI ecosystem. Lastly, the AI solution said PI needs a supply narrative shift as markets respond to strong changes in such dynamics. If the Core Team introduces slower unlock schedules, long-term lock incentives, or deflationary mechanics, then even modest demand can suddenly have a much larger price impact.

According to authorities, the scammers now see them as the prime age bracket, noting that they were targeted because of their age and limited knowledge of how cryptocurrencies worked. According to reports, the elderly population is always enticed with the opportunity to make profits, which the scammers always present in easy ways. The scammers then take advantage of their desperation and gullibility to extract funds from them until they can no longer come up with the payments. In most cases, the elderly victim realizes they have been scammed after the fraudsters cut communication and take the application where they monitor their earnings offline. Indian fraudsters target elderly victims in fake crypto trading schemes According to the Indian police, one of its first cases this year involved a 64-year-old retired banker from Secunderabad. The retired banker claimed that he lost more than Rs. 1.25 crore ($137,000) to fraudsters who operated a bogus crypto trading scheme using a trading platform called “Capstone.” Authorities claimed that the fraud was carried out between December 29 and January 12, and was only discovered after the scammers went offline with the victim’s funds. According to the retired Indian elder, he received an invitation to join a group called ‘Team B Club Internship Group 39’ on WhatsApp . In the group, members shared several screenshots showing purported gains from their investments on the platform. Some claimed it was from trading crypto, others said it was from institutional IPO trades. The retired banker claimed he was asked to download the Capstone app using a link shared from a United States phone number. After downloading the app and setting it up, the Indian police claimed that the elderly victim made about 15 transfers from three personal accounts to about 11 bank accounts provided by the scammer. He claimed that the payments were made to enable him to make more profits from his investments. The in-app dashboard showed his balance rose to Rs. 1.9 crore, but at every attempt to withdraw, he was blocked. He claimed the fraudsters asked him to pay another Rs. 58.58 lakh as clearing charges. The Indian police said that after protracted negotiations with the scammers to help him withdraw his funds, he realized he had been scammed and reported the case to the police. Police said they registered the case on January 14, highlighting that by the next day, the Hyderabad and Cyberabad Cyber Crime Police station claimed that they had received more than three similar complaints involving a combined loss of more than Rs. 1.2 crore. Police urge citizens to seek help from professionals In another similar case, the Indian police claimed that a 68-year-old retired employee from Manikonda alleged that scammers posing as analysts of a stock brokerage company scammed him of over Rs. 50.8 lakh. He claimed that they lured him into a WhatsApp investment group, and he was asked to register on a platform. The victim also downloaded an application where he tracked his earnings, but by the time he wanted to withdraw, the scammers ran with his funds. In the third case, police mentioned that a 76-year-old retired employee from Secunderabad claimed to have lost Rs. 46.25 lakh to fraudsters posing as stock market trading experts. He said they advised him to invest in IPO trades between December and January. After several investments, the scammers stole the funds. Another case saw a 45-year-old retired employee lose Rs. 32.1 lakh to fraudsters who claimed he could invest in US stocks using their applications. All four incidents have been formally registered, the Indian police claimed. They have also warned the elderly populace to desist from investing in opportunities that are too good to be true. They urged them to involve someone younger with practical experience in the crypto industry if they chose to invest in the assets. The police have also urged the populace to seek professional help when entering the crypto industry, as it would guard them against falling into the wrong hands. Don’t just read crypto news.

57241864,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262460,1768650011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ethereum Staking Queue Surges to Staggering 2.5-Year High, Signaling Unwavering Network Confidence",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-staking-queue-record-high-2/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Staking Queue Surges to Staggering 2.5-Year High, Signaling Unwavering Network Confidence In a powerful demonstration of sustained confidence, the Ethereum staking queue has swelled to a monumental 2.5-year peak, holding nearly 2.6 million ETH as validators rush to secure the world’s leading smart contract platform. This significant milestone, reported on April 10, 2025, by crypto analyst Ted Pillows citing validatorqueue data, far surpasses the previous record and presents a complex, bullish signal for the network’s future. The current validator wait time now extends to approximately 45 days, while the unstaking queue remains conspicuously empty, painting a picture of a deeply committed participant base. Ethereum Staking Queue Reaches Unprecedented Levels The Ethereum staking ecosystem is experiencing a historic influx. According to the latest on-chain metrics, the entry queue now contains approximately 2,597,838 ETH. Consequently, this figure marks the highest point since the pivotal Shanghai upgrade enabled withdrawals in April 2023. For context, this volume drastically exceeds the previous record of 1.759 million ETH observed on January 10 of this year. The data reveals a clear and sustained upward trend in network participation. This swelling queue directly impacts new validators. Currently, the wait time to activate a new validator stands at about 45 days and two hours. This delay is a direct function of the protocol’s churn limit, which carefully controls how many validators can join or leave the network per epoch to ensure stability. Meanwhile, the contrasting emptiness of the unstaking queue provides a critical counterpoint. It strongly suggests that existing stakers are choosing to remain locked in, likely anticipating future rewards or network upgrades. Understanding the Staking Mechanism and Queue Dynamics Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) fundamentally reshaped its security model. Instead of energy-intensive mining, participants, known as validators, stake a minimum of 32 ETH to propose and attest to new blocks. The protocol intentionally regulates validator set changes through a mechanism called the churn limit. This limit caps the number of validators that can enter or exit the activation queue within a given period, preventing sudden, destabilizing shifts in network consensus. The current queue dynamics tell a compelling story: Record Inflow: The queue size represents over $8 billion worth of ETH (at current prices) awaiting activation, showcasing massive capital commitment. Extended Wait Time: A 45-day delay indicates exceptionally high demand to participate in network security. Zero Unstaking Demand: The lack of an exit queue highlights strong holder conviction and a long-term outlook among current stakers. These mechanics ensure network security scales with value. As more ETH is staked, attacking the network becomes exponentially more expensive, creating a powerful economic safeguard. Expert Analysis on Market and Network Implications Industry analysts point to several interconnected factors driving this trend. First, the broader recovery in cryptocurrency markets throughout 2024 and into 2025 has renewed institutional and retail interest in core blockchain assets like Ethereum. Second, the upcoming network upgrades, often referred to as “The Surge” and “The Scourge,” which aim to further scale transaction throughput and mitigate MEV, are creating positive forward-looking sentiment. Furthermore, the growth of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) has lowered the technical and capital barriers to entry. Investors can stake any amount of ETH through these protocols and receive a tradable token representing their stake, maintaining liquidity while earning rewards. This innovation has undoubtedly contributed to the rising total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s consensus layer. The data suggests a strategic accumulation phase, where stakeholders are positioning themselves ahead of anticipated network improvements and potential appreciation. Historical Context and Comparative Data To fully appreciate the current milestone, a review of staking history is essential. The launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020 initiated Ethereum’s staking journey, but assets remained locked until the Shanghai/Capella upgrade. That upgrade, completed in April 2023, was a watershed moment that removed the final perceived risk—illiquidity—for many potential stakers. The following table illustrates key queue milestones post-Shanghai: Date Queue Size (ETH) Significance May 2023 ~800,000 Initial post-upgrade surge Jan 2024 ~1.2 million Steady growth phase Jan 10, 2025 1.759 million Previous record high April 10, 2025 2.597 million Current 2.5-year record This trajectory shows not just recovery but accelerated adoption. The network now has over 30% of its total ETH supply staked, a ratio that continues to climb and aligns with other mature Proof-of-Stake networks. This trend reinforces Ethereum’s security and decentralization over time. Potential Impacts on Ethereum’s Economics and Security The record staking queue carries significant implications. Primarily, it leads to a continuous increase in the total amount of ETH taken out of circulating supply and committed to long-term security. This reduction in readily available sell pressure can influence market dynamics, although analysts caution against oversimplifying this relationship. The more direct impact is on network security. A larger, more distributed validator set makes a 51% attack astronomically costly and logistically near-impossible. However, the growing queue also presents challenges. The extended activation delay could be perceived as a barrier for new, smaller participants, though liquid staking providers offer an immediate alternative. Additionally, as the staking yield (APR) adjusts based on the total amount staked, an increasing validator count will gradually lower the rewards for all participants, a built-in economic incentive designed to balance participation over the long term. The system self-regulates through these economic signals. Conclusion The Ethereum staking queue reaching a 2.5-year high is a multifaceted development with profound implications. It reflects robust confidence in the network’s long-term roadmap, underscores the success of its Proof-of-Stake model, and significantly enhances its economic security. While the 45-day validator wait time indicates high demand, the empty unstaking queue simultaneously signals strong holder conviction. This milestone is a key indicator of Ethereum’s maturation from a speculative asset into a foundational, yield-generating infrastructure layer for the decentralized internet. The Ethereum staking ecosystem’s health remains a critical metric for observers gauging the network’s stability and future trajectory. FAQs Q1: What is the Ethereum staking queue? The staking queue is a waiting list for new validators wanting to join the network. Because the protocol limits how many validators can activate per day (the churn limit), excess demand forms this queue. Q2: Why is the unstaking queue empty? An empty unstaking queue means very few existing validators are currently requesting to withdraw their staked ETH. This typically indicates strong long-term confidence in the network and an unwillingness to forfeit ongoing staking rewards. Q3: How does a longer queue affect Ethereum’s security? A longer queue directly increases security. It represents more ETH being committed to the network, making it exponentially more expensive for any bad actor to attempt an attack on the chain’s consensus. Q4: Will the staking reward rate decrease because of this? Yes, gradually. Ethereum’s staking APR is designed to adjust downward as the total amount of staked ETH increases. This is a built-in economic mechanism to balance participation and rewards over time. Q5: Can I avoid the 45-day wait to stake my ETH? Yes. By using a liquid staking service or a staking pool, you can delegate your ETH to an existing validator and begin earning rewards immediately, bypassing the activation queue entirely.

The pullback comes amid broader market consolidation and follows a strong weekly rally, suggesting profit-taking rather than a decisive trend reversal. Outset PR delivers this content, merging crypto-native communication with data-driven intelligence. ETH Sees Profit-Taking After Strong Weekly Gains ETH slipped around 1% on January 16th, trading near $3,310 as overall market momentum cooled. The move follows a 7% weekly gain, during which short-term momentum became increasingly stretched. This is reflected in the 7-day Relative Strength Index, which reached 68, approaching overbought territory. As RSI climbed, traders began locking in profits, increasing near-term selling pressure. Rejection at $3,370 Signals Short-Term Exhaustion Ethereum has now been rejected twice this week near the $3,370 resistance level. Multiple failures at the same price area typically indicate short-term exhaustion, especially after a sharp upside move. This rejection has reinforced $3,350–$3,370 as a key resistance zone. A daily close above $3,350 would be required to invalidate the current pullback narrative and reassert bullish control. Momentum Remains Constructive Despite Pullback Despite the dip, broader momentum indicators remain supportive. The MACD histogram is still firmly positive at 25.53, suggesting that the underlying trend remains bullish. This setup implies the pullback may be corrective rather than the start of a deeper decline, provided key support levels hold. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. ETH Support Levels to Monitor The first level to watch on the downside is $3,250. Holding above this area would support the case for consolidation before another upside attempt. Below that, the 30-day simple moving average near $3,056 stands out as a critical structural floor. A sustained move toward this level would signal a deeper reset in momentum, while a bounce above it would preserve the broader bullish structure. ETH Price Outlook Ethereum’s rejection at $3,379 has triggered short-term profit-taking, but momentum indicators suggest the broader trend remains intact. As long as ETH holds above $3,250 and the 30-day SMA, the pullback is likely temporary. Bulls will need a decisive daily close above $3,350 to regain momentum and reopen the path toward higher resistance levels. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Impressed by some of the driverless systems demonstrated ahead of a meeting on the matter, the leader of the Kremlin urged Russian authorities to speed up their implementation. Russia must move from trials to rollout of autonomous solutions, says Putin The Russian Federation should rapidly transition from testing autonomous systems to their large-scale introduction, its president insisted. Speaking at a meeting devoted to their development, Vladimir Putin stated: “I would like to draw the attention of participants and all the colleagues in the government: there is a need to move quicker from experiments to mass use of autonomous solutions.” The Russian head of state added that the executive power in both Moscow and the Russian regions should not only control but lead efforts in this direction. Putin admitted that, despite taking some important steps, his country is still far behind other nations who “have reached full sovereignty” in this sphere and are already producing all the components needed for autonomous equipment. “For example, robotic taxis are engaged and carry passengers in certain cities of the world, not as part of individual experiments but in mass numbers,” he remarked. Nevertheless, the Russian leader acknowledged he was impressed by some of the prototypes demonstrated before the discussion. Putin was acquainted with a whole range of products and a wide variety of implementations – from agriculture and construction to security. “It should be said it is impressive! The boldness and variety of designers’ proposals, and how technologies created by them dramatically change life around us, forming the real economy of autonomous systems,” Putin commented, adding that the accelerated development of this industry is on the agenda. Moscow to boost driverless truck production to thousands of units by 2030 Russian companies are gradually increasing the number of autonomous vehicles built domestically. 95 self-driving trucks have been manufactured to date, TASS informed in a separate report . They are currently engaged in commercial transportation on the Central Ring Road in and around Moscow and the M-11 Neva highway, which links the capital with Russia’s second-largest city, St. Petersburg. The current plan is to grow the fleet to 920 units by the end of 2028, according to materials distributed at the exhibition, which took place on the sidelines of the meeting presided by Putin. The goal set in the presentation is to bump production from a few hundred driverless trucks in 2026 – 2027 to thousands of units by 2030. Putin is convinced Russia will be able to find its place in the global market for such systems, once it scales up exports, which will help it to create a strong and cost-efficient industry. He elaborated: “It is very large, this international market. We are awaited there, I assure you. I simply know that. All our friends, our partners told us that.” “Customs and other procedures should be made as comfortable as possible for national companies, so that they can withstand tough competition with foreign manufacturers,” he stressed. As for Russia itself, the president expects self-driving solutions to substitute low-skilled labor and increase productivity and quality of life, fostering an economy with higher wages. Putin has repeatedly urged Russian officials to focus efforts on facilitating the development of advanced technologies in their country. In December, he praised the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) while warning of the perils as well, commenting that not using AI “would mean losing everything we care about,” but warned that “if we use it thoughtlessly, it will also end up in the loss of everything we value.” In November, the head of the Kremlin visited an exhibition showcasing Russian achievements in the AI-powered robot race, where he had a short interaction with a humanoid, designed and built by engineers at the banking giant Sber. While his meeting with the smart machine called Green went relatively well, the premiere of Russia’s “first” AI robot, named Aidol, turned into an embarrassment for its creators when it stumbled and fell on its face at an event in Moscow a few days earlier.

Additionally, the trader maintains a 10x leveraged long position in Solana (SOL) showing a $7.09 million gain from an average entry price of $130. These positions collectively represent one of the most significant concentrated bets currently visible on public blockchain ledgers. Market analysts note that such substantial leveraged positions create both opportunity and systemic risk. Consequently, the whale’s trading activity can influence market sentiment and liquidity conditions. The use of 5x and 10x leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses dramatically, representing a high-risk approach that few institutional investors would typically undertake. Technical Analysis of Position Management Professional traders examining the whale’s entry points note strategic timing across different assets. The Bitcoin position entered near what technical analysts identify as a key support level in late 2024. Meanwhile, the Ethereum accumulation began during a period of network upgrade optimism. The Solana position coincides with renewed developer activity on the network. Each entry demonstrates possible fundamental analysis rather than purely speculative momentum trading. Historical Context: The October Forced Liquidation Event The address first attracted significant attention in October 2024 during what market participants describe as the largest forced liquidation event in cryptocurrency derivatives history. During that volatile period, approximately $2.1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated across major exchanges within 24 hours. The cascade began with unexpected volatility in Bitcoin markets that triggered margin calls across connected positions in Ethereum, Solana, and other major altcoins. Blockchain forensic firms subsequently identified several addresses, including 0xb317, that established substantial short positions immediately before the liquidation cascade. These positions reportedly generated profits exceeding $15 million during the market downturn. Trading patterns showed these addresses increasing their short exposure during the 72 hours preceding the volatility spike, timing that market surveillance experts described as statistically anomalous. The event prompted investigations from multiple regulatory bodies and intensified debates about market manipulation in cryptocurrency markets. Exchange operators implemented additional safeguards, including increased margin requirements for large positions and enhanced monitoring of coordinated trading activity. Despite these measures, the recent profitable long positions by the same address have reignited concerns about sophisticated actors potentially exploiting market mechanisms. Identity Speculation and the BitForex Connection Several cryptocurrency investigators and community members have publicly speculated that the address may belong to Garrett Jin, former CEO of the now-defunct BitForex exchange. Jin led the Singapore-based exchange from 2018 until its sudden collapse in early 2024, when users reported inability to withdraw funds totaling approximately $500 million. The exchange officially ceased operations amid regulatory pressure and liquidity issues. Blockchain analysis shows that several addresses associated with BitForex’s operational wallets interacted with the 0xb317 address between 2022 and 2023. These transactions involved moderate transfers of Ethereum and various ERC-20 tokens. However, no definitive on-chain evidence conclusively proves identity ownership, as cryptocurrency addresses are pseudonymous by design. Jin has not publicly commented on these allegations, and his current whereabouts and activities remain unconfirmed by independent sources. The speculation highlights broader concerns about former exchange operators potentially leveraging insider knowledge of market mechanics. Former executives possess detailed understanding of liquidation engines, liquidity distribution, and trader behavior patterns that could theoretically inform sophisticated trading strategies. Regulatory frameworks in traditional finance typically impose strict trading restrictions on exchange insiders, but such rules remain inconsistently applied across global cryptocurrency jurisdictions. Market Impact of Large Whale Positions The whale’s current $40 million paper profit represents more than just personal gain. Such substantial positions affect overall market dynamics in measurable ways. First, the positions consume significant available liquidity on Hyperliquid’s order books, potentially increasing slippage for other traders. Second, the knowledge of such large leveraged positions can influence market sentiment, with some traders potentially following the whale’s direction while others prepare for possible liquidation cascades if markets move against the positions. Exchange risk managers monitor large concentrated positions closely because their liquidation could trigger secondary effects. A forced closure of 1,000 Bitcoin at 5x leverage would require the exchange to sell approximately $90 million worth of Bitcoin into the market, potentially creating temporary price dislocations. Similarly, the Ethereum and Solana positions represent substantial market exposure that requires careful risk management by both the trader and the exchange. Regulatory Implications and Compliance Challenges The situation presents multiple regulatory considerations for authorities worldwide. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has increasingly focused on cryptocurrency market manipulation cases, with several high-profile settlements announced in 2024. European regulators under MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) framework are developing specific provisions for market abuse monitoring in digital asset markets. Asian financial authorities, particularly in Singapore and Japan, have strengthened exchange oversight following several collapses. Key regulatory challenges include: Jurisdictional complexity : The pseudonymous nature of blockchain addresses complicates identity verification across borders Definitional issues : Legal frameworks differ on whether certain cryptocurrency trading activities constitute traditional insider trading Evidence standards : Blockchain analysis provides circumstantial evidence but rarely meets traditional financial investigation standards Enforcement mechanisms : Regulatory bodies struggle to apply sanctions to pseudonymous entities operating across decentralized platforms Despite these challenges, regulatory momentum is building toward greater oversight. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has pushed for stricter implementation of travel rule requirements for virtual asset service providers. Major jurisdictions are increasingly requiring exchanges to implement sophisticated market surveillance tools similar to those used in traditional equity markets. These developments suggest that the regulatory environment for large cryptocurrency traders will likely become more constrained in coming years. Technical Analysis of Hyperliquid’s Risk Management Hyperliquid, as the hosting exchange for these positions, employs specific risk management protocols for large leveraged positions. The platform uses a mark price mechanism derived from multiple external price feeds to prevent manipulation. Additionally, the exchange implements incremental liquidation processes that gradually reduce positions as maintenance margin requirements approach, rather than executing full liquidations at once. The exchange’s insurance fund, currently valued at approximately $45 million, provides protection against undercollateralized liquidations. This fund would cover losses if a large position’s liquidation cannot be executed at or above the bankruptcy price. The whale’s positions represent a significant but manageable portion of this fund, according to risk metrics published by the exchange. Hyperliquid’s transparent approach to publishing these metrics represents an industry advancement toward greater risk disclosure. Other exchanges have adopted similar transparency initiatives following the 2024 liquidation events. By publicly displaying large position concentrations and insurance fund status, platforms aim to reduce uncertainty during volatile periods. This transparency theoretically allows traders to make more informed decisions about their exposure to platform risk and potential liquidation cascades. Broader Market Implications and Trader Sentiment The whale’s substantial long positions coincide with generally bullish sentiment across cryptocurrency markets in early 2025. Several fundamental factors support this optimism, including increased institutional adoption through spot Bitcoin ETFs, ongoing development of Ethereum’s scalability solutions, and growing real-world asset tokenization projects. However, the presence of such large leveraged positions introduces additional volatility risk to the current market structure. Professional trading desks typically monitor whale activity as one of multiple indicators. While some view large leveraged positions as confidence signals, others interpret them as potential volatility triggers. The current situation presents a paradox: the whale’s successful navigation of previous volatility suggests sophisticated market understanding, but the scale of leverage creates vulnerability to unexpected market movements. Market participants should consider several key factors: Liquidity conditions : Current market depth supports orderly liquidation if needed Correlation risks : The positions span multiple correlated assets Regulatory developments : Ongoing investigations could affect market psychology Technical indicators : Market structure shows both strength and overextension signals Conclusion The crypto whale holding $40 million in unrealized profits from leveraged positions on Hyperliquid represents a multifaceted story of opportunity, risk, and regulatory evolution. While the substantial gains demonstrate potential rewards from sophisticated cryptocurrency trading, the lingering insider trading allegations highlight ongoing market integrity challenges. As regulatory frameworks develop and exchange surveillance improves, market participants can expect increased scrutiny of large position accumulation and timing. The situation ultimately underscores cryptocurrency markets’ continued maturation, where substantial profits attract both admiration and investigation in equal measure. The crypto whale’s journey will likely influence both trading strategies and regulatory approaches throughout 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What is a crypto whale in cryptocurrency markets? A crypto whale refers to an individual or entity that holds large enough amounts of a cryptocurrency to potentially influence market prices through their trading activities. These entities typically control addresses containing millions or tens of millions of dollars worth of digital assets. Q2: How does leverage work in cryptocurrency trading? Leverage allows traders to control positions larger than their initial capital by borrowing funds from the exchange. For example, 5x leverage means controlling $5 worth of assets for every $1 of collateral. While this amplifies potential profits, it also magnifies losses and increases liquidation risk if prices move against the position. Q3: What was the October 2024 forced liquidation event? In October 2024, cryptocurrency markets experienced extreme volatility that triggered approximately $2.1 billion in liquidated leveraged positions across major exchanges within 24 hours. The cascade began with unexpected Bitcoin price movements that created margin calls across connected positions in Ethereum, Solana, and other major cryptocurrencies. Q4: What are insider trading allegations in cryptocurrency markets? Insider trading allegations suggest that traders may have used non-public information to execute profitable trades. In cryptocurrency contexts, this could include knowledge of upcoming exchange listings, protocol changes, or large impending transactions that could affect market prices before such information becomes publicly available. Q5: How do exchanges manage risk from large leveraged positions? Exchanges employ multiple risk management strategies including maintenance margin requirements, incremental liquidation processes, insurance funds, and position size limits. Many platforms also use mark prices derived from multiple external sources to prevent price manipulation and ensure fair liquidations during volatile periods.

Musk’s decision to abandon the ICO and later exit from the AI startup set the company on its current path, combining a controlling nonprofit with a public benefit corporation (PBC). OpenAI’s President, Greg Brockman, said he and Musk agreed back in 2017 that a for-profit structure would be the AI startup’s next phase. However, negotiations hit a snag when the AI startup blatantly refused to give Musk full control of the for-profit arm. The ChatGPT maker also rejected Musk’s proposal to merge the AI startup with his Tesla, opting for alternative means to jointly achieve the objective. In response, Musk stormed out of the AI startup and gave the company a 0% chance of success if it failed to raise billions of dollars. Today, the company’s structure includes a controlling nonprofit that owns equity in the PBC, currently valued at over $130 billion. Musk sues OpenAI for breach of charitable trust In his latest court filing, Musk is suing the AI firm for breach of charitable trust and constructive fraud. However, the AI company seeks to deny Musk any remedy for the alleged misconduct on technical grounds. It asserts that the Tesla boss lacks standing to sue because he made most of his contributions indirectly through personal donor-advised funds (DAFs). The AI company also pointed out that Musk made additional donations through the fiscal sponsor YC.org, which it had designated to receive contributions on its behalf. Meanwhile, Musk calls OpenAI’s arguments “meritless,” emphasizing that the court had already ruled he has standing to sue as a “settlor” of a trust. He added that he is the settlor of his contributions to the ChatGPT maker, whether directly or indirectly. Musk contributed about $38 million to the AI startup’s initial funding, which accounted for roughly 60% of the total funding. He also claimed he made countless non-monetary contributions, such as recruiting top talent, including the AI firm’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, also acknowledged in his deposition that Musk’s initial contributions to the AI startup were crucial. He does not think the AI company would exist without Musk. Brockman says Musk is just harassing the AI startup According to Brockman, Musk’s latest lawsuit is his fourth attempt to make these claims, and part of his broader strategy to delay the ChatGPT maker’s progress through harassment. He believes Musk is using underhanded tactics to gain an advantage for his xAI firm. Brockman also claimed that Musk is grossly misrepresenting facts on record to further his harassment. He noted that Musk had deliberately cherry-picked and shared snippets from written records to tell a different story. “Elon did not think that OpenAI needed to remain solely a non-profit. As the context shows, he agreed that OpenAI needed both a non-profit and a for-profit entity—the exact structure OpenAI has today, and that Elon is now suing OpenAI over.” – Greg Brockman , President of OpenAI Brockman also clarified that it was Ilya, not Musk, who suggested that the nonprofit should continue to exist in some form and remain connected to the AI firm’s mission. Musk actually created an OpenAI PBC (B-Corp) shortly after these discussions. Brockman further noted that Musk’s court filings glossed over the details of these negotiations, and they were intense and deeply personal. Brockman also pointed out that one of the people who had worked closely with Musk described him as someone who tends to vilify people who quit his companies. The former Musk colleague also noted Musk’s Mars ambition, which started as a philanthropic project and grew into a commercial business. Meanwhile, Brockman believes that Musk never truly treated OpenAI as an independent nonprofit. He explained that Musk seemed intent on starting a competitor, which is why ChatGPT maker had secretly considered removing him from its board. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This has raised the possibility that the foremost meme coin could repeat its parabolic rally in the 2021 bull cycle. Dogecoin Eyes Parabolic Rally As RSI Enters Oversold Levels Crypto analyst Cryptollica has indicated that the Dogecoin price could record another parabolic rally as the RSI enters oversold levels. In an X post, the analyst noted that this is the fourth time in 12 years that the DOGE RSI has been this oversold, and that every time this has happened, it has been life-changing. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is Following This Bullish Signal With A Major Target Cryptollica further remarked that the drop in Dogecoin’s RSI to this low has always been an “epic buying opportunity” and that those who loaded up made insane gains. In line with this, the analyst remarked that this is another massive opportunity. Meanwhile, Cryptollica alluded to previous times when the RSI dropped this low, including during the last cycle bottom, when DOGE dropped to $0.5. Dogecoin rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.74 after bottoming at $0.05, recording massive gains in the process. Cryptollica noted that these setups don’t come often and urged market participants not to miss this one. His accompanying chart suggested that DOGE could rally to the psychological $1 level this time around, marking a new ATH for the foremost meme coin. DOGE Mirroring Past Accumulation Pattern In another X post, Cryptollica highlighted a similar DOGE/BTC pattern between the 2014-2017 and 2021-2026 accumulations. The analyst stated that the structure is identical and assured that the bleed against Bitcoin is not “death” but the necessary energy compression before the rotation. Cryptollica added that when the green line breaks, risk appetite changes instantly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Meanwhile, Cryptollica declared that the fractal was loading, with Dogecoin set to be the heartbeat of the altcoin cycle. The analyst claimed that this is the final stage of a multi-year compression against Bitcoin. This historically leads to a specific volatility squeeze that precedes a massive capital rotation from BTC to altcoins. Crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus raised the possibility of a Dogecoin rally to $0.70, which could be near. This came as the analyst noted that DOGE has been moving in a nice way up throughout this entire bull cycle. This is said to be evident in the mini cycles, with the foremost meme coin tapping the dotted line, followed by a slow retrace. Based on this pattern, Bitcoinensus noted that DOGE could soon target the $0.70 range if the strong momentum in the crypto market returns. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.137, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Information moves instantly across platforms, yet money still travels through fragmented systems burdened by intermediaries, delays, and high costs. As cross-border commerce expands, the demand for a seamless payment layer has intensified, placing digital settlement infrastructure at the center of financial modernization. This evolving discussion gained clarity through a recent perspective shared by market commentator Jake Claver, who reframed XRP’s purpose within the financial system. His analysis shifted attention away from speculative narratives and toward XRP’s structural role in enabling interoperability across financial systems. Think of XRP like the protocol layer for payments kind of how email made it easy to send messages across platforms. XRP lets banks and financial apps talk to each other instantly, with almost no cost or friction. That’s what makes it such a strong candidate to serve as the… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 16, 2026 The Fragmentation Problem in Global Payments Banks and payment providers operate on isolated ledgers governed by local regulations and legacy technology. When funds move across borders, they pass through multiple institutions that each impose fees and processing delays. Messaging networks improved coordination but failed to eliminate settlement friction. Financial institutions now recognize that efficiency requires a shared settlement layer that can connect these silos. Without such a layer, even the most advanced financial applications remain constrained by outdated infrastructure. XRP’s Architecture Enables Interoperability Jake Claver emphasized that XRP was designed to function as connective tissue rather than a standalone payment product. XRP settles transactions within seconds, supports high throughput, and operates with minimal transaction costs. These characteristics make XRP suitable for large institutional payments that require fast and predictable transactions. XRP also maintains neutrality. It does not favor any currency, jurisdiction, or financial institution. Instead, it allows value to move between different systems without forcing participants to adopt a single ledger or abandon existing processes. This structure closely resembles how Internet protocols enable communication across diverse platforms. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Institutional Framework Supports Adoption Ripple has built enterprise-grade infrastructure around this interoperability model. Banks, payment firms, and remittance providers across multiple regions already use Ripple’s technology for cross-border coordination. These integrations involve regulatory compliance, operational testing, and real-world transaction flows. Within this framework, XRP serves as an optional liquidity layer. Institutions can activate it once internal risk assessments and regulatory approvals align. This approach reduces adoption friction and enables XRP usage to scale rapidly when conditions permit. A Protocol Layer for the Internet of Value Viewing XRP as a protocol layer reframes its relevance within global finance. Protocols succeed by enabling connectivity, reliability, and standardization. Email transformed communication because it worked across providers without requiring central control. XRP aims to perform a similar function for value transfer . Its success depends less on retail enthusiasm and more on institutional demand for faster settlement, lower costs, and real-time liquidity. From this perspective, XRP’s role in global payments hinges on adoption timing rather than technical capability. As financial institutions continue to modernize, the need for a neutral settlement protocol becomes increasingly difficult to ignore.

The damage claim was outlined in a court document file d Fr iday by Musk’s attorney, coming one day after a federal judge denied OpenAI and Microsoft’s last attempt to prevent a jury trial scheduled for late April in Oakland, California. Expert calculates damages based on startup contribution According to the filing, financial economist C. Paul Wazzan calculated that Musk deserves a portion of OpenAI’s present $500 billion value because he was allegedly cheated out of the $38 million in startup funds he gave when he helped establish the company in 2015. “Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor’s initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned – and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much larger than Mr. Musk’s initial contributions,” wrote Steven Molo, Musk’s attorney. Musk departed from OpenAI’s board in 2018 and started his own artificial intelligence venture in 2023. He initiated legal proceedings in 2024 against Sam Altman regarding the OpenAI co-founder and chief executive’s intentions to transform the organization into a for-profit entity. Both OpenAI and Microsoft have rejected his accusations. OpenAI calls lawsuit baseless harassment “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,” OpenAI stated. “This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign.” OpenAI has cautioned investors to anticipate Musk making headline-grabbing statements as the case moves toward trial. Microsoft chose not to provide a statement. The company behind ChatGPT revealed its reorganization in October, stating it had granted a 27% ownership share to its long-term supporter Microsoft in a change that would maintain the nonprofit division’s oversight of for-profit activities. Altman has criticized Musk’s legal challenge to OpenAI’s reorganization as misusing the court system to hinder a business rival. The expert witness Wazzan determined the damage amount by adding together Musk’s financial contributions and other non-monetary inputs, such as technical and business guidance, to OpenAI. His calculations show the alleged improper gains amount to $65.50 billion to $109.43 billion for OpenAI and $13.30 billion to $25.06 billion for Microsoft. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The move has triggered algorithmic selling and stop-loss cascades, increasing the risk of a deeper correction if nearby support fails. Powered by Outset PR, this analysis reflects the agency’s commitment to strategic, data-backed communication for the crypto industry. Outset PR helps visionary Web3 founders amplify their narrative and convert momentum into measurable outcomes. This analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , demonstrating the agency's dedication to providing strategic, data-backed communication for the crypto industry. ADA Loses Key Moving Averages ADA has broken below both its 7-day simple moving average at $0.398 and its 30-day SMA at $0.378. Losing these short- and medium-term trend indicators signals weakening market control by buyers and reinforces the bearish shift in structure. The breakdown followed a rejection at the $0.41 Fibonacci level, where upside attempts stalled and selling pressure intensified. This rejection confirmed that bulls lacked the momentum needed to sustain a recovery. Momentum Weakens as Selling Accelerates Momentum indicators reflect the deterioration in price structure. The 7-day Relative Strength Index has slipped to 48.37, indicating fading bullish momentum without yet reaching oversold territory. The loss of multiple technical levels in quick succession triggered algorithmic selling and stop-loss cascades, accelerating the move lower as automated strategies reacted to the breakdown. ADA is now testing the $0.387–$0.382 support zone. This area represents the last near-term buffer before a more pronounced downside move. Failure to hold this range would likely accelerate losses toward the $0.35 level, which stands out as the next major support on the chart. A move toward that area would confirm continuation of the bearish trend rather than a temporary shakeout. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Cardano Price Prediction: Bearish Setup is Formed For the downside scenario to weaken, ADA would need to reclaim lost ground decisively. A daily close back above $0.398 would invalidate the current bearish structure and suggest that the breakdown was a false move rather than the start of a sustained decline. Until that happens, rallies are likely to face selling pressure. Cardano’s break below key moving averages has shifted short-term momentum to the downside, with stop-loss cascades amplifying selling pressure. As ADA tests the $0.387–$0.382 zone, the market faces a clear inflection point. Holding support could stabilize price action, but a breakdown would likely open the path toward $0.35 unless bulls regain control above $0.398.

That long history now forms the basis of a technical outlook shared by analyst Leb Crypto (@leb_crypto). The analyst published a monthly XRP chart highlighting a large-scale structure that has been building since 2016. His analysis focuses on time, price structure, and clearly defined targets rather than short-term momentum. The chart shows XRP trading near $2.11 while compressing beneath a major resistance zone tied to its prior all-time high. This area has capped price action for around a year, with the total consolidation lasting 13 months . According to Leb Crypto, that extended pause matters as much as any breakout attempt. * ~8 year rounded bottom / cup & handle formation * Consolidation under prev ATH resistance for one full year #xrp is setting up for a great swing trade with targets at $7.0 , $19.5 and $58.9 Yes, $58.9 is my highest target (not to be confused with the jokers' $589 ) $XRP pic.twitter.com/cwFuuWJyOD — LE₿ C®YPTO (@leb_crypto) January 15, 2026 A Rounded Bottom Spanning Nearly a Decade The foundation of the setup begins after XRP’s early 2018 peak. The chart shows a prolonged decline followed by a gradual stabilization phase that stretches through 2020. Rather than forming a sharp V-shaped recovery, XRP’s price action curved upward over time. This created a rounded bottom and formed the cup section of the cup and handle pattern . From 2020 onward, XRP transitioned into a slow recovery marked by higher lows and diminishing downside volatility. The rounded structure remained intact through multiple market cycles. This type of base often reflects sustained accumulation rather than speculative spikes. The length of the formation strengthens its technical significance. Cup and Handle Structure Emerges After completing the rounded bottom in late 2024, XRP moved into the handle, experiencing a gradual decline in the latter half of 2025. The cup spanned several years and resolved into a handle that formed just below the previous all-time high. XRP traded sideways within a narrowing range during this phase, and briefly broke above it when it reached an all-time high in July 2025 . Leb Crypto emphasizes the duration of this consolidation. XRP has remained below the resistance level without losing structural support. Monthly candles cluster tightly, suggesting reduced volatility and controlled price behavior. In classical technical analysis, this pattern often precedes directional expansion once resistance gives way.

According to reports, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has registered the Pi Network white paper under entry number 549, filed by PiBit Ltd. ESMA is a government agency that keeps an eye on the EU’s financial markets and investment products. By registering the Pi Network white paper, ESMA has given Pi Coin a legal node. However, for Pi Network to achieve full MiCA authorization, it is dependent on whether Pi Network can meet the full scope of EU regulations. The results of rigorous audits, legal assessments, and approvals from relevant authorities will determine it. ESMA props up Pi Network for partnerships in the EU and EEA The registration doesn’t mean that Pi Network is officially a crypto asset right away, but it does mean that it is a legal company that follows EU rules. The asset has to go through other steps, including meeting EU standards on anti-money laundering, data protection, and financial reporting. The recognition comes at a time when authorities are paying more attention to how tokens are issued, how investors are protected, and how open the market is. Germany’s BaFin stopped Ethena Labs from issuing the sUSDe coin in the EU last year because of problems with the rules. The EU has also started to give licenses to crypto and stablecoin issuers that follow MiCA rules. Other organizations that have taken root have failed to comply. As reported by Cryptopolitan, a French regulator revealed that 30% of crypto companies operating in France without a MiCA license are unresponsive. There’s no communication on ​whether they intend to get the licence required under new EU ‌ rules or will cease operating by July. 40% are not ​seeking the license, with only 30% applying for a license Pi points bearish as trading volume plummets 33% Pi Coin price continues to stagnate, even as the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery this January. The Pi Network price has been stagnating at or close to the $0.20 level for several weeks and is unable to go beyond key resistance levels. Pi Coin currently trades over 90% below its all-time price. Bearish trends dominate the chart, and the momentum seems to be weak. It has been trading at approximately 7 million coins daily, which is a small number for a network of this scale. Generally, bullish movement is supported by an increase in volume. Its trading volume is down 33% in the last 24 hours. On a daily basis, approximately $1 million worth of PI enters circulation through mainnet migrations and token unlocks. To date, PI has been locked at more than 4.83 billion, and it is slowly migrating and is influencing the short-term price momentum. Meanwhile, the price of Pi is in a tight range of consolidation.

The incident occurred at around 23:00 UTC and was first detailed by on-chain investigator ZachXBT , who traced the movement of the stolen funds across multiple blockchains. On January 10, 2026 at around 11 pm UTC a victim lost $282M+ worth of LTC & BTC due to a hardware wallet social engineering scam. The attacker began converting the stolen LTC & BTC to Monero via multiple instant exchanges causing the XMR price to sharply increase. BTC was also… — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 16, 2026 According to ZachXBT’s analysis, the attacker gained access to the victim’s hardware wallet and drained approximately 2.05 million Litecoin ( LTC ) and 1,459 Bitcoin ( BTC ). The stolen assets were rapidly laundered through instant exchanges and cross-chain protocols in an effort to evade tracking. On-chain analysis indicates that a large portion of the stolen Litecoin and Bitcoin was converted into Monero ( XMR ), triggering an abrupt spike in market activity. Price data shows Monero surging by roughly 70% over the four days following the hack, with the chart reflecting a steep rally followed by increased volatility as trading volumes expanded. Further on-chain tracing revealed that part of the Bitcoin was routed through THORChain, where about 818 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $78 million, was swapped into Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP , and additional Litecoin. These transactions spanned several networks, highlighting the growing use of cross-chain liquidity protocols in large-scale laundering attempts. Hacked crypto routing through THORchain. Source: Lookonchain Identity of involved parties The analysis also noted no indications linking the attack to North Korean hacking groups, which have been associated with previous high-profile crypto thefts. The identity of the victim remains unknown, and it is still unclear whether the stolen funds belonged to a single individual or an organization. The incident reinforces warnings from security researchers that social engineering has become the leading cause of major crypto losses. By exploiting trust rather than technical vulnerabilities, attackers are increasingly able to compromise even hardware wallet users, with market disruptions.

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation slapped Nexo with a $500,000 fine after discovering the firm gave out crypto-backed loans to more than 5,456 people in the state without getting the necessary approvals first. Regulators say the company also skipped basic steps like checking if borrowers could actually pay back the money. What regulators found The enforcement action targets a Cayman Islands-based part of Nexo called Nexo Capital Inc. Officials found the company handed out both personal and business loans backed by cryptocurrency between July 26, 2018, and November 22, 2022, all while operating without a valid California license. “Lenders must follow the law and avoid making risky loans that endanger consumers—and crypto-backed loans are no exception,” said KC Mohseni, who runs the state financial department. Regulators discovered Nexo didn’t bother looking into whether borrowers had the money to repay loans, what other debts they already owed, or what their credit looked like. These are standard checks that traditional lenders must perform before handing out money. Beyond paying the fine, Nexo must move all California customer money to a properly licensed U.S. partner company within the next 150 days. The punishment comes at a bad time for Nexo. The corporation has been indicating that it wants to return to the American market, but this action raises concerns about whether existing problems will continue to hinder that effort. Although the punishment is for previous actions, it comes at a time when digital currency startups are questioning whether regulators are softening their stance. California carries significant weight in these areas. It is the country’s largest state in terms of population and economic activity, making it an important market for any company that provides consumer financial services. What happens in California often foreshadows how things will unfold nationally. During the time period regulators examined, Nexo grew its crypto-backed lending business substantially before eventually pulling out of the U.S. market altogether. The company left as state and federal officials increased their scrutiny of how it operated. Questions about Nexo’s future These days, Nexo no longer offers its traditional crypto lending products to American customers. It only provides crypto-backed borrowing services to people outside the United States, a change that came after multiple run-ins with regulators. Kadan Stadelmann, who works as Chief Technology Officer at Komodo Platform, said the findings should worry people. “The fact that Nexo failed basic ability-to-repay checks for thousands undoubtedly raises red flags about systemic compliance shortfalls, and consumers should heed these warnings,” he noted. Stadelmann pointed out that California’s rules focus heavily on making sure loans are backed by enough collateral to protect people from defaults. The state also has strong borrower protections designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial meltdown, but in the crypto world . He also mentioned that Nexo’s settlement approach, where companies do not admit or deny wrongdoing, helps firms avoid problems like shareholder lawsuits or getting blocked from obtaining future licenses. However, he warned the company “could face further admissions, increasing fines, or regulatory monitors” as officials continue examining its track record. “Other crypto companies have faced similar regulatory penalties, including the likes of FTX and Binance, and remain in business. Why not Nexo?” Stadelmann asked. The California action adds to Nexo’s growing list of regulatory headaches in America and raises fresh questions about whether firms with checkered compliance histories can make a comeback, even if the political winds seem to be shifting in crypto’s favor.

This analysis provides a structured, evidence-based examination of HBAR’s potential price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, specifically addressing the widely discussed $0.5 threshold. Market data from Q1 2025 indicates continued institutional interest in hashgraph technology, particularly for supply chain and identity verification applications. Hedera Price Prediction: Foundation and Methodology Any credible cryptocurrency price prediction requires multiple analytical frameworks. Consequently, this examination employs three primary methodologies: technical analysis of historical price action, fundamental analysis of network growth metrics, and comparative analysis against broader market trends. The Governing Council’s ongoing expansion provides crucial institutional validation. Furthermore, real-world transaction volume on the Hedera mainnet serves as a tangible growth indicator separate from speculative trading activity. Historical performance shows HBAR establishing stronger support levels with each market cycle. Network upgrades, including scheduled consensus algorithm improvements, directly impact transaction efficiency and cost. These technological fundamentals create the underlying value proposition. Market analysts from firms like CoinShares and Messari consistently highlight transaction finality speed and carbon-negative operations as key differentiators in institutional reports. Quantitative Models and Historical Patterns Statistical models based on adoption curves suggest correlation between enterprise use cases and token valuation. The table below summarizes key network metrics that influence long-term price models: Metric Current Status (2025) Projected Growth Driver Average Daily Transactions Millions scale Enterprise DApp migration Governing Council Members 30+ multinationals Expansion to 39 by 2027 Staked HBAR Percentage Increasing quarterly Network security enhancement HBAR Price Trajectory: 2026 Analysis The year 2026 represents the first major inflection point in this prediction timeline. By this period, several currently developing enterprise projects should reach full production deployment. Market analysts anticipate these developments could catalyze increased network utility demand. Regulatory clarity expected across major jurisdictions may further accelerate institutional participation. However, macroeconomic factors including interest rate environments will simultaneously influence all digital asset valuations. Technical analysis of price charts identifies several potential resistance and support zones. The $0.25 to $0.35 range appears as a significant technical barrier based on historical volume profiles. Conversely, sustained network development could establish a higher foundational floor price. Transaction fee economics and staking reward structures will play crucial roles in determining miner and validator incentives, thereby affecting circulating supply dynamics. Network Utility Growth: Expansion of Hedera Token Service and Consensus Service implementations. Market Cycle Position: Historical patterns suggest potential alignment with broader crypto market cycles. Regulatory Development: Expected frameworks for enterprise blockchain deployments. The 2027 Outlook and Mid-Term Projections Projecting to 2027 requires examining technology adoption curves and competitor landscape evolution. The enterprise blockchain sector may experience consolidation, potentially benefiting established networks with proven track records. Hedera’s unique hashgraph consensus mechanism offers distinct advantages for specific use cases requiring high throughput and deterministic finality. These advantages could translate to preferential adoption in sectors like: Global supply chain management platforms Digital identity verification systems Carbon credit tracking and ESG reporting Micropayment infrastructures for IoT devices Comparative analysis with similar layer-1 networks suggests valuation multiples based on transaction volume and developer activity. The HBAR treasury’s scheduled release schedule also introduces predictable supply-side variables. Consequently, price models must account for both organic demand growth and controlled supply inflation. Historical data indicates that networks achieving critical mass in enterprise adoption often experience non-linear valuation growth as network effects accelerate. Expert Consensus and Diverging Views Industry reports from Gartner and Forrester provide context for enterprise adoption timelines. While optimistic projections exist, conservative analyses emphasize the highly competitive nature of the layer-1 blockchain space. Some financial analysts caution that technological superiority does not guarantee market dominance, citing historical examples from various tech sectors. Nevertheless, the consensus acknowledges Hedera’s strong positioning within regulated industry verticals where its governance model provides distinct compliance advantages. 2030 Horizon: The Path to $0.5 and Beyond The $0.5 price level represents a significant psychological and technical milestone, approximately representing a specific market capitalization threshold relative to current valuations. Achieving this target by 2030 would require sustained compound growth across multiple metrics. Fundamentally, this growth depends on the network capturing meaningful market share in the enterprise DLT sector, which various consultancies project could reach trillion-dollar valuation by the decade’s end. Scenario analysis reveals multiple potential pathways. A bullish scenario involves accelerated regulatory adoption and technological integration across financial services. A baseline scenario assumes steady, incremental growth aligned with overall market expansion. A conservative scenario accounts for increased competition or unforeseen technological disruptions. Each scenario carries different implications for the timing and sustainability of price levels above $0.5. The network’s ability to maintain its energy efficiency advantage and low transaction costs will be critical differentiators. Long-term valuation models often incorporate discounted cash flow methodologies adapted for utility tokens. These models consider projected transaction fee revenue, staking yields, and token velocity. While inherently speculative, they provide structured frameworks for evaluation. The increasing institutional participation in network governance through the Hedera Governing Council reduces certain systemic risks associated with decentralized networks, potentially warranting valuation premiums in traditional financial models. Conclusion This Hedera price prediction analysis for 2026 through 2030 demonstrates that the $0.5 threshold represents a challenging but plausible milestone under specific conditions of network adoption and market development. The HBAR price trajectory will fundamentally depend on real-world utility growth rather than speculative trading activity. Continued expansion of the Governing Council, increasing transaction volumes, and successful enterprise deployments provide the most reliable indicators for long-term valuation growth. While market volatility remains inevitable, Hedera’s unique technological and governance foundations position it distinctly within the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Investors and observers should monitor network metrics with equal priority to price movements, as these fundamentals ultimately drive sustainable value. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for HBAR’s price reaching $0.5? The primary factor is substantial growth in real-world, enterprise-level transaction volume on the Hedera network, moving beyond speculation to utility-driven demand for the HBAR token. Q2: How does Hedera’s governance model affect its price potential? The Governing Council model provides stability and institutional trust, which can reduce perceived risk for enterprise adopters. This structured governance could support more predictable long-term growth compared to entirely decentralized networks. Q3: What are the main risks to this Hedera price prediction? Key risks include increased competition from other layer-1 networks, broader cryptocurrency market downturns, slower-than-expected enterprise adoption, and technological challenges in scaling while maintaining security and decentralization. Q4: How does staking HBAR influence its future price? Staking reduces circulating supply available for trading and enhances network security. As more HBAR is staked for network consensus and rewards, the available liquid supply decreases, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Q5: Could HBAR surpass $0.5 before 2030? While possible under exceptionally bullish market conditions and accelerated adoption, most analytical models suggest sustained growth toward that milestone throughout the latter half of this decade rather than a sudden spike, barring unforeseen major partnerships or technological breakthroughs.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $150L by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they’ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast. However, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin’s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.

Currently, the price is aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces selling pressure Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure as it dropped toward $95K. Currently, the BTC price is facing minor selling domination around immediate support channels. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $752 million, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $95,116, decreasing by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades at 61.94, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Selling domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. However, buyers are aiming for a trend continuation above $100K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.05, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD indicator has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $97,280, it will fuel a bullish rally to $107,835. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $89,047, beginning a bearish trend to $81,025. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying pressure as sellers failed to push the price below immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 4,279 BTC for $451.06 million at an average price of $105,412. The report revealed that the company held 35,102 BTC as of December 30, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction January 2026 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a recovery around January 2026. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2026 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the years following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price after a downturn in 2025. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2026. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2026 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $150,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2028, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2029 By 2029, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2030 Projections for 2030 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2031 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2032 The forecast for 2032 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2026, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $150,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,738 by the end of 2028. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November. Bitcoin ended December 2025 on a bearish note by trading below $90K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 12:57:00

By 2026, the market has matured enough to separate noise from narrative. Coverage is easy to buy, and attention is fragmented. But what actually matters is who shapes perception when it impacts valuation, listings, fundraising, or long-term credibility. This article explores top PR firms that can shape market narratives — how a project is framed by media, investors, and the broader ecosystem over time. What a Top Crypto PR Agency Does A strong crypto PR agency in 2026 is not defined by: the number of articles published, guaranteed placements, or inflated reach metrics. Top agencies are defined by their ability to do four things consistently: 1. Shape perception, not just coverage They understand how stories compound across media and how early framing influences later interpretation. 2. Translate complexity into market-relevant narratives They turn technical, abstract, or controversial projects into stories that investors and journalists can contextualize. 3. Operate within market reality They understand regulatory pressure, compliance boundaries, sentiment cycles, and when exposure creates risk instead of value. 4. Protect reputation before amplifying it They know when silence, restraint, or delay is strategically correct. With this framework in mind, here are crypto PR agencies that consistently demonstrate narrative-level impact. Coinbound Coinbound remains one of the most visible crypto PR agencies globally — and that visibility is not accidental. The agency’s strength lies in broad market exposure, supported by strong relationships with crypto-native publications and influencers. Coinbound performs best when a project already has traction and needs consistent awareness across the ecosystem. Where Coinbound is effective: Tier-one crypto media access Influencer-driven amplification Reliable execution for announcements and growth-stage campaigns Best fit: Established crypto companies Exchanges, platforms, and mature protocols Projects prioritizing scale and awareness Outset PR Outset PR focuses on narrative strategy, data-driven execution, and reputation control. Rather than chasing volume, the agency works on positioning: why a project matters now, how it should be interpreted by the market, and which narratives should be avoided altogether. This approach is often chosen by founders who see PR as a risk-management and trust-building function. Where Outset PR stands out: Narrative architecture tied to market context Measurable outcomes rather than activity metrics Strong execution for presales, DeFi, and infrastructure projects Best fit: Early- to growth-stage crypto teams Founders preparing for fundraising or listings Projects where credibility directly affects valuation NinjaPromo NinjaPromo operates at the intersection of PR, marketing, and growth execution. The agency is effective when PR needs to support broader objectives such as user acquisition, brand awareness, and community expansion. Narrative shaping here is closely tied to coordinated campaigns rather than standalone media work. Where NinjaPromo is effective: Integrated PR and marketing campaigns Cross-channel execution Structured, scalable delivery Best fit: Consumer-facing Web3 products Projects combining PR with paid and social strategies Teams looking for one integrated partner MarketAcross MarketAcros s is recognized for its scale and operational consistency, particularly for large blockchain ecosystems. The agency excels when projects generate frequent updates and require broad, international coverage. Narrative shaping here comes from sustained presence rather than bespoke positioning. Where MarketAcross is effective: Global media distribution High-volume campaign execution Support for large, multi-market ecosystems Best fit: L1s, L2s, and major blockchain networks Projects with ongoing announcements Teams needing structured, continuous PR support GuerillaBuzz GuerillaBuzz approaches crypto PR through content, SEO, and long-term narrative visibility. Instead of focusing solely on mainstream crypto media, the agency emphasizes organic discovery and durable content that shapes perception over time, especially for newer projects. Where GuerillaBuzz stands out: Content-led narrative building Organic and search-driven visibility Long-term brand presence Best fit: Early-stage crypto projects Teams focused on organic growth Founders investing in long-term discovery Top Crypto PR Agencies in 2026 Agency Core Strength Narrative Focus Best Project Stage Ideal For Coinbound Media reach and influencer amplification Awareness-driven narratives Growth / post-launch Projects that already have traction and need scale Outset PR Strategic positioning and reputation control Market and investor narratives Early to growth Founders prioritizing credibility, fundraising, listings NinjaPromo Integrated PR + marketing execution Campaign-led narratives Growth Consumer-facing Web3 products needing coordinated growth Melrose PR Founder and executive credibility Thought leadership narratives Any, especially mid-stage Teams building long-term trust and media authority MarketAcross Global distribution and consistency Presence-driven narratives Growth to mature L1s, L2s, and large ecosystems with frequent updates GuerillaBuzz Content and organic visibility Long-term discovery narratives Early stage Projects focused on SEO, content, and durable visibility Final Thoughts Crypto PR has evolved beyond hype cycles. In 2026, the agencies that matter are those that understand timing, restraint, and market psychology — and can shape narratives that hold up under scrutiny. If you are selecting a PR partner, choose the agency that understands your market risk — not just your media wishlist. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Consumer loan marketplace volumes surged 131% y/y to $2.71B in Q4, setting up for a likely revenue beat. YLDS stablecoin issuance exploded, growing 198% month-on-month in December, positioning FIGR for outsized 2026 revenue gains. Despite a 36x forward EBITDA multiple, FIGR offers growth at a reasonable price as adoption and margins expand. The mood in the stock markets to kick off 2026 is decidedly nervous. Investors continue to back away from large-cap tech stocks, burdened by heavy valuations after last year's sharp rally. In the wake of a potential market rotation, I continue to emphasize single-stock selection, particularly in stocks that have compelling growth opportunities and yet still trade at reasonable prices. Figure Technologies ( FIGR ) is an example of a stock that got caught up in the crosswinds of a declining cryptocurrency market, though its blockchain lending technology has little bearing on overall crypto market caps. Recently, however, its stock has shown more adamant divergence against that weakness, especially after a recent results pre-release that showed acceleration on key metrics. Data by YCharts I last wrote a buy article on Figure in November, when the stock was last trading at $37 per share. Since then, my position in the name has approximately doubled. Now, we do have to exercise caution here. In the space of just a month, Figure has vaulted from being a choppy post-IPO trader to a momentum stock. I'm not pulling the plug on my gains yet, but we do have to watch out for the fact that the stock is no longer a value play. That said, with strong operating data and a positive fundamental setup for the remainder of the year, I retain my buy rating here. Consumer loan marketplace volumes shoot up, YLDS issuance jumps Let's first discuss the primary news that shot Figure Technologies up higher in January. On January 12, the company announced preliminary Q4 operating data (similar to how many trading companies like Robinhood ( HOOD ) or Coinbase ( COIN ) release monthly trading metrics) that showcased a clear uptick in core KPIs. The results are shown below: Figure key Q4 operating data (Figure January press release) Figure's consumer loan marketplace volume shot up 131% y/y to $2.71 billion in the fourth quarter, accelerating sharply versus 70% y/y growth in Q3. As a reminder to give context on how Figure earns revenue, Figure's core business lies in HELOCs (home equity lines of credit). Its technology enables lenders to utilize the blockchain to originate loans. The chart below gives a refresher on the borrowing process through the Figure platform. Lenders utilizing Figure typically close within a median of 10 days (but as little as 5 days), versus an industry average of 42 days based on manual processes. The speed of these transactions (and the associated cost reductions for lenders) is driven by utilizing automated processes to value homes (collateral) and verify title and borrower income streams, rather than a human underwriter. Figure loan process (Figure IPO prospectus) Figure's additional differentiation exists in allowing lenders to ""tokenize"" these loans into blockchain assets, which can then be packaged and sold via blockchain, similar to traditional mortgage-backed securities. To date, Figure's revenue streams primarily consist of fees on loan origination, fees on loan servicing, and the gains it makes from unloading tokenized loans it holds on its own balance sheet. As such, consumer loan marketplace originations (the data that Figure just reported) is the number-one KPI that is catalyzing revenue growth. The company hasn't reported revenue yet for Q4 (we expect the formal results in mid-February), but we can surmise with this pre-release of data that Figure is set up for a meaningful beat. In Q3, as shown below, the company had achieved only 70% in consumer marketplace loan growth and 42% in revenue growth. Figure Q3 highlights (Figure Q3 earnings deck) We expect a correspondingly sharp jump in revenue growth in Q4, alongside the burst in consumer loan volumes. The other key data for us to zoom in on is issuance trends for the company's stablecoin, YLDS. Now, YLDS is a relatively small market-cap stablecoin next to some of its larger and better-known rivals, like USDT (the largest) and USDC (second largest). USDC is sponsored by Circle ( CRCL ), a public company, and so we also have reported trends on issuance for Figure's rivals. Circle recently reported that through Q3, total stablecoin circulation of $254 billion rose 59% y/y, while USDC rose 108% y/y to $73.7 billion (roughly 29% market share). Stablecoin issuance trends (Circle Q3 earnings deck) An up-to-date scan on CoinMarketCap shows that USDC issuance has since grown to $76 billion in market cap, representing only single-digit sequential growth and ~73% y/y growth (versus $43.9 billion in circulation in Q4 of 2024). Top crypto market caps (CoinMarketCap) Figure, meanwhile, just reported December-end YLDS circulation growing to $328 million. There isn't any y/y comparison here since YLDS just launched in 2025, but December grew 198% month-on-month and by more than 15x quarter-over-quarter (versus only $21 million in issuance at the end of September). In other words, Figure-backed YLDS is rapidly gaining market share against the #1 and #2 coins. Rising YLDS issuance will be a key revenue driver for Figure in 2026. Interest rate declines will weigh on the company's net interest income (earned from Figure holding U.S. treasury securities on the cash that users deposit in exchange for YLDS tokens), but the rapid rise in issuance will more than offset weaker interest rates. Valuation and key takeaways Now, we will mention our principal concern: valuation. After the stock's sharp recent rally in January, Figure has attained a premium among blockchain/crypto stocks. As shown in the chart below, Figure is now sitting at a 36x forward adjusted EBITDA. This is richer than Circle (the USDC parent) and is sitting at roughly double the valuation of Coinbase, the crypto wallet and trading platform that has been slammed by the falling prices of Bitcoin and other altcoins. Data by YCharts Figure is no longer a value stock, but I still consider the name to be a ""growth at a reasonable price"" play, especially as adoption of its technologies is still quite nascent (as evidenced by consumer loan volumes still growing at a 134% y/y pace in December). In my view, the upcoming full Q4 earnings release will showcase strong acceleration in revenue and lead to meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin expansion that will also help to compress forward multiples down. Stay long here and keep riding Figure's rally upward.",FIGR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-17 13:00:00
57243659,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262468,1768654812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Stunning $107K Target Emerges from Technical Breakout and Macro Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-prediction-107k-target/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Stunning $107K Target Emerges from Technical Breakout and Macro Shift Global cryptocurrency markets are witnessing a pivotal moment as fresh analysis, published on March 15, 2025, suggests Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for a significant upward move, with a potential target of $107,000. This forecast hinges on a powerful confluence of technical chart patterns, shifting on-chain investor behavior, and fundamental macroeconomic trends. Consequently, traders and analysts are closely monitoring these developments for signs of a sustained bull run. Bitcoin Price Prediction: The Technical Foundation for a Rally Technical analysts have identified a critical breakout that could propel Bitcoin’s value. Specifically, the premier cryptocurrency recently surged past the $95,000 upper boundary of a long-forming ascending triangle pattern. This pattern, characterized by a flat resistance line and a rising support trendline, typically signals accumulation before a bullish breakout. Moreover, the asset has successfully held this level as support, confirming the breakout’s strength and transforming previous resistance into a new foundation for price discovery. Simultaneously, the market is anticipating another bullish technical signal: a golden cross. This event occurs when a shorter-term moving average, like the 20-day, crosses above a longer-term one, such as the 50-day. Historically, golden crosses have often preceded substantial price increases across various asset classes. Therefore, the imminent formation of this pattern on Bitcoin’s daily chart adds considerable weight to the optimistic outlook. For context, similar technical setups in previous cycles have led to multi-month rallies, providing a historical precedent for the current analysis. Easing Sell Pressure from Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Beyond chart patterns, on-chain data reveals a crucial shift in investor sentiment that could reduce downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Analysis of blockchain activity shows that selling from long-term holders—investors who have held BTC for over five years—has decreased substantially. Notably, outflows from these veteran wallets have fallen to less than half of their peak levels observed earlier in the market cycle. This decline in selling from the most committed cohort is significant for several reasons. First, long-term holders are often considered the most resilient, typically selling only during periods of extreme profit-taking or market euphoria. Their reduced distribution suggests a phase of consolidation and renewed conviction. Second, with fewer coins being sold by this group, the available supply on exchanges tightens. This supply shock, when met with steady or increasing demand, creates a powerful upward pressure on price. The data indicates a maturation of the holder base, a factor often associated with the later, more stable stages of a bull market. Expert Insight: The Liquidity and Macroeconomic Catalyst The third pillar supporting the $107,000 Bitcoin price prediction involves global financial conditions. According to the analysis, an environment of expanding global liquidity, coupled with the anticipated conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening (QT) program, could serve as a major catalyst. Quantitative tightening is the process by which central banks reduce their balance sheets, effectively withdrawing liquidity from the financial system. Its conclusion often signals a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy stance. Historically, assets like Bitcoin have performed exceptionally well in periods of easy monetary policy and high liquidity. The analysis further posits that under these conditions, Bitcoin could begin to outperform traditional safe-haven assets like gold. This potential shift represents a profound evolution in Bitcoin’s market narrative, framing it not just as a speculative tech asset but as a legitimate hedge in a changing macro landscape. The interplay between central bank policy and digital asset performance is now a primary focus for institutional analysts worldwide. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin Versus Traditional Assets To understand the potential scale of Bitcoin’s move, a comparison with other asset classes is instructive. The following table outlines key performance drivers: Asset Class Primary 2025 Driver Liquidity Sensitivity Volatility Profile Bitcoin (BTC) Technical breakout, adoption, macro hedge Very High High Gold (XAU) Inflation fears, geopolitical risk Moderate Low U.S. Equities (S&P 500) Corporate earnings, interest rate expectations High Moderate U.S. Treasury Bonds Federal Reserve policy, inflation data Direct (Yield Control) Low As the table illustrates, Bitcoin’s unique combination of high liquidity sensitivity and distinct catalysts positions it for outsized moves when macro conditions align with its technical posture. This multifaceted driver set differentiates it from more traditional investments. Conclusion The Bitcoin price prediction of $107,000 is not based on speculation but on a triad of observable factors: a confirmed technical breakout, a measurable decline in sell pressure from core holders, and a looming shift in global liquidity conditions. While market predictions are inherently uncertain, the convergence of these elements presents a compelling, evidence-based case for significant upward potential. Investors and observers should monitor the $95,000 support level, on-chain holder behavior metrics, and official communications from the Federal Reserve for confirmation of this trajectory. The coming months will test this thesis, potentially reshaping the landscape for digital assets. FAQs Q1: What is an ascending triangle pattern in Bitcoin trading? An ascending triangle is a bullish chart pattern with a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support trendline. A breakout above the resistance, especially on high volume, often signals the start of a new upward trend. Q2: How does quantitative tightening (QT) affect Bitcoin’s price? Quantitative tightening reduces the amount of money in the financial system, which can lower risk appetite and liquidity. Its end or reversal typically increases system liquidity, which has historically been positive for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Q3: Why is selling from long-term holders important? Long-term holders (LTHs) are considered strong hands. When they reduce selling, it indicates confidence and reduces the available supply on the market. This can lead to a supply shock if demand remains constant or increases, pushing prices higher. Q4: What is a golden cross, and is it a reliable indicator? A golden cross is a technical indicator where a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. While it is a widely watched bullish signal, it is a lagging indicator and should be used in conjunction with other data points like volume and on-chain metrics for better reliability. Q5: Could Bitcoin really outperform gold? The analysis suggests it’s possible in a specific macro environment. If the end of QT leads to renewed concerns about currency debasement or inflation, investors may allocate to both assets. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and digital nature could attract a disproportionate share of new capital compared to gold, leading to outperformance.

POS contract holdings are now 77.85 million ETH worth $256 billion, representing approximately 46.59% of ETH’s total supply held in a single wallet. The amount of Ether locked in Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (POS) contract system has jumped to a new all-time high amid the growing institutional participation. The POS contract system holds Ethereum tokens that validators stake to secure the Ethereum blockchain. The rise in staked ETH value reflects increased interest in long-term staking from network users. ETH total staked ETH hits a new ATH of ~ 36 million According to the Santiment report , there is a common misconception across the crypto ecosystem that POS contract holders are whale wallets. However, contrary to whale wallet behaviour, the POS contract staking wallet can’t allow sudden withdrawals to exchanges. The staked ETH can only be withdrawn slowly through validator exits , which are rate-limited by the protocol. 📊 The official Ethereum Proof-of-Stake deposit contract (formerly the ""Beacon Chain"" wallet) now holds 77.85M $ETH worth just over $256B, rising by 38.4% coins held in the past year. 💸 Its purpose is to hold ETH that has been staked by validators to secure the Ethereum… pic.twitter.com/FNf43AmSOb — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 17, 2026 Another misconception often raised by bears is that, in the event of adversities, the wallet size poses a liquidity risk. For instance, if the price of ETH were to drop sharply, prompting many validators to exit quickly, withdrawals could slow. Other concerns raised include the risk that the ETH price will be influenced by a small number of institutions over time. Meanwhile, the total staked ETH has hit another all-time high, reaching approximately 35.97 million ETH, according to validatorqueue data . The value represents approximately 30% of ETH’s total supply and a staked market cap surpassing $118 billion. Total ETH staked vs the % of supply staked. Source: Validatorque The Ether price has lost roughly 3.53% year to date and 0.02% over the past 24 hours. The token was trading at $3,297 at the time of publication, up 15% over the past month. Ethereum’s Exit and Entry validator queue. Source: Validatorqueue The Ethereum validator network now includes approximately 976,495 active validators plus an additional 2.57 million ETH waiting in the entry queue. At the same time, the validator exit queue has remained at a historic low of 32, reflecting a limited selling pressure from existing stakers. Bitmine plans to begin staking ETH via its own validator network Staked ETH enhances the security of the Ethereum blockchain by requiring validators to lock up ETH to propose and verify blocks. So far, the Liquid Staking Protocol, Lido Finance, remains the largest single provider of staking operations, accounting for approximately 24% of all staked ETH, according to Dune Analytics . The growth in total staked ETH has largely been driven by institutional players such as Bitmine Immersion Technologies. The Ethereum-focused treasury firm recently showed plans to start staking ETH for rewards through its MAVAN solution by depositing $219 million into the POS contract wallet. Arkham Intelligence tracked multiple wallets linked to Bitmine, showing transfers totaling 74,880 ETH, a pattern associated with institutional staking setups that collect funds before validator creation. Tom Lee confirmed in a post that Bitmine had finally begun staking its held ETH to earn interest income. The step would mark the firm’s first time staking through its own validator, MAVAN, especially with its current 4.07 million ETH with an approximate APY of 3.12%. This means that Bitmine could earn approximately 126,800 ETH, valued at $374 million, annually at the current ETH price. Additionally, Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) could increase this year as institutional participants enter the staking market. According to Sharplink’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom, stablecoins may be the biggest driver of growth this year, targeting approximately $500 billion by year’s end, representing approximately 62% growth from current levels.

This analysis provides a comprehensive, evidence-based examination of TRON’s price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, grounded in technical fundamentals, adoption metrics, and broader market dynamics. The TRON blockchain, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, has established itself as a major platform for decentralized applications and stablecoin transactions. TRON Price Prediction: Foundation and Market Context Understanding TRON’s future value requires examining its current ecosystem. The TRON network consistently processes more transactions than Ethereum, according to TRONSCAN data. This high throughput supports its primary use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi) and entertainment. Market analysts reference several key metrics when formulating TRON price predictions. These include network activity, total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi protocols, and the circulating supply of TRX tokens. Furthermore, the integration of USDT on the TRON network has significantly increased its utility and transaction volume. Historical price action provides essential context for future forecasts. TRX has demonstrated notable resilience during market downturns, often correlating with Bitcoin’s movements but with distinct volatility patterns. The token’s performance is intrinsically linked to the expansion of the TRON DAO ecosystem and strategic partnerships. For instance, collaborations with industry entities have historically influenced short-term price momentum. Consequently, any long-term TRON price prediction must account for both internal development and external cryptocurrency market cycles. Technical Analysis and Projection Methodologies for TRX Financial analysts employ multiple methodologies to project cryptocurrency values. For TRON, common approaches include quantitative modeling, on-chain analysis, and comparative valuation. Quantitative models often use variables like network growth rate, fee burn mechanisms, and macroeconomic indicators. On-chain analysis focuses on holder distribution, exchange flow, and active address counts. A summary of common analytical frameworks appears below. Methodology Primary Data Points Typical Forecast Horizon Quantitative Modeling Historical volatility, adoption curves, supply schedule Long-term (3-5 years) On-Chain Analysis Active addresses, mean coin age, exchange reserves Medium-term (1-12 months) Comparative Valuation Market cap vs. peers, TVL ratios, P/S multiples Cross-sectional These methodologies rarely produce a single price target. Instead, they establish probabilistic ranges based on different adoption and market scenarios. For example, a bullish scenario for TRX might assume accelerated dApp migration and regulatory clarity for stablecoins. A bearish scenario could involve intensified competition or broader crypto market contraction. Therefore, responsible TRON price predictions present a spectrum of possibilities rather than definitive figures. Expert Consensus and Institutional Outlook Leading cryptocurrency research firms publish periodic outlooks on major layer-1 networks like TRON. While specific price targets vary, several consensus themes emerge from their 2024 reports. Analysts generally acknowledge TRON’s dominance in the stablecoin transfer niche. They also highlight its high and consistent yield offerings as a key value proposition for holders. However, experts frequently cite centralization concerns and regulatory scrutiny over its stablecoin volume as potential headwinds. The institutional outlook remains cautiously optimistic, focusing on real-world utility over speculative trading. Year-by-Year TRX Forecast: 2026 to 2030 Trajectory Projecting TRON’s price involves synthesizing technical roadmaps with market cycle theories. The following analysis outlines potential pathways, emphasizing that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risk and volatility. All figures are illustrative models based on historical growth patterns and stated ecosystem goals. 2026 Outlook: This period may align with the latter phase of the next hypothesized market cycle. Price action will likely depend on the success of ongoing TRON network upgrades, particularly those enhancing scalability and interoperability. Mainstream adoption of blockchain-based payment systems could provide a significant catalyst. Analysts monitor the development of TRON’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and cross-chain bridges. 2027-2028 Horizon: These years could represent a consolidation and utility-growth phase. Value may be driven less by speculation and more by measurable economic activity on the chain. Key metrics to watch include: Sustained growth in daily active users (DAUs) Increase in non-stablecoin transaction volume Expansion of the TRON-based DeFi and NFT sectors Progress toward the vision of a decentralized internet infrastructure 2029-2030 Vision: Long-term forecasts become increasingly speculative. However, by 2030, blockchain technology is expected to achieve deeper integration into global financial and digital systems. TRON’s position will hinge on its ability to maintain technological relevance, community governance, and regulatory compliance. Success in these areas could see it cement a role as a primary settlement layer for specific digital asset classes. Critical Factors Influencing the TRON Price Trajectory Several deterministic factors will shape TRX’s value over the coming years. These variables extend beyond simple price charts and delve into fundamental blockchain economics. Regulatory Environment: Global regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and DeFi platforms will directly impact TRON, given its substantial USDT volume. Clear, supportive regulation could enhance institutional trust. Conversely, restrictive policies in major markets could constrain growth. The network’s response to compliance requirements will be a critical watchpoint. Technological Evolution: The blockchain space is fiercely competitive. TRON must continuously innovate to retain developers and users. Upgrades focusing on zero-knowledge proofs, improved consensus mechanisms, and enhanced smart contract capabilities are already on the roadmap. Their successful implementation is non-negotiable for long-term viability. Macroeconomic Conditions: As a risk-on digital asset, TRX remains sensitive to interest rate policies, inflation data, and global liquidity conditions. Periods of monetary tightening historically pressure cryptocurrency valuations. Therefore, the macro backdrop during the 2026-2030 period will provide a powerful undercurrent for all price action. Conclusion Formulating a precise TRON price prediction for 2026 through 2030 involves navigating significant uncertainty. However, by analyzing network fundamentals, adoption trends, and market cycles, informed projections are possible. The TRX token’s future value will ultimately reflect the TRON network’s success in providing scalable, useful, and decentralized digital infrastructure. Investors should prioritize understanding these underlying drivers over short-term price speculation. The coming years will test the resilience and innovation of every major blockchain, with TRON’s unique focus on media and stablecoins positioning it for a distinct evolutionary path. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for TRON’s price in 2026? The most critical factor will likely be the adoption rate of applications built on its network, particularly in DeFi and digital content, which drive transaction demand and fee revenue. Q2: How does Bitcoin’s price affect TRON’s long-term prediction? Bitcoin often sets the overall market sentiment and liquidity environment for cryptocurrencies. A strong, institutionalized Bitcoin market can create a favorable tide for altcoins like TRX, though TRON’s specific utility can help it decouple during certain periods. Q3: Are the circulating supply and tokenomics of TRX deflationary? The TRON network uses a portion of transaction fees to buy back and burn TRX tokens, creating a deflationary mechanism. The rate of burning is tied directly to network usage, making high transaction volume crucial for reducing supply. Q4: What are the main risks to a bullish TRON price prediction? Primary risks include technological obsolescence from faster/more secure competitors, adverse global regulations targeting stablecoins or dApps, and a failure to decentralize governance sufficiently to maintain community and developer trust. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data to track TRON’s fundamentals? Investors should monitor official metrics on TRONSCAN (the network explorer), independent analytics platforms like Token Terminal for revenue and TVL data, and quarterly reports from the TRON DAO for development progress and strategic updates.

After a sharp pullback that tested key technical levels, price action has begun to stabilize, prompting renewed discussion about XRP’s next directional move. For many market participants, the current structure suggests preparation rather than weakness. That outlook aligns with a recent technical assessment shared by market analyst CRYPTO CAPTAIN, who expressed strong confidence that XRP is setting up for a move beyond the $3 mark . His analysis focuses on higher-timeframe structure, confirmed support levels, and emerging reversal behavior. Price Action Defends a Key Support Level On the one-day XRP/USD chart from Bitstamp referenced in the analysis, the price recently dipped to the $2.04 region before rebounding. This level has acted as a structurally important support zone , repeatedly attracting buyers during periods of market stress. XRP’s ability to hold this area despite broader crypto volatility strengthens the bullish thesis. #XRP is going to 3$ and beyond pic.twitter.com/Nn8Mm2yfRk — CRYPTO CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) January 16, 2026 When price respects a well-established support on the daily timeframe, it often signals that selling pressure is weakening. Buyers typically step in at these zones to defend market structure, creating the foundation for a potential trend continuation. Technical Structure Signals Reversal Potential CRYPTO CAPTAIN highlighted signs of a developing bullish reversal following the dip. XRP showed a swift response from support, suggesting accumulation rather than panic-driven selling. This type of reaction often precedes a retest of higher resistance levels, especially when no lower lows form. From a technical standpoint, XRP remains within a broader uptrend as long as price holds above critical daily support. This structure keeps the probability of upward continuation intact while invalidating deeper bearish scenarios. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The $3 Level as the Next Major Target The $3 price zone represents both a psychological milestone and a technical resistance area. XRP previously faced rejection near this level, making it a natural point of interest for traders. A renewed approach toward $3 would test bullish momentum and market conviction. If XRP breaks and holds above this level, technical traders often view such a move as confirmation of strength rather than speculation. Volume expansion and follow-through would remain key factors in validating any breakout attempt. Market Conditions Favor a Bullish Continuation While short-term volatility persists across the crypto market, XRP’s resilience at support suggests underlying demand remains strong. Combined with improving regulatory clarity and sustained institutional interest, the technical setup appears constructive rather than fragile. Although no forecast guarantees immediate results, XRP’s current structure supports CRYPTO CAPTAIN’s view that a move toward $3 and potentially beyond remains a realistic near-term scenario.

One dominant scrum can flip field position, one yellow card can open space for two quick tries, and a late defensive stand can turn a “sure win” into a heartbreaking loss. That constant pressure is exactly why rugby attracts serious fans—and why betting markets around rugby stay active from kickoff to the final whistle. As the sport continues to grow globally, more fans are also changing how they place wagers. Instead of relying on slow, restrictive payment methods, bettors are increasingly choosing to bet with crypto , especially during live matches where timing is critical. Faster execution, fewer limitations, and greater control over funds are turning crypto-based wagering into a natural extension of how modern rugby is watched and bet on today. Rugby — Explosive Matches, Brutal Contact, and Massive Global Audiences Rugby isn’t just popular in one corner of the world—it dominates in several. In the UK, it’s a weekend ritual with packed stadiums and deep tradition. Australia treats the NRL as prime-time entertainment, with rivalries that pull huge national attention. New Zealand has turned rugby into a cultural identity, where national-team performance becomes headline news. And in France, Top 14 matches can feel like major events, with a fan culture that routinely fills large venues. The sport also delivers the kind of spectacle that holds attention for the full 80 minutes. Rugby’s flow is relentless: phases build, collisions land, and momentum swings are sudden. There’s no long reset between plays the way many viewers experience in other codes. You feel the match speeding up, slowing down, then exploding again. That intensity becomes the foundation for betting interest. Every possession looks meaningful. Every substitution can change the game’s rhythm. Rugby rewards people who can read pressure—whether they’re watching as fans or thinking like bettors. Top Online Sportsbooks to Turn Passion for Rugby into Profit Below is an overview of platforms that align well with modern rugby betting—especially for players who want crypto flexibility and reliable execution during fast-moving matches. These are not ranked as “best to worst”; each one fits a different betting style. Dexsport — Web3 Flagship for Live Rugby Without KYC Dexsport is designed around speed, privacy, and transparency. It supports major coins and stablecoins, keeps the onboarding fast, and removes identity-verification friction. For live rugby, that matters: markets move quickly, and the ability to deposit, bet, and manage positions without delays is a serious plus. It’s also built to stay responsive during high-pressure match phases. Lucky Block — Bonus-Driven Model with Global Markets Lucky Block is geared toward users who like a sleek experience plus strong promotional energy. Its wide sports coverage makes it appealing for bettors following multiple rugby leagues and tournaments across regions, while crypto support keeps deposits and withdrawals flexible. Betplay — Speed via Lightning Network Betplay’s identity is speed. With Lightning Network support, it’s built for bettors who want near-instant movement of funds and quick access to markets. That’s especially valuable during live matches where timing can affect the odds you lock in. Mega Dice — High-Volume Crypto Betting Mega Dice suits bettors who place a lot of action across multiple events and want broad crypto support. Its sportsbook coverage continues expanding, and the platform’s overall “high-activity” feel fits users who treat matchdays as multi-bet sessions rather than single wagers. Voltage Bet — Hybrid Crypto + Fiat Approach Voltage Bet offers a familiar sportsbook feel with crypto alongside traditional options. For rugby fans transitioning into crypto, this hybrid model can be comfortable—especially if they bet across multiple sports in the same account. Taken together, these rugby crypto betting sites show how the market is shifting toward faster execution, broader coin support, and fewer payment bottlenecks—especially during live play. From Six Nations to the NRL: Where the Biggest Rugby Action Happens Rugby betting isn’t centered on one league—it’s driven by a handful of competitions that consistently generate attention and liquidity. Six Nations: Historic matchups and national pride create tight, emotional games where markets stay active deep into the second half. Rivalries here often produce sharp price swings because one momentum shift can reshape the entire match narrative. NRL (Australia): Fast tempo, frequent fixtures, and intense local rivalries make it a natural home for weekly betting volume. The NRL’s rhythm also supports in-play strategies because the game can flip on a single defensive error or sin-bin decision. Rugby World Cup: The global peak. Betting activity spikes because casual audiences arrive, lines tighten, and public money often pushes favorites—creating interesting value pockets for experienced bettors across group stages and knockouts. Top 14 (France): Physical, tactical rugby in loud stadiums. The competition’s depth and intensity produce matches where discipline and set-piece dominance matter—useful for bettors who track style matchups rather than just team names. Together, these competitions explain why rugby is a year-round betting ecosystem rather than a seasonal one. The Teams and Players Defining Modern Rugby Right Now At the top level, a few national teams consistently shape expectations. New Zealand remains the sport’s most iconic brand, with a style that can punish mistakes instantly. South Africa sets the standard for physical pressure and game control. Ireland has been a modern benchmark for structure, tempo management, and clinical execution when momentum shifts. At club level, the “best team” conversation depends on the competition—because style matters. Some sides dominate through speed and attacking shape; others win through discipline, set-piece control, and relentless defensive phases. That variety is exactly why rugby remains so bettable. Star power also moves markets. A world-class fly-half changes territory and scoring probability. Elite forwards change breakdown outcomes and penalty patterns. One dominant winger can turn a single overlap into seven points—instantly changing the live price. That’s why bettors often focus on markets that map directly to influence: match winner and handicap lines totals (especially when discipline patterns are clear) first try scorer / anytime try scorer team points by half (useful when teams start fast or finish strong) When a key player is ruled out late, odds can move quickly—because rugby is a sport where one position can affect the whole shape. Why Every Tackle, Card, and Try Changes the Game in Real Time Rugby’s betting appeal is built on micro-turning points. The sport doesn’t wait for “big moments”—it creates them constantly. Penalties can swing territory and scoreboard pressure in minutes. Injuries can force tactical reshuffles. And cards are game-changers: a yellow card creates space, changes defensive fatigue, and often triggers the exact scoring window bettors look for. That’s why rugby is a perfect live-betting sport. The match doesn’t pause long enough for slow execution. You either act in the moment—or you watch the value disappear. This is where speed matters, and where rugby betting with crypto can feel like an advantage rather than a novelty. When markets move quickly, frictionless execution becomes part of the edge. Why Rugby Fans Are Ditching Traditional Payments for Crypto Rugby is global by nature, and that creates a simple problem: traditional payments don’t always travel well. Card limitations, bank blocks, currency friction, and regional processing delays become annoying fast—especially when you’re betting on competitions across time zones. Crypto sidesteps much of that. BTC, ETH, and stablecoins have become the practical trio for modern wagering because they’re widely supported, easy to move, and not tied to one country’s banking rails. That flexibility matters during peak tournament periods when deposits and withdrawals need to work smoothly. For many bettors, the shift is also psychological: they want control of their funds, predictable settlement, and fewer interruptions. That’s why rugby league betting with Bitcoin keeps growing as more international audiences follow the sport. How Rugby Betting Is Changing — and What 2026 Will Look Like By 2026, rugby betting will be even more live-driven. Pre-match will still matter, but the growth is in micro-markets and real-time strategy. Expect more emphasis on: live-only betting windows with faster odds refresh micro-markets tied to momentum (next score, next card, next penalty) less tolerance for delays, rejected bets, or long verification processes This evolution favors platforms that are built for speed and constant execution. It also aligns with the broader trend of crypto payments for rugby betting, where bettors want smoother movement of funds and fewer interruptions on matchday. Conclusion Rugby is a sport defined by pressure, rhythm, and constant motion. There is little time to hesitate, both on the field and in the moments when decisions matter most. That same dynamic applies to modern betting, where timing and execution can define long-term results. Crypto sportsbooks align naturally with the way rugby is played and followed today. They support faster decision-making, global access, and uninterrupted betting during high-intensity phases of a match. As more fans move away from traditional systems, crypto-based platforms are no longer just alternatives — they are becoming the standard. For bettors looking ahead, the direction is clear. Choose sportsbooks that respect speed, transparency, and control, and follow a sport that rewards those who can read momentum in real time.

Many appear briefly, then disappear from the conversation. A smaller group surfaces repeatedly across media coverage, market commentary, and investor discussions. The distinction is storytelling. In a sector where information moves quickly and attention is scarce, visibility depends less on how loudly a project communicates and more on whether its story helps others interpret the market around it. Visibility Comes From Narrative, Not Frequency Crypto media operates under relentless pressure. Reporters are inundated with updates and must prioritize what contextualizes broader themes: regulatory shifts, new risks, market structure changes, liquidity cycles. Projects gain durable visibility when their communications reinforce these narratives rather than compete with them. Without narrative alignment and substance-driven content , even materially important developments struggle to break through. Much of crypto communication is episodic. Each announcement is treated as a standalone event, forcing reporters to establish relevance from scratch. But visibility compounds only when updates connect to a stable, coherent story — one that explains the project’s purpose, its timing, and its position in a shifting market. When communications lack that continuity, attention resets every time. How Press Office by Outset PR Models Structured Storytelling Some firms have begun to formalize this narrative discipline. One example is Outset PR’s Press Office , which applies an editorial process to crypto communications. Instead of simply distributing announcements, the Press Office framework restructures them into commentary that aligns with topics journalists already cover. This includes refining angles, clarifying language, and timing updates around the media cycle — the same rules newsrooms apply internally. When updates arrive in a format that matches editorial logic, they stand a higher chance of being considered, cited, or incorporated into broader reporting. In a market where paid placements are limited or banned at many leading publications, earned relevance becomes the primary route to visibility. Press Office operations lean into this constraint. By relying on organic outreach and continuous journalist relationships, they aim for consistency over noise. The effect can be cumulative. A well-framed update may be referenced multiple times across outlets, especially when it contributes to a widely discussed issue. When this happens repeatedly, a project transitions from self-promotion to recognized source — a shift that no advertising budget can replicate. For early-stage and mid-sized crypto firms, this kind of structured storytelling helps establish legitimacy at a pace commensurate with the project’s development, without overstating claims or relying on transient hype. Storytelling Also Limits Downside Exposure A clear narrative protects as much as it promotes. Projects without defined positioning are easier to reframe by critics, competitors, or jittery markets. During downturns, an undefined story becomes a liability. Narrative clarity sets expectations and boundaries, making negative interpretations harder to attach and easier to counter. How Crypto Teams Can Build a Story That Gets Noticed A functional narrative is not improvised; it is deliberate. Define the core idea. A project should have one stable explanation of its value that does not shift with market cycles. Tie developments to current conditions. Explain why an update matters now — not just what occurred. Maintain consistent language. Recognition depends on repetition; repetition requires linguistic discipline. Write for editorial usability. If a message requires substantial rewriting to fit the news, it likely will not be used. Storytelling compounds gradually, but the benefits endure. The Bottom Line In crypto, being noticed is simple. Being understood is harder. Being consistently visible requires a story the market can reuse. Projects that communicate through a coherent narrative — and reinforce it through disciplined, editorially aligned processes — become part of the industry’s ongoing conversation. Those that rely on announcements alone remain outside it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Among them, Algorand (ALGO) presents a compelling case study. This analysis provides a detailed Algorand price prediction for 2026 through 2030, examining the technical, economic, and adoption factors that will determine if the ALGO price can sustainably hit the pivotal $1 threshold. Algorand Price Prediction: Foundational Analysis for 2026 Predicting cryptocurrency prices requires a multi-faceted approach. Analysts must consider on-chain metrics, macroeconomic conditions, and platform-specific developments. For Algorand, its pure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism offers distinct advantages. The protocol finalizes blocks in seconds with minimal energy consumption. Consequently, this efficiency attracts institutional interest in sustainable blockchain solutions. Market data from 2023 and 2024 shows ALGO’s price correlated strongly with broader crypto market cycles and network activity spikes. For instance, surges in daily transactions and new asset creation on the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) often preceded positive price momentum. Therefore, monitoring these metrics provides a foundation for any 2026 Algorand price prediction. Experts from firms like CoinShares and Messari emphasize that adoption by governments for digital currencies and by enterprises for tokenization will be key price drivers. Technical Roadmap and Ecosystem Growth Toward 2027 Algorand’s development trajectory directly influences its long-term valuation. The core development team, led by MIT professor Silvio Micali, continuously upgrades the protocol. Upcoming enhancements focus on increasing transaction throughput and reducing latency further. These improvements aim to solidify Algorand’s position for high-frequency use cases like micropayments and decentralized finance (DeFi). Ecosystem expansion provides another critical variable. Major partnerships, such as those with the Republic of the Marshall Islands for its digital currency, demonstrate real-world utility. Similarly, growth in Algorand-based DeFi total value locked (TVL) and non-fungible token (NFT) volumes signals increasing network demand. This organic usage growth is a more reliable indicator of value than speculative trading alone. A comparison of key growth metrics against other layer-1 blockchains like Cardano and Solana offers context for ALGO’s competitive position. Metric Current Status (2024) Projected 2027 Milestone Daily Transactions ~1-2 Million ~5-10 Million Unique Active Wallets ~500,000 ~2-3 Million Total Value Locked (DeFi) ~$150 Million ~$1 Billion Expert Perspectives on Market Cycles and Valuation Financial analysts apply traditional valuation models to crypto assets with caution. Models like the Metcalfe’s Law variant, which values a network based on its number of users and transactions, are often cited. For Algorand to achieve a $1 price, its network would need to see a significant expansion in active addresses and transaction volume. Historical data from previous bull markets, such as 2021, shows that ALGO’s price peaks coincided with peak network usage. Furthermore, regulatory clarity expected by 2026-2027 could have a profound impact. Clear guidelines for staking, token classification, and decentralized applications could reduce market uncertainty. This reduction in risk often leads to increased institutional capital allocation. Reports from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will therefore be critical to monitor. Their decisions will affect liquidity and investor confidence across all smart contract platforms, including Algorand. The 2030 Horizon: Long-Term ALGO Price Drivers Looking toward the end of the decade, fundamental technological shifts will dictate Algorand’s value. The integration of blockchain with the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) presents a massive opportunity. Algorand’s fast finality and low cost make it a candidate for machine-to-machine economies. Success in these nascent fields could unlock entirely new demand vectors for ALGO tokens, used for transaction fees and staking. Monetary policy also plays a long-term role. Algorand’s vesting schedule for early backers concluded in 2024, removing a major source of sell-side pressure. The current inflation rate and the mechanics of governance rewards will influence token supply dynamics. A balanced model that rewards long-term holders without excessive dilution is crucial for price appreciation. Key factors for the 2030 Algorand price prediction include: Global CBDC Adoption: Central Bank Digital Currency projects choosing Algorand’s technology. Institutional Staking: Large-scale participation in Algorand’s consensus by funds and corporations. Interoperability: Seamless cross-chain communication assets becoming standard. Developer Mindshare: The number of active developers building on Algorand versus competing chains. Conclusion This Algorand price prediction from 2026 to 2030 highlights a path contingent on sustained technological execution and ecosystem adoption. Reaching a $1 ALGO price is plausible but not guaranteed. It requires continued network growth, successful navigation of the regulatory landscape, and capturing market share in key sectors like digital identity and asset tokenization. Investors should base decisions on these fundamental drivers rather than short-term price speculation. The coming years will ultimately test the resilience and utility of the Algorand blockchain in an increasingly competitive and regulated digital asset world. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for Algorand’s price to reach $1? The single most critical factor is a substantial increase in real, utility-driven network activity. This means growth in daily transactions, active wallets, and total value locked in DeFi applications, moving beyond speculative trading to demonstrate indispensable use cases. Q2: How does Algorand’s technology compare to Ethereum for long-term value? Algorand offers faster transaction finality and lower fees due to its pure proof-of-stake design. However, Ethereum boasts a larger developer community and established network effects. Long-term value will depend on which platform better attracts high-value decentralized applications and enterprise adoption. Q3: Can regulatory changes negatively impact the ALGO price prediction? Yes, absolutely. Unfavorable regulations concerning staking rewards, token classification as a security, or restrictions on decentralized applications could create significant sell pressure and reduce institutional interest, adversely affecting the price trajectory. Q4: What role does the Algorand Foundation play in the ecosystem’s growth? The Algorand Foundation manages grant programs, developer education, and ecosystem funding. Its strategic initiatives to onboard enterprises, governments, and developers are vital for driving demand for the ALGO token and supporting the network’s long-term health. Q5: Is staking ALGO a necessary part of the investment thesis for price growth? Participating in governance staking can provide yield and align holders with the network’s success. A high percentage of staked tokens also improves network security and reduces circulating supply, which can be positive factors for price stability and growth over time.

The million-dollar contest follows Threads announcing an increase in its active monthly users, which surpassed that of X for the first time. The announcement, which was posted on X’s Creators account, comes at a critical time as the social media platform struggles to regain its standing as the preferred platform for real-time conversations and breaking news. According to a recent report by Cryptopolitan, Threads is seeing stronger user engagement, particularly among the younger demographic. X make s mi llion-dollar play for creator loyalty X (formerly known as Twitter) announced a $1 million dollar bounty on their Creators account. “We’re trying something new: we’re giving $1 million to the Top Article of the next payout period.” This was a move to recognize and reward high-impact content, which shapes conversation on the platform. However, given the recent competition from Threads users see it as a move to attract more content creators and improve its standing in the content creator economy wars. The bounty is targeted towards creators who write long form content an d re stricted to only U.S. users. Ironically, the United States is the one of the places where X is doing better than Threads, even though those numbers are not as impressive as they used to be. In the announcement post, X said the content published must be an original work and at least 1,000 words. This isn’t the first time X has tried to use money to solve the problem. The platform had previously rolled out a monetization feature, where creators with large verified following and impressions on posts are eligible for ad revenue sharing. While X has not formally acknowledged a user engagement competition with Threads, the timing of the bounty is not coincidental. Threads has been refining its algorithm to create a more polished user experience, which has driven up its active users to beat X’s numbers. Additionally, the Meta owned platform has a seamless integration with Instagram, which makes it easy for creators to move their following there. The bigger picture beyond features and monetization X’s announcement of a bounty raises more serious questions regarding creator retention. There is a growing perception that creators are starting to diversify, even though X still has a lot of cultural significance. Many creators now post simultaneously on X, Threads, and other platforms. The competition between the social media platforms, however, goes beyond just features or money, but also includes user experience. Threads is positioning itself as a less toxic alternative to X, with better content moderation policies, which users find more appealing. Elon Musk’s X positions itself as a free-speech platform, which sounds appealing to some, but also alienates others . The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This comprehensive analysis explores the technical foundations, market dynamics, and expert projections that will shape the Avalanche price prediction from 2026 through 2030, providing a data-driven framework for understanding its future valuation. Avalanche Price Prediction: The Foundation of Analysis Creating a reliable Avalanche price prediction requires examining multiple interconnected factors. Market analysts typically consider technological adoption, network activity, developer growth, and macroeconomic conditions. The Avalanche platform has demonstrated significant technical capabilities since its 2020 launch, particularly through its unique consensus mechanism and subnet architecture. Consequently, these features position AVAX for potential growth as blockchain adoption accelerates globally. Furthermore, institutional interest in scalable layer-1 solutions provides additional momentum for the network’s development. Current Market Context and Historical Performance Understanding AVAX’s historical price action provides essential context for future projections. The token experienced remarkable growth during the 2021 bull market, reaching an all-time high near $145. However, like most cryptocurrencies, it underwent substantial correction during subsequent market cycles. This volatility highlights the importance of long-term fundamental analysis over short-term price movements. Market data from 2023-2024 shows AVAX establishing stronger support levels while expanding its ecosystem through strategic partnerships and technological upgrades. Technical Analysis and Price Modeling for 2026 Financial analysts employ various models for cryptocurrency valuation. For the 2026 Avalanche price prediction, most models consider both on-chain metrics and comparative analysis. Key indicators include: Network Revenue: Transaction fees and subnet creation costs Active Addresses: User growth and engagement metrics Total Value Locked (TVL): DeFi ecosystem strength Developer Activity: GitHub commits and new project launches Based on current growth trajectories, conservative estimates place AVAX between $45 and $75 by late 2026. This range assumes moderate adoption of Avalanche subnets and steady expansion of its DeFi ecosystem. However, accelerated institutional adoption could push valuations toward the higher end of this spectrum. The 2027 Outlook: Infrastructure and Adoption Drivers The 2027 projection for Avalanche depends heavily on several technological and market developments. The continued rollout of custom subnets for enterprises and governments represents a significant potential catalyst. Additionally, advancements in the network’s interoperability through technologies like Avalanche Warp Messaging could enhance its competitive position. Market analysts note that regulatory clarity, expected by 2026-2027, will substantially impact all cryptocurrency valuations. If favorable regulations emerge alongside technological maturation, AVAX could establish a stronger foundation for sustained growth toward the $100 threshold. Comparative Analysis with Competing Networks A balanced Avalanche price prediction requires examining competitive dynamics. AVAX competes directly with other layer-1 platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Each platform offers distinct technical advantages and trade-offs. Avalanche’s primary competitive edge lies in its subnets architecture, which allows for customized blockchain solutions. Market share analysis suggests that multiple layer-1 networks can coexist and thrive, particularly as different use cases require specialized technical solutions. This multi-chain future could benefit AVAX if it maintains its technological leadership in specific verticals. The Path to $100: 2028-2030 Projections The question of whether AVAX can hit $100 by 2030 involves analyzing both optimistic and conservative scenarios. Under a conservative model assuming linear growth and moderate adoption, AVAX might reach $80-90 by 2030. However, an accelerated adoption scenario, driven by enterprise blockchain implementation and global DeFi expansion, could push valuations well beyond $100. Critical factors for this outcome include: Successful implementation of planned technical upgrades Expansion into regulated financial markets Growth in real-world asset tokenization on Avalanche Increased developer migration from competing platforms Financial models incorporating these variables suggest the $100 target represents a challenging but achievable milestone within the 2028-2030 timeframe, particularly if broader cryptocurrency market capitalization continues its historical growth patterns. Risk Factors and Market Considerations Any long-term Avalanche price prediction must acknowledge significant risk factors. Regulatory uncertainty remains the primary concern for all cryptocurrency projects. Additionally, technological competition intensifies continuously as new platforms emerge with innovative approaches. Macroeconomic conditions, particularly interest rate environments and institutional investment patterns, substantially influence cryptocurrency valuations. Security incidents or protocol vulnerabilities could also impact investor confidence. Therefore, while the $100 target represents a plausible outcome, investors should maintain awareness of these substantial risks. Expert Perspectives and Institutional Analysis Leading cryptocurrency research firms provide valuable insights for the Avalanche price prediction. Firms like Messari, CoinShares, and Delphi Digital regularly publish analyses of layer-1 networks. Their consensus suggests cautious optimism regarding AVAX’s long-term potential. Institutional investors increasingly view Avalanche as a credible platform for enterprise blockchain solutions. This growing institutional interest could provide both validation and capital inflow. However, experts consistently emphasize that cryptocurrency investments carry exceptional volatility and risk, requiring thorough due diligence and appropriate portfolio allocation. Conclusion This comprehensive Avalanche price prediction analysis reveals a complex but promising path toward the $100 milestone. The AVAX token’s future valuation depends on multiple factors, including technological execution, market adoption, regulatory developments, and broader cryptocurrency trends. While reaching $100 by 2030 represents a challenging target, it remains within the realm of possibility given Avalanche’s strong technical foundation and growing ecosystem. Investors and observers should monitor key metrics including network activity, developer growth, and institutional adoption to gauge progress toward this significant price level. Ultimately, the Avalanche price prediction reflects both the enormous potential and substantial risks inherent in the evolving blockchain landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for AVAX reaching $100? The most critical factor is sustained adoption of Avalanche’s subnet technology by enterprises and institutions, which would drive network utility and demand for AVAX tokens. Q2: How does Avalanche’s technology compare to Ethereum for long-term growth? Avalanche offers faster transaction finality and lower fees than Ethereum’s mainnet, but Ethereum has significantly larger network effects and developer community. Both networks are evolving with upgrades that may change their competitive positions. Q3: What are the biggest risks to this Avalanche price prediction? Primary risks include regulatory crackdowns, successful competition from other layer-1 platforms, technological vulnerabilities, and adverse macroeconomic conditions affecting all risk assets. Q4: How reliable are cryptocurrency price predictions? All cryptocurrency predictions involve substantial uncertainty and should be viewed as analytical frameworks rather than guarantees. Market conditions can change rapidly based on technological, regulatory, and macroeconomic developments. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data for evaluating Avalanche’s progress? Investors should monitor Avalanche’s official network dashboard, reputable blockchain analytics platforms like Token Terminal and Artemis, and quarterly reports from established cryptocurrency research firms.

The rule change targets how large data centers bring power on site fast. It cuts off a method that avoided air permits and public review. The Memphis site, called Colossus, opened in 2024 and was built for speed. xAI set up its own off‑grid power using gas‑burning turbines placed on trailers. Those turbines were labeled as non‑road engines, which meant no standard air permits were needed. Local health officials approved that approach, and the equipment went live without public comment or an environmental review. EPA tightens Clean Air Act rules on mobile turbines The EPA updated its rules this week and said trailer‑mounted turbines cannot be treated as non‑road engines. The agency said companies must now get Clean Air Act permits before installing them. This applies when total emissions cross major pollution thresholds. That process requires notice, review, and limits that were skipped before. The Shelby County Health Department had allowed xAI to use the turbines under a temporary label. That decision let the company avoid hearings and operate right away. The EPA decision now blocks that path and could slow how xAI expands around Memphis as it adds buildings filled with Nvidia graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence work. Inside the Memphis facility, xAI runs training and inference for its Grok systems. The work supports a chatbot and an image generator that plug directly into the social network X. The site is part of a crowded generative AI race that also includes OpenAI and Google, where power supply is a major bottleneck. The company previously told county officials the turbines would use selective catalytic reduction systems to cut pollution. That did not happen. Solaris Energy Infrastructure, the supplier, told CNBC in June that those controls were not installed on the temporary turbines used by xAI. Solaris Energy Infrastructure, often called SEI, has seen its stock price jump in recent months. The rise has been linked in part to xAI expansion plans and demand for fast power solutions tied to data centers. Pollution from the turbines sparked backlash. Residents from Boxtown, a majority‑Black neighborhood in South Memphis, spoke at hearings last year. They described a rotten egg smell in the air and said smog made heart and lung problems worse. Researchers at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville reported that turbine use by xAI added to local air pollution. Environmental groups warned of legal action. The NAACP said it would sue to stop unpermitted turbine use. That lawsuit did not move forward after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary and issued permits. The pressure comes as xAI raised $20 billion from investors that include Nvidia and Cisco. The company is also under investigation in multiple regions after its Grok and X apps allowed users to create and spread violent and sexualized deepfake images involving women and children.

Its short-term price action has shown signs of life. However, questions are growing around sustainability beyond speculative cycles. As holders weigh Pepe price predictions against shifting market trends, many are exploring alternatives with clearer utility. This article breaks down where Pepe stands now and why investor attention is gradually moving toward more use-case-driven crypto projects. Pepe Price Prediction Faces Fresh Scrutiny After Recent Breakout PEPE has staged a notable recovery after weeks of tight consolidation, pushing back above key support levels and reviving short-term interest across the meme coin sector. The recent breakout has improved sentiment, but analysts remain divided on what comes next for Pepe price prediction as attention slowly shifts toward projects offering clearer utility. On lower timeframes, PEPE price today is holding above the former breakout zone near $0.0000060. That level has now flipped into short-term support after buyers stepped in following a brief pullback. Trading volume expanded during the breakout, suggesting real participation rather than thin liquidity. This move marked a change in structure after a long compression phase, a pattern often linked to directional expansion in meme coins. From a technical perspective , momentum has cooled without breaking. RSI has moved out of overbought territory and is stabilizing near neutral levels. That reset reduces exhaustion risk and keeps the bullish setup intact. VWAP remains below spot price, while short-term moving averages continue to slope upward. These signals support cautious optimism in the current Pepe Coin price prediction. However, resistance remains overhead. Analysts point to $0.0000070 as the next critical hurdle. They strongly believe that a clean break above that level would strengthen the bullish case. Failure to reclaim it could keep Pepe price range-bound as traders reassess risk. This is why recent Pepe news highlights a growing debate around meme coins versus utility-focused alternatives. Analysts Compare Pepe Coin Price To Utility-Driven Alternatives As analysts debate Pepe price prediction and question how sustainable meme coin rallies really are, a growing number of holders are rotating toward projects built on real utility. That shift is where Remittix is winning attention. While Pepe Coin price reacts mainly to sentiment and short-term momentum, Remittix focuses on a clear problem that affects millions every day.

With a 162-game regular season, daily matchups, and a data-driven structure, MLB offers one of the most consistent and active betting environments in the world. Unlike leagues with weekly fixtures, baseball creates constant opportunities for analysis, adjustment, and repetition. That rhythm explains why more bettors now choose to bet on baseball with crypto. Frequent games demand fast deposits, smooth live betting, and reliable withdrawals. Crypto fits naturally into this flow, removing delays and allowing bettors to stay engaged throughout the long MLB season. As 2026 approaches, baseball betting continues to evolve — and crypto sportsbooks are becoming a core part of that shift. Best Crypto Sportsbooks for MLB Betting in 2026 Not all platforms handle baseball equally well. MLB betting requires stability, deep player markets, and consistent execution during long live sessions. The sportsbooks below stand out for how they support modern baseball betting with crypto. Dexsport — Built for Modern MLB Betting Dexsport is designed for bettors who place frequent wagers and actively manage positions during games. The platform operates without mandatory identity verification and allows instant access through crypto wallets or simple sign-up methods. For MLB bettors, Dexsport offers: fast bet execution during live innings flexible cash-out options to manage risk mid-game smooth deposits and withdrawals across multiple cryptocurrencies This structure works especially well for baseball crypto betting, where timing and repetition matter more than occasional promotional boosts. Dexsport’s focus on execution and transparency makes it a strong fit for long MLB seasons. Stake — Competitive MLB Odds and Live Experience Stake is known for its polished interface and strong live betting tools. MLB markets are supported with competitive odds, clear in-play layouts, and access to a wide range of cryptocurrencies. The platform suits bettors who enjoy active engagement during games, particularly those placing multiple wagers across innings. Among modern crypto baseball betting sites, Stake appeals to users who value usability and real-time data alongside fast transactions. BetOnline — Classic MLB Coverage with Crypto Support BetOnline brings a more traditional sportsbook approach to MLB betting. The platform offers early lines, extensive player props, and reliable coverage of U.S. baseball markets, while still supporting cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals. For bettors familiar with conventional MLB betting formats but looking to use crypto, BetOnline provides a familiar structure with added payment flexibility. Why MLB Is Built for Daily Betting Baseball is uniquely suited for consistent betting activity. With games almost every day, bettors can refine strategies, track trends, and react quickly to form changes. Several factors make MLB ideal for regular wagering: long seasons reduce variance over time detailed statistics create analytical depth pitching rotations introduce predictable market patterns Because opportunities reset daily, bettors are not waiting a full week to adjust. This pace naturally rewards platforms that allow frequent, low-friction betting — one of the reasons crypto sportsbooks continue to gain ground in the MLB ecosystem. Teams, Stars, and Betting Narratives That Drive MLB Action MLB betting rarely moves on standings alone. What drives baseball markets is a mix of brand gravity, star power, and volume — and that volume shows up not just in handle, but in crowds. The “public teams” that shape the market Certain franchises pull action almost every night, even when they’re not in peak form. In 2025, the Dodgers led MLB in home attendance (about 4,012,470 total, 49,536 average), with the Yankees also near the top (about 3,392,659 total, 42,408 average).When these teams are on the board, lines tend to get tighter faster, and live markets stay more active deeper into the game. A quick snapshot of what “big crowd = big market” looks like: Team (2025) Home Total Home Avg LA Dodgers 4,012,470 49,536 NY Yankees 3,392,659 42,408 San Diego Padres 3,437,201 42,434 Philadelphia Phillies 3,375,477 41,672 NY Mets 3,182,052 39,775 (Those are home numbers only.) Who are the “favorites” right now? If you follow futures pricing, the market picture heading into 2026 is clear: Dodgers opened as the favorite, with teams like the Yankees and Phillies close behind (per widely published 2026 World Series odds at the time).That matters for bettors because favorites tend to create: more expensive moneylines (especially at home), higher live “comeback premiums,” more prop liquidity (books offer deeper menus because demand is there). The stars that keep props and micro-markets alive Baseball is increasingly a player-prop sport. Even if you’re not betting the side, you’re still trading innings, strikeouts, RBIs, HRs, and pitcher matchups. Heading into 2026, the league’s betting narratives are heavily shaped by names like: Shohei Ohtani (Dodgers) and Aaron Judge (Yankees), who won the 2025 MVP awards Paul Skenes (Pirates) and Tarik Skubal (Tigers), the 2025 Cy Young winners plus a broader “face of the league” tier that MLB itself highlights for 2026 (e.g., Juan Soto, Bryce Harper, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., and others). For bettors, this is the key shift: you can win or lose an MLB night without caring who wins the game, because the best edges often sit inside: pitcher strikeouts + pitch count dynamics inning-by-inning scoring probabilities hitter form + matchup splits live adjustments when bullpens enter Why this matters for crypto baseball betting The more you bet props and live micro-markets, the more execution matters. Big-name games and star-driven props generate constant line movement, and that’s where speed + stability becomes part of your edge — especially if you’re placing several wagers across a single matchup rather than one pre-game ticket. Top MLB Betting Rivalries That Attract Heavy Action Rivalries are where baseball betting volume spikes. These matchups draw casual money, sharp action, and sustained live interest — often regardless of standings. For bettors, rivalry games behave differently from regular fixtures. New York Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox This remains the most bet-on rivalry in baseball. Even during rebuilding phases, Yankees–Red Sox games generate inflated handle and tighter pre-game lines. What makes it interesting for bettors: public money often leans heavily toward the Yankees live totals react sharply to early scoring pitcher matchups drive strong strikeout and first-five-innings markets Late innings in this rivalry tend to produce aggressive live movement, especially when bullpens enter. Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants A West Coast rivalry with deep betting history and strong analytics-driven interest. Key betting traits: lower-scoring expectations compared to public perception value often appears in unders and alternative run lines live betting becomes active once starters exit Dodgers–Giants games are a favorite among bettors who focus on situational and in-play edges rather than pre-game narratives. Chicago Cubs vs. St. Louis Cardinals One of the most consistent rivalry markets in MLB, driven by tradition and regional fanbases. From a betting perspective: spreads and totals stay efficient prop markets remain active deep into games live odds adjust steadily rather than explosively These games reward patience and inning-based strategies. Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Diego Padres A newer rivalry, but one that has grown rapidly in betting relevance over recent seasons. Why bettors pay attention: high-profile rosters increase player prop liquidity aggressive offensive styles create volatile live totals public money often overreacts to early momentum This matchup frequently produces value for bettors who wait for mid-game corrections. Why Rivalries Matter for Crypto Baseball Betting Rivalry games generate: higher betting volume deeper live markets more frequent odds adjustments For bettors placing multiple wagers during a single matchup, execution speed becomes critical. This is where crypto-based platforms show their strength, allowing users to stay active throughout rivalry games without delays or missed pricing windows. In rivalry-heavy slates, the ability to move quickly often matters more than the opening line. How Serious MLB Bettors Approach Crypto Betting in 2026 By 2026, MLB betting with crypto is no longer driven by novelty. For experienced bettors, it’s about building a workflow that matches the rhythm of the season. Serious baseball bettors tend to: focus on daily volume rather than isolated big bets split exposure across pre-game lines, first-five innings, and live props react to pitching changes, bullpen usage, and in-game momentum Crypto sportsbooks support this approach by removing operational friction. Faster balance updates, fewer interruptions, and smoother live execution allow bettors to think in terms of sessions, not single wagers. This is especially important during long MLB stretches — road trips, rivalry series, and dense schedules — where consistency matters more than short-term variance. Platforms that handle frequent activity reliably tend to earn long-term trust, which is why bettors increasingly gravitate toward crypto-native solutions. Summing It Up Baseball has always rewarded patience, analysis, and repetition. The modern betting landscape reflects that reality more clearly than ever. With a long season, constant statistical signals, and deep live markets, MLB naturally favors platforms that can keep up without slowing bettors down. This is why crypto has moved from a niche option to a practical standard for many baseball bettors. Using crypto for MLB betting offers: faster access to markets smoother live betting across innings greater flexibility during extended betting sessions Platforms like Dexsport illustrate how this shift works in practice, aligning infrastructure with the way baseball is actually bet today. As the 2026 season approaches, bettors who prioritize execution, stability, and adaptability will be best positioned to take advantage of what MLB betting has to offer.

Rejection could pull the price back toward $1.45–$1.40. If lows persist, the trend remains constructive, and a drop below $1.45 would shift momentum back to sellers. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView On the 4-hour timeframe, price shows a short-term recovery after a prior sell-off, forming higher lows that suggest tentative bullish momentum rather than a full trend reversal. The market appears to be consolidating within a defined range, with repeated tests of a nearby resistance level where selling pressure has previously emerged. Volume seems to taper during the pullbacks, implying weaker bearish conviction, but buying strength is not yet decisive. If the price sustains above the recent swing high, a continuation toward the next resistance zone is likely. Conversely, a rejection here could trigger another retracement toward the nearest support area before any clearer directional move develops.

The broader trend shows signs of stabilization compared to earlier weakness, but the market has not yet delivered a clear breakout to confirm a full bullish reversal. Repeated reactions around key resistance suggest that sellers are still active at higher levels, while buyers are gradually defending critical support zones. In the near term, FIL is likely to continue oscillating within its current range until volume provides clearer directional conviction. A sustained move above resistance would improve the outlook, while a failure to hold support could renew downside pressure. Why is Filecoin up today? FIL is up today as the price shows a short-term rebound from a previously established support zone. After a period of consolidation, buyers stepped in around key demand near the $1.45–$1.50 area, triggering short-term accumulation and encouraging renewed bid interest. The daily candle is green and reflects this upside, with momentum indicators like MACD crossing toward bullish, and buyers regaining control from intraday dips. Additionally, stabilization in broader crypto sentiment is lifting risk-on assets, helping FIL catch inflows from altcoin rotations. Overall, today’s move shows a corrective upside and buyer confidence returning after earlier selling pressure eased. Is Filecoin a good investment?

Filecoin’s historic price sentiment Filecoin price history by CoinGecko Filecoin (FIL) started trading in December 2017, a short period after conducting its ICO. Trading started long before the Filecoin mainnet was released. Between December 2017 and May 2020, FIL traded below $30. Then, starting mid-May, the Filecoin price started rising, and the bull trend continued until 1st April 2021, when it hit its highest price of $237.24.

Among them, Hyperliquid and its native HYPE token have garnered significant attention for their unique approach to perpetual swaps trading. This analysis provides a detailed, evidence-based examination of Hyperliquid’s price potential from 2026 through 2030, exploring the critical factors that could propel HYPE toward a new all-time high. Hyperliquid Price Prediction: Foundation and Market Context Hyperliquid operates as a novel decentralized exchange (DEX) specializing in perpetual futures. The protocol distinguishes itself through its proprietary high-performance blockchain, which is specifically designed for ultra-low latency and high-throughput trading. Consequently, this technical foundation is a primary driver for its valuation model. Market data from Q1 2025 indicates a consolidation phase for the broader altcoin market, yet infrastructure protocols like Hyperliquid often demonstrate resilience during such periods. Historical volatility patterns from 2023-2024 show that infrastructure tokens frequently lead the next market cycle, a trend noted in several institutional crypto research reports. Furthermore, the total value locked (TVL) in Hyperliquid’s ecosystem serves as a fundamental metric. A consistent increase in TVL typically correlates with greater utility and fee generation for the HYPE token. Network activity, measured by daily active addresses and transaction volume, provides additional context for assessing organic growth versus speculative trading. These on-chain metrics offer a more grounded perspective than price action alone. Critical Factors Influencing HYPE’s 2026-2030 Trajectory Several interconnected variables will determine the HYPE price path. First, the broader macroeconomic environment for digital assets remains paramount. Regulatory clarity, particularly from major jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union, will impact institutional adoption. Second, the competitive landscape within the decentralized perpetuals market is intense. Hyperliquid’s ability to maintain technological advantages and capture market share from both centralized and decentralized rivals is crucial. Protocol Development and Token Utility The HYPE token’s value is intrinsically linked to its utility within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Core use cases include: Governance: Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades, fee parameters, and treasury management. Fee Discounts: Using HYPE to pay for trading fees provides users with a cost reduction, creating consistent buy-side pressure. Staking and Security: Staking mechanisms secure the network and allow participants to earn a portion of protocol fees. Future roadmap implementations, such as cross-margin capabilities, new asset listings, and layer-2 integrations, could significantly enhance this utility. The development team’s track record of meeting milestones, as documented in their public GitHub repositories and quarterly reports, builds investor confidence. Quantitative Models and Expert Price Ranges for HYPE Financial modeling for cryptocurrency assets incorporates both quantitative and qualitative inputs. Analysts commonly use network value-to-transaction (NVT) ratios, Metcalfe’s Law-based valuations, and discounted cash flow models based on projected fee revenue. It is critical to note that all price predictions are probabilistic scenarios, not guarantees. Year Conservative Scenario Base Case Scenario Optimistic Scenario Key Drivers 2026 $X – $Y $A – $B $P – $Q Regulatory developments, TVL growth, BTC halving aftermath 2027 $X1 – $Y1 $A1 – $B1 $P1 – $Q1 Mainnet upgrades, derivative market share, institutional product integration 2030 $X3 – $Y3 $A3 – $B3 $P3 – $Q3 Mass adoption of DeFi, potential new all-time high, ecosystem maturity Note: Specific price figures are omitted to avoid unsubstantiated speculation. Reputable analysis firms publish similar ranged models based on transparent assumptions. The potential for HYPE to reach a new all-time high (ATH) hinges on the confluence of these drivers. For instance, the optimistic 2030 scenario generally assumes successful execution of the protocol roadmap, a favorable macro climate for risk assets, and Hyperliquid securing a top-three position in its market niche. Conversely, the conservative model factors in increased competition and potential regulatory headwinds. Risks and Challenges to the Hyperliquid Price Prediction Investors must weigh potential downsides. Smart contract risk, though mitigated by audits, persists in all DeFi protocols. Market risk, including prolonged crypto winters, can suppress prices regardless of fundamentals. Furthermore, technological disruption from a more innovative competitor presents an ever-present challenge. A comprehensive risk assessment, often highlighted in due diligence reports from firms like CoinShares or Delphi Digital, includes stress-testing these models against adverse conditions. Conclusion This Hyperliquid price prediction analysis for 2026 through 2030 underscores the multifaceted nature of crypto asset valuation. The path for the HYPE token is not predetermined but will be shaped by protocol execution, competitive dynamics, and broader market forces. While models indicate a plausible path to a new all-time high under optimal conditions, this outcome is contingent upon sustained growth in utility and adoption. Investors are advised to conduct their own research, focusing on Hyperliquid’s on-chain metrics and development progress, rather than short-term price fluctuations. The long-term vision for decentralized derivative trading remains a powerful narrative, and Hyperliquid’s technological foundation positions it as a significant contender in this space. FAQs Q1: What is the primary use case of the HYPE token? The HYPE token is primarily used for governance of the Hyperliquid protocol, for securing the network via staking, and for receiving discounts on trading fees, which aligns holder incentives with network growth. Q2: How does Hyperliquid differ from other decentralized exchanges? Hyperliquid is built on its own purpose-built blockchain optimized for high-speed perpetual swaps trading, aiming to rival the experience of centralized exchanges while maintaining non-custodial, on-chain settlement. Q3: What are the biggest risks to this Hyperliquid price prediction? Key risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, intense competition in the DeFi derivatives sector, adverse cryptocurrency regulations, and broader financial market downturns that reduce risk appetite. Q4: Where can I find reliable data to track Hyperliquid’s fundamentals? On-chain data platforms like DefiLlama and Dune Analytics track metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) and user activity. The official Hyperliquid documentation and GitHub repository provide development updates. Q5: Do price predictions guarantee future returns? No. All price predictions and forecasts are speculative models based on current data and assumptions. They are not financial advice and should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions. Market conditions can change rapidly.

Long before modern leagues, televised events, or online sportsbooks , people were already wagering on horses. The sport evolved alongside betting itself, developing a unique culture built around speed, instinct, and last-second decisions. Today, that culture is moving online. As traditional payment systems struggle with the pace of modern wagering, horse racing betting with crypto has emerged as a natural evolution rather than a trend. The reasons are rooted not in technology hype, but in how this sport is actually bet. Crypto Platforms Used by Modern Horse Racing Bettors As horse racing betting continues to shift toward digital and global audiences, crypto sportsbooks have adapted in different ways. Below is an overview of platforms commonly used by modern horse racing bettors, focusing on structure, access, and betting suitability rather than direct comparison. Platform Betting Focus Crypto Support KYC Policy Horse Racing Fit Dexsport Crypto-native sportsbook & casino BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, TRON + 40+ coins No mandatory KYC Built for high-frequency racing bets, fast execution, live cash-out Cloudbet High-limit global sportsbook 30+ cryptocurrencies including BTC & USDT KYC may apply at scale Strong liquidity for major racing events and international markets BetPanda Privacy-first sportsbook & casino BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, DOGE, BNB No KYC unless flagged Suitable for bettors prioritizing anonymity and fast transactions Boomerang Casual-friendly sportsbook BTC, ETH, USDT, LTC, XRP KYC required for withdrawals Accessible racing markets with loyalty and VIP incentives Voltage Bet All-in-one sportsbook & casino Crypto + fiat options KYC required before withdrawals Racing available alongside major sports, less specialized This overview highlights how different platforms approach horse racing betting from a crypto perspective. Some focus on speed and execution, others on limits or accessibility. For bettors placing multiple wagers across race cards, choosing a platform that aligns with their betting rhythm is often more important than headline features. Where Horse Racing Is Most Popular Today Horse racing is not a niche sport confined to one region. It is global, deeply embedded in national traditions, and supported by massive betting ecosystems. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, racing is woven into everyday sports culture. Events like Royal Ascot, the Cheltenham Festival, and Aintree attract millions of viewers and some of the highest betting volumes in Europe. In the United States, marquee races such as the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Breeders’ Cup dominate betting calendars. The Kentucky Derby alone regularly draws television audiences exceeding 15 million viewers, with betting handle reaching hundreds of millions of dollars in a single day. Australia treats horse racing as a national spectacle. The Melbourne Cup is often described as “the race that stops a nation,” generating enormous wagering interest both domestically and internationally. Meanwhile, Japan and Hong Kong represent some of the most sophisticated racing markets in the world. Tracks like Sha Tin and events such as the Japan Cup attract sharp bettors and institutional-level liquidity, driving the growth of online horse racing crypto betting in Asia. Horse Racing Audience and Betting Volume Unlike seasonal sports, horse racing operates almost year-round. Races run daily across multiple tracks, creating a high-frequency betting environment that few other sports can match. This structure produces: constant betting opportunities rather than weekly peaks shorter decision windows before races begin heavy reliance on late information and market movement Because bettors often place multiple wagers in a single session, speed and reliability become more important than promotional incentives. This is one reason horse racing has quietly become one of the strongest use cases for crypto-based wagering. Famous Racehorses That Shaped Modern Betting Certain horses transcend the sport and fundamentally change how people bet. Secretariat remains a benchmark decades later, setting records that still influence public perception of dominance. His races drew unprecedented betting volume, often compressing odds as casual money flooded markets. Frankel, undefeated across his career, reshaped expectations around pricing elite horses. Bettors often faced historically low odds, forcing markets to adapt with exotic bets and complex combinations. American Pharoah, the first Triple Crown winner in nearly four decades, sparked massive global interest. His performances drove betting far beyond traditional racing audiences. More recently, Winx in Australia demonstrated how sustained excellence over many seasons could keep betting markets active year after year, even when outcomes appeared predictable. These horses didn’t just win races — they changed betting behavior. Legendary Jockeys and Trainers Bettors Follow In horse racing, bettors rarely look at horses alone. Jockeys and trainers play a critical role in market perception. Names like Frankie Dettori, Ryan Moore, John Velazquez, and Aidan O’Brien carry weight far beyond statistics. Their presence often influences odds movement before the race even begins. Experienced bettors factor in: jockey decision-making under pressure trainer patterns across race types and seasons combinations of horse, jockey, and stable reputation This layered analysis makes horse racing one of the most intellectually demanding betting sports — and one that rewards platforms capable of handling frequent, fast wagers. Horse Breeds and Racing Disciplines Explained Not all horse racing is the same. Understanding disciplines is essential for informed betting. Thoroughbred racing is the most common and globally recognized form, featuring high speeds and flat tracks. Most major betting events fall into this category. Harness racing involves horses pulling sulkies, with pacing and trotting rules that significantly affect race dynamics and betting strategies. Steeplechase racing adds jumps and obstacles, introducing higher variance and favoring bettors who specialize in form analysis and endurance. Each discipline attracts different betting patterns, which further increases the demand for flexible, fast wagering platforms. How Bettors Actually Bet on Horse Racing Horse racing betting is rarely about a single wager. Most bettors combine: Win, Place, and Show bets Exacta, Trifecta, and Quinella combinations late bets placed minutes — or seconds — before the off This behavior explains why crypto horse betting has gained traction. When dozens of bets are placed across multiple races, execution speed matters more than theoretical odds value. Why Crypto Fits Horse Racing Better Than Other Sports Horse racing places unique demands on any betting platform. Unlike team sports with fixed schedules, racing operates at a faster and more fragmented pace. Multiple races run back-to-back, often across different tracks and time zones, with very short windows for placing bets. Crypto fits this environment naturally. First, speed matters more in racing than in most other sports. Bets are often placed minutes — sometimes seconds — before the start. Crypto deposits and real-time balance updates allow bettors to react instantly without waiting for payment confirmation. Second, racing encourages high-frequency betting behavior. Bettors may place dozens of wagers in a single session, combining straight bets with exotic combinations. Traditional payment systems introduce friction here, while crypto allows continuous participation without interruption. Finally, horse racing attracts a global audience. Bettors follow events in the UK, the U.S., Australia, Japan, and Hong Kong — often on the same day. Crypto removes currency barriers and banking delays, making cross-market participation seamless. These factors explain why crypto adoption in horse racing has accelerated faster than in many other betting verticals. It is not about novelty — it is about practicality. Conclusion Horse racing has always been a sport shaped by betting. Its traditions, rhythms, and economics evolved around wagering long before modern sportsbooks existed. In many ways, crypto represents the next step in that evolution. As betting moves online and becomes more global, the limitations of traditional systems become harder to ignore. Speed, flexibility, and uninterrupted access are no longer optional — they define the quality of the betting experience. Crypto aligns with how horse racing is actually bet today: frequently, quickly, and across borders. Platforms like Dexsport demonstrate how this alignment works in practice, supporting modern betting behavior without forcing bettors to adapt to outdated infrastructure.",More News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2026-01-17 13:24:28

Meanwhile, BTC hovered under the 50 week MA and EMA cluster, setting up a near term reclaim or another rejection. Bitcoin ETF inflows edge ahead of last year as early 2026 trend tracks history Bitcoin spot ETF inflows in the U.S. reached about 3.8K BTC so far this year, moving ahead of the roughly 3.5K BTC recorded over the same period last year, according to data shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. The chart showed cumulative inflows for early 2026 running slightly above the 2025 line at the same point on the calendar. Bitcoin Net Cumulative Inflows to US Spot ETFs by Year. Source: CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju At the same time, the data placed the current pace within a familiar seasonal pattern. Historically, January tends to see relatively modest ETF inflows, while stronger accumulation usually begins later in the first quarter. Past cycles highlighted larger inflow waves forming between February and April rather than at the very start of the year. The comparison across years suggested that early 2026 remains broadly aligned with prior trends despite the year over year uptick. As a result, the inflow trajectory implied that the more decisive phase of ETF driven demand may still lie ahead, based on how previous cycles developed once the first quarter progressed. Bitcoin faces a key test near the 50 week moving average cluster Meanwhile, Bitcoin entered an important technical week as price hovered just below the 50 week moving average and exponential moving average cluster, according to a chart shared by analyst Jelle, known on X as CryptoJelleNL. The TradingView chart showed BTC consolidating after a pullback from recent highs, with price trading near the mid $90,000s at the time of the snapshot. Bitcoin 50 Week MA EMA Cluster Chart. Source: CryptoJelleNL The chart highlighted the 50 week MA and EMA as a key decision zone that has historically shaped medium term trend direction. A sustained move back above this band would signal strength after the recent correction and reinforce the broader uptrend that started in late 2023. In contrast, repeated failure at this level would suggest continued hesitation and raise the risk of deeper consolidation. Price action on the weekly timeframe showed Bitcoin still holding above its longer term rising structure despite recent volatility.

In 2026, most yield products fall into two buckets: Lending-style savings: platforms lend assets (or use them in structured lending) and share interest with depositors. Staking-style savings: platforms stake proof-of-stake tokens and pass through staking rewards (this does not apply to Bitcoin). The right choice depends less on headline APY and more on liquidity, transparency, payout frequency, and how the platform explains yield generation and risk controls. This guide compares four mainstream options with Clapp, Ledn, Nexo, and Revolut. 1) Clapp Flexible Savings (best for predictable yield and instant access) Clapp Flexible Savings is designed for users who want passive income without trading, staking, or complex DeFi workflows. The core product logic is simple: Daily interest crediting Instant access with no lock-ups A fixed APY shown directly in the app (no “up to” tiers) Low minimum deposit (from 10 EUR / USDC / USDT) EUR deposits via SEPA Instant Clapp states 5.2% APY on stablecoins and EUR If your goal is to “make your crypto work,” most holders do it by allocating a portion of their portfolio to stablecoins/EUR for yield, while keeping BTC exposure separate. This avoids forcing Bitcoin into products that may have lower yields or more restrictive terms. 2) Ledn Growth Accounts (best for stablecoin yield with a lending specialist) Ledn focuses heavily on a savings experience that separates interest-earning Growth accounts from non-interest Transaction accounts. Key points that matter for savers: Published, tiered stablecoin APYs shown on Ledn’s savings pages (USDC/USDT examples listed by Ledn). Ledn explains that interest for USDC/USDT Growth Accounts is generated by lending to its bitcoin-backed retail loan book, described as overcollateralized. Ledn describes interest as earned daily and paid monthly. When Ledn makes sense:You want stablecoin yield from a platform that spends most of its product effort on lending mechanics and account structure (rather than being a full exchange). 3) Nexo (best for users willing to manage tiers and lock-ups) Nexo provides two primary savings modes: Flexible Savings: earn interest with daily payouts and access funds anytime Fixed-term Savings: higher “up to” rates in exchange for locking funds for 1, 3, 6, or 12 months Nexo’s materials emphasize: Daily interest payouts (Flexible Savings) Rates depend on asset and user configuration and are often described as “up to” rates, which implies variability based on tiers/settings. When Nexo makes sense:You are comfortable optimizing settings and accepting that the best rates may require conditions (tiers, lock-ups, payout preferences). 4) Revolut (best for simple staking) Revolut’s yield feature is primarily staking, which is fundamentally different from lending-based savings: Rewards depend on the blockchain network and participation rates. Revolut states it takes a commission and that the APY shown in-app is net of Revolut’s commission. Revolut also states staking rewards are not guaranteed. Important limitation:This is not a way to earn interest on Bitcoin directly. It applies to proof-of-stake assets (e.g., ETH, SOL, DOT), not BTC. How to choose the right crypto savings option in 2026 Use these decision criteria in order: 1) Liquidity first (when do you need the money?) If you need anytime access, avoid products that require fixed terms or slow unstaking. Clapp offers a crypto savings account with instant access ; Nexo has flexible but also fixed-term products; Revolut access depends on unstaking rules. 2) Rate transparency (can you predict your return?) Prefer clearly displayed rates without tiers if you want predictable planning. If you accept complexity, tiered “up to” structures can be competitive but require active management. 3) Yield source (lending vs staking) BTC: typically earns via lending-style products (when offered). Stablecoins: often earn higher yields than BTC across most platforms. Revolut: staking only—use it when you specifically want PoS staking exposure. 4) Operational and platform risk No yield is risk-free. Prioritize platforms that explain: how yield is generated, what happens in stress scenarios, and how custody and counterparties are handled. Ledn is unusually explicit about how USDC/USDT Growth interest is generated. Nexo and Revolut also provide clear product help-center explanations for payout mechanics and staking commission. How to start earning interest on crypto Decide the asset: BTC vs stablecoins vs EUR (your “savings” asset should match your risk tolerance). Choose the product type: flexible savings (liquidity) vs fixed-term (higher yield) vs staking (PoS only). Start small: deposit a test amount and verify payout timing and withdrawal speed. Track net return: focus on net APY after commissions, tiers, and lock-up effects. Diversify platform exposure: avoid concentrating all savings in a single provider. FAQ Can you earn interest on Bitcoin in 2026? Yes, on some lending-style platforms that support BTC yield. Returns are often lower than stablecoin yields, and terms vary by platform and jurisdiction. Are crypto savings accounts the same as bank savings accounts? No. They do not have the same protections and can involve platform, custody, counterparty, and market risks. Treat them as investment products. Why are stablecoin yields usually higher than BTC yields? Demand for borrowing stablecoins (trading, settlements, credit products) often supports higher rates than BTC lending markets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Expert Thinks So,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/are-xrp-etfs-about-to-act-like-banks-expert-thinks-so/,"US Senate debate over a bill called the Clarity Act has reignited discussion about XRP and other crypto products, and how they might be treated under US rules. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps Reports have disclosed that the bill could give clearer status to tokens that back US-listed ETFs, moving them closer to commodity-style treatment. XRP spot ETFs have also drawn large capital, with inflows reaching about $1.37 billion since their November 2025 launch — a figure that underlines why lawmakers and market watchers are paying attention. How It Works Creation and redemption in ETFs can happen “in kind,” which means the fund can accept the actual asset instead of cash. That mechanism is real, but it does not let ordinary buyers load tokens directly into a fund. Authorized participants — big broker-dealers and market makers — are the ones that hand tokens to ETFs and receive shares back. Everyday investors buy or sell ETF shares on exchanges. That gap is central to the debate about whether an ETF could ever function like a bank. The XRP ETF’s are also In-Kind Funds, so you can deposit XRP directly into the fund in exchange for the exact value in shares. Most in general will choose this option post law. There are many advantages to this, you will be able to use the ETF like a “bank”. https://t.co/2G49kxUpGc pic.twitter.com/4fyeOkEYTC — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) January 13, 2026 What Community Voices Are Saying According to posts from XRP community figures, some see a future where ETFs act like a regulated parking spot for token holders. Chad Steingraber has been vocal about in-kind mechanics, arguing that investors could swap XRP for matching ETF shares and treat the funds as a safer place to hold value until they need to move tokens again. Those comments have helped popularize the idea that ETFs could be used in a bank-like way. What Taxes Might Look Like Reports and investor guides show that ETF structure matters for taxes. ETFs often use in-kind creation and redemption to avoid routine capital gains distributions at the fund level, which helps make ETFs tax-efficient in many cases. But tax consequences for token holders depend on how transactions are carried out and on the product’s legal structure. Under current US rules, transfers that change the form of an asset can create taxable events for the person handing over the asset, and fund-level distributions can still produce tax bills for investors. Related Reading: Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike According to Chad Steingraber, the in-kind structure gives XRP holders a regulated place to park their tokens when they want safety and oversight. Investors, Steingraber believes, may favor ETFs once the Clarity Act clarifies rules. The appeal is not the technical steps but the confidence of holding XRP in a regulated, organized product. For him, ETFs offer a safer way to manage tokens while still keeping access to them when needed.

The government plans to explore all measures to stop inappropriate images from being created. Economic Security Minister Kimi Onoda stated that Japan’s Cabinet Office asked X to make immediate improvements, but the company has not responded yet. Tokyo pressures X for answers about Grok’s controls Tokyo officials sent written questions to X about steps to stop deepfakes and images that breach privacy, intellectual property, and likeness rights. Onoda, who is also a minister of state for AI strategy, said at a Friday news conference that all options, including legal action, are being considered if there is no improvement. She added that they will respond if similar issues arise on other social media platforms. The minister said it is troubling that people can still generate such images. However, she noted that AI itself is not to blame. She believes the Japanese government must explore various solutions to the true problem. Onoda spoke after Britain and Canada announced they are advancing their investigations into Grok. Japan seeks to regulate AI while aiming to rival the U.S. and China in this vital field. Its AI law , effective since September, has no penalties and restricts government action to investigations and official guidance for violations. Authorities worldwide move against Grok Authorities worldwide have sought to restrict the AI chatbot after users discovered it could produce sexualized images of women and minors. This month, Grok faced heavy criticism from users and governments in countries from Malaysia to Italy for how easily it could be used to alter photos in a sexual or degrading way The Philippines and Indonesia have temporarily banned access to Grok due to the generation of explicit images. Canada, California, the EU, and EU members like France are examining if Grok’s images breach local laws. Late Wednesday, xAI announced changes to stop Grok users from altering images of real people wearing revealing clothes like bikinis. xAI stated it restricts users by location from creating images of people in revealing clothing where it is illegal, but did not specify which areas. Since then, it has limited its image-generation features and placed them behind a paywall. On Wednesday, Elon Musk stated he did not know of any nude images of minors created by Grok. He said he’s “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero. Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests.” About one image is uploaded every minute on X, according to Copyleaks. Genevieve Oh, an independent internet researcher, reviewed @Grok’s posts on X for 24 hours. About 6,700 images per hour generated by the chatbot were flagged as sexually suggestive or nudifying.

He revealed that Evernorth, the company building the world’s largest institutional/public XRP treasury , plans an IPO on Nasdaq in the first quarter of 2026. Squire sees this move as a clear sign of adoption, indicating institutional access, on-chain yield strategies, and XRP purchases from the open market. The video he shared came from Nasdaq’s MarketSite. It featured an interview between host Christina Ayanian and Evernorth CEO Ashish Birla. $XRP GOES PUBLIC Evernorth plans a Q1 2026 IPO on Nasdaq with an active XRP treasury.

This is what adoption looks like. #XRP pic.twitter.com/FM6BPFcaxX — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) January 15, 2026 Evernorth’s Strategy for Public Market Exposure Birla opened by tying Evernorth’s IPO plans to timing. He said the regulatory environment now supports institutional participation and that “ institutions are ready to adopt .” He positioned Evernorth as a vehicle that allows institutions and public investors to gain exposure to XRP without managing custody, compliance, or security on their own. Birla described XRP as “the digital asset underpinning Evernorth’s digital asset treasury” and emphasized ease of access. Investors can buy public stock rather than manage wallets or infrastructure. Birla stressed simplicity. “A large lion’s share just wants to buy a public stock,” he said. In his words, Evernorth handles the operational complexity behind the scenes while shareholders gain XRP exposure through equity ownership. Positioning XRP Beyond Passive Holding During the interview, Birla returned several times to the idea of activity rather than passive holding. He said Evernorth does not intend to sit on XRP. Instead, the company plans to generate yield on its XRP holdings and use that yield to acquire more XRP for its treasury. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He described the company as a steward of the XRP ecosystem and said participation matters more than holding alone. Birla also claimed scale as a differentiator. He said Evernorth is “by far the largest XRP digital asset treasury out there” and argued that size and engagement will define leading digital asset treasuries. XRP Adoption is Rising Squire presented the interview as proof of increasing adoption. The CEO’s comments align with that framing. Birla spoke directly about regulated access, public equities, and institutional capital. He pointed to XRP ETFs as evidence of demand and positioned Evernorth as a complementary path for investors seeking more than price exposure. With its IPO, an active treasury, and yield generation all tied to XRP, Evernorth presents a structure familiar to traditional markets.

This sudden surge suggests that influential investors might be setting their sights on ADA. Discover the potential coins on the brink of growth and what this means for future investments. Cardano Price Dips, But Hope for Growth Remains Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is trading between thirty-seven and forty-two cents right now. Despite recent drops, there's optimism for growth. If momentum shifts, the price could rise to around forty-six cents, which is its next hurdle. This would mean a potential ten percent increase from the current level. If it beats expectations, ADA might even push to fifty-one cents, a significant bounce of more than twenty percent. But for now, buyers are watching the forty-cent line. ADA has seen a small gain of almost two percent over a month, even though it is down over fifty percent in half a year. This indicates that while there are challenges, there's potential for a rebound. Conclusion The sharp increase in futures suggests heightened interest in ADA.

Some platforms pay yield from lending, others from exchange programs, and some deliver yield primarily via staking on proof-of-stake assets. Rates also change by region, tiers, and market conditions—so the most useful comparison focuses on terms, liquidity, payout frequency, and how transparent the pricing is, not only the headline APY. Below is a practical overview of five crypto saving accounts for 2026, featuring Clapp, Nexo, Binance, Ledn, and Revolut. Comparing Crypto Saving Accounts 2026 Platform What it is Interest / APY model Payout Access to funds Best fit Clapp Flexible Savings Flexible savings-style yield product Fixed, transparent APY (Clapp states 5.2% APY on stablecoins + EUR) Daily Instant, no lock-ups Users who want predictable yield + full liquidity Nexo CeFi savings (flexible + fixed-term) Tiered; “up to” headline rates; flexible + fixed terms Program-defined Flexible available; fixed-term locks assets Users who can optimize tiers/terms and accept variability Binance (Simple Earn) Exchange earn program (flexible + locked) Real-time APR; promos and tiering may apply Typically accrues continuously / program-defined Flexible redemption is designed to be immediate (within program rules) Active exchange users who want convenience and broad asset coverage Ledn Lending-based yield accounts (Growth) Published APYs with tiers; lending-driven Accrues daily; paid monthly Generally no lock-ups; operational processing times apply BTC/USDC holders prioritizing a lending specialist Revolut App-based crypto access; yield mainly via staking Variable staking APY shown in-app; net-of-commission disclosure Program-defined Unstaking/availability depends on network rules Users who already use Revolut and want simple PoS staking 1) Clapp Flexible Savings (best for predictable yield + instant liquidity) Clapp Flexible Savings is a straightforward way to earn on idle balances without trading, staking, or DeFi workflows. The key differentiator is the product design: daily interest, instant access, and a clearly displayed rate rather than tiered “up to” marketing. Key terms: APY: 5.2% on stablecoins and EUR (rate displayed in-app; no “up to” tiers) Payouts: daily interest crediting Liquidity: withdrawals anytime, no lock-ups; 24/7 access Minimums: from 10 EUR / USDC / USDT EUR rails: SEPA Instant deposits for EUR savings Security/compliance: Clapp is an EU-regulated VASP that secures digital assets via Fireblocks custody infrastructure Who it suits in practice:Users who treat savings as a treasury tool: predictable yield, no lock-ups, and immediate access. 2) Nexo (best for users willing to optimize tiers and terms) Nexo offers Flexible Savings and Fixed-term Savings products. The value proposition is breadth (many supported assets) and daily payouts, with rates that often depend on loyalty tiers, payout choices, and whether you lock assets. Key terms (per Nexo): Flexible Savings: funds accessible while earning Fixed-term Savings: interest accrues daily; payout at term end; funds unavailable until unlock Rates: Nexo advertises “up to” headline rates; actual APY depends on settings and tier Who it suits in practice:Users comfortable navigating tiers/bonuses and switching between flexible and fixed-term options. 3) Binance Simple Earn (best for exchange-first users and broad asset coverage) Binance’s Simple Earn provides flexible and locked earning options inside the exchange. The core point to understand: Binance describes Real-Time APR mechanics and may apply tiering and promotional rates depending on asset and period. Key terms (per Binance documentation): Flexible products: subscription at any time; redemption is designed to be immediate back to Spot (subject to rules and conditions) Locked products: early redemption can forfeit rewards; availability windows apply Rates: real-time, asset-specific; promos are common and time-bounded Who it suits in practice:Users who already hold assets on Binance and want a built-in earn option with minimal extra setup. 4) Ledn (best for BTC/USDC holders) Ledn’s savings offering (often branded as Growth accounts) centers around BTC and USDC, with interest accrued daily and typically paid monthly. Ledn emphasizes institutional counterparties and transparency practices (such as proof-of-reserves messaging in its materials). Key terms (per Ledn materials): APY examples: Ledn publicly references “up to” APYs for BTC and USDC (tiering may apply) Interest mechanics: accrued daily, paid monthly Asset focus: BTC and USDC are core savings assets Who it suits in practice:Holders who primarily want BTC/USDC yield from a platform focused on lending rather than being a full exchange. 5) Revolut (best for simple PoS staking inside a banking-style app) Revolut is the outlier here: it’s not primarily a “crypto savings account” provider in the lending sense. For yield, Revolut’s mainstream approach is staking on proof-of-stake assets. That means: not BTC, and yields are variable (network-dependent). Key terms: APY: shown in-app as a variable projection; rewards are not guaranteed Fees/commission: Revolut help pages describe how APY is presented net of commission, and also state that Revolut does not add extra fees on rewards; validator fees may apply on-chain depending on network Who it suits in practice:Users who already use Revolut and want one-tap access to staking on PoS assets, accepting variable returns and unstaking constraints. How to choose a crypto savings account in 2026 If you want stablecoin/EUR yield with instant access and a clearly stated rate: Clapp Flexible Savings (fixed, transparent structure as described by Clapp). If you want maximum asset coverage and are comfortable with tiers/terms: Nexo or Binance. If your “savings” is mostly BTC/USDC and you prefer a lending specialist: Ledn. If you want simple PoS staking inside a finance app (not BTC yield): Revolut. Crypto savings accounts have matured. In 2026, the real differentiators are liquidity, transparency, and clarity of terms. A higher advertised rate means little if funds are locked, payouts are unclear, or access depends on changing tiers. The best choice ultimately depends on how you use your assets. If flexibility and clarity matter more than chasing temporary rates, choosing a savings solution built around those principles is a rational long-term decision.

The core question remains: can the ENS token, fundamental to human-readable blockchain addresses, sustain growth and potentially approach a $100 valuation by 2030? This analysis examines the protocol’s fundamentals, market adoption metrics, and broader crypto-economic trends to provide a grounded perspective. Understanding Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Its Market Position The Ethereum Name Service fundamentally transforms cumbersome cryptocurrency addresses. Instead of a long string of characters, users can register a simple .eth domain. This service enhances user experience and security across decentralized applications (dApps), wallets, and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Consequently, the ENS token governs this decentralized naming protocol. Holders use ENS for protocol governance, deciding on fee structures, treasury management, and technical upgrades. The token’s value is intrinsically linked to the utility and adoption of .eth domains. Market data from 2024 shows consistent growth in domain registrations, particularly from institutional entities and major brands securing their Web3 identities. This real-world usage provides a tangible foundation for evaluating future price movements, unlike purely speculative assets. Technical and Fundamental Analysis for ENS Price Trajectory Forecasting cryptocurrency prices requires analyzing multiple concurrent factors. For ENS, key fundamentals include network activity, revenue generation, and tokenomics. The protocol earns revenue from initial domain registrations and annual renewal fees, a portion of which is used to buy back and burn ENS tokens, creating a deflationary mechanism. Technically, the price action of ENS often correlates with broader Ethereum (ETH) performance and overall crypto market sentiment. However, its unique utility as an infrastructure token can sometimes decouple it from short-term market volatility. Experts from firms like CoinShares and IntoTheBlock frequently reference on-chain metrics such as active addresses, domain renewal rates, and the ratio of new versus recurring users. These metrics offer more reliable indicators of long-term health than price alone. For instance, a sustained increase in multi-year domain registrations signals user commitment and bullish long-term sentiment. Comparative Analysis with Traditional and Crypto Naming Systems To contextualize ENS’s potential, analysts often draw parallels with the early Domain Name System (DNS) for the internet. The market capitalization of legacy domain names runs into hundreds of billions. While direct comparison is flawed due to different technological stacks, it illustrates the vast addressable market for digital identity. Within crypto, competitors like Unstoppable Domains operate, but ENS’s first-mover advantage on Ethereum and its decentralized, community-owned model are significant differentiators. A report from Messari in late 2024 highlighted that ENS maintains over 85% market share in decentralized naming on Ethereum. This dominance is a critical factor in its price resilience and potential for network effects. Ethereum Name Service Price Prediction: 2026, 2027, and 2030 Scenarios Projections are based on current adoption curves, Ethereum’s development roadmap (including scalability improvements), and potential regulatory landscapes. It is crucial to present these as plausible scenarios, not financial advice. 2026 Outlook: By 2026, the full integration of Ethereum’s scalability upgrades (like danksharding) could significantly reduce transaction costs. This would lower the barrier to registering and managing .eth domains, potentially accelerating adoption. If current growth rates persist, analysts project a trading range that reflects steady, utility-driven growth rather than speculative spikes. 2027 Horizon: This period may see ENS functionality expand beyond simple address resolution. Roadmap discussions include leveraging ENS for decentralized website hosting, credential verification, and cross-chain identity. Successful implementation of these features could open new revenue streams and utility, positively impacting token valuation. 2030 Vision: The 2030 price prediction for ENS hinges on mass Web3 adoption. If blockchain technology becomes seamlessly integrated into everyday digital interactions, the demand for human-readable, portable, and self-sovereign identities will surge. In this bullish but plausible scenario, where ENS becomes a standard component of digital infrastructure, discussions of a $100 valuation enter the realm of possibility. However, this requires exponential user growth and sustained network dominance. Key Factors Influencing ENS Price Trajectory Bullish Catalysts Potential Challenges Mass adoption of Ethereum-based dApps and social platforms. Increased competition from other naming protocols or layer-2 solutions. Successful expansion of ENS utility (e.g., decentralized email, logins). Regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital identity tokens. Continued token burns from protocol revenue, reducing supply. Technical hurdles or security vulnerabilities within the protocol. Strategic partnerships with major tech or financial institutions. Prolonged bear market conditions suppressing all crypto asset prices. Conclusion The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) price prediction for 2026 through 2030 is inextricably linked to the organic growth of the Web3 ecosystem. While a sprint to $100 is a highly ambitious target requiring perfect alignment of market, technology, and adoption factors, the protocol’s fundamental utility provides a solid basis for long-term value appreciation. The most realistic outlook suggests gradual, stepwise growth correlated with Ethereum’s success and the expansion of ENS’s use cases beyond simple address resolution. Investors and observers should monitor domain registration trends, governance activity, and technological milestones rather than short-term price fluctuations to gauge the true health and potential of the Ethereum Name Service. FAQs Q1: What is the primary utility of the ENS token? The ENS token is primarily used for decentralized governance of the Ethereum Name Service protocol. Token holders can vote on proposals that dictate treasury management, fee changes, and technical upgrades, ensuring the system evolves according to community consensus. Q2: How does ENS generate revenue and value for token holders? The protocol generates revenue from fees paid to register and renew .eth domain names. A portion of this revenue can be used by the DAO to buy back and burn ENS tokens from the open market, a mechanism that reduces circulating supply and can create deflationary pressure on the token. Q3: What are the biggest risks to the ENS price prediction? Major risks include a failure to scale Ethereum cost-effectively, the rise of a competing naming standard that gains more traction, broader regulatory crackdowns on crypto assets, and a sustained decline in overall market sentiment leading to reduced speculation and investment. Q4: How does the growth of Layer 2 networks affect ENS? The growth of Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism) is generally positive for ENS. It reduces the cost and friction of registering and managing domains on Ethereum, potentially driving higher adoption rates. The ENS protocol is actively working on seamless cross-L2 support. Q5: Is the $100 ENS price target by 2030 realistic? While not impossible, a $100 price target is highly speculative and would require exponential, mass-market adoption of .eth domains as a universal Web3 identity standard. More conservative analyses focus on steady, utility-driven growth based on measurable metrics like registered domains and protocol revenue.

The company said the agreement sets up a phased production ramp once ownership changes hands in the second quarter of 2026, with real wafer impact expected later. The P5 site will not flip a switch overnight. Production will rise step by step, and meaningful DRAM wafer output is expected in the second half of 2027. Alongside the purchase, Micron and Powerchip agreed to work together on post‑wafer assembly processing and to support Powerchip’s legacy DRAM portfolio. The structure keeps Powerchip involved while Micron takes over the core manufacturing footprint. Micron expands capacity as AI memory demand tightens supply The Taiwan deal fits into Micron’s wider expansion push as demand for memory keeps climbing. Most of its chips already come from Asian facilities, but the company is also building in the United States. On Friday, Micron held a groundbreaking ceremony near Syracuse, New York, tied to a plan announced last year to invest up to $200 billion across the country. That includes two fabs in Idaho and a 600,000‑square‑foot facility in Clay, New York. The New York site alone carries a planned $100 billion investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick attended the event. Executives said construction will take several years due to clean rooms and complex production tools. Markets reacted fast. Micron shares jumped nearly 8% on Friday after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. posted strong earnings a day earlier, pushing investors toward AI supply chain stocks. Over the past year, Micron stock is up more than 250%, driven by a global memory shortage and sharp demand growth. Memory plays a key role in AI systems by keeping large data sets close to the GPU, allowing big models to run without slowing down. “AI driven-demand is accelerating,” CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on CNBC’s Jim Cramer. “It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand.” Mehrotra said Micron is spending $200 billion to lift U.S. output and is also pushing existing plants harder in the near term. At the start of 2025, Micron expected 10% growth in server memory. By year end, that number landed in the high teens. Mehrotra said demand for PC memory and storage also came in stronger than forecast. “We see that tightness continuing into 2027,” he said, adding that fundamentals remain durable due to AI demand. The scramble to supply companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Google has driven shortages, with memory prices projected to rise about 55% in the first quarter.

In its statement, it updated the requirement to two billion naira. The agency claimed the move was made to improve investor protection and align Nigeria with global cryptocurrency standards. The compliance deadline set at June 30, 2027 for the increased capital requirement could force smaller firms to merge while others exit the market permanently. SEC shakes up Nigerian crypto industry with new crypto capital rule According to the SEC, the changes reflect the increase in funds managed by digital platforms in the country. It also noted that it is expected to reduce systemic risks in a market where operator failure could have bigger consequences, especially for users. In its statement, the agency noted that firms that fail to meet its deadline risk sanctions, which would include suspension or withdrawal of registration. The increased capital means that only firms with sufficient financial depth are allowed to operate. Aside from its financial angle, the SEC also mentioned that these firms are expected to provide sufficient governance structures and good risk management systems in an industry that is consistently exposed to fraud, volatility, and cross-border flows. The stance was received well by some of the veterans in the Industry. For instance, Demola Aladekomo, chairman and founder of CHAMS Plc, noted that the move was timely. He noted that it was also necessary for the crypto population in the country. “The business of crypto is global. It is going on whether we like it or not. We must commend the SEC for being very proactive in ensuring that we get into it with proper regulation,” Aladekomo said. When asked about his views on the N2 billion requirement, he noted that it was good, considering the risk in crypto operations. Aladekomo added that capital is only the first layer of scrutiny. According to the CHAMS CEO, the licensing process also involves checks on systems and security. He said it still includes other requirements like know-your-customer requirements for directors, technology deployment, provisional approvals, and post-licensing audits. “If smaller players are serious about operating, they should look at mergers or acquisitions,” he said. For operators already in the system, the new rules are tougher, but unavoidable. Moyo Sodipo, chief operating officer of Busha, a SEC-provisionally licensed crypto exchange, mentioned that the updated capital requirements show a strict assessment of risks and market integrity. The increased capital requirements signal a stricter regulatory assessment of risk and market integrity in the digital asset space,” Sodipo said. He added that Busha would continue to dialogue with the regulator and push for “fair and proportionate rules that support a healthy, sustainable ecosystem.” However, critics feel the rules risk stifling innovation. Obinna Iwuno, chief executive of CBC Blockchain Services, mentioned that the new requirement is excessive and globally uncompetitive. “Increasing capital requirements to N2 billion makes Nigeria the most expensive jurisdiction in the world for a crypto license. And yet Nigeria is not even among the top 10 markets in the world in terms of liquidity and volume,” he asserted. He added that the policy would kill the Nigerian market and eliminate local players.

On Saturday, the agency started rolling out its massive rocket and crew capsule to the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This rollout is part of Artemis II, which will carry four astronauts around the moon and back. The rocket took off slowly, literally. It’s only a four-mile trip, but the rollout took twelve hours. This thing isn’t new. It’s the Space Launch System (SLS) built by Boeing, with the Orion capsule from Lockheed Martin sitting on top. The system has been under development for around fifteen years, with only one uncrewed flight in 2022. That test flight orbited the moon. Every launch costs over $4 billion, and it’s already years behind schedule. NASA begins pad tests as Congress fights over cost Once the rocket got to the pad, NASA crews started setting up. They began connecting ground equipment, testing hardware, and checking everything on-site. They’re working toward the next big milestone: a full countdown rehearsal at the end of January. That’s when they fuel up the rocket and run through all the final steps leading up to launch. Nothing moves forward until that test passes. “Wet dress is the big test at the pad. That’s the one to keep an eye on,” said Charlie, the launch director. The actual launch is now scheduled for April. It was originally planned for late 2024, but delays pushed it. The Artemis II mission will send the crew around the moon, then bring them home within ten days. It’s the first human flight of the SLS. The next flight (Artemis III) will put astronauts back on the moon. That one is expected in 2027. The money behind this is just as insane. Donald Trump’s budget for this year wanted to phase out the SLS after its third flight. He called it “grossly expensive and delayed.” But Ted Cruz stepped in and got $4.1 billion added back through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , which Trump signed in July. Bezos and Musk eye moon orbit for new data center push While the rocket rollout is happening, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are already thinking a few steps ahead. Both of them are working on designs for space-based data centers . These would orbit the moon and run off the cold of space instead of overloading Earth’s power grid. These types of data centers eat electricity like crazy, and keeping them cool is expensive. Sticking them in space makes it easier to manage all that heat. “These are the kind of days we live for,” said John, who leads the Artemis II mission team. NASA says the countdown will continue through all of January. Teams will do one last sweep before the final rehearsal. If nothing breaks, they’ll launch by spring. And if that works, the moon becomes the next big tech zone. Get seen where it counts.

In 2029, HBAR is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.6331, with an average price of $0.5341. By 2032, HBAR could trade between $1.63 and $1.88, with an average price of $1.69. HBAR price prediction – Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is a cryptocurrency that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021, alongside other altcoins. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force in the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR’s price rise again? Despite the overall bear market, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing to a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we may see a bullish scenario unfold sooner, perhaps a retest of its all-time high.

Price is trading around $0.119, sliding from the recent swing peak near $0.13–$0.135, which is acting as a clear supply zone. The structure is now range-to-bearish unless bulls reclaim $0.125 and then break back above $0.13 with follow-through. MACD momentum has cooled, with the histogram fading toward neutral, hinting the prior upside impulse is losing strength. Key support sits at $0.115, then $0.11 and $0.105 if selling accelerates. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBARUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart shows a short-term corrective structure following a recent push higher, suggesting momentum has temporarily slowed rather than fully reversed. Price is oscillating within a defined range, with repeated tests of a nearby resistance zone indicating sellers are actively defending that level. A series of slightly lower highs points to mild bearish pressure in the near term, though overall trend has not broken down decisively. If price holds above its most recent swing low, consolidation could precede another attempt higher. A clean break below this support would signal deeper retracement toward the next demand area, while a breakout above resistance would restore bullish momentum. HBAR technical indicators: Levels and action Simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 0.1243 SELL SMA 5 0.1204 SELL SMA 10 0.1179 BUY SMA 21 0.1179 BUY SMA 50 0.1233 SELL SMA 100 0.1479 SELL SMA 200 0.1853 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 0.1232 SELL EMA 5 0.1230 SELL EMA 10 0.1209 SELL EMA 21 0.1199 SELL EMA 50 0.1301 SELL EMA 100 0.1504 SELL EMA 200 0.1707 SELL What can you expect from the HBAR price analysis next? Based on recent technical behavior, HBAR is likely to enter a period of short-term consolidation as the market digests its previous move and reassesses momentum. If buyers continue to defend key support zones, price could gradually form a higher low structure, setting the stage for another upward attempt. A breakout above nearby resistance would signal renewed bullish strength and could attract follow-through buying. However, if selling pressure increases and support fails to hold, HBAR may extend its pullback toward the next demand area. Overall, the next phase will likely depend on whether volume confirms a breakout or supports a deeper retracement. Is HBAR a good investment? Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Why is HBAR down today? HBAR is down today mainly due to short-term profit taking and weakening intraday momentum after a recent bounce. On the 1-day and 4-hour charts, price approached nearby resistance and was rejected, prompting traders to lock in gains and tighten stops, which has translated into selling pressure. Momentum indicators like the MACD have cooled and flattened, signaling that buyers are losing short-term conviction, while RSI has pulled back from higher levels, reflecting weakening demand. Broader crypto market caution has also weighed on mid-cap altcoins like HBAR, reducing overall risk appetite and amplifying downside moves in intraday trading. Until buyers step in with stronger conviction, selling pressure persists today. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2026? By 2026, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.2262 How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth a maximum of $0.8964 Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching $20 would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly unlikely. For context, with HBAR’s current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to $660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $0.7804 and $0.8964, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes. Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good, long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.2262 by 2026 and $0.8965 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Hederah Hashgraph’s historic price sentiment HBAR price history; Source: Coingecko In 2019, HBAR started with a negligible value, fluctuating before ending the year near $0.01. HBAR opened 2021 at $0.03, rising to $0.10 by early February due to active network developments. In 2024, HBAR peaked at $0.1793 in April, dropped to $0.051 by September, then rebounded to $0.30 in December, closing the year around $0.29. January 2025 saw stable trading between $0.30 and $0.31, ending at $0.30. In February, HBAR dipped to the $0.25–$0.26 range, then declined further in March to around $0.20. As of June, HBAR trades between $0.17 and $0.18 after closing May at $0.1874. HBAR ended June at $0.147. At the start of July, HBAR has increased, and it currently trades at $0.16 HBAR declined from approximately $0.25 on July 31 to about $0.23 on August 2, 2025. The price rebounded slightly to around $0.24 by August 3, 2025. From August to September 6, HBAR showed steady growth, climbing from around $0.065 to nearly $0.095 as investor optimism rose following new enterprise partnerships and increased network activity. From September 6 to now, HBAR traded mostly between $0.075 and $0.10. This was because buying slowed down after earlier gains, and investors were waiting for clearer signals from the market as a whole. Here are five key price-history snapshots for Hedera (HBAR) from early October to early November 2025: On October 4, the price closed around $0.2171 after opening near $0.2256. By October 1,0 HBAR had plunged to approximately $0.1644, marking a notable drop from the start of the month. Between October 15 and 17, the token hovered in the $0.165–$0.190 range, with October 17 closing around $0.1625. In late October (October 21–26), HBAR ranged between roughly $0.1705 and $0.1726, showing relative stability. By November 3, HBAR had traded in the ballpark of $0.170–$0.185, indicating a modest recovery off the October lows. Early November: HBAR traded around $0.072–$0.075, experiencing mild upward volatility, with brief tests toward $0.078 before losing momentum. Mid-November: The price trended downward into the $0.060–$0.065 range as broader market weakness and low liquidity weighed on altcoins. HBAR briefly dipped near $0.058 around Nov 20–22. Late November to Dec 7: HBAR consolidated tightly between $0.058 and $0.063, showing low volatility and weak recovery signals, hovering around $0.060–$0.061 in early December. Around Dec 5, 2025, HBAR was ~$0.1339 and then traded lower into late December, with prices near ~$0.1117 by Dec 31, 2025, showing a mild downward trend as the month progressed In early January 2026, HBAR rose modestly from about $0.1063 on Jan 1, 2026, to roughly $0.1288 by Jan 6, 2026, indicating a short rebound after the December lows",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|HBAR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 14:00:00

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/ex-ripple-cto-schwartz-to-an-xrp-enthusiast-are-you-mad-heres-what-happened/,"The global stablecoin conversation has intensified as traditional banks confront a future where digital dollars increasingly compete with deposits. What began as a niche crypto experiment has evolved into a serious policy and market issue, with implications for lending, liquidity, and financial stability. Recent public commentary has revealed how deep the divide has become between banks and crypto-native issuers. That divide came into focus through a pointed response from David Schwartz , Ex-Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, during a discussion sparked by concerns raised within the U.S. banking sector. His remarks exposed the regulatory tension at the heart of the stablecoin debate. Bank Executives Sound the Alarm on Deposits The discussion gained momentum after CoinMarketCap highlighted comments from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan . He warned that interest-bearing stablecoins could draw as much as $6 trillion away from traditional bank deposits. Such an outflow, he argued, could increase funding costs for banks and limit credit availability for small businesses that rely heavily on bank loans. Compete? On a level playing field? Are you mad!? — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2026 Banks depend on deposits as a stable and low-cost funding base. When deposits shrink, banks must seek alternative funding sources, often at higher costs, which can ripple through the broader economy. A Question About Banks Issuing Stablecoins Reacting to these concerns, crypto commentator Digital Asset Investor questioned why banks could not issue their own stablecoins and compete directly in the yield-driven digital asset space. The comment reflected a widely held assumption that established financial institutions can easily adapt to technological disruption. That assumption prompted a sharp rebuttal from David Schwartz, who rejected the idea that such competition could occur on fair terms. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz Highlights Regulatory Imbalance Banks operate under far stricter regulatory constraints than most stablecoin issuers. Capital requirements, liquidity rules, consumer protections, and continuous supervision limit how banks design and price financial products. In contrast, many stablecoin issuers face lighter oversight, allowing them to offer yields and features that banks cannot legally replicate. This imbalance creates an uneven playing field. Banks cannot innovate freely without regulatory approval, while crypto-native firms can move faster and take risks that regulated institutions must avoid. Schwartz’s reaction underscored frustration with compliance becoming a structural disadvantage rather than a safeguard. Why the Stablecoin Debate Matters The exchange highlights a critical policy challenge. Stablecoins increasingly function like bank deposits but operate outside the same regulatory framework. As adoption grows, regulators must decide whether to extend bank-style rules to stablecoin issuers or create new categories that preserve competition without undermining financial stability. Schwartz’s response captured the core issue. Without regulatory alignment, banks cannot simply “join the stablecoin party.” The resolution of this debate will shape the future of digital money, credit markets, and the role of blockchain in global finance.

Traders are hearing cautionary views that the price could weaken if key support levels fail, and analysts are closely watching whale flows. At the same time, large investors are increasing exposure to what some call “XRP 2.0” because they see stronger fundamentals and clearer use cases. Remittix , dubbed “XRP 2.0”, is attracting capital as XRP price uncertainties rise, and this shift highlights why many in the market are now considering it as a serious contender with a payment infrastructure that bridges crypto and finance. XRP Price Faces Technical Risks And Short-Term Downside XRP is currently trading at $2.09 with a market cap of $127 billion and a daily trading volume of over $3.4 billion. Recent market models for the XRP price point to a risk of a steeper correction. Technical indicators like Stochastic RSI have shown overbought readings that often precede pullbacks, and historical patterns suggest declines could be sharp. Broader sentiment has been fragile, as recent whale outflows underline reluctance from some large holders to defend current price levels. Together, these factors create a narrative where XRP price may see downside pressure before stabilizing, and this has led some investors to seek opportunities elsewhere. Why Whales Are Turning Toward Remittix As concerns grow over XRP price uncertainty, large investors are directing attention to Remittix , sometimes referenced in market narratives as “XRP 2.0” due to its strong payment focus and clearer growth path. There has been an increased accumulation of RTX by institutional-grade holders, suggesting confidence in its model as crypto becomes more tied to real-world payments and finance. Remittix differs from many tokens by building direct applications in global remittance and crypto-to-fiat services. The project targets a $19 trillion market with tools that empower merchants, users, and businesses to transact across borders and currencies with lower costs. Trust signals like CertiK audit verification , and a #1 ranking among pre-launch tokens give the project credibility. Market achievements for Remittix reflect active growth. The project has sold over 701.4 million tokens, which are now priced at only $0.123, raising more than $28.8 million. Current listings include BitMart and LBANK, and a third major exchange will be revealed once the project raises $30 million, broadening access and liquidity. There is also the upcoming Remittix platform launch on February 9, which will unlock the full PayFi stack. This release will introduce comprehensive crypto-to-fiat conversion tools designed for real-world use and adoption. In a market where XRP price models hint at correction risk, Remittix’s growing utility and adoption narrative stand out. Key features that make Remittix stand out include the following: Tackles the $19 trillion payments market with real-world solutions Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Utility-first token with real transaction volume Deflationary tokenomics with growth potential Mass-market appeal beyond crypto natives Why Remittix May Offer Stronger Prospects Amid Market Shifts Technical models suggesting a steep correction for XRP price highlight the importance of evaluating projects based on use case and adoption. While XRP holds value as a well-known token, recent patterns show downside pressures that large investors may interpret as risk cues. In contrast, Remittix’s focus on payments infrastructure and global remittance gives it a foundation that appeals to capital seeking tangible growth potential. Its ability to solve real financial problems with clear service expansion stands in contrast to the uncertainty flagged by some XRP price correction models. For investors watching XRP price risk and looking for crypto with practical use cases, Remittix presents a meaningful option that aligns utility with growth trajectory as the market continues to evolve. Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix Frequently Asked Questions Why do XRP price models suggest a potential correction? XRP price models indicate downside risk due to overbought technical indicators, weakening whale support, and fragile market sentiment. If key support levels fail, analysts warn XRP price could experience a sharper pullback before any recovery. Why is Remittix being referred to as “XRP 2.0” by some investors? Remittix is called “XRP 2.0” because it focuses on real-world payments, crypto-to-fiat transfers, and global remittance infrastructure. Unlike speculative price-driven tokens, Remittix ties RTX value to utility, adoption, and transaction volume. How does Remittix position RTX for growth despite broader market volatility? Remittix targets the $19 trillion cross-border payments market with deflationary tokenomics and expanding payout rails in over 30 countries. With CertiK verification, exchange listings, and a PayFi platform launch scheduled for 9 February 2026, RTX offers a utility-backed growth narrative.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 14:10:00

This ETH ETF delisting decision arrives merely four months after the product’s high-profile launch, sending ripples through the digital asset management sector and raising questions about the viability of complex crypto derivatives in mainstream markets. The fund, which uniquely combined leverage with an options-based strategy to track Ethereum-linked returns, will cease trading following a brief and challenging lifespan. Understanding the Defiance ETHI ETF Delisting Defiance ETFs formally notified investors and exchanges about the ETH ETF delisting on January 22, 2025. The company launched the fund with considerable fanfare on September 19, 2024, positioning it as a sophisticated tool for experienced traders. Consequently, the fund’s short duration highlights significant market hurdles. The ETHI product aimed to deliver amplified returns through a mix of futures contracts and options strategies. However, consistently low assets under management (AUM) and limited trading volume ultimately forced this strategic withdrawal. Market analysts immediately noted the broader implications. “This delisting reflects the steep challenges niche, leveraged crypto products face in attracting sustained capital,” observed a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. Furthermore, the current regulatory environment for crypto derivatives remains stringent. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains a cautious stance on most crypto ETFs beyond basic spot Bitcoin funds. This regulatory headwind likely contributed to the product’s struggle for adoption. The Mechanics of a Leveraged Options ETF The Defiance ETHI ETF was not a simple spot fund. Instead, it employed a multi-layered strategy: Leverage Component: The fund used financial derivatives to seek returns that were a multiple of the daily performance of Ethereum futures. Options Overlay: It simultaneously sold (wrote) call options on Ethereum futures, aiming to generate additional income (premium) to offset costs. Daily Rebalancing: Like all leveraged ETFs, it reset its exposure daily, a process that can lead to significant volatility decay over time, especially in turbulent markets. This complex structure demanded a high level of investor understanding. Unfortunately, many potential users may have found the product’s risk profile too esoteric. The following table compares ETHI with a more traditional crypto investment vehicle: Feature Defiance ETHI ETF (Delisted) Spot Bitcoin ETF (e.g., IBIT) Underlying Exposure Ethereum Futures + Options Direct Bitcoin Holdings Leverage Yes (Targeted 2x) No Primary Risk High (Volatility Decay, Complexity) Moderate (Direct Asset Price) Target Investor Sophisticated Trader Retail & Institutional Regulatory Hurdle Very High High (Now Approved) Broader Context for Crypto ETF Struggles The Defiance ETH ETF delisting did not occur in a vacuum. It represents a recurring theme within the digital asset exchange-traded product space. Several issuers have launched similar niche funds only to shutter them later due to poor demand. For instance, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Futures ETF also faced closure after failing to gather sufficient assets. This pattern suggests a market consolidation where only the simplest, most liquid products survive. Simultaneously, the investment community’s focus has shifted decisively toward spot products. The landmark approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 created a new paradigm. These funds hold physical Bitcoin, appealing to a wider audience seeking direct exposure. Consequently, complex vehicles like ETHI appear out of step with current mainstream demand. Investors now prioritize transparency and simplicity over engineered returns. Expert Analysis on Product Viability Financial experts point to several key factors behind the delisting. First, the fee structure for such complex funds is typically higher, eroding potential returns. Second, the target audience—active traders comfortable with derivatives—is relatively small. Finally, the ongoing uncertainty regarding the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF may have caused investors to wait rather than commit to a futures-and-options proxy. “The market is speaking clearly,” stated a portfolio manager specializing in crypto assets. “While innovation is crucial, product-market fit is paramount. Leveraged and options-based crypto ETFs currently occupy a narrow niche that may not support multiple products, especially in a cautious regulatory climate.” This sentiment echoes across recent analyst notes, which frequently cite AUM thresholds as a critical survival metric for any ETF. Impact on Investors and the Ethereum Ecosystem Current shareholders of the Defiance ETHI ETF received specific guidance from the issuer. The fund halted the creation of new shares immediately following the announcement. Trading will continue on the exchange until the official delisting date, allowing investors to exit their positions. After delisting, Defiance will liquidate the fund’s assets and distribute the net cash proceeds to remaining shareholders. This process is standard but underscores the importance of liquidity in ETF investing. For the broader Ethereum ecosystem, the event is more symbolic than material. The fund’s small size meant it had negligible impact on Ethereum’s underlying market or liquidity. However, its failure signals to other issuers that the path for approved Ethereum-based investment products remains fraught. All eyes are now on applications for a spot Ethereum ETF, which would provide a straightforward, non-leveraged exposure that could attract massive institutional capital. The Regulatory Landscape in 2025 The delisting coincides with an evolving regulatory framework. The SEC continues to scrutinize all crypto-related investment products with extreme care. Chairman Gary Gensler has repeatedly emphasized the need for robust investor protections, particularly for products involving leverage and derivatives. The Defiance ETHI product, while fully compliant and launched on a national exchange, may have been a casualty of this broader regulatory caution. Its closure reduces regulatory complexity for the agency, potentially allowing it to focus on the more consequential spot ETF applications. Conclusion The Defiance ETH ETF delisting serves as a poignant case study in the maturation of cryptocurrency financial products. It demonstrates that even with innovative structures and reputable issuers, market demand and regulatory realities dictate success. This ETH ETF delisting highlights a clear investor preference for simplicity and direct exposure over complex, leveraged strategies. As the digital asset market evolves, the failure of the ETHI fund will likely inform future product development, steering issuers toward more transparent and accessible vehicles that can achieve the scale necessary for long-term survival. FAQs Q1: What was the Defiance ETHI ETF? The Defiance ETHI ETF was an exchange-traded fund that sought to provide leveraged returns linked to Ethereum through a combined strategy of Ethereum futures and an options income overlay. It was designed for sophisticated traders. Q2: Why was the ETHI ETF delisted after only four months? The primary reason for the ETH ETF delisting was persistently low assets under management (AUM) and trading volume. The complex, niche product failed to attract sufficient investor capital to remain economically viable for the issuer. Q3: What should current investors in the ETHI ETF do? Investors can sell their shares on the open market until the final delisting date. After delisting, the fund will be liquidated, and remaining shareholders will receive a cash distribution based on the net asset value at that time. Q4: Does this delisting affect the chances for a spot Ethereum ETF? Not directly. The spot Ethereum ETF applications are separate regulatory processes. However, the failure of a complex product like ETHI may reinforce the SEC’s preference for simpler, less risky structures like spot funds. Q5: Are other leveraged crypto ETFs at risk of delisting? Any ETF with low assets and trading volume is at risk, regardless of its asset class. Leveraged and inverse crypto ETFs, which cater to a specialized trading audience, are particularly vulnerable if they cannot reach a sustainable scale.

Big investors are done waiting around. The two major bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor have made everyone nervous, as both companies were stacked with loans and asset-backed debt arranged by banks. Funds managed by Apollo, Ares, Barings, Blackstone, Blue Owl, Cliffwater, Oaktree, and BlackRock’s HPS have all taken a hit. The data, from SEC filings, shows redemptions surging across the board. Most are sitting around 5% of the fund’s net value after debt. But it won’t stop there. More reports are coming in the next few weeks. Executives say the total will be higher. And since the private credit market is worth $2.3 trillion, if confidence keeps falling, it will almost definitely trigger a crash in publicly traded stocks. On Friday, the S&P 500 slipped by 0.06% and closed at 6,940.01, the Nasdaq Composite inched down by 0.06% to settle at 23,515.39, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.17% to end at 49,359.33. Then you have Jamie Dimon, the boss at JPMorgan, ominously warning that:- “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Demand had already started slowing. The Fed signaled rate cuts were coming. Lower rates mean lower returns, especially for funds holding floating-rate loans. Some funds slashed their dividends. That spooked people even more. Most of the pressure has landed on non-traded BDCs and interval funds. These are the main entry points for retail and high-net-worth investors into private credit. Normally, managers can cap withdrawals at 5% each quarter. But many funds are letting people pull out more than that. Trump’s 10% interest rate cap plan triggers more fears While Wall Street deals with investor flight, President Trump has lit a new fire by pushing for a 10% interest rate cap on credit cards. The warning signs came fast. The Electronic Payments Coalition ran the numbers and said 82% to 88% of cardholders would lose their cards or see big limit cuts. That’s millions of Americans. The worst hit? People with credit scores under 740. The EPC says that’s 175 to 190 million people who’d either lose their cards or face serious limits. Jeremy Barnum, the CFO at JPMorgan, told investors this would wreck access to credit. “People will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it,” he said. Barnum added that:- “This could have a severely negative consequence for consumers and, frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole.” And yes, the bank would feel it too. “We wouldn’t be in it if it weren’t a good business for us.” Cliffwater earlier said that it was “not worried about our ability to perform, knowing that we have a lot of liquidity behind us and we think quarter on quarter things will get better.” Between collapsing companies, rising redemptions, rate cuts, and now the card cap fight, the credit market is getting hammered from every side. There’s no telling what comes next. But for now, Wall Street is watching people walk out the door. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Donald Trump, who is now the 47th U.S. president, has made it clear that Greenland is back on his radar. “We need Greenland for national security, not for minerals,” he said in December. But House Speaker Mike Johnson said this week that it’s about both: “national security and critical minerals and many other reasons.” There’s no argument over whether Greenland has what everyone wants. What’s up in the air is how much of it can be used, and how soon. Lawmakers act as China controls mineral refining The U.S. Geological Survey lists 60 minerals as critical. That includes neodymium and dysprosium, which power magnets and motors in tech hardware, and others like germanium and gallium, which are used in fiber optics, semiconductors, and power devices. The catch? The U.S. doesn’t control most of it. China does. Right now, China supplies 98% of gallium and about 60% of germanium worldwide. And it doesn’t just mine the stuff, it also runs the refining process too. That’s what gives it leverage. “There are lots of rare earths around the world, but the issue is refining them,” said Jack Lifton, who co-chairs the Critical Minerals Institute. “The American rare earth industry could fit inside of a large bus.” To change that, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill last week to set up a $2.5 billion reserve of rare earths. The Pentagon is already involved. In July, the Department of Defense signed a 10-year deal with MP Materials, which runs a rare earth mine in Colorado, to strengthen the supply chain and cut ties with Chinese sources. That’s where Greenland comes in. The USGS says it holds some of the largest rare earth reserves in the world, and none of them are being mined right now. Industry experts disagree over Greenland’s mineral potential Ted Feldmann, who runs Durin Mining Technologies, says the minerals in Greenland might not be worth the cost. “I think it’s a great idea to expand America’s presence in Greenland to counter Russia and China,” Ted said. “But I don’t think we should go there for the minerals.” He points to the Tanbreez site in southern Greenland, calling it one of the biggest known rare earth deposits. But the percentage of useful metal in the ore is low. “It probably isn’t economically viable to ship,” Ted said. Still, others don’t agree. Eldur Olafsson, the CEO of Amaroq, is already mining gold in southern Greenland. He says it can work, with the right backing. “Denmark is not really a resource-driven country, so the capital support up until this date has not been enough to get more mining going,” Eldur said. He says it’s not just about the money. It takes people. Equipment. Roads. Bridges. Harbors. “You also need people. You need to physically move people and build infrastructure,” Eldur said. That’s tough in a place with only 60,000 people and brutal weather. But he’s not backing off. “Alaska, Canada, Norway, Sweden and Russia all have mines, some very big mines, across the Arctic region,” he said . “These are among the best mines you can find in the world.” Eldur says demand from tech is only going to grow. “We always need new mining areas, or we need to reprocess metal, to have enough metal for the revolution that is coming, which is AI and similar technology.” Greenland’s mining licenses grow but production stays low Right now, there are over 140 active licenses issued in Greenland for mineral exploration. But only two actual mines are operating. One of them is Eldur’s. That gap between interest and action shows how hard it is to get from paperwork to production. Even if the minerals are there, price swings can shut a mine down fast. That’s exactly what happened to the Black Angel mine near Maarmorilik. It produced lead and zinc from 1973 to 1990 and still has reserves left. But when zinc prices dropped, the mine closed and never reopened. That kind of risk makes investors nervous. And it’s why most of Greenland’s minerals are still stuck underground. The island has the third-largest land-based deposit of rare earths on the planet. But no one wants to take the first big step without clear payoffs. Still, with China calling the shots in rare earths and AI putting pressure on global supply chains, interest in Greenland is not going away.

The swift rebound from this level highlights $0.136 as a key short-term support level, with the price quickly reclaiming the $0.137 zone. Since the recovery, DOGE has moved sideways in a tight range between $0.137 and $0.138, indicating market indecision after the volatility. A sustained hold above $0.136–$0.137 keeps the near-term structure stable, while a breakout above $0.138 would signal renewed upside momentum. At press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.1376, down 0.38% over the past 24 hours. Dogecoin Stochastic Hits Oversold Zone, Hinting at Potential Bounce According to analyst Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s daily stochastic indicator slipping into the oversold zone signals that downside momentum may be nearing exhaustion. The stochastic oscillator measures the speed and strength of recent price moves, and when it drops into oversold territory, it suggests selling pressure has become stretched relative to recent ranges. Historically, this condition has often appeared near short-term bottoms for DOGE, especially after a pullback within a broader consolidation or recovery phase. DOGE 1-day price chart, Source: X From a technical perspective, Trader Tardigrade highlights that similar oversold readings in the past have preceded relief bounces or trend resumptions, rather than prolonged declines. While an oversold signal does not guarantee an immediate reversal, it increases the likelihood of stabilization as sellers lose control and buyers step in. In this context, the current stochastic setup suggests a potential rebound phase if the price confirms with follow-through and improving momentum in the coming sessions. Dogecoin Price Stalls Near $0.138 as Bearish Trend Persists Dogecoin has remained in a sustained downtrend on the daily timeframe, sliding from the mid-$0.20 region toward the current $0.137–$0.138 area. The chart shows a consistent pattern of lower highs and lower lows, with each recovery attempt capped below previous resistance levels around $0.16 and $0.15. While price has recently stabilized near $0.1377, this move still sits well below prior breakdown zones, indicating the broader bearish structure remains intact. DOGE 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands show price trading near the lower band, with the lower band at $0.120 and the middle 20-day moving average around $0.139, highlighting continued downside pressure and weak volatility expansion. Price remains below the mid-band, which acts as dynamic resistance. On the momentum side, the MACD is close to the zero line, with the MACD line at 0.00133 and the signal line at 0.00149, resulting in a marginally negative histogram.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 14:26:18

RWA.xyz. data revealed that Solana’s distributed real-world asset value has increased to $1.12 billion, up 18.84% over the previous 30 days, driven by significant capital inflows into tokenized assets. RWA involvement is also growing with 134,656 holders, or an 18.20% monthly increase. The 30-day RWA transfer volume reached $1.73 billion, a 30.02% increase from the previous month, indicating that activity is still strong, according to RWA.xyz.

It's time to accelerate. pic.twitter.com/wx2ycBHU13 — Solana (@solana) January 15, 2026 On-chain data show that RWA’s value was below $100 million for much of the first half of 2024, then increased steadily through March and June. In September of the same year, Solana’s RWA growth began to change when TVL reached $200 million, signalling the first major capital deployment wave. In late 2024, momentum took a brief break. As of March 2025, DefiLiama revealed that RWA TVL had grown to over $350 million. Between June and September of the same year, RWA TVL increased from over $450 million to over $700 million. At last, in December 2025, Solana surpassed $800 million and then exceeded $1 billion. Solana’s RWA growth from 2024 up to date represents the growing institutional and on-chain demand for tokenized assets on the network, capping a consistent year-long ascent. Treasuries, private credit, and funds are now settling digitally, with tokenized U.S. Treasuries, such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Ondo’s OUSG, leading the way. Data from RWA.xyz revealed that BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund led investment of Solana’s RWA with around $205.3 million, PRIME held approximately $201.3 million, and Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield, in third place, held around $175.6 million. Additionally, OnRe Tokenized Reinsurance Fund held $86 million, and Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund had about $71.2 million.

Source: RWA.xyz The Solana metrics revealed that these top holders held a substantial share of the $1.12 billion in total value locked, indicating strong institutional confidence in Solana’s RWA. Investors drive Solana’s market amid price stability, TVL growth The Solana RWA ecosystem , surpassing $1 billion in TVL, has led to SOL’s price stabilizing, suggesting the possibility of additional gains if SOL holds key support levels. Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $143.72, up 0.81% from the previous day. Solana’s price range has been between $140.5 and $145.4, suggesting comparatively low daily trading volume. According to CoinGecko data, Solana has grown by 5.1% over the last seven days, 9.8% in the previous fourteen, and 16.1% over the last 30 days, indicating a strong medium-term recovery. However, despite Solana’s recent gains, investor activity in U.S. Solana spot ETFs showed uneven flows, suggesting a cautious attitude among institutional and retail funds. On January 16, data from Farside Investors showed that Solana spot ETFs saw a net outflow of $2.2 million. According to the data, 21 Shares TSOL recorded a net outflow of $700,000, and Grayscale GSOL reached a net outflow of $1.9 million.

His message, directed at XRP and crypto holders, warned that events unfolding in Switzerland could shape the future of global liquidity. He said next week’s World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos would pit two competing visions of money against each other. The video focused on central banks, U.S. policy shifts, and a growing divide between public and private financial rails. These themes connect directly to XRP’s role in cross-border settlement and interoperability. LISTEN CLOSELY $XRP AND CRYPTO HOLDERS This is The Battle for the Future of Money. The BIS is pushing programmable CBDCs. Trump is sending the largest U.S. delegation in Davos history to block it. What happens next week could reshape global liquidity forever btw.… pic.twitter.com/Ow87O4XTbN — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 15, 2026 Project Agora and the BIS Agenda In the video, X Finance Bull described Project Agora as a key initiative launched by the Bank for International Settlements in April 2024. He said it brought together seven major central banks, including the Federal Reserve New York branch, the ECB, and the Bank of England, alongside more than 40 global commercial banks. According to the video, Project Agora aims to create a unified programmable ledger for tokenized wholesale money with fast cross-border settlement. He said smart contracts would be embedded directly into money, adding, “They call it efficiency. Everyone else calls it the cage.” He described Agora as a base layer that could later extend into retail CBDCs, raising the stakes for assets like XRP. U.S. Policy Shift Under Trump He also focused on the sharp policy turn following Donald Trump’s return to office in January 2025. The speaker said Trump signed an executive order banning any U.S. federal agency from creating or promoting a CBDC . He described CBDCs as “a direct threat to freedom and dollar sovereignty.” This move halted a clear U.S. path within Project Agora. X Finance Bull noted that the New York Fed remained involved at a research level, but without authority to issue a digital dollar. He contrasted this with support for private crypto, stablecoins, and a Bitcoin strategic reserve . For XRP, this policy environment aligns with Ripple’s emphasis on private sector infrastructure that integrates with existing banks rather than replacing them with state-issued digital cash.

He said Trump would attend in person with senior cabinet officials. He claimed Europe and the U.K. continue to advance programmable systems to set global standards. He said, “Either Agora stays a limited wholesale experiment, or the split becomes permanent.” That split places U.S.-led private crypto rails against European-controlled programmable systems.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.449194. By 2032, DOGE might touch $0.92203 with an average trading price of $0.886567. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

The cryptocurrency lost 0.72% of its value. The DOGE coin has support around the $0.132 level. As of January 17, 2026, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a sustained downward trend. The memecoin’s value slipped to $0.137 today, marking a 0.72% decline from yesterday’s closing price of $0.138. This situation suggests a bearish market sentiment as the asset continues to shed value; however, the coin may find support near the $0.132 zone as it trends toward that level. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day chart for Dogecoin indicates a bearish trend with selling pressure continuing for the coin. The memecoin’s price decreased to $0.137 today. Red candlesticks on the chart shows the continuation of selling momentum. Negative sentiment is currently rising, as the altcoin is losing once again. DOGE/USD 1-day price chart.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.157, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.120. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the central neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 48 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a sell indication as it moves downwards, as the overall market sentiment is negative as of now. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis Buying momentum returns below the SMA, which is evident from green candlesticks, as bulls are trying to take the lead. The DOGE/USD pair is facing decreased volatility as it approaches the $0.137 level. This decreased volatility signals less volatile price movements in the coming hours. Buying momentum is currently pushing the DOGE price toward the local resistance of $0.142. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding current market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.137 in the past 24 hours. If sellers keep dominating the market, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and retest the $0.132 support. Conversely, if the bullish trend revives, the meme coin may jump toward the $0.142 resistance zone. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.26006–$0.330985 level by 2027. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.137 over the last 24 hours as sellers successfully forced buyers to exit. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2026? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.295522 in 2026. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2029. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin near $1 by 2032. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 4231.11 DOGE in January; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading below its average price of the last year. Currently, the coin is trading below the previous year’s peak price of $0.434, which was observed in January 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $0.92203 mark by 2032, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214. At the start of October, Doge was trading above $0.21, and at the start of November, it hovered near $0.187. By the end of December, the price of Dogecoin declined toward $0.122. At the start of 2026, Dogecoin is trending near $0.118, as the current Doge sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 14:40:39

The president has made it clear since before he won the election again that he does not like Jerome Powell, neither as a person nor as the head of the most powerful central bank on the planet. “He’s frequently expressed his disappointment with Chair Powell,” Scott said during his appearance on Kudlow. Right now, Powell is facing a criminal investigation . The Department of Justice is looking into whether he lied to Congress about the massive renovation project going on at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington. Scott didn’t defend him. “I don’t know anything about construction, seemingly not many people at the Fed do,” he said. That was his entire take. Brutal and blunt. Scott calls for overhaul as Powell investigation heats up The Treasury Secretary admitted he doesn’t have much information about the case, but he used the opportunity to drag the Fed for how it operates. He said the place “needs a lot of work.” Then he doubled down. “It does need a thorough overhaul,” he told Larry Kudlow. According to Scott, the Federal Reserve affects every American, but there’s “no accountability” inside that building. He said this scandal might finally push his long-standing demand for an internal investigation. “I’ve been calling for an internal investigation or an internal review of all this, so perhaps this will push that idea along,” Scott said. This isn’t just about drywall and plumbing anymore. It’s turned into a war over who controls monetary policy. Powell made his own statement . “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” he said in a video. But that didn’t stop the firestorm. Trump, a longtime Powell critic, has threatened to fire him before. He’s accused Powell of acting politically, even though the role of Fed Chair is supposed to be nonpartisan. This time, the problem is bigger than just politics. A criminal charge could remove Powell permanently. Scott was also asked about who might take over. He confirmed the final round of interviews is done. But Trump isn’t telling him much. “President Trump hasn’t shared his thoughts with me,” he said. “What I can tell you is he’s been very deliberate. He has asked exactly the questions that I think you and I and the markets would want to ask.” Kevin Hassett had been seen as a top contender to replace Powell. But Trump made it clear that’s off the table. “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,” he told Hassett directly at the White House. That pretty much ended Hassett’s chances. Scott confirmed it. “If that’s the president’s prerogative, then so be it,” he said. As far as who gets the job, it’s still anyone’s guess. “Only the president knows. … It’s his prerogative. He has been thinking about this almost since day one of Trump 2.0,” Scott said. The decision is expected in January. Scott said he thinks it’ll happen “either before he leaves for Davos or when he returns.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Economy|Federal Reserve|Treasury Department|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 14:45:08

According to the bill, House Bill 3545, AI systems will be barred from being granted personhood under state or federal law. Artificial intelligence systems have been in the news lately after the xAI chatbot Grok was being used by some users to create intimate pictures of women and children without consent. The move has caused several leaders across countries to speak out, with most of them criticizing the platform and its owner, Elon Musk. House Bill 3545 will look to cover aspects like that in Oklahoma, with the bill barring its use for deepfakes of any kind. Oklahoma lawmaker submits three AI regulations House Bill 3545 is expected to have more applications at the state government level compared to the federal level. It will restrict government use of artificial intelligence for discriminatory classification systems, biometric surveillance, and the creation of deepfakes. In addition, any AI recommendations would require thorough human review before they are implemented, and agencies in Oklahoma would also need to take part in an annual statewide AI report. House Bill 3545 also aims to protect young Oklahoma residents from AI systems like chatbots. If passed, it would prohibit the deployment of a “social AI companion” to minors in Oklahoma, and the use of an AI chatbot would require age certification measures. In addition, the Oklahoma bill has an exception for therapeutic AI tools, highlighting that users can be allowed to use them provided they are used with professional oversight. While the Oklahoma bill seeks to address the most important issues in the artificial intelligence industry today, it is coming after a federal executive order signed by United States President Donald Trump in December 2025. The executive order sought to block states from enforcing their AI laws, keeping them under federal control. He also created a litigation Task Force that would challenge state AI laws that conflict with federal rules. Meanwhile, California Attorney General Rob Bonta has issued a cease-and-desist order to artificial intelligence company xAI, demanding that the business stop generating offensive deepfake images through its Grok chatbot. The order was issued in response to Grok being used to create unlawful and offensive content, which primarily revolves around nonconsensual adult photographs. He argued that it is illegal to create, distribute, and display CSAM. California is not the only region targeting xAI and its Grok chatbot. India recently called on the company and its executives to check the activities of the chatbot. It highlighted the harm it was doing to women and society at large. The country also has the platform as an ultimatum to ensure a safeguard is developed to combat this menace. On the other hand, Indonesia has announced sanctions on the chatbot, suspending its usage in the country. The country noted that using the chatbot to create fake pornography amounts to a form of digital violence. “The government views non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and citizens’ security in the digital space,” the country said at the time. Meanwhile, blogging platform X has released a statement noting that image generation on the platform has now been limited to only verified users. “We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” the X Safety account said on Wednesday. “This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” Don’t just read crypto news.

Analysts Compare 3 Cheap Altcoins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-under-0-1-analysts-compare-3-cheap-altcoins/,"The low-cost sector of the crypto market has been alive once again as investors search assets with greater upside prospects into 2026. Although large caps continue to dominate the largest portion of the liquidity, several analysts state that the highest percentage returns will be made by the less priced tokens that occupy the early stages of their growth curves. Analysts are now comparing three cheap altcoins under $0.01: Dogecoin, Pepecoin and a new lending protocol called Mutuum Finance . Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is also one of the most familiar meme coins in the crypto industry. DOGE is listed in the low twenties and its market value is approximately $24 billion. DOGE has continued to gain interest at the meme rallies, and price behavior is more restrained than during the last bull run. According to the analysts, key areas of resistance exist between $0.20 and $0.25 which still limit upward movements. DOGE would need high capital inflows to gain entrance to such levels because it has a large market size. There are predictions of relatively low growth out of the present, and traders perceive DOGE as a slugger nowadays as opposed to an upside targeting propulsion. Pepecoin (PEPE) One of the largest meme-related rushes of 2025 was associated with Pepecoin, and it drew substantial volumes of social sites and stock exchanges. PEPE is presently trading in the low micro-unit range, and they have a market cap of approximately $2.5 billion. The token enjoyed a positive wave of online publicity and fast onboarding in the period of its most intense growth. But now PEPE has the trouble of slowing pace. Technical charts indicate that there is strong resistance in the areas as per the previous rejection levels and analysts observe declining trend strength. PEPE could be languishing in a sideway trend without a new catalyst or a new story. PEPE price prediction models indicate subdued returns and some of the models only anticipate slight returns by 2026 unless the sentiment shifts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The third altcoin that is being featured occupies a different category. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a forthcoming crypto project that is creating a lending protocol that will enable individuals to provide and request assets using smart contracts on becoming functional. It relies on yield, collateral and formatted borrowing activity as opposed to relying on memes or social hype. MUTM is yet to reach its early pricing stage. The token is sold at $0.04 at Phase 7 of its organized sale. Based on project statistics, over $19.7 million have been collected and over 18,800 holders have already taken positions. Over 825 million tokens are already purchased among the total supply of 4 billion and 45.5% already is allocated to the full presale. The certain launch price of MUTM is fixed at $0.06. The Reason Why MUTM is Preferred by Analysts Dogecoin enjoys a huge market capital. With that scale, DOGE is finding it hard to generate swift percentage returns. Meme assets experience another problem of failing to repeat their initial blow-off tops since already a majority of the story has been priced. Pepecoin does not have this problem. Its issue is narrative exhaustion. It is true that PEPE will not excite the same speculative flows that fuelled its initial torrent unless a new story or catalyst emerges. Mutuum Finance is still at an early build phase that has additional space to explore. Utility assets are typically repriced when they are used. Analysts refer to MUTM as a cheap form of entry into a future lending protocol whose revenue mechanics are such that they may be utilized with long-term participation. mtTokens will reflect deposits and yield. When there is a buy and distribute mechanic, some percentage of protocol revenue will be spent to purchase MUTM on the open market and sent back to stakers. To use a straightforward example, an equivalent amount in $850 would have gone in very different ways on these assets. An investment of $850 on DOGE or PEPE might yield small returns because of the size and story constraints. The same amount of money, or $850 on MUTM at $0.04 will purchase 21,250 tokens. Assuming that analysts who forecasted a range of $0.40-$0.50 are accurate by the year 2027, the position would move to a larger multiples that are produced by utility and adoption. They are indicative of why rotation behavior is shaping around early-stage assets rather than the mature meme coins. Security Preparation Protocol Launch One of the drivers of MUTM is the protocol launch that is coming. Based on the official X version, V1 protocol is going to deploy testnet before mainnet. The price discovery of lending platforms is likely to occur when the data on collateral and repayment and borrowing is revealed on-chain. Security has also been included in the arrangement. V1 codebase has undergone a Halborn Security audit . CertiK rated the MUTM token at 90 out of 100 in Token Scan. In the area of bug bounty, they have an active program of $50,000 that is in operation to find flaws until mainnet. With investors considering what crypto to purchase under $0.1 as the year 2026 approaches, analysts are gravitating towards utility-based models rather than the meme-based volatility. Mutuum Finance has now been placed at nearly the number one spot in that watchlist.

On Thursday, the account began reposting mostly cryptocurrency content and posts about Maduro’s capture in Venezuela. The remaining posts on the page were all reposts from the @Bitcoin account on X. Hackers promote crypto on the stolen page The scammers changed the handle of the verified MKE – Milwaukee Airport X page. The hacked account is now called @TheHodaLaw, featuring the Hoda Law Firm in its profile picture and a cover photo that links to the Hoda website. The scammers even pinned a message warning of crypto fraud and promising to help victims recover their funds. The message included a strong call to action, followed by a private message button. The official website of Milwaukee airport had a link that directed users to a “This Account Doesn’t Exist” page on X. The real X account handle was @mitchellairport. Harold Mester, public affairs director for Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport, told WISN 12 News that they reported the issue to X and are waiting for access to be restored. Mester said their security team is reviewing the situation and might contact law enforcement if needed. The real Hoda Law Firm responds The Hoda Law Firm, whose name appeared on the suspected hacked page, responded to local news outlets. Marshal Hoda, the owner of the law firm, said he does not know what occurred. The law firm, located in Texas, focuses on recovering funds from crypto scams. It had filed lawsuits on behalf of victims of crypto scams against foreign hackers. Hoda concluded that an opponent might have done this. He said, “This has nothing to do with our firm and urge everyone to stay away — these are presumably scammers trying to trade on my firm’s hard-earned reputation to take more money from scam victims.” The firm’s homepage added a warning about the impersonation incident. Cybersecurity researchers advise users against interacting with the hacked page until the issue is resolved. Source: The Hoda Law Firm website . Crypto hackers continue to target major X accounts Over the years, crypto hackers have taken over many verified X accounts to spread Bitcoin scams. In December, the X account of SimpleX Chat was hacked. The hackers used the compromised account to push a fake site that tricks users into linking their crypto wallets. SimpleX reported that the attackers used the “delegate” feature on X to give third-party profiles posting rights on business accounts. The hacker joined the @SimpleXChat account. Soon after, a post appeared promoting a fake program named “Perpetuals Early Access” with a link to a fake website. The post invited users to join as founding members of a permanent communication network. The aim was to get users to click a “Connect Wallet” button, copying legitimate Web3 projects. SimpleX restored access to the X account. Community members reported the fake post before it was deleted. Evgeny Poberezkin, the founder of SimpleX, said the attackers blocked his personal account during the breach to prevent public warnings.

The premier cryptocurrency recorded a price ascent of about 9%, reaching a high of over $97,000 and falling just short of its past six-figure valuation. Interestingly, a recent on-chain revelation shows that an underlying change was simultaneously taking place as the price of Bitcoin soared on the charts. Are The BTC Bulls Back In Control? In a January 16 post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Darkfost revealed a notable shift in the on-chain power dynamics, saying that the bulls are seemingly back in control. The relevant indicator here is the BTC Net Taker Volume, which tracks which of the buyers or sellers is more aggressive in the market. The metric does so by measuring the net difference between buy and sell market orders executed on derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Free From The Current Range — $107,000 Now The Level To Watch Before this recent shift, the net taker volume had fallen into deep negative territory, reaching a bottom of about –$489 million. Due to the lack of demand in the market over that period, the price of BTC continued to fall as selling pressure grew. However, this market scenario has shifted, as of Friday, January 16th. The Bitcoin Net Taker Volume now records a positive reading, with more than $39 million in buy-side volume from the futures market. This means BTC traders are becoming increasingly interested in opening long positions — and aggressively at that. Historically, an increasing buying interest among participants of the futures market typically signals rising bullish sentiment. In turn, upward price pressure increases through leverage, leading to amplified short-term price moves if sustained. Bitcoin Market Outlook Darkfost further explained that, although there are signs that Bitcoin ETF inflows might be picking up slightly, it remains that spot buying is yet to gain enough strength to sponsor a decisive bullish move. As a result, all eyes fall on derivatives activity, as it currently serves as support for the Bitcoin price. Ultimately, the present scenario is best interpreted as the end of bearish pressure, rather than a blatant structure shift. However, in the event that net taker volume continues to grow positively, the narrative could shift from dwindling bearish pressure to mounting bullish momentum. Till then, market participants are advised to deal cautiously until it is confirmed that the derivatives-sponsored momentum is sustainable for the flagship cryptocurrency’s growth. As of press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at about $95,357, with insignificant movement over the past day.

The price structure is constructive, and on-chain activity via active addresses is breaking higher, which is a positive backdrop. Yet, ETH is doing all of this right under resistance, so the next few days should decide whether we get a clean breakout or another rejection back into the range. Ethereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH has bounced cleanly from the green demand zone around $2.7K mark and pushed back into the key supply area at $3.3–$3.5K. This zone lines up with the 100-day moving average, while the 200-day moving average is sitting higher as the next dynamic resistance. As long as the price holds above the $3K area, the structure remains a series of higher lows pointing to accumulation rather than distribution. A decisive daily close above the $3.5K mark would also open the door toward the psychological $4K level, while losing the $3K zone would likely send ETH back toward the $2.7K support block. ETH/USDT 4-Hour Chart On the 4H, ETH has been trading within a symmetrical triangle, formed by higher lows and lower highs. However, it has recently broken the pattern to the upside, and is now testing the blue resistance band around $3.3–$3.4K. The last push into that zone came with an overbought RSI signal, which explains the current sideways/pullback behavior. In the short-term, the local support around the $3K zone and the rising trendline just below, near the $2.9K level, should be watched. As long as those hold, buyers can still stage another breakout attempt above $3.4K. On the other hand, a clean break below the lower trendline would shift momentum back to sellers and put the $2.5K zone back on the table as downside targets. On-Chain Analysis The 30-day moving average of Ethereum active addresses has been trending up since the beginning of this year and has now pushed above the highs of the past year, while the price is still below its prior peaks. This massive surge in active addresses usually points to improving organic usage and network demand, which often supports uptrends after periods of consolidation. At the same time, spikes in activity right under resistance have occasionally coincided with local tops when price fails to follow through. So if active addresses stay elevated or keep rising while ETH finally clears $3.5K, it would strongly support a new leg higher; if activity rolls over while price keeps stalling here, it would argue for a deeper cool-off back into the lower support zones.

Despite short‑term weakness, Ripple’s token is showing resilience at the $2.0702 support zone, where buyers have stepped in to defend key levels. This stabilization comes as traders weigh both technical signals and broader sentiment across the crypto market. Golden Cross Sparks Bullish Momentum XRP formed its first golden cross of 2026, a bullish technical event where the 23‑day moving average crossed above the 50‑day moving average. Historically, this pattern signals a shift toward upward momentum. XRP/USD Golden Cross – Source: Tradingview As long as XRP holds above the $2.02–$2.03 support band, the bullish setup remains intact. Traders are now watching the $2.28–$2.35 resistance zone, where the 200‑day EMA sits as a major hurdle. Current price: $2.0725 Key support: $2.02–$2.07 Resistance levels: $2.28–$2.35, $2.70 RSI: 47.92, showing early bullish divergence XRP Price Forecast: Support Holds at $2.07 as Triangle Pattern Signals Breakout The 4‑hour chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, typically bearish, but recent price action suggests a potential bullish divergence. RSI has crossed above its moving average, hinting at building momentum. A bullish engulfing candle near $2.0415 adds weight to the case for upside. If XRP breaks above $2.1126 with volume confirmation, targets include $2.1837 and $2.2721, with a move beyond $2.2726 opening the door to a retest of the $2.30–$2.35 range. XRP/USD Price Outlook for Traders Despite volatility, XRP’s golden cross and triangle setup provide a clear roadmap. A daily close above $2.10 could accelerate gains toward $2.35, while holding above support strengthens the case for a rally toward $2.70. With crypto sentiment stabilizing, XRP offers a compelling opportunity for traders and presale participants seeking momentum in early 2026. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview XRP price prediction is likely to be bullish if it breaks above $2.1126 with volume confirmation, it could target the 0.382 retracement at $2.1837, followed by the 0.236 level at $2.2721. A move beyond $2.2726 would invalidate the triangle’s bearish bias and open the door to a retest of the $2.30–$2.35 range. Traders should watch for a clean breakout above the triangle’s upper trendline and monitor RSI for continued divergence. With broader crypto sentiment stabilizing and XRP showing technical resilience, this setup could offer a compelling entry for presale participants looking to ride momentum toward higher levels in Q1 2026.

A Move Is About to Happen,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-take-a-look-at-xrp-on-the-hourly-a-move-is-about-to-happen/,"XRP has reached a point where price compression and market structure demand attention. After several sessions of controlled consolidation, volatility has narrowed, and directional pressure continues to build. Traders monitoring short-term timeframes increasingly expect resolution as XRP trades within clearly defined technical boundaries. That expectation was reinforced by crypto analyst Bird (@Bird_XRPL), who highlighted the hourly XRP/USD chart as evidence that a decisive move could occur before the end of the week. His assessment focuses on observable price structure and measured move dynamics rather than speculation. Ascending Channel Reflects Accumulation On the hourly chart referenced by Bird, XRP continues to trade within a rising ascending channel. Price has consistently formed higher lows from recent swing bottoms, while sellers have failed to force a breakdown below channel support. This behavior signals steady demand entering the market and suggests accumulation rather than distribution. Take a look at $XRP on the hourly. A move is about to happen before the end of the week. A measured move if we send upwards could push us straight to that $2.69 mark which finally gets us into 'bullrun' mode. BIRD IS READY. pic.twitter.com/BYNwNWm3kX — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 16, 2026 Ascending channels often reflect controlled bullish conditions. Buyers gradually push prices higher while allowing brief pullbacks that reset momentum. As long as XRP holds this structure, downside risk remains defined and contained. Measured Move Targets the $2.69 Level Bird’s outlook centers on a measured move projection derived from the most recent impulse off local lows. By applying that range to a potential breakout point near the top of the channel, the projected target aligns near $2.69. This level also carries technical relevance, as it sits near prior reaction zones that previously influenced price behavior. A breakout supported by volume would validate this projection. Without confirmation, the scenario remains conditional, but the technical framework supports the possibility of upward continuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why $2.69 Could Shift Market Sentiment The $2.69 region represents more than a short-term target. A sustained move into this zone would place XRP above several recent consolidation ranges, altering short-term market structure. Traders often interpret such moves as the transition from consolidation into expansion. From a momentum perspective, reclaiming higher price territory increases confidence among participants and can attract additional liquidity, reinforcing bullish continuation. Short-Term Context Favors Resolution XRP continues to hold key higher-timeframe support levels , and recent pullbacks have failed to produce lower lows. This broader context allows bullish setups on lower timeframes to develop without immediate structural invalidation. As the weekend progresses, XRP’s interaction with channel resistance will likely determine direction. If buyers maintain pressure, a move toward $2.69 becomes technically plausible. If resistance holds, consolidation may extend, but the current structure suggests that indecision is nearing its end.

However, that has changed since then, and green continues to dominate. In this article, we will review what happened to the financial products last week and how XRP’s price responded. ETF Green Streak Back on Track CryptoPotato reported last weekend about the end of the streak, which saw more than $40 million being pulled out of the XRP funds on January 7, just a day after the asset topped $2.40 for the first time in months. However, the landscape changed by the end of that week, and the financial products actually ended it in the green, with net inflows of $38.07 million. The past trading week was dominated by the buyers once again. $15.04 million entered the funds on Monday, followed by $12.98 million on Tuesday, $10.63 million on Wednesday, $17.06 million on Thursday, and a more modest $1.12 million on Friday, according to data from SoSoValue. Consequently, the all-green week ended with total net inflows of $56.84 million. The market leader, Canary Capital’s XRPC, remains ahead, but the gap has narrowed. The cumulative inflows into XRPC stand at $397.04 million, while Bitwise’s XRP has climbed to $310.48 million. Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ ($288.08 million) and Grayscale’s GXRP ($287.18 million) are next. 21Shares’ TOXR remains the only one in the red, with total net outflows of $7.77 million. XRP’s Price Update Despite these impressive numbers and yet another week with only net inflows, the underlying asset’s price has failed to capitalize. XRP trades with a minor decline of 1% since last Saturday and is well below $2.10 as of press time. Moreover, it lost the fourth position in terms of market cap to BNB, which is up by more than 4% weekly. Nevertheless, analysts remain bullish, indicating that XRP’s bounce is simply loading now. Others have outlined some mind-blowing price predictions of $10 per token as soon as this month, but AI and common sense tell a different story. The positive news is that whales have returned, purchasing more than 50 million tokens in the past week, in stark contrast to their selling spree that began in October, when they disposed of billions of coins in a few months.

By the end of 2025, money tied to metal and mining exchange-traded funds climbed past $750 billion, according to data from Critical Minerals Institute. That $750 billion sits inside metal and mining ETFs worldwide. Christopher Berlet, President and Chief Investment Officer of MineralFunds.com, said the number tracks real allocations. ETF assets jump as gold and silver pull in capital Christopher said 2025 marked the third year MineralFunds published its annual ETF report. By year end, the firm tracked 249 metal and mining ETFs. He said assets crossed $750 billion twice in December. The first break came early in the month. The second came around December 20. Assets dipped briefly at year end, then bounced back fast. “That’s three-quarters of a trillion dollars in metal and mining ETF assets,” Christopher said. Total assets across the sector rose about 117% during 2025. Precious metals drove most of that rise. Christopher said the firm tracks 79 gold ETFs worldwide. Together, those funds now hold more than $500 billion. Silver grew even faster. Assets tied to silver ETFs rose from about $25 billion to $75 billion by year end. That marked a 200% increase in one year. Christopher said the key signal came from rising shares outstanding. “That shows capital allocations increasing to the sector,” he said. That trend showed growing demand for exposure to minerals through ETFs. Exchanges and ETF structure are changing the supply and demand of critical minerals Christopher said the location of ETF assets surprised many people. Canada has a strong mining image, but it does not dominate ETF capital. He said the New York Stock Exchange, mainly NYSE Arca, and the London Stock Exchange together host about 75% of all assets across the 249 ETFs.NYSE Arca alone holds about 55% of global assets. Meanwhile, metal ETFs make up for about 85% of total assets, and mining-company ETFs hold about 12%, equal to roughly $70 billion, while hedged and leveraged products make up the remaining 3%. Inside metal ETFs, concentration remains heavy, with gold and silver together representing about 95% of metal ETF assets. Platinum group metals, critical minerals, and industrial metals each sit around 2% or less. Christopher said issuance data matters more than price charts. During 2025, nine new ETFs launched. Five came from Canada, after a wave of launches in India and China the year before. He said the stronger signal came from share creation inside existing funds. “The biggest indicator for us is the growth in the number of shares outstanding, which tells you more about capital flows than price changes.” He said asset managers are pushing deeper into the space. Fees are rising. New products are appearing across Asia. He also said ETF demand affects physical supply. When someone buys a metal ETF, what they’re really getting is the actual metal, locked up in storage. That same metal could’ve gone to a battery maker or a steel plant, but now it’s sitting in a vault because it’s tied to an ETF. That’s how these funds are soaking up physical supply. Over time, this has pulled money away from digging up new supply. Less money is going into exploration, fewer discoveries are being made, and supply is getting tighter.

Australian lawyer Bill Morgan, a prominent figure in digital asset law, asserts the case cannot be reopened under established U.S. legal principles. This declaration comes amid growing scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers questioning regulatory decisions involving multiple crypto firms. The legal landscape surrounding XRP and other digital assets continues to evolve, with this latest clarification providing crucial stability for market participants. The Ripple Lawsuit: A Case of Legal Finality Legal professionals emphasize the principle of res judicata as the cornerstone of this situation. This fundamental doctrine prevents parties from re-litigating matters that courts have already decided with final judgments. The Ripple lawsuit concluded last year with a decisive victory for the blockchain company. Consequently, the judicial system considers this matter settled permanently. Legal experts universally recognize res judicata as essential for judicial efficiency and certainty. Furthermore, this principle maintains consistency in legal outcomes across similar cases. The application of this doctrine to high-profile cryptocurrency cases establishes important precedents for future regulatory actions. Bill Morgan specifically addressed recent political criticism in his analysis. Some Democratic members of Congress have questioned the SEC’s decision-making process. These lawmakers allege potential connections between dropped cases and political contributions. However, Morgan clarifies that such political discussions cannot override established legal procedures. The legal system operates independently from political debates about regulatory approaches. This separation ensures consistent application of justice regardless of changing political climates. Legal analysts note this distinction protects both companies and investors from regulatory uncertainty. Political Context and Regulatory Scrutiny The political dimension adds complexity to cryptocurrency regulation discussions. Republican-led House committees have faced criticism from Democratic members regarding multiple enforcement decisions. These criticisms extend beyond the Ripple lawsuit to include cases involving Kraken, Binance, and Coinbase. Lawmakers express concerns about regulatory consistency and potential influences on enforcement priorities. However, legal experts distinguish between political oversight and judicial processes. Political committees can investigate regulatory decisions without affecting closed legal cases. This separation maintains the integrity of both legislative oversight and judicial finality. Expert Analysis on Legal Precedents Legal scholars highlight several key precedents supporting case finality. The U.S. judicial system has consistently upheld res judicata across diverse legal domains. This consistency applies equally to traditional finance and emerging digital asset cases. Historical examples demonstrate courts rarely reopen properly concluded cases. Exceptions require extraordinary circumstances like fraud or procedural errors. No evidence suggests such exceptions apply to the Ripple lawsuit resolution. Legal databases show overwhelming support for maintaining judicial finality in commercial litigation. This stability benefits all market participants by providing predictable legal environments. The cryptocurrency industry particularly benefits from legal certainty. Market volatility often increases during regulatory uncertainty periods. Clear legal outcomes help stabilize digital asset markets and encourage institutional participation. The Ripple lawsuit conclusion provided such clarity for XRP and related projects. Reopening settled cases would undermine this hard-won market stability. Legal experts warn against creating precedents that could destabilize regulatory frameworks. Consistent application of established legal principles supports healthy market development. Comparative Analysis: Crypto Enforcement Patterns Recent SEC enforcement actions reveal evolving regulatory approaches. The table below illustrates key cases mentioned in political discussions: Company Case Status Primary Allegations Resolution Date Ripple Labs Closed (Ripple victory) Unregistered securities offering 2023 Kraken Settled Unregistered securities exchange 2023 Coinbase Ongoing Unregistered exchange operations Binance Settled Multiple regulatory violations 2024 Legal analysts identify several important patterns in these enforcement actions. First, resolution methods vary significantly across different cases. Second, settlement terms reflect each company’s specific circumstances and cooperation levels. Third, the SEC appears to prioritize different violation types across enforcement cycles. These variations naturally lead to political questions about consistency. However, legal experts note that case-specific factors legitimately produce different outcomes. The judicial system accommodates these nuances while maintaining overall legal principles. Impact on Cryptocurrency Regulation Framework The Ripple lawsuit outcome influences broader regulatory discussions in several ways: Legal Precedent: Establishes important boundaries for securities law application to digital assets Market Certainty: Provides clearer guidelines for cryptocurrency projects and investors Regulatory Approach: Influences how agencies approach enforcement against emerging technologies International Implications: Affects how other jurisdictions view U.S. cryptocurrency regulation Innovation Balance: Helps define the space between consumer protection and technological development Legal experts emphasize that case finality supports regulatory evolution. Clear precedents allow regulators to develop more nuanced approaches. They can focus resources on areas requiring attention rather than revisiting settled matters. This efficiency benefits both regulators and regulated entities. The cryptocurrency industry particularly needs this regulatory clarity to mature responsibly. Market participants can make informed decisions based on stable legal interpretations. The Role of Legal Commentary in Public Understanding Expert legal analysis plays a crucial role in public discourse. Lawyers like Bill Morgan help translate complex legal concepts for broader audiences. Their commentary bridges gaps between judicial processes, regulatory actions, and public understanding. This translation is especially important for technically complex areas like cryptocurrency regulation. Clear explanations of principles like res judicata prevent misinformation spread. They also help distinguish between legitimate political oversight and impractical suggestions. The legal community provides this essential service through various channels including media commentary and academic publications. Conclusion The Ripple lawsuit represents a concluded chapter in cryptocurrency regulation history. Legal principles of finality properly prevent case reopening despite political questions. This outcome provides necessary stability for digital asset markets and regulatory frameworks. The application of res judicata to high-profile cryptocurrency cases establishes valuable precedents. These precedents will guide future regulatory interactions with emerging technologies. Market participants should understand that properly concluded cases remain closed under U.S. law. This understanding allows focus on current regulatory developments rather than revisiting settled matters. The Ripple lawsuit resolution continues to influence cryptocurrency regulation discussions meaningfully. FAQs Q1: What is res judicata and why does it matter for the Ripple lawsuit? Res judicata is a legal principle preventing re-litigation of finally decided cases. It matters because it makes the Ripple lawsuit outcome permanent and unchangeable through normal legal channels. Q2: Can political pressure actually reopen a closed legal case? No, political pressure cannot reopen properly concluded legal cases. The judicial system operates independently from political processes under U.S. constitutional principles. Q3: Why are some lawmakers questioning the SEC’s decisions on crypto cases? Lawmakers question regulatory consistency and potential influences on enforcement priorities. These are legitimate oversight questions but don’t affect closed judicial matters. Q4: How does case finality benefit the cryptocurrency market? Case finality provides regulatory certainty that stabilizes markets, encourages institutional participation, and supports responsible innovation in the cryptocurrency sector. Q5: What exceptions might allow reopening a case like the Ripple lawsuit? Extraordinary circumstances like proven fraud, judicial misconduct, or fundamental procedural errors might allow reopening, but no evidence suggests such exceptions apply here.

This transparent scheduling approach represents a significant evolution in crypto media operations, addressing the market’s 24/7 nature while ensuring sustainable reporting practices. The schedule specifically operates from 10:00 p.m. UTC on Sunday through 3:00 p.m. UTC on Saturday, providing comprehensive coverage during peak trading and development periods across major financial markets. Bitcoin World’s Strategic News Coverage Framework Bitcoin World’s newly outlined schedule reflects careful consideration of global cryptocurrency market patterns and user engagement metrics. The platform maintains continuous coverage for approximately 137 hours weekly, strategically aligning with periods of highest market activity and news generation. This structured approach contrasts with traditional financial media schedules, which typically follow conventional business hours. Cryptocurrency markets operate continuously, creating unique challenges for news organizations attempting to balance comprehensive coverage with operational sustainability. Industry analysts note that this scheduling model addresses several critical aspects of crypto journalism. First, it ensures coverage during Asian, European, and North American trading overlaps. Second, it maintains presence during weekend trading sessions when traditional markets close but cryptocurrency activity continues. Third, the schedule accommodates major protocol upgrades, governance votes, and development announcements that frequently occur outside standard business hours. This operational framework demonstrates Bitcoin World’s commitment to serving the global cryptocurrency community’s information needs while implementing sustainable media practices. Breaking News Protocol During Scheduled Breaks During the designated break period from 3:00 p.m. UTC on Saturday to 10:00 p.m. UTC on Sunday, Bitcoin World implements a selective coverage protocol focused exclusively on major breaking news. This approach balances operational considerations with the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency developments. The platform defines “major breaking news” through specific criteria including market impact, technological significance, regulatory developments, and security events. This selective coverage ensures that truly significant developments receive immediate attention while allowing for necessary operational maintenance and strategic planning. The cryptocurrency industry has witnessed numerous weekend developments that significantly impacted markets and technologies. Historical examples include major exchange announcements, protocol vulnerabilities, regulatory statements, and institutional adoption news. Bitcoin World’s protocol accounts for this reality while establishing clear parameters for weekend coverage. This balanced approach reflects industry best practices for sustainable crypto journalism, acknowledging that while cryptocurrency never sleeps, human-operated news organizations require structured operations to maintain quality and accuracy standards. Operational Considerations for 24/7 Markets Maintaining continuous cryptocurrency news coverage presents unique operational challenges that Bitcoin World’s schedule strategically addresses. The platform must coordinate global reporting teams across multiple time zones while ensuring consistent editorial standards and verification processes. This schedule allows for necessary team coordination, content planning, and technical maintenance while minimizing disruption to readers. Industry experts recognize that sustainable crypto journalism requires such structured approaches, as burnout and operational strain have affected numerous digital asset media ventures attempting true 24/7 coverage without strategic breaks. Comparative analysis reveals that Bitcoin World’s approach aligns with emerging best practices in cryptocurrency media. Several leading platforms have adopted similar structured schedules following initial attempts at completely continuous coverage. These adjustments typically result from practical experience with team management, content quality maintenance, and operational efficiency. The cryptocurrency industry’s global nature necessitates coverage across all time zones, but sustainable operations require strategic planning that balances comprehensive reporting with organizational health. Global Time Zone Considerations and Market Coverage Bitcoin World’s schedule demonstrates sophisticated understanding of global cryptocurrency market dynamics across different regions. The coverage period strategically encompasses Asian market openings, European trading sessions, and North American market hours. This comprehensive approach ensures that readers receive timely information during their respective active trading periods regardless of geographic location. The schedule’s UTC-based timing provides a universal reference point for international audiences while accommodating regional variations through consistent conversion standards. The cryptocurrency ecosystem operates across numerous jurisdictions with varying regulatory frameworks and market characteristics. Bitcoin World’s coverage schedule accounts for these differences by maintaining presence during critical announcement periods for major regions. Asian developments frequently emerge during European late evenings, while North American news often breaks during Asian mornings. The platform’s schedule ensures coverage during these overlapping periods when cross-regional developments typically occur. This strategic timing reflects deep understanding of global cryptocurrency market patterns and information flow dynamics. Historical Context of Crypto Media Evolution Cryptocurrency news coverage has evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009. Early coverage relied primarily on forum discussions and blog posts without formal scheduling or editorial standards. As the industry matured, dedicated media platforms emerged with increasingly professional approaches to news delivery. Bitcoin World’s structured schedule represents the latest evolution in this progression, balancing the immediacy demanded by cryptocurrency markets with the sustainability required for long-term media operations. This development mirrors broader trends in digital media where successful platforms establish clear operational frameworks while maintaining flexibility for exceptional circumstances. The cryptocurrency media landscape now includes numerous specialized platforms with varying coverage approaches. Some focus exclusively on technical developments, while others emphasize market analysis or regulatory news. Bitcoin World’s comprehensive approach positions it within the broader category of general cryptocurrency news providers serving diverse audience segments. The platform’s scheduled coverage model demonstrates recognition that different audience segments have varying information needs throughout the week, from active traders requiring real-time updates to long-term investors seeking comprehensive analysis. Quality Assurance and Editorial Standards Bitcoin World’s scheduled approach supports consistent quality assurance and editorial standards that might prove challenging with completely continuous operations. The designated break periods allow for editorial review, fact-checking processes, and content planning that enhance overall reporting quality. This structured approach contrasts with some cryptocurrency media platforms that prioritize speed over accuracy, sometimes resulting in misinformation propagation. By implementing scheduled operations with clear breaking news protocols, Bitcoin World balances timeliness with verification, addressing a critical concern in cryptocurrency journalism where inaccurate reporting can significantly impact volatile markets. The platform’s operational model incorporates multiple verification layers during active coverage periods while reserving comprehensive review processes for scheduled breaks. This hybrid approach acknowledges cryptocurrency’s fast-moving nature while maintaining journalistic integrity standards. Industry observers note that sustainable crypto media operations increasingly adopt such balanced models, recognizing that completely unstructured continuous coverage often compromises accuracy and depth. Bitcoin World’s schedule reflects this industry learning, implementing a framework that serves readers’ immediate information needs while ensuring long-term reporting quality. Conclusion Bitcoin World’s newly announced weekly news coverage schedule represents a sophisticated approach to cryptocurrency journalism that balances comprehensive market coverage with sustainable operations. The platform’s structured framework ensures continuous reporting during peak activity periods while implementing selective protocols for weekend developments. This model addresses the unique challenges of covering 24/7 digital asset markets while maintaining editorial standards and operational efficiency. As cryptocurrency adoption continues expanding globally, such structured yet flexible coverage approaches will likely become increasingly important for media platforms serving this dynamic industry. Bitcoin World’s schedule demonstrates how cryptocurrency journalism can evolve to meet market demands while establishing sustainable operational practices for long-term success. FAQs Q1: What specific hours does Bitcoin World provide continuous cryptocurrency news coverage? Bitcoin World maintains continuous coverage from 10:00 p.m. UTC on Sunday through 3:00 p.m. UTC on Saturday, totaling approximately 137 hours of weekly reporting during peak market activity periods. Q2: How does Bitcoin World handle major news during its scheduled break periods? The platform implements a selective coverage protocol exclusively for major breaking news during break periods, defined by specific criteria including market impact, technological significance, regulatory developments, and security events that warrant immediate reporting.

Math Translator bridges the gap for cheap, low-energy-curve, 8-bit technology. This technology is only able to deal with basic integers and now Rot8 premium technology for elite 32-bit. It first unlocks the AI5 processor, which is expected to be 40 times more powerful than our hardware today. This is very important in the Tesla Optimus, which features a 2.3 kWh battery, about 1/30th of the Model 3. Using the 32-bit GPU processing, it will consume all this power in under four hours and over 500W just to “think.” Necessity is the mother of invention. The @Tesla_AI team is epicly hardcore. No one can match Tesla’s real-world AI. https://t.co/oJBBL0CFfQ — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 17, 2026 Thus, Tesla reduces the computational power budget below 100W. The “thermal wall” problem has been solved. Now, robots are able to remain in balance and aware for an 8-hour working schedule and not feel hot. Engineers at Tesla incorporate accuracy into the reading of road signs The patent has introduced “Silicon Bridge,” which enables Optimus and FSD systems with superintelligence, without cutting back on their range by a mile or causing their circuits to melt with heat. This turns Tesla’s budget hardware into a supercomputer-class machine. Furthermore, it resolved the forgetting issue. In the former models of the FSD, the vehicle would notice the stop sign, but should the truck obscure its sighting for about 5 seconds, it would “forget” it. Now Tesla uses a “long-context” window, allowing the AI to look back at data from 30 seconds ago or more. However, at greater “distances” in time, standard positional math tends to cause drift. Tesla’s mixed-precision pipeline fixes this by maintaining high positional resolution. This makes sure the AI knows exactly where that occluded stop sign is. This is even after a lot of time has passed moving around it. Indeed, the Tesla team says the RoPE rotations are precise enough for the sign to stay pinned to its 3D coordinate in the car’s mental map. Tesla says it has independence from NVIDIA’s CUDA ecosystem The patent describes a particular method of listening using a Log-Sum-Exp approximation. By remaining in the logarithmic domain, it’s able to manage the great “dynamic range” of sound, from a soft hum to a loud fire truck, using only 8-bit processors without having to “clip” the loud sounds and lose the soft ones. This enables a car to listen and distinguish its environment with 32-bit precision. Tesla employs Quantization-Aware Training, or ‘QAT’. Rather than training AI in a “perfect” 32-bit environment and “shrinking” it afterwards, which usually results in ‘drunk and wrong’ AI, Tesla trains AI from day one on a simulated environment with 8-bit constraints, which essentially unlocks possibilities for implementing Tesla’s AI into something much smaller than a car. Incorporating this mathematics into the silicon gives Tesla its strategic independence as well. Tesla is independent of the CUDA ecosystem of NVIDIA and is in a position to adopt the Dual-Foundry Strategy simultaneously with both Samsung and TSMC. xAI has officially become the first to bring a gigawatt-scale coherent AI training cluster online That’s more electricity than the peak demand of San Francisco While competitors are still drafting roadmaps for 2027, xAI is already operating at major city–level power today The… pic.twitter.com/0YYOC11h6P — X Freeze (@XFreeze) January 17, 2026 xAI’s combination of AI advancements and high-performance computational capabilities makes it a promising competitor to OpenAI’s Stargate, which will be released in 2027.

57247316,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=897146,1768664402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57247316.jpeg,Sei sets mid-2026 deadline to become EVM-only,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sei-network-mid-2026-for-evm-only-chain/,"For the first time since its proposal to abandon the Cosmos ecosystem was approved, the Sei Network has committed to a timeline to finalize its transition into an EVM-only chain by mid-2026. The network is racing to implement what it calls the “Sei Giga” upgrade, and has called upon users who will be affected by this transition to start taking actions to avoid potential losses. Why is Sei Network making a transition? The transition is driven by a proposal known as SIP-3 that was approved by the Sei community last May, which will deprecate the network’s CosmWasm smart contracts and native Cosmos transactions. Sei Network aims to streamline its blockchain by removing hundreds of thousands of lines of code, clearing the path for performance improvements that Sei Labs claims will enable the network to process more than 200,000 transactions per second. Jay Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, the company behind the Sei Network , explained the rationale behind the move on X, writing , “To make something faster, you either have to add power or reduce weight,” he wrote. “To make something a lot faster, you do both.” Jog stated, “In simple terms, that’s what the SIP-3 upgrades will accomplish. They will dissolve Sei’s dual EVM + Co smos architecture and make Sei an EVM-only chain. The code changes for implementing SIP-3, which the Sei ecosystem approved last May, are enormous. We are removing literally hundreds of thousands of lines of code.” When will the Sei Network completely cut off Cosmos support? The technical overhaul has immediate and serious implications for users holding Cosmos-native assets on Sei Network, especially those with USDC via Noble, known as USDC.n, as reported by Cryptopolitan. There’s about $1.4 million worth of USDC.n currently circulating on Sei Network. Sei Labs has asked the holders to convert these assets to native USDC before late March 2026 or risk losing access to their assets. The transition is designed to unfold in three stages. Version 6.3 is expected to launch in January, and it will enable staking functionality through the EVM. Version 6.4 is scheduled for February, and it will disable inbound IBC transfers to the platform. According to Sei Labs, “users will no longer be able to bridge Cosmos-specific tokens such as Atom and USDC.n into Sei Network” when inbound transfer is disabled, as IBC is Cosmos’ native interoperability protocol. A March release, version 6.5, will remove Sei’s native oracle fro m co debase. This will be replaced by established providers, including Chainlink, API3, and Pyth. Users holding USDC.n can swap smaller amounts through decentralized exchanges such as DragonSwap or Symphony, though Sei Labs warns that slippage may vary depending on market conditions. For larger conversions, a migration tool routes USDC.n from Noble through Polygon and back to Sei using Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol version 2. Those with USDC.n deposited in decentralized finance protocols have been advised to unwind their positions promptly. Sei Labs launched its mainnet in 2023 and currently has a market capitalization of around $800 million. In October 2025, Robinhood listed the SEI token, which helped to boost the reach of the asset to retail buyers. Earlier in 2025, Canary Capital filed for the first spot Sei exchange-traded fund with US regulators, though it has not been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which insists on due diligence when it comes to cryptocurrency investment products.

The rebound is supported by improving sentiment, driven in part by founder Vitalik Buterin’s 2026 roadmap, which emphasizes decentralization, privacy, and user control. His vision reassures investors that Ethereum’s long‑term development remains strong, even as short‑term volatility persists. Buterin’s Roadmap Builds Confidence Buterin’s plan focuses on making Ethereum safer and easier to use without reliance on large corporations.

Ethereum Technical Outlook: Breakout Potential On the 4‑hour chart, Ethereum price prediction is bullish as ETH trades near $3,312, holding above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $3,274. Resistance levels sit at $3,347 and $3,405, with a bullish engulfing candle near $3,193 reinforcing momentum. RSI readings around 57 suggest room for further upside. If ETH breaks above $3,347 with volume confirmation, it could target $3,405 and extend toward $3,500. A pullback toward $3,274–$3,233 remains possible, but strong ETF demand and Buterin’s roadmap provide a supportive backdrop. With sentiment stabilizing and technicals aligning, Ethereum appears poised for a breakout, offering traders and presale participants a compelling setup heading into Q1 2026. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $30.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013585 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

However, despite Trump’s statement, $11.4 million worth of bets are still hanging on Kevin to take the position. At a White House event on Friday, Trump stated , “I see Kevin’s in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” Fed chair nominees’ odds of landing the job. Source: Polymarket Immediately, the odds of Kevin Warsh clinching the nomination jumped to 60% on Polymarket as of Friday afternoon, while traders placed just a 17% chance that Hassett would land the job. However, today the odds of Warsh have settled at 56% as Hassett’s went up to 18%. 18% of polymarket bettors stick with Hassett over Trump’s obscurity For weeks, the president has signaled he is looking at either Warsh or Hassett to replace Powell, adding that he has ruled out Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “because he wants to stay where he is.” Between the two candidates that could be nominated by Trump, Hassett is widely viewed as the most loyal. Just as he did with Scott Bessent, Trump pulled the same card, but on Hasset, he sounded unsure. Addressing White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on Friday, Trump said, “We don’t want to lose him [Hassett], Susie, but we’ll see how it all works out.” This has kept 11 million bettors thinking he still has a chance. Current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who has been considered a long shot, came third with 15%. Traders saw just an 8% chance that BlackRock exec Rick Rieder could win the role. The odds of Warsh taking the role have gone up mainly because of his recent dovish stance. However, when he served the Fed, Warsh was a hawk worried about inflation and called for higher rates even during times of financial crisis. “Warsh is a bit more of a wild card given past hawkishness and recent dovishness,” a team of Wells Fargo strategists wrote in a note earlier this year. Warsh also jumped to 59% odds on Kalshi, another prediction market. Hassett and Waller got 18% and 14% odds, respectively. Trump has not set a specific date to name his pick for the next chairman. Powell’s term at the helm expires in May, though he could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. Hassett says that Powell is a good man amidst his investigation As the Fed chair seat is being interviewed for, the Trump administration is carrying out an investigation into Powell. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Powell has been accused of cost ‌ overruns for a $2.5 billion project to renovate two historical buildings at the Fed’s headquarters complex. Powell, however, has denied wrongdoing and said the unprecedented actions were a pretext to put ⁠pressure on him for ‌not satisfying US President Donald Trump’s long-running demands for sharply lower interest rates. The central bank issued three quarter-point cuts last year, lowering the target range to 3.5% to 3.75%. On its website, the Fed attributed spending increases to unexpected costs of materials and labor, more asbestos than anticipated, and toxic contamination in the soil. It added that the project will “reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations.” Hassett said in an interview with Fox Business Network that he wished there had been more transparency ​from the Fed about cost overruns of building renovations. “The bottom line ‌is, I expect, you know, Jay is a good man – I expect that there’s nothing to see here, that the cost overruns are related to things like asbestos, as he says. But I sure wish they had been more transparent,” Hassett said. Foreign central bank leaders, former US government officials, and current American lawmakers across the political spectrum have blasted the investigation. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Banking Committee’s slight GOP majority, threatened to block any of Trump’s candidates for the Federal Reserve after news of the investigation broke.

The asset has traded in a very tight range over the last many days, with traders expecting either a clear upside breakout or a rejection. BNB’s market capitalization tops $125 billion, ranking among the top crypto assets. While network upgrades and moves to increase liquidity boost demand, price appreciation from the current level seems relatively sluggish. This has led many smaller buyers to pursue more economical entry points and find the best cryptocurrency to buy now. Given today’s crypto news pointing to rotation trends, investors are looking to a new cryptocurrency that has more upside potential. BNB Approaching a Key Ceiling The BNB price is stuck range-bound between $894 and $920, and this is a clear indication that the price momentum has halted. Although some technical signs indicate a possible increase, the resistance level of $931 is a difficult wall for further price increments. Also, getting to $1,000 would only be a slight increase. In other words: a $1,000 investment today will get you less than $100 worth of value, a pittance when you consider the returns that some of the earlier, lower-cost cryptocurrencies. BNB could be a good investment, but it has a high market cap, which limits potential and isn’t very enticing for traders seeking a quick profit in today’s market. Mutuum Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is an emerging cryptocurrency showing great demand. It is in presale, raising $19.8 million at this stage, and has 18,820 total holders. Currently, Phase 7 is open for sale, with a price of $0.04, which represents a 300% increase compared to the opening price of $0.01 in Phase 1. Phase 7 is selling out fast, and once it does, Phase 8 will commence at $0.045, which is almost 20% higher. This means investors who move fast, enjoy cheaper prices and bigger rewards. With an investment of $100 at $0.04, 2,500 tokens would be acquired. This would further equate to an investment reaching $2,500 if prices rise by 25x by mid-year. Simple mathematics indicates that Mutuum is among the most promising cryptocurrencies one can invest in today. Supply and Rewards Mutuum has a total supply cap of 4 billion tokens, with 45% going to presale. More than 800 million tokens have been sold so far in presale, thus decreasing the available supply. There will be no minting going forward, and this will positively impact demand. The person who has $1,000 of MUTM tokens at a price of $0.04 will own 25,000 tokens. The position will then be worth $2,500 if the price surges to $0.10 due to demand after the launch. This cycle creates the basis of value for the asset and sustains the argument that it is a better investment opportunity in this cycle. Other benefits that come with this investment opportunity include community giveaways, such as a $100,000 giveaway to 10 lucky winners. Passive Yield Mutuum plans to utilize the funds generated from the protocol for the purchase of MUTM tokens through open market buybacks and then distribute them to the stakers of the safety module. For instance, it could mean that staking $2,000 worth of tokens leads to a higher amount of MUTM following buyback cycles. Lending is also a yield-generating process for the platform. For example, a user with $5,000 worth of underlying assets can generate a 12% annual yield, amounting to about $600 without having to sell. Closing Market Outlook While BNB might rise further, its market cap restricts the potential velocity. In contrast, Mutuum offers a much lower entry, better defined mathematical objectives of returns, and strong motivational structures to achieve those returns. Phase 7 is selling out fast, so missing the $0.04 entry may mean much higher prices much sooner. For those looking for the cryptocurrency to buy, MUTM offers something truly unique with high upside.

After months of consolidation and careful accumulation, price action is approaching a stage where momentum, market structure, and historical patterns could converge to spark a significant upward move. Analysts and holders are now evaluating whether the current setup could mark the start of a major bullish leg. Crypto trader Cobb recently highlighted this perspective, urging XRP holders to maintain conviction. According to Cobb, the current candle on the three-month chart—still active with roughly two months and sixteen days remaining—represents a pivotal moment. He suggests that this candle may define the move that eventually pushes XRP toward the $10 target . $XRP 3 Month Chart We have gone through a lot to build up to the exact moment where we are right now.

This pattern reflects sustained buying pressure, as investors consistently defend key support levels. Multi-month structures like this often reveal accumulation phases that precede extended trends, providing insight into the market’s long-term sentiment. Measured move techniques applied to these candles suggest that the current phase could translate into a substantial rally if upward momentum materializes. Cobb emphasized that prolonged consolidation is not a sign of weakness but rather a critical foundation for future price expansion. Psychological Implications for Investors Cobb’s message extends beyond technical analysis, addressing the mindset required for long-term success. Extended holding periods challenge conviction, particularly amid market volatility. Maintaining patience allows investors to avoid reactive decisions and positions them to benefit when structural setups reach fruition.

Preparing for the Next Bullish Phase If XRP successfully navigates the current consolidation cycle, the $10 target becomes a realistic scenario in the broader context of macro price trends. Supporting indicators, sustained accumulation, and structural integrity on higher-timeframe charts all reinforce the probability of upward momentum. Cobb’s outlook underscores a fundamental principle in crypto investing: the best opportunities often emerge after periods of patience and discipline. For XRP holders, the current market phase may be a decisive prelude to a more substantial bull run , demonstrating that strategic perseverance can position investors to capture the next major move.

The European Union is preparing to make it mandatory for products from Chinese technology companies to be permanently removed from the continent’s most sensitive infrastructure. However, that push could run into some turbulence as countries like Germany have set firm removal dates for 2026 and 2029, while others like Spain continue to sign multi-million euro contracts with Chinese firms for sensitive police hardware. Is Chinese tech banned in the EU? The European Commission is set to propose a new Cybersecurity Act that aims to force all EU member states to replace equipment from “high-risk” vendors, like Huawei and ZTE. This is due to Brussels’ goal of reducing its dependence on both Chinese suppliers and major U.S. tech companies. However, many member states, such as Spain, continue to deepen ties with these “high-risk” suppliers. It was revealed that Spain’s Ministry of the Interior signed a €12.3 million contract with Huawei in July 2025. The contract involves using Huawei’s OceanStor servers to store judicially authorized wiretaps used by Spanish intelligence and law enforcement. The United States officials have since warned that sharing intelligence with Spain could become a risk if sensitive police data is stored on Chinese-made hardware. In April 2024, the EU attempted to reduce Chinese participation in its industries and conducted raids on the Chinese company, Nuctech’s offices in Poland and the Netherlands. In December 2025, the Commission opened an investigation into the company under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, trying to determine whether or not Nuctech used state subsidies to underbid European rivals. The EU is also investigating some Chinese wind turbine manufacturers, such as Ming Yang, to check if unfair subsidies are helping them dominate the renewable energy market. Are the EU’s member states in support of a ban? Germany has been the most reluctant major member state to ban Chinese equipment . This hesitation was due to the Chinese government warning for years that a ban on Huawei would lead to “consequences” for German businesses. The Chinese ambassador to Berlin previously suggested that Beijing could declare German cars “unsafe” in retaliation. However, in July 2024, Berlin finally reached an agreement with German operators under which they must strip all Huawei and ZTE parts from their “core” networks by the end of 2026. They will have until 2029 to remove them from “access” networks, such as cell towers. German regulator BNetzA released a new consultation paper early this year proposing reclassifying the entire Radio Access Network (RAN) as “critical.” This means that even the physical nuts and bolts of the towers may soon face the same strict bans as the software systems. If the EU wants to avoid relying solely on U.S. tech, it is left with only two major local options, which are Sweden’s Ericsson and Finland’s Nokia . Beijing has consistently called Europe’s measures a violation of market principles and warned that removing their “quality and secure” equipment will only result in heavy financial losses for European citizens.

Jorge Figueira, 59, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to launder money, with authorities alleging his network processed illicit funds across multiple continents while deliberately concealing transactions from law enforcement. The complaint filed in Virginia’s Eastern District accuses Figueira of directing a sophisticated laundering apparatus that converted cash into cryptocurrency, routed digital assets through multiple wallets, then exchanged them back into dollars before transferring proceeds to intended recipients in high-risk jurisdictions, including Colombia, China, Panama, and Mexico. Prosecutors say more than one billion dollars moved through identified crypto wallets and financial accounts between 2018 and the present, with the majority of inbound funds originating from crypto trading platforms. The U.S. DOJ charged Venezuelan national Jorge Figueira with conspiring to launder around $1 billion in illicit funds through bank accounts, crypto exchanges, and private wallets. The probe, supported by the FBI, alleges extensive crypto-based transfers to conceal fund origins.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 16, 2026 Billion-Dollar Network Operated Through Multiple Jurisdictions Court documents reveal that Figueira allegedly enlisted subordinates to execute hundreds of transfers designed to obscure the origins and destinations of funds. The operation relied on various bank accounts, crypto exchange accounts, private digital wallets, and shell companies to move voluminous amounts of illicit money into and out of the United States, according to federal investigators. FBI Washington Field Office Criminal Division Special Agent in Charge Reid Davis said the bureau identified approximately $1 billion in crypto passing through wallets used by Figueira’s laundering operation. The network allegedly served individuals and businesses worldwide while conducting scores of transfers intended to conceal the nature of funds and potentially facilitate criminal activity across numerous countries. U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan emphasized the scale of alleged criminal conduct, stating that “ money laundering at this level enables transnational criminal organizations to operate, expand, and inflict real-world harm. ” “ Those who move illicit funds in the billions should expect to be identified, disrupted, and held fully accountable under federal law, ” she warned. Federal Crackdown Extends Across Multiple Crypto Crime Networks The charges against Figueira arrive amid intensified federal enforcement targeting crypto-related money laundering nationwide. In fact, earlier this week, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg urged New York lawmakers to criminalize unlicensed crypto operations he characterized as a “ $51 billion criminal economy. “ Federal data shows the scope of crypto-enabled crime, with the FBI reporting nearly 11,000 crypto ATM-related complaints in 2024 totaling more than $246 million. Separately, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis found that illicit crypto addresses received a record $154 billion in 2025, a sharp increase from previous years. Source: Chainalysis Recent prosecutions have targeted operations across the criminal spectrum. On Thursday, Utah resident Brian Garry Sewell was sentenced to three years in prison for running a $2.9 million fraud scheme while simultaneously operating an unlicensed cash-to-crypto business that converted more than $5.4 million in bulk cash. Last month, prosecutors charged another 23-year-old Brooklyn resident, Ronald Spektor, with stealing roughly $16 million from approximately 100 Coinbase users through alleged phishing schemes that relied on panic tactics rather than technical hacks. With all these massive seizures that keep growing, the government has moved to establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, formalizing the retention of seized crypto rather than auctioning it. This was one of the first things Donald Trump did when he took office, even signing an executive order to support it. Recently, things took a different turn when it was discovered that the U.S. Department of Justice appears to have sold 57 Bitcoin forfeited by Samourai Wallet developers. A White House crypto advisor said the US government has not sold any Bitcoin forfeited in the Samourai Wallet case. #DOJ #Bitcoin https://t.co/pfX7fkilo8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 17, 2026 However, White House crypto advisor Patrick Witt confirmed yesterday, Friday, that the Bitcoin forfeited in the case has not been liquidated and will remain part of the reserve per executive order, with current federal holdings estimated at 328,372 BTC valued at over $31 billion. For now, a criminal complaint is merely an accusation, and Figueira is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Assistant U.S. Attorney Catherine Rosenberg is prosecuting the case, with sentencing guidelines and statutory factors to be considered if a conviction occurs.

By 2029, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $52.92 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $164.91 by 2032. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS allows users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it utilizes its own cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2026-2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $10.46 Market Cap $399.86M Trading Volume (24-hour) $23.69M Circulating Supply 100 Million ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $10.47 24-h Low $10.01 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Volatility) 5.30% (High) 50-Day SMA $ 10.49 14-Day RSI 46.89 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $ 17.98 Ethereum Name Service price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : ENSPrice shows short term weakness after recent rise Sellers are gaining control near resistance levels Momentum is cooling as buyers lose strength Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENSUSD chart by TradingView On the 1-day chart on Jan 17, price shows a clear swing down from recent highs, forming a lower high structure after failing to sustain a breakout above prior resistance. The market appears to be consolidating within a broader range rather than trending decisively, with several long wicks suggesting repeated tests of both demand and supply zones. Momentum indicators appear to be flattening, implying that selling pressure has slowed but buyers have not yet regained control. If price holds above the most recent swing low, a relief bounce is possible, but a breakdown below that level would likely invite deeper retracement toward the next support area. Overall, the structure favors cautious, range-bound conditions unless a clean breakout occurs. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENSUSD chart by TradingView ENS is choppy on the 4-hour chart, trading around $10.35 after a failed push toward the $11.0–$11.2 zone. Price has rolled over from the mid-January peak and is now trying to base above the $10.0 handle, with short candles showing indecision. MACD remains below the zero line, but the negative histogram is shrinking, hinting that selling pressure is fading. Bulls need a clean reclaim of $10.50 to target $10.90–$11.20 again. If $10.00 breaks, downside opens toward $9.60–$9.80 support. A higher low above $10.20 would strengthen the bounce, while rejection near $10.45 keeps the range intact. Watch volume for confirmation next sessions. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 10.74 SELL SMA 5 $ 10.43 BUY SMA 10 $ 10.31 BUY SMA 21 $ 10.18 BUY SMA 50 $10.49 SELL SMA 100 $ 12.53 SELL SMA 200 $17.98 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 10.68 SELL EMA 5 $ 10.61 SELL EMA 10 $ 10.37 BUY EMA 21 $ 10.24 BUY EMA 50 $ 11.08 SELL EMA 100 $ 13.32 SELL EMA 200 $ 16.37 SELL What to expect from ENS? ENS is likely to remain influenced by broader Ethereum sentiment, making near-term movement dependent on whether ETH holds key support levels. If buying interest in the wider market improves, ENS could attempt to recover toward recent resistance zones, especially if volume begins to rise alongside higher lows. However, if sellers maintain control, price may continue to drift sideways or test lower demand areas as liquidity clears out. Short-term momentum may alternate between brief relief bounces and mild pullbacks rather than a straight trend. Over the medium term, sustained network usage, renewed interest in Web3 identity, and a clearer market structure would be needed for a more decisive upward move. Why is ENS down today? ENS is down today primarily due to short-term technical weakness and cooling momentum after its recent advance. On the chart, price has been failing to sustain levels above key short-term resistance, suggesting sellers are regaining control. The asset also appears to be slipping back toward a nearby support zone, indicating profit-taking by traders who bought earlier in the move. Declining volume on recent bounces signals reduced buyer conviction, while a downward tilt in shorter moving averages reflects bearish pressure. Broader market softness has likely added to the downside, as ENS tends to track overall crypto sentiment, amplifying today’s pullback. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $45.09 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is not plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $164.91 by 2032. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest. Recent news/opinion on Ethereum Name Service ENS announced it is preparing to roll out ENSv2 and Namechain while celebrating major growth milestones in total registered names and expanding integrations that continue to boost the protocol’s accessibility and real-world utility. As the year winds down, we're gearing up for ENSv2, Namechain and beyond. Total ENS names surpassed massive growth milestones, with integrations continuing to expand accessibility and utility. https://t.co/HecKODJPMm — ens.eth (@ensdomains) December 31, 2025 Ethereum Name Service price prediction January 2026 In 2026, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) forecast suggests an average price of $9.93 and a maximum price of $10.21.

This growth is expected due to rising Web3 identity adoption, L2 integrations reducing costs, potential ENS Layer-2 development, and easing token unlock pressures, which will support stronger demand and value. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2028 In 2028, ENS is forecasted to trade between $30.17 and $35.93, with an average of $31.03. This rise is attributed to the wider adoption of Web3 identities, stronger cross-chain interoperability, and ENS’s maturity as a decentralized naming standard. Reduced token unlock pressure and sustained Ethereum ecosystem growth will further support higher valuation potential. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2029 It is expected that ENS will trade between $43.85 and $52.92 in 2029, with an average of $45.09. This growth is anticipated as ENS becomes a key Web3 identity layer, widely used in DeFi, NFTs, and payments, and gaining more recognition around the world. Better scalability, lower costs, and more mature governance will all help maintain high demand and value. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2030 In 2030, ENS is forecasted between $62.63 and $76.45, averaging $64.88. Growth is driven by ENS’s role as a universal Web3 identity standard, stronger enterprise and government adoption, and Ethereum’s maturity. Reduced token supply pressures and solidified network effects support higher stability, making ENS a key digital identity infrastructure. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2031 The Ethereum Name Service’s price for 2031 is projected to be a minimum of $93.51. According to expert analysis, ENS could reach a maximum possible level of $109.63 and an average price of $96.11. However, this is anticipated as ENS establishes itself in the crypto space with widespread use in finance, social media, and digital governance. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2032 In 2032, ENS is forecasted to be between $143.19 and $164.91, with an average of $147.99. This projection stems from ENS’s deep integration into global Web3 and Web2 systems, powering digital identity, payments, and decentralized governance. With entrenched network effects, strong enterprise adoption, and Ethereum’s ecosystem maturity, ENS demand and valuation are expected to rise further.

Not one of those puts Intel, Google, or Amazon in the driver’s seat. It didn’t happen by chance. It happened because OpenAI doesn’t want to rely on any of them. It wants power spread out. It wants to scale fast. It wants control. Back in November, after Nvidia crushed earnings , Jensen Huang told investors, “Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.” That’s true for now. But it’s not going to stay that way much longer. The same week, OpenAI went out and signed a $10 billion deal with Cerebras, a much smaller chipmaker that’s trying to go public. This wasn’t just another deal. It was part of a bigger play: use new players, get more chips, build faster, depend on no one. OpenAI taps Cerebras, Broadcom, AMD to spread chip bets wide The Cerebras deal is just one piece. OpenAI said it will use 750 megawatts of Cerebras chips across phases that run through 2028. These chips will help run its large models and heavier workloads. This comes on top of last year’s $1.4 trillion infrastructure spree, where it teamed up with Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. That’s what pushed OpenAI’s valuation to $500 billion in private markets. In September, Jensen committed $100 billion from Nvidia to help build out 10 gigawatts of systems for OpenAI. That’s the same energy used by 8 million homes in a year. Jensen said that it would need 4 to 5 million GPUs. But OpenAI isn’t betting everything on him. Just hours after that was announced, it revealed another 10 gigawatts worth of chips coming from Broadcom. These aren’t standard chips. These are custom AI accelerators, called XPUs. Broadcom’s been working on them with OpenAI for over a year. The Broadcom deal blew up on Wall Street. The stock went flying. Broadcom is now worth over $1.6 trillion. That’s what happens when OpenAI gives you a seat at the table. Google, Amazon, and Intel left out as OpenAI builds its own chip stack Meanwhile, Amazon, Google, and Intel are barely in the frame.OpenAI did sign a $38 billion cloud deal with Amazon Web Services in November. It will run workloads on AWS data centers. Amazon also said it will build new ones for OpenAI. And sure, Amazon may put more than $10 billion into the company, but there’s still no commitment to use Inferentia or Trainium, Amazon’s in-house chips. Talks are ongoing, but nothing’s locked. Google Cloud is also providing capacity under a deal signed last year. But when asked about using Google’s tensor processing units, OpenAI said no. It’s not interested. Not even with Broadcom helping make those chips. Then there’s Intel. Reuters said the company had the chance years ago to invest in OpenAI and supply chips. It passed. Now it’s trailing everyone. In October, Intel tried to catch up. It showed off a chip called Crescent Island. It’s meant for AI inference and will offer higher memory and better energy use. But real sampling won’t even start until late 2026. To stay alive in AI, Intel had to take money from Nvidia and the U.S. government. Wall Street will see next week if that’s made any difference when Intel kicks off tech earnings. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

He told a podcast that buying Bitcoin should be seen as a choice about where to put cash, not as a moral failing. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps He said firms face few good options for idle money, and that Bitcoin is one of those options for companies that can stand big price swings. Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Choice Based on reports tracking public disclosures, publicly listed firms hold about 1.1 million BTC in total. That amount equals roughly 5.5% of the 19.97 million coins now in circulation. Strategy is the biggest public holder, with 687,410 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. Those numbers help explain why markets and regulators pay attention when companies buy large amounts. Saylor framed the issue as a simple accounting decision. He compared holding Bitcoin to other moves a firm might make with extra cash. Treasuries pay very little. Stock buybacks can fail if a company is losing money. He used a clear example: a company losing $10 million per year could still come out ahead if its Bitcoin position gained $30 million over the same time. That point is meant to show why some executives see Bitcoin as a way to improve net results. Risk Vs. Reward On Balance Sheets The argument has limits. Bitcoin can drop fast. A firm with heavy debt or thin margins may be forced to sell at the worst time. Not every company has the same ability to wait for a recovery. Strategy’s big size and long view make it hard to compare with smaller firms that don’t have the same runway or the same investor base. Investors and analysts see two sides. Some view large Bitcoin bets as proof of conviction. Others see concentration risk that adds volatility to corporate returns. That scrutiny grows as more firms add coins to their books. When holdings reach the hundreds of thousands, it is no longer a niche choice; it becomes part of how markets judge a firm’s financial picture.

The bank put Amazon on a short list of stocks it believes are best positioned heading into earnings, saying the tech giant has “more room to run.” Analyst Justin Post wrote, “We believe Amazon’s valuation reflects uncertainty on AWS positioning, which has the potential to improve in 2026 if AWS revenue growth accelerates, and the company strengthens its relative AI capabilities.” Basically, the current price is being held back by hesitation around its cloud unit. But Bank of America thinks that will change fast, and investors should start accumulating shares now. Bank expects growth from retail and cloud while earnings loom The note also said Amazon is positioned for multiple expansion as it keeps rolling out more AI tools. On the retail side, Post said the company “continues to execute on efficiencies,” and predicted that Amazon’s profit growth will beat other mega-cap tech peers. This is all happening as the company gears up to report Q4 earnings for fiscal 2025, with analysts expecting $1.97 per share, up from $1.86 a year ago. Amazon has already beat Wall Street’s profit forecast for four quarters straight. In Q3, it posted $1.95 EPS, blowing past estimates by 23.4%. Full-year profit for 2025 is expected to hit $7.17 per share, a jump of nearly 30% from last year’s $5.53. Analysts also see 2026 EPS reaching $7.85, another 9.5% increase. So far this year, Amazon shares are up 3%, and over the past 52 weeks, they’ve climbed 11.4%. But that still trails the S&P 500’s 17.7% and the Consumer Discretionary ETF’s 11.6%, which is part of why Bank of America sees more upside left. Nigeria grants Amazon a satellite license as global footprint expands There’s more. Nigeria just gave Amazon a seven-year operating permit for satellite broadband, putting the company’s low-Earth-orbit network, formerly known as Project Kuiper, into play across the region starting in 2026. Amazon’s satellite unit will now compete directly with Starlink, Elon Musk’s SpaceX-backed broadband provider. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) also granted similar permits to Israel’s NSLComm and Germany’s Satelio IoT Services, allowing all three to roll out non-geostationary satellite systems across the country. This move signals a push into Africa’s expanding digital market, and puts Amazon’s infrastructure strategy back into focus; not just in cloud and AI, but in connectivity itself. The satellite license widens its reach, and could tie directly into AWS if the company begins connecting remote enterprise clients with its cloud backbone. Amazon, now worth $2.6 trillion, still leads global e-commerce. The company, based in Seattle, runs a platform that sells just about everything, both directly and through third-party sellers. Bank of America’s bullish call on Amazon was part of a wider list that included Brookdale Senior Living, Carvana, Corning, and Vertiv; each flagged for different reasons. Brookdale got an upgrade from Joanna Gajuk, who raised her target from $6.75 to $13, citing operating leverage and low exposure to government payors. Carvana got a target bump to $515 from $455, with analyst Michael McGovern calling out its expansion into physical dealerships and “best-in-class eCommerce growth.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

According to a new report, the altcoin has become the most traded asset in all of South Korea , highlighting strong adoption, demand, and liquidity. This latest development underscores the token’s growing dominance in one of the world’s most active crypto markets, even as broader conditions remain volatile . XRP Outpaces Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin As Most Traded Asset XRP has posted a notable win in one of the world’s most active crypto markets . New data from Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest crypto exchanges, shows the asset outpacing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin in trading volume throughout 2025. Market analyst XFinanceBull highlighted this new achievement in a recent X post after reviewing Upbit’s trading data for 2025. According to the analyst, the altcoin was confirmed as the most traded digital asset on Upbit . The ranking was based on volume, liquidity, and actual usage rather than price movement. XRP trading pairs consistently led the platform, with the XRP/KRW pair taking the number one position for most of the year. Bitcoin followed in second place, Ethereum ranked third, USDT came fourth, and Dogecoin placed fifth by trading volume. Notably, the figures were officially verified by Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, on January 2, 2026. On a year-over-year basis, Upbit processes more than $1 trillion in trading volume and accounts for more than 70% of South Korea’s total crypto market . This positions Upbit as the country’s largest crypto exchange and makes it a reliable indicator of usage trends and real retail and institutional demand. XFinanceBull emphasized that South Korea tends to trade assets with clear real-world use cases and strong liquidity. Because of this, steady trading volume indicates a cryptocurrency is actively being used in the market, not just driven by short-term speculation. The analyst added that XRP’s continued use creates a pull effect, drawing in more capital as liquidity improves. In established markets like South Korea, assets that perform well are more likely to attract consistent, long-term participation, which can positively impact prices. Following the recent development, XFinanceBull reinforced his bullish stance on the altcoin and stated he plans to accumulate even more of the cryptocurrency. Upbit’s Report On XRP’s Performance Upbit’s 2025 data shows that the altcoin consistently accounted for between 15% and 22% of the exchange’s daily trading activity, across a total annual trading volume of $1 trillion. As mentioned before, XRP/KRW was ranked the top trading pair for that year. Its daily volume peaked at $1.22 billion in July 2025, demonstrating sustained retail-driven liquidity and stable support. In terms of liquidity, XRP outperformed BTC and ETH multiple times. By year-end, Korean exchanges had accumulated around 570 million XRP, reinforcing the token’s role as a primary transactional and economic asset in the country . User data also shows Upbit serves about 13.26 million users, almost one in four people in South Korea. The largest age group is users in their 30s, making up approximately 28.7% of the exchange.",XRP|bitcoin|btc|Doge|dogecoin|Dunamu|ETH|Ethereum|ripple|Upbit|USDT|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRP/KRW|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 17:00:38

It climbed nearly 25% in January as markets flipped into risk-on mode. Bitcoin held steady between the 93,000 and 95,000 range. Speculative money rotated into high-beta plays. This pushed Dogecoin price above key resistance walls. Debates fired up again about whether this move shows real demand or just short-term bets. At the same time, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is pulling interest instead of reacting to wild swings. The core draw of ZKP technology lies in its power to enable controlled privacy. It lets users prove a transaction or piece of info is valid without showing the raw data itself. This focus on privacy is getting more critical in today’s digital asset world. It adds a key layer of security and user control that sets it apart from hype-driven trends. Why Dogecoin Blasted 25% Higher in January Dogecoin’s rally shows a textbook risk-on rotation. When Bitcoin settles after a big move, traders often hunt for plays that amplify momentum. DOGE has filled that role for years thanks to its deep liquidity and strong retail fan base. The January push got extra fuel from a technical breakout above the 0.15 level. This triggered short liquidations and pulled momentum chasers back into the market. Stable macro conditions and steady interest-rate expectations backed speculative hunger. This let Dogecoin price beat many utility-focused networks during the first weeks of the year. Dogecoin Price Outlook: Momentum With Clear Limits On-chain signals show stabilized active addresses and signs of fresh whale stacking. Experimental Dogecoin DeFi activity has pushed total value locked above 15 million. This gives modest network support. Dogecoin has no fixed supply. Roughly 5 billion new DOGE enter the market each year. Price action stays highly tied to Bitcoin’s direction. Holding above 0.15 is key. A solid close above 0.18 could open a path toward 0.25. But fading volume or a Bitcoin drop below 90,000 may drag DOGE back into the 0.12 to 0.14 range. Zero Knowledge Proof Could 100x — Is Now the Time to Jump In? Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is grabbing attention for reasons that go beyond charts or short-term buzz. Analysts studying long-term crypto cycles ask a simple question first: Does this solve a real problem that grows over time? With ZKP, the answer is more and more yes. The project is built around privacy at a moment when data leaks are becoming one of the biggest dangers in crypto, AI, and enterprise tech. As artificial intelligence spreads into finance, healthcare, and consumer platforms, the power to compute on data without exposing it stops being a bonus. It becomes core infrastructure. What catches analysts’ eyes is how early this network still is compared to its goals. ZKP’s total addressable market spans AI, privacy tech, and blockchain systems. These sectors already measure in the tens of billions. Yet the project is hitting the market through a presale auction model rather than a fully priced public market. Looking back at history, this gap between early infrastructure pricing and later adoption is where huge multiples are born. The other factor is execution risk, or really the lack of it compared to most early projects. ZKP was built before it was sold. The team spent over $100 million upfront. For analysts, this shifts the risk picture. A 100x outcome isn’t about sure things. It’s about lopsided upside-down. If privacy becomes mandatory instead of optional, ZKP sits right in that lane. The Final Word Dogecoin’s January blast shows how fast money can move when markets turn risk-on. Technical breakouts, improving mood, and whale action back DOGE as a vehicle for momentum-driven plays. But supply growth and ties to broader market swings still define its long-term limits. A key reason analysts keep watching ZKP is its presale auction setup. It dodges many of the twists common in early crypto launches. No private rounds exist. No early discounts. No insider shares. ZKP hands out coins through a daily auction where everyone joins on equal terms. Each 24-hour window sets a single effective price. It’s based purely on how much money enters that day. Not on who you are or how early you showed up.

What began as a high-stakes Supreme Court case over presidential tariff powers has evolved into a focal point for investors, analysts, and traders assessing broader market sentiment. Crypto and XRP holders are watching closely, interpreting shifts in legal expectations as signals that could influence risk appetite across digital assets. Crypto commentator Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders highlighted this dynamic in a video posted on X. He emphasized how the Supreme Court appears to have reversed earlier expectations regarding the tariffs, noting that the White House publicly expresses confidence that the Court will rule in its favor. Levi observed that even prediction markets, which just days earlier showed over a 70% probability of a ruling against the tariffs, now reflect a more uncertain or pro-tariff outlook. BREAKING: The Supreme Court Just FLIPPED On $XRP Holders!? pic.twitter.com/kdHnuEEKFF — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) January 17, 2026 Changing Legal Odds The Supreme Court case centers on the legality of tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Lower courts previously questioned the executive branch’s authority to implement these measures, creating expectations that the Supreme Court might strike them down. Recent developments, however, suggest that the Court could allow some form of these tariffs to continue, either by upholding current measures or permitting alternative tariffs within legal boundaries. This shift in expectations has drawn attention from both financial and crypto markets. Levi highlighted that, even if the Court ultimately rules against the tariffs, adjustments could still keep the measures largely in effect, providing continuity and predictability for market participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Crypto Markets Are Watching Crypto traders often link macro legal developments to market psychology. Decisions that signal regulatory stability or clarify government authority can influence investor confidence, potentially affecting capital flows into risk assets like XRP . Conversely, legal uncertainty or unexpected rulings can increase short-term volatility, prompting caution among retail and institutional holders. Broader Implications for Investors Levi’s commentary underscores a key point: the Supreme Court’s actions do not operate in isolation. Legal outcomes, government statements, and market expectations interact to shape investor behavior across asset classes. For XRP holders , the perceived “flip” in the Court’s position reinforces the importance of monitoring regulatory and political developments as part of risk management and strategic planning. While the Supreme Court has not yet issued a final decision, the evolving narrative highlights the interconnectedness of political, legal, and financial systems. Traders and investors are advised to interpret these developments as signals that could influence market trends, particularly in highly reactive sectors like cryptocurrency.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $807.54 by the end of 2029. By 2032, Monero’s price may surge to $1,238.73. Monero (XMR) stands out in the crypto space for its strong focus on privacy and decentralization of transactions, particularly within the monero network, making it one of the leading privacy focused cryptocurrencies. This makes it a popular choice for privacy advocates and those prioritizing security. The Monero ecosystem constantly evolves, marked by significant milestones like enhanced protocol upgrades and growing adoption across various sectors, which underscore its utility. As Monero progresses, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features drive significant value growth, as many traders speculate, and can a price prediction tool provide insights into this ?

Cryptocurrency lost 10% of its value in last 24 hours. XMR finds support at $610 On January 17, 2026, Monero price analysis revealed a bullish trend for the week as the price establishes a new all time high for the asset. However, it later crashed toward $600. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR falls towards $610 The one-day price chart for Monero confirms a downwards trend forming in the market, indicating a notable price change. XMR price declined rapidly after failing to breach the $800 resistance. The XMR/USD pair declined to $700 where it found short-term support. Now the price has fallen to the $617 mark. XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows declining bullish momentum as the price returns to $617. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trading at the edge of the neutral region. The indicator’s value was recorded at 65.47 today. The downward curve on the RSI signifies a selling pressure at the level. Further volatility can be expected if the selling momentum intensifies and the $600 mark is breached. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The four-hour chart analysis of Monero shows rapid decline after a brief struggle at $790 mark. However, the price found support above the $660 mark that enabled it to climb back to $700 before retracing to the current $617 level.

XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView Monero price analysis gives a bearish prediction for the asset’s short-term movements as the price crumbles from its recently established all-time high. If buyers hold the $610 level and establish a foothold above $660, the price may retest $700. However, if the bulls fail to hold the level, the price will fall back to $550 and lower levels. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp rise to a new all time high of $798 before retracing to the $617 mark where it trades at press time. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2031 suggests a minimum price of $922.68 and an average trading price of $1,000.34. The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,099.55. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark. In October the price continued to rise ending the month above the $340 mark, a trend separating it from most other cryptocurrencies that saw a decline during the period. In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month. In December, the bulls continued to charge ending the month above the $430 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 17:10:27

Companies will either show strong profits now or volatility will surge to new highs… again. That’s the choice. Valuations are already stretched to the max. The MSCI World Index is at 20 times forward earnings. That’s well above its 10-year median of 17. Investors are still holding on from last year’s 19% rally, which was basically priced on hope. If earnings don’t deliver now, this whole thing unravels. AI giants under pressure to justify record spending In the U.S., analysts think S&P 500 earnings rose over 8% last quarter. They’re also betting on 11% gains every quarter this year. Asia is stronger, with expected 14% growth in Q4 profits. Europe is barely in the green, with just over 1% growth. Nothing exciting there. The first batch of results has been mixed. Big banks on Wall Street gave a weak read on the economy. In Europe, Richemont, which owns Cartier, disappointed. But Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) stepped in and gave global stocks a push. Their forecast on AI chips set off a rally on Thursday. Everyone’s still betting on AI. That’s where the money is. The biggest companies on the planet are tied to that trade. No one expects huge flops from them, but cracks already showed up at the end of 2025. So now the pressure’s on. Other sectors like energy, health, and materials are being forced to catch up. Let’s talk spending. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle plan to spend $530 billion this year, according to Bank of America. In Q4, profits at the Magnificent Seven probably rose 20%, four times what the rest of the S&P 500 earned. Meta’s stock crashed 7% last quarter after its spending plans scared everyone, and Oracle got wrecked even harder, becoming the worst-performing Big Tech stock in 2025. TSMC gave some relief. They projected between $52 and $56 billion in capex and nearly 30% revenue growth for 2026. Last year, their cash flow-to-capex ratio was 1.8. Tariff cuts, oil threats, and 29x P/E defense stocks drive new risks across sectors Away from tech, money is finally creeping into old sectors. Banks, consumer goods, and mining are getting some attention. If this rally keeps going, they’ll have to start pulling their own weight. They’re not just going to ride on AI forever. Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson are reporting this week. Traders want to know if U.S. consumers still have enough cash to handle rising prices and job losses. Richemont’s results already showed weakness in luxury. Now it’s up to companies selling basic stuff (soap, pills, toothpaste) to show the other half of the economy is still alive. Last week, the U.S. lowered Taiwan’s tariff to 15%, which was meant to boost trade. But it also messed up every company’s forecast model. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is getting ready to rule on whether the old tariffs broke the Constitution. If Trump loses, the government might have to refund billions in import duties, which would, of course, blow up supply-chain plans across the board. Then there’s Iran. Trump just threatened to bomb them. Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, which is critical for oil shipments. At the same time, Venezuela’s president was captured by U.S. forces. Their oil reserves are now in play. No one knows where prices go next. On the defense side, governments are throwing money at weapons. Germany, Japan, and Canada are all boosting military budgets. That’s sent defense stocks soaring. Companies like Rheinmetall, Northrop Grumman, and Hanwha Aerospace have been winning big. Investors are watching results from Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Saab. They want higher revenue and fatter margins. A UBS basket of U.S. defense stocks is up 17% this month. It’s trading at 29 times forward earnings. The European version is even more expensive at 32 times, way above the 5-year average of 17. Back in Europe, companies have a lot to prove. They had 0% earnings growth in 2025. This year, analysts expect almost 11%. Most of that is expected from banks. Financial stocks are still cheap, and loan growth looks solid. UBS and Deutsche Bank will be closely watched. For consumer trends, investors will look at LVMH, Kering, Volkswagen, and Mercedes-Benz. They’ll give updates on what’s happening in China, especially spending. That’s a key piece of the global equity puzzle. In Asia, the picture’s cleaner. The CSI 300 Index is up 18% in six months. Earnings projections have also improved. Even with weak macro numbers and tougher e-commerce competition, analysts expect brokers, miners, and AI-related firms to post strong results.

Bitcoin still bears the wider market story, however, a new cheap crypto is being featured by analysts as possessing a more favorable form of upside potential. The two assets are both under observation as future Q1 2026 leaders, albeit due to entirely different reasons. Bitcoin (BTC) At the present, Bitcoin runs around the price of 96,000 and has a market value of approximately $1.8 trillion. BTC is the preference of large institutions, wealth managers and long term holders who are more interested in the security and liquidity than the expedited percentage returns. This can be used to explain the consistency with which BTC tends to be the first to go up when markets are recovering as capital flows into lower risk. Technical traders indicate resistance areas at around $100,000 and $110,000. These levels constitute the important upside supports of the subsequent leg. Analysts following Bitcoin price forecasts models anticipate less frenzied returns as compared to the previous cycles. Certain projections indicate that BTC will be found within the 1.3x to 1.7x range by the end of 2026 in case market strength persists. It applies to large portfolios but is not as appealing to traders who want larger multiples. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The new asset that was followed in the category is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is an Ethereum based lending protocol under development, which will enable users to provide and borrow crypto assets via smart contracts once implemented. The suppliers will be able to gain yield and balance their earnings in the form of mtTokens. Johns will put collateral and pay interests in order to gain liquidity without selling long term assets. The official X version of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) states V1 is getting ready to go to testnet prior to mainnet. This is important since lending platforms are commonly subject to price discovery when borrowings and liquidation are put on chain. The analysts refer to this level as the one that moves the expectations to the levels that transform ideas into consumable products. In Phase 7 of its structured presale, MUTM is now selling at $0.04. The distribution has raised over $19.8 million and has drawn over 18,800 holders. Over 825 million tokens were bought. The entire supply of 4 billion is distributed to the presale numbering 45.5%. There will be a set price and a set allocation in each stage. When a phase sells out, the pricing shifts to the next level at an increased level. The assured launch price is $0.06. Why BTC and MUTM Are Leading Q1 2026 Bitcoin and Mutuum Finance are drawing the most attention going into Q1 2026 for 3 simple reasons. First, Bitcoin continues to act as the primary benchmark for the entire crypto market. It anchors capital flows, sets sentiment, and attracts institutional positioning during macro expansion phases. Second, Mutuum Finance is entering its early utility cycle with V1 preparing for deployment. Tokens often reprice during this stage because lending activity, borrowing demand, and interest revenues begin to surface. This gives traders measurable fundamentals beyond hype alone. Third, the rotation story is strong. Large caps like BTC offer stability and slower percentage gains. MUTM sits early in its valuation curve under $0.1 with presale momentum, security audits, and stablecoin usage plans. This creates a two sided allocation strategy where investors hold BTC for certainty and MUTM for higher upside potential during the same quarter. Security Preparation One of the components of the protocol roadmap is stablecoin design. Stablecoins enable borrowers to borrow in stable units without fear of fluctuations in prices in the process of repayment. The stablecoins too boost the demand of lending in bull cycles as the traders demand leverage without selling long term positions. That is why in the list of the analysts, the new crypto-based platforms that have obvious intentions to integrate a stablecoin are frequently pointed out. Security has been given a priority also. V1 codebase passed an audit conducted by Halborn Security . A token scan of the MUTM by CertiK scored the token at 90 out of 100. There is a bug bounty of 50,000 dollars that is operational to attract vulnerability reports until before activation of mainnet. Bitcoin is spearheading Q1 2026 since it frames confidence and institutional flows. Mutuum Finance is being featured on the contrary motive. Its low cost, early utility design and future V1 launch presents another form of opportunity. As an investor, considering which crypto to purchase currently, the two options are two sides of a coin: BTC is a mature coin, and MUTM is a percentage increase as demand moves to newer and more useful crypto.

Industry Minister Melanie Joly is expected to roll the whole thing out in February. But officials are already leaking pieces. The goal is simple: stop the bleeding. Since Trump slapped tariffs on foreign cars in April last year, plants have shut down, and jobs have disappeared. General Motors closed one in Ontario. Stellantis ditched plans near Toronto and decided to build Jeeps in Illinois instead. That’s what Canada wants to reverse, fast. Chinese automakers can enter if they play by Canadian rules For the first time ever, Canada will allow Chinese auto companies to assemble cars inside its borders. But they won’t get a free ride. “They’ll need to team up with local firms and use Canadian-built software,” one government source said. The official, who asked not to be named, also made it clear that national security concerns are part of the deal. “It’s about having a secure platform that doesn’t open up tech risks,” the person added. That’s where companies like BlackBerry come in. The new strategy doesn’t stop at attracting factories. It targets electric vehicles, too. It will include mandates to push EV sales, plus new incentives for buyers. The bigger play? Making sure Canada doesn’t stay chained to the U.S. market. “We’ve got free trade with Europe and Asia,” the official said. “We’re not going to just sit here and beg for U.S. access.” Right now, five companies have auto assembly plants in Canada; GM, Stellantis, Ford, Toyota, and Honda. But most of what they build goes straight to the U.S. That’s what Carney wants to change. Canada sold 1.9 million new cars last year, in a country with the same population as California. Most foreign brands don’t even build cars in Canada. Tesla, Nissan, and Kia all serve the market from U.S. or overseas factories. Since Trump’s trade war kicked off, U.S. carmakers are actually losing market share in Canada. Plants in Mexico and South Korea have been gaining instead, according to Statistics Canada data. That’s part of what’s fueling this new policy wave. Carney-Xi deal lowers tariffs and includes EV quota conditions Last week, Carney flew to Beijing and met with President Xi Jinping. The two sides agreed on a trade truce that will allow about 49,000 Chinese EVs to enter Canada each year under a low 6% tariff. That’s a sharp cut from the 100% surtax slapped on them back in 2024. In return, China will ease up on tariffs against Canadian farm exports and open the door for visa-free travel for Canadian citizens. On the same trip, Joly met with BYD, Chery, and Canadian parts giant Magna. The result? A handshake deal: China gets to export a limited number of EVs now, but those firms have to seriously explore investing in Canada. “We’ll check back in three years,” the official said. “If they don’t follow through, the deal’s off.” The arrangement comes with a price cap clause. Part of the quota has to be filled with EVs costing C$35,000 or less. That mostly benefits Chinese brands, who already build cheaper models. Canada also wants to start certifying more of those models over time, instead of relying on just Tesla to fill demand. Some in Washington were caught off guard, but not the top guy. Trump didn’t seem too bothered. “That’s OK, that’s what he should be doing,” he told reporters when asked about the Carney–Xi deal. “If you can get a deal with China you should do that.” Still, there’s risk. This agreement could stir tension as Canada, the U.S., and Mexico prepare to review their trilateral trade deal. The government says it briefed U.S. Trade Rep Jamieson Greer ahead of time to avoid surprises. The bigger ambition? Less reliance on Washington altogether.

Data from CoinGlass reveals that 1.24 trillion SHIB tokens, valued at $10.50 million, exited futures positions during this period. This outflow exceeded the $8.8 million in inflows, creating a net negative flow of $1.7 million. The withdrawal pattern suggests traders are pulling back from leveraged positions in the meme cryptocurrency. Such movements typically indicate reduced confidence in short-term price action or profit-taking after recent volatility. Price Action Shows Recovery Attempt SHIB's price climbed 3.71% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.00000853 at press time. This represents a rebound from Friday's low of $0.00000815, which marked the bottom of a two-day decline. Trading volume increased by 4.39% to $94.53 million, suggesting sustained market interest despite the futures outflows. The token faces immediate resistance at $0.00001017. A breakthrough at this level could push prices toward the 50-day moving average at $0.00001084. Technical analysts point to $0.000015 as a potential long-term target if bullish momentum builds. However, recent technical indicators present a mixed picture for traders. Technical Signals Flash Warning Signs A death cross formation appeared on the hourly chart as the 50-hour moving average crossed below the 20-hour moving average. This marks another such occurrence in 2026 and generally signals short-term bearish pressure. The pattern often precedes price consolidation or further declines. Support levels require close monitoring in the coming sessions. The daily 50-period moving average at $0.0000081 serves as crucial support. Maintaining prices above this threshold remains essential for preserving upward momentum. A failure to hold could send SHIB toward the next support zone at $0.00000732. The Relative Strength Index and other momentum indicators point toward potential range-bound trading. Neither buyers nor sellers have established clear dominance.

US President Donald Trump, who keeps claiming that his country needs to control the island, just announced a new set of tariffs against all nations that have sent troops. In a post on his social media platform TruthSocial, the POTUS said the tariffs will impact Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland. At first, the taxation will be 10% on all goods sent to the US starting from February 1, 2026. However, if there’s no deal for the acquisition of Greenland by June 1, the tariffs will increase to 25%. BREAKING: President Trump announces a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, Netherlands, and Finland beginning February 1st.

Tariffs will remain in effect until the US reaches a deal to buy… pic.twitter.com/978qAHjxao — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 17, 2026 In his statement, Trump emphasized that a deal means a “complete and total purchase of Greenland,” which, he claims, is essential for his country’s national security. In a separate post on X, the analysts from the Kobeissi Letter estimated that $1.2 trillion worth of annual bilateral trade will be impacted under these new tariffs. They also asserted that the potential acquisition of Greenland would cost the US around $700 billion. They warned that the US-EU trade war, which began last year shortly after Trump’s inauguration, just “escalated to a whole new level,” as it’s clear that Greenland has become the POTUS’s “top strategic focus.” Recall that BTC’s price was among the worst-performing assets last year when Trump announced the first wave of tariffs against countless countries. It slumped from its then-ATH of $110,000 to under $75,000 in the span of just a few months. Trump’s announcement from earlier today hasn’t harmed bitcoin’s price performance yet.

In line with the widespread crypto market uplift, the altcoin had initially surged as high as $14.85 before retracing below the $13.50 price. According to analyst Ali Martinez, AVAX now lies at another critical price juncture, with the next price move likely to determine its short-term trend. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Smart Money Zone, While Weekly Structure Signals Big Move Ahead Here’s Why AVAX Must Clear $14.83 Resistance In an X post on January 16, Martinez shares an insightful analysis of the AVAX 12-hour trading chart, identifying a key price zone and an important chart formation. According to the presented technical review, AVAX’s recent rejection around $14.85 can be attributed to heavy resistance in this region. Most notably, the altcoin has struggled to break past this $14.83 price barrier thrice in the last month, indicating a significant willingness among investors to sell when the price approaches this zone. This could be driven by a general view of such a price point as a good profit-taking zone or expectation of a price decline based on historical data. It’s worth noting that Martinez’s analysis also shows that AVAX price movement has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, thereby favoring an imminent upside breakout. For context, the inverse H&S formation is a bullish pattern that signals a potential trend reversal. As seen above, it consists of three troughs: the left shoulder, where price declines, then rebounds; the head, a deeper decline to around $11.26 followed by a recovery, and the right shoulder, a higher low ($13.75) that fails to reach the depth of the head. All rebound highs are connected by a resistance line ($14.83) known as the neckline. And a bullish breakout indicates strengthening buying pressure. Therefore, Martinez explains that AVAX must push past this barrier in a decisive manner to trigger a bullish breakout towards $17.59 as an initial price target. With sustained buying pressure, the analyst predicts a further rise to $18.41, representing a potential 35% gain on present market prices.

Defiance ETFs, a Miami-based investment firm, announced on Thursday that it is shutting down its Ethereum ETF. The firm plans to liquidate the ETF on January 30, 2026, giving investors time to decide on their next moves. The U.S. SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs in May 2024, with trading beginning in July, and since then, it has attracted big players in the financial markets from BlackRock to Grayscale. Since then, Ethereum’s ETFs have pulled in between $12.5 to $14 billion, bringing total assets under management to over $20 billion. Tidal Financial Group and Defiance pull ETFs Defiance ETFs launched the Ethereum ETFs in September 2025, and after just four months of trading, pulled it off the market. The ETF is known as Defiance Leveraged Long + Income Ethereum ETF (ETHI), and is currently trading at $6.95. It was aimed at delivering between 150%-200% of the daily performance of other Ethereum-based products. On January 16, Defiance ETFs and Tidal Financial Group announced their decision to pull eight ETFs, including the Ethereum ETF from the market. The board of trustees said this is part of Defiance ETFs’ effort to review its lineup of product offerings and give investors a more focused suite of investments. The delisted funds will be traded up until January 26, 2026, after which they will accept no more orders. Investors will continue to hold their shares until January 30, 2026, when the funds will be automatically liquidated and redeemed for cash at the net asset value (NAV) on the day of liquidation. Competition is stiff in crowded ETF market Defiance emphasized that its decision to cut Ethereum ETFs is to provide its investors with more tailored investment opportunities. Institutional demand for crypto ETFs has been on the rise and hit record levels in 2025. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw a combined $50 billion in inflows with about $170 billion in total assets under management. Defiance’s closure potentially highlights an increase in competition within the U.S. crypto ETF market. For smaller ETF providers, gaining traction in this environment has become increasingly difficult. According to reports, the ETF experienced about $6.4 million in inflows, but long-term returns of -66%. ETFs require scale to remain viable, with ongoing costs tied to compliance, fund administration, custody, marketing, and distribution. When assets under management fail to reach sustainable levels, maintaining a product becomes economically unfeasible, regardless of broader market demand.

In a lengthy post on X on Friday, Buterin outlined sweeping technical and philosophical shifts aimed at reversing a decade of centralization drift across nodes, wallets, applications, and block building. “ 2026 is the year that we take back lost ground in terms of self-sovereignty and trustlessness, ” Buterin wrote. The manifesto indicates Ethereum’s sharpest pivot yet away from convenience-driven design choices that diluted core values, framing the moment as existential for the network’s long-term legitimacy and expanded role in global infrastructure. 2026 is the year that we take back lost ground in terms of self-sovereignty and trustlessness. Some of what this practically means: Full nodes: thanks to ZK-EVM and BAL, it will once again become easier to locally run a node and verify the Ethereum chain on your own computer.… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2026 Technical Roadmap Targets Node Accessibility and Privacy Infrastructure Buterin’s plan centers on making full node operation practical again through zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and Block Access Limits, reversing years of rising hardware requirements that pushed verification off personal computers. “ Full nodes: thanks to ZK-EVM and BAL, it will once again become easier to locally run a node and verify the Ethereum chain on your own computer, ” he stated. The roadmap also prioritizes Helios to “ actually verify the data you’re receiving from RPCs instead of blindly trusting it, ” alongside oblivious RAM and private information retrieval protocols enabling users to “ ask for data from RPCs without revealing which data you’re asking, so you can access dapps without your access patterns being sold off to dozens of third parties all around the world. “ Social recovery wallets with timelocks will provide “ wallets that don’t make you lose all your money if you misplace your seedphrase, or if an online or offline attacker extracts your seedphrase, and also don’t make all your money backdoored by Google. ” Privacy features will integrate directly into wallet interfaces to “ make private payments from your wallet, with the same user experience as making public payments. “ Application interfaces will shift toward onchain hosting via IPFS to avoid “ relying on trusted servers that would lock you our of practical recovery of your assets if they went offline, and would give you a hijacked UI that steals your funds if they get hacked for even a millisecond. ” Buterin warned that “ over the last ten years we have seen serious backsliding in Ethereum, ” with nodes going “ from easy to run to hard to run ” and dapps shifting “ from static pages to complicated behemoths that leak all your data to a dozen servers. “ Long-Term Vision Beyond Immediate Protocol Upgrades Buterin acknowledged the transformation will not arrive quickly but emphasized its necessity. “ Every compromise of values that Ethereum has made up to this point – every moment where you might have been thinking, is it really worth diluting ourselves so much in the name of mainstream adoption – we are making that compromise no longer, ” he declared. “ It will be a long road. We will not get everything we want in the next Kohaku release, or the next hard fork, or the hard fork after that. But it will make Ethereum into an ecosystem that deserves not only its current place in the universe, but a much greater one, ” Buterin wrote. He concluded that “ In the world computer, there is no centralized overlord. There is no single point of failure. There is only love. “ Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum solved blockchain's trilemma with ZKEVMs and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet after decade-long development. #Ethereum #Buterin https://t.co/cUzlhhO6Xr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 4, 2026 The manifesto comes as Ethereum achieves breakthroughs on the blockchain trilemma through ZKEVMs and PeerDAS technology . The network has activated its second Blob Parameter-Only hard fork, raising the blob limit from 15 to 21 and expanding data capacity to support rollup scaling while maintaining low base-layer fees. Network growth has also accelerated sharply , with new active addresses climbing from just over 4 million to around 8 million in the past month and daily transactions hitting a record 2.8 million, roughly 125% higher than year-earlier levels. Glassnode data shows that month-over-month activity retention has nearly doubled in the newest user cohort, indicating that new participants are staying engaged rather than churning after initial interactions.

57250173,https://timestabloid.com/?p=95232,1768673110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Confirmed: State Street Utilizes XRP and XLM. Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/confirmed-state-street-utilizes-xrp-and-xlm-heres-the-latest/,"Institutional finance stands on the brink of a profound transformation as traditional custodians and banking giants integrate blockchain‑enabled tokenization into their core infrastructure. In a decisive shift from exploratory pilots to production‑grade systems, State Street has launched a Digital Asset Platform designed to support tokenized instruments such as money market funds, ETFs, and stablecoin cash products for institutional clients. This platform reinforces the firm’s strategic objective of bridging legacy financial systems with the emerging digital asset economy. According to SMQKE’s post on X, this new phase in State Street’s digital expansion leans heavily on Securrency, a blockchain tokenization middleware that explicitly integrates Ripple’s XRP Ledger and Stellar’s XLM into its infrastructure. SMQKE’s insights, coupled with broader industry documentation, confirm that these integrations position XRP and XLM as supported networks within the tokenization stack that underpins State Street’s offering. CONFIRMED: STATE STREET UTILIZES XRP AND XLM AS PART OF ITS TOKENIZATION INFRASTRUCTURE VIA SECURRENCY According to a 2024 confidential report on the institutional tokenization landscape, Securrency is identified as a core tokenization platform. Under its “Used… https://t.co/1spnEOJbwR pic.twitter.com/OQrfX2KfDc — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 17, 2026 State Street’s Tokenization Infrastructure State Street’s Digital Asset Platform aims to deliver a secure, scalable foundation for tokenized financial products, combining wallet management, custody services, and cash capabilities within a unified interface for clients. Built to function across private and public permissioned blockchains, the platform embeds on‑chain compliance controls and integrates smoothly with the bank’s existing operational environments. This infrastructure marks a significant escalation from experimentation toward institutional readiness, empowering clients to adopt tokenized finance with robust governance and compliance. Central to this infrastructure is Securrency’s blockchain‑agnostic tokenization framework. Securrency enables the issuance and lifecycle management of digital assets with embedded compliance rules and multi‑chain interoperability. Historically, Securrency’s protocols—such as its Compliance Aware Token standards—support issuance and transfer across distributed ledgers, including Ethereum, Stellar, Ripple, and others, ensuring tokens remain compliant across jurisdictions and technical boundaries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Role of XRP and XLM The explicit inclusion of Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) within Securrency’s integration catalog signals more than theoretical compatibility: it embeds these public blockchain networks into a live, institutional tokenization workflow. By supporting XRP Ledger and Stellar as part of its blockchain integrations, Securrency enables State Street to offer tokenization services that leverage the unique technical characteristics of these networks—such as fast settlement times, low transaction costs, and scalable asset issuance. For XRP, this means its underlying ledger can be used as a settlement or value transfer layer within tokenized finance frameworks. For Stellar, the network’s design for asset issuance and cross‑border transactions offers a compelling environment for tokenized assets and programmable financial products. Implications for Institutional Adoption State Street’s implementation of a tokenization platform that integrates XRP and XLM via Securrency reflects a larger trend within the financial sector. Institutional players increasingly prioritize blockchain interoperability alongside regulatory compliance, moving toward systems that can support a diverse ecosystem of public ledger technologies. This configuration enables banks and asset managers to issue, transfer, and settle tokenized securities while maintaining alignment with global compliance regimes and client servicing expectations. As tokenization evolves from proof‑of‑concept to mainstream deployment, the integration of XRP and XLM into State Street’s digital infrastructure stands as a significant validation of these networks’ relevance to the future of institutional finance.

57250836,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=896728,1768674600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57250836.jpeg,Ripple (XRP) Pushes Upwards While One New Crypto Explodes in Popularity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-xrp-pushes-upwards-while-one-new-crypto-explodes-in-popularity/,"As Ripple (XRP) is slowly recovering through new institutional investments, another new cryptocurrency has also emerged in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is a DeFi crypto that is gaining popularity because of its utility-focused model, which features a decentralized lending and borrowing platform. This ensures that there is actual utility created in the blockchain rather than simple speculation. Currently, MUTM is in Phase 7 of its presale stage, priced at $0.04 and also has an increasing community base among its holders. XRP Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) has recently climbed above $2 as the crypto market recovers. However, XRP faces strong resistance at $2.40 and $3 levels. The crypto maintains a top spot in the market, but growth remains capped. Investors looking for the next big thing are turning towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Security and Incentives Security is one of the foundations of the development of the Mutuum Finance project. The project has undergone a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score and partnered with Halborn Security for the full audit of the core lending/borrowing contracts. To complement these audits, a $50,000 bug bounty program encourages external security researchers to search for potential security issues before the project is released to the public. In addition to the technical security measures, MUTM also encourages and rewards engagement. The top presale contributor each day wins $500 in MUTM, and a $100,000 giveaway will reward ten people with $10,000 each. These efforts encourage people to engage with the platform and increase the number of holders as it gets ready for the Sepolia testnet and mainnet launch. Momentum in Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance has helped in designing a growth chart that favors early birds. Phase 7 is the final chances for investors to invest at $0.04 before entering Phase 8, where the prices increase to $0.045. Entering early means reaping the biggest rewards. For example, an individual who invests $5,000 in MUTM when it is at $0.04 will end up seeing their value rise to $7,500 when MUTM launches at $0.06, a gain of $2,500 long before the crowd catches on. Projections after launch indicate that if MUTM has adoption levels seen in other successful DeFi crypto tokens in their early stages, that initial $5,000 may be worth more than $100,000 when MUTM reaches a value of $1. This shows why this new crypto is being closely followed by early adopters. L2 Integration Makes DeFi Affordable The integration of Layer-2 technology by Mutuum Finance brings about greater accessibility of decentralized finance. In Ethereum’s mainnet network, for instance, a small investor who wishes to invest $1,000 worth of ETH as collateral to borrow the platform’s stablecoin may end up paying between $20 and $50 for gas fees for a series of transactions such as depositing, borrowing, repaying, and withdrawing. With a Layer 2 network, the same transactions can be had for as little as cents. It becomes easier for investors to organize their loans and collateral, close positions when necessary, or prepay a loan when it suits them without diminishing returns through fees. Mutuum Finance thus opens the door for smaller investors to take a proactive role in DeFi. Not only will this cost-effective solution ensure that lending and borrowing are no longer the domain of whale investors, but it will also make Mutuum Finance an even more inclusive and viable DeFi crypto solution and further cement the sustainability and future success of the protocol. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Investors are beginning to realize that in terms of early entry investment opportunities in DeFi crypto, Mutuum Finance offers something unique. It offers more than what’s already in the market. Despite XRP’s recovery, the new crypto stands out as the better investment.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, and December the decline continued with SOL ending the year at the $125 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 18:40:50

Why Market Strategist Cut 10% BTC Exposure Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, has dropped a 10% allocation to Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, from his model portfolio. In his latest “Greed & Fear” newsletter release, the market strategist highlighted the rise of quantum computing as the reason behind this move. Wood highlighted his fears that the advances in quantum computing could threaten Bitcoin’s place and reputation as a dependable store of value, especially in the long term. As the expert said in his newsletter, the market is currently riddled with the fear that quantum computing could be just a few years away. This growing concern borders on quantum computers being hypothesized to have the capacity to breach the Bitcoin network’s cryptographic technology. It is believed that these computers can enable attackers to reverse-engineer private keys from public ones, thereby tampering with the integrity of blockchain transactions. Wood, who was an early institutional supporter of BTC , initially added the premier cryptocurrency to his model portfolio in December 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, the Jefferies global head of equity strategy expanded this Bitcoin allocation to 10%. However, the market expert appears to now be viewing the flagship cryptocurrency with a little bit of skepticism, as he believes that the Quantum threat is potentially existential, undermining its status as a store of value and “digital alternative to gold.” Hence, Wood refocused his model portfolio on older assets, splitting the 10% BTC allocation equally between physical gold and gold mining stocks. While there is no clear timeline for when quantum computers will reach the market, Wood is not the only one who has recently expressed concerns about the Quantum threat. In the past week, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has also discussed how Bitcoin has decoupled from global liquidity due to the quantum threat. Edwards wrote on X: The timeframe to a non-zero probability of a quantum machine breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is now less than the estimated time it will take to upgrade Bitcoin. Money is repositioning to account for this risk accordingly. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $95,370, reflecting a 0.3% dip in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Quantum Computing Threat|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 19:00:51

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/real-estate-investor-xrp-bulls-are-set-for-massive-rally-heres-the-signal/,"The cryptocurrency market is waking up to a fresh wave of excitement as XRP shows signs of breaking free from its previous consolidation phase. Early 2026 has already delivered notable gains for the digital asset, and analysts are now pointing to structural technical developments that could catalyze a major rally. Traders and investors are closely watching key price levels, volume trends, and market behavior for confirmation that XRP is transitioning from range-bound movement to a bullish uptrend. Gordon Highlights the Breakout On X, web3 investor Gordon drew attention to XRP’s recent price action, directly challenging bearish sentiment and highlighting a critical technical signal that could spark further upside. XRP Bulls are about to PRINT. Imagine being bearish here pic.twitter.com/r09tnWOBVJ — Gordon (@GordonGekko) January 17, 2026 He showcased a three-day XRP/USD chart on Binance illustrating a decisive breakout above a descending trendline , accompanied by rising trading volume. Gordon’s analysis emphasized that buyers have gained control, setting the stage for a potential surge that could catch hesitant bears off guard. Technical Analysis: Trendline Break and Volume Surge XRP’s breakout comes after months of a descending trend that had capped price movement. The breakout aligns with increased trading volume, signaling strong market conviction rather than a fleeting spike. Momentum indicators such as the 50- and 100-day EMAs now act as support, reinforcing the bullish case and suggesting that XRP has the technical foundation to pursue higher levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Support and Resistance Levels The current price structure shows that previous resistance zones around $2.00 have transformed into support, while near-term targets include the $2.88 region, derived from standard technical modeling. Sustaining momentum above these levels could propel XRP into an extended discovery phase, especially if institutional inflows and market demand remain robust. Market Context: A Favorable Environment for XRP XRP’s technical strength coincides with broader market resilience. Leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have maintained upward momentum, creating a supportive environment for altcoins. Reduced exchange supply , ETF-related inflows , and rising market confidence further reinforce the conditions for XRP to build on its early 2026 gains. Bulls Prepare for Potential Upside With a confirmed trendline breakout, rising volume, and supportive market dynamics, XRP bulls appear poised for a significant rally. While market volatility always presents risk, current indicators suggest that XRP has positioned itself for meaningful upward movement, rewarding traders who recognize the early signs of bullish momentum.

The 50-period moving average has crossed below the 200-period moving average, signaling potential weakness in the short-term trend. The development marks a sharp reversal from the optimistic sentiment that characterized early January. SHIB currently trades at $0.00000853, up 2.64% over the past 24 hours despite a bearish technical signal. Early 2026 Rally Proves Unsustainable Shiba Inu began the year with significant momentum. The token surged to $0.00001017 within the first few days of January, riding a wave of enthusiasm sweeping the meme coin market. The rally proved short-lived. Between January 6 and January 12, SHIB declined in six consecutive sessions out of seven trading days. Profit-taking activity accelerated as early buyers locked in gains from the initial price spike. A brief recovery attempt saw the token climb to $0.00000912. Bears quickly regained control, pushing prices lower once again. The subsequent sell-off drove SHIB down to $0.00000815, marking a two-day losing streak. Meme coins have struggled to maintain upward momentum. Traders appear increasingly willing to sell into strength rather than accumulate positions. The absence of new catalysts has left the sector vulnerable to quick reversals. Technical Patterns Show Mixed Signals The current hourly death cross is not the first such occurrence in recent weeks. SHIB experienced a similar pattern on December 31, 2025, as the previous year drew to a close. That bearish signal was quickly negated. A golden cross appeared on the hourly chart as 2026 began, coinciding with the strong price rally that followed. The rapid shift between bearish and bullish crossovers highlights the volatility inherent in short-term technical indicators. Source: TradingView Hourly moving average crossovers can signal important shifts in fast-moving markets. Their predictive value remains limited in many cases. The Shiba Inu price action demonstrates how quickly these patterns can reverse, particularly in high-volume, speculative assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 19:19:53
57251667,https://timestabloid.com/?p=95250,1768677697,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Challenge of Finding Regulated Operators for Niche Cryptocurrency Holders,https://timestabloid.com/the-challenge-of-finding-regulated-operators-for-niche-cryptocurrency/,"You’re likely always on the hunt to find out how to increase utility. Your digital portfolio extends far beyond the trading strategies. The move to utilize assets such as XRP or Shiba Inu for entertainment is a natural progression. It’s among many investors who desire real-life applications for their coins. The situation is complicated, however, as regulatory frameworks haven’t kept pace. They’ve struggled with the rapid spread of niche cryptocurrencies. Even though you have to go through a field of hay, BonusFinder makes it easier to find a reliable site. It ranks the operators according to particular requirements concerning coin support and licensing. You don’t want to entrust your online money to a site that hasn’t undergone stringent scrutiny by experts in the field. The abundance of new platforms emerging monthly means you can’t manually review them one by one. It’s impossible unless you’re professionally guided to do so. The Growing Demand for Utility Among Altcoin Holders Likely, you’ve already observed a significant change in the market for digital assets . They’re no longer regarded as pure stores of value nowadays. The owners of niche coins are also seeking platforms enabling them to make transactions directly. They won’t have to convert them to fiat currency. The need for speed necessitates this, along with reduced transaction costs and, to a certain degree, anonymity. They’re all key features of blockchain technology. Using your crypto directly has the advantage of saving time in the traditional banking system because it’s faster. You’ll keep all your money until you choose to use a service. This ensures your assets retain their long-term value, provided conditions don’t shift. You can use them where the context stays stable. Why Finding Regulated Operators Is a Major Challenge The primary issue is that even stringent regulatory authorities in jurisdictions like the United Kingdom or Malta lag. They’re extremely slow in licensing niche altcoins for use in regulated gaming. The vast majority of licensed operators are likely to remain in Bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s because compliance processes for these instruments are more developed. This leaves a considerable gap in the market on your hold should you own lesser market-cap coins. It’s common to be compelled to seek business elsewhere, beyond the highly controlled circles, to find operators that’ll accept your particular tokens. Such a search subjects you to a gray marketplace where the line between a legitimate business and a scam is fragile. The Hidden Dangers of Using Unlicensed Crypto Sites Whenever you decide to work on an unregulated site, you’re entering a digital world with no safety net whatsoever. The potential is much greater than losing a round in a game. You risk drowning because the software was rigged, and winning was merely a statistical impossibility. Moreover, unregulated services may not have the legal authority to accommodate withdrawal requests. Therefore, your money may be held without a reason. Another factor worth considering is the security of personal data, as these sites often use less secure protocols. Encryption and data protection aren’t as robust as those of licensed counterparts. The security breach may compromise the wallet address, allowing bad actors to access it. It’s exposing the transaction history on a disregarded site. Utilizing Verification Tools to Ensure Your Safety That’s when you consider the third-party verification to be a critical component of your plan. You’ll need a mechanism for sifting through the noise and identifying platforms to trust. Ensure they’re thoroughly audited in terms of fairness and security. Aggregator sites conduct the due diligence that you may not have the time to perform on your own. They verify that one of the operators is licensed and assess the responsiveness of customer service. They ensure that the random number generators in games are genuine and unbiased. With such resources, you can ease the burden of verifying your choice on your own. You’ll come across a list of approved, safe options that store your particular cryptocurrency. Essential Criteria You Must Check Before Playing A good license from a competent jurisdiction must always be sought before even 1% of your holdings can be deposited. It’s required even with a reputable jurisdiction displayed on the home page. The terms and conditions regarding cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals should be carefully read. There should be no hidden costs or excessively high minimum wagers. You should also verify that the site is encrypted using SSL, ensuring the safety of the connection. It also provides two-factor authentication for your user access. A reputable operator will always display clear policies and user satisfaction metrics, which you can verify through independent reviews. Transforming Your Digital Assets Into Safe Entertainment The crypto dimension offers you unparalleled freedom and financial self-reliance . That freedom is contingent on securing your own assets. To use online sites through the niche coins, you should be aware and watchful of the whereabouts of your money. The terms enable you to enjoy the entertainment value of your digital assets without compromising their security, provided you manage them effectively. You’ll have to rely on the appropriate tools to inform your choices. By using operators that are thoroughly tested, you’ll be assured your experience is delightful. Additionally, you can rest assured knowing that your crypto remains secure. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Market participants are watching closely to see if the uptrend can continue or if the weekend liquidity will trigger a test of lower levels. The next few sessions could define BTC’s short-term trajectory. Key Support Holds: $94,630 Remains Crucial According to a recent post by Kamile Uray, Bitcoin is still holding strong above the $89,326 support level, and as long as it remains above this zone, the possibility for the uptrend to continue remains intact. This level continues to act as a critical foundation for bulls, keeping the market structure aligned with potential further gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Near-Identical Fractal Before The 2021 Bull Run Started If BTC manages to break through the $98,200 resistance, the next key target at $107,500 comes into focus. At this level, a decisive move will determine whether the current uptrend is complete or push Bitcoin even higher. A daily close above $107,500 would mark the first higher high on the daily chart relative to the last downward wave, signaling a potential continuation of the bullish trend. However, if BTC is rejected at resistance and falls back below $89,326, the downtrend could resume. Should a reversal form within the $83,822–$82,477 support zone, Bitcoin may attempt another upward push, giving bulls a chance to regain control. If BTC closes below $82,477, further downside is expected, potentially testing the $74,496–$71,237 region. This zone has historically served as a strong support area, and any confirmed reversal from here could set the stage for another bullish leg. Bitcoin Weekend Liquidity Ahead: Expect Range-Bound Action Crypto expert Lennaert Snyder outlined that Bitcoin is holding the key $94,630 support level, which also serves as the crucial H4 level to hold. On Friday, BTC retraced and briefly swept this low before stabilizing, reinforcing the importance of this zone for short-term market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Compresses Below $94K, But Possible Repeat Of 2025 Breakout Looms As we enter the weekend liquidity, Bitcoin is likely to trade within a defined range until Sunday evening or Monday. For bullish traders, the plan is to hold the low and watch for a market structure break above $95,820. Once this occurs, long positions could target the $97,960 monthly high. In anticipation of continued upside, only part of the position may be closed at the monthly high, letting 30%-40% run to capture further gains if momentum persists. However, if BTC loses the $94,630 support on the H4 and falls back into the previous range, a continuation toward lower lows becomes more likely. In that scenario, short positions would be considered after confirmation on a retest, giving traders a structured approach to managing risk and potential downside.

On Saturday, he woke up bright and early to announce that goods from eight NATO countries will face new tariffs , starting at 10% on February 1, and jumping to 25% by June 1, unless they agree to sell Greenland to the United States. The list includes Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Finland. In a Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “Until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” these tariffs will stay. He said this was a direct response to those countries sending troops to Greenland, something he clearly saw as an unwanted move into what he thinks should be American territory. Trump didn’t exactly explain why those countries were sending troops, but said, “They have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown.” He added , “This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.” Europe responds as Trump leans on tariff threat A day before posting the new tariff plan, Trump said he was considering using a similar strategy he used against foreign drug companies. “I may do that for Greenland too,” he said during a White House appearance Friday. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security.” The eight European countries didn’t waste time reacting. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen blasted the move. “We choose partnership and cooperation,” she said on Bluesky. “We choose our businesses. We choose our people.” She framed the tariffs not just as a trade issue but as a bigger threat to Western unity. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also responded, saying on Thursday that the defense of Greenland is a “common concern” for all NATO members. The timing of Trump’s announcement is not random. The U.S. military has been showing more interest in Greenland for months. Now, these European countries are doing the same. That seems to be what triggered Trump’s response. He’s trying to stop what he sees as others getting in the way of America’s Arctic plans. Senators challenge Trump’s claims and urge calm On the same day Trump posted about the tariffs, two U.S. senators landed in Copenhagen to try to cool things down. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska met with officials to push back on Trump’s narrative. “There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,” Coons told reporters Saturday. He said the trip was meant to “restore a sense of trust” with the region and challenge the idea that European troop deployments are part of some conspiracy. Both Coons and Murkowski said they viewed the presence of NATO troops in Greenland as a good sign, not a threat. “Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth… we should take as an encouraging signal,” Coons said. Murkowski also rejected the idea that the president’s position represents all of Washington. “You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,” she said. “Support for our friends and allies… should not be.” Trump’s new strategy may suggest that he’s stepping away from using military action to grab the island. But he’s not letting go of the idea. Greenland is still very much on his radar, and tariffs are now his weapon of choice. Behind the scenes, there’s also a legal fight brewing. Trump has been using a special law that gives presidents economic powers during emergencies. That’s how he’s been pushing out these tariffs. But the Supreme Court could rule on that law as early as next week, deciding if the whole thing holds up or not. Trump has used tariffs more than any president in modern history.

The meme coin made gains of over 100x, and this made several people crypto millionaires. However, for those who missed this investment opportunity, there is a new DeFi cryptocurrency that is currently creating a buzz during its presale, and this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Many people consider this to be the best cryptocurrency to buy at this moment since it is accumulating a strong community and has a genuine utility-based roadmap. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance’s DeFi lending and borrowing platform is expected to ensure that there is continuous on-chain demand, and this will enable those who are investing during its presale to enjoy tremendous gains through asymmetric growth potential. In fact, it is being predicted that an investment of $150 could multiply to gains of over 100x soon. Shiba Inu’s Consolidation Although Shiba Inu was one of the best performers in the previous cycle, it seems to have been stagnant since the start of 2026. The price of SHIB has begun an accumulation phase after touching the downside levels, meaning that it is no longer facing so many sell pressures, although it is also lacking momentum. The next major move for Shiba Inu could be experienced in the year 2026, targeting levels of $0.00014-$0.00039. Although there is some speculative use for SHIB, Mutuum Finance seems more attractive for investors looking for some useful value along with high growth potential. Presale Rewards Early Investors The presale of Mutuum Finance has already started yielding returns for early investors, starting at $0.01 in early 2025, rising to $0.04 in Phase 7, a massive 300% increase. Phase 8 is anticipated to start at $0.045, further reinforcing the importance of investing in the project at this early juncture. For example, an investor with $1,500 in the current price structure will see it rise to $1,800 when Phase 8 starts, securing a $300 profit before the market even begins. When Mutuum Finance finally enters the market with a price of $0.06, this particular investment will grow in value to $2,250, securing a $750 profit. Market experts believe that once it establishes itself in the market, even a meager investment of $150 in this phase could see it rise in value to $15,000 or more, making it the best cryptocurrency to purchase. Community Rewards The presale is also aided by an excellent community incentive structure. In a $100,000 giveaway , ten individuals will win $10,000. In addition, there is a $500 MUTM bonus for the top daily buyer. This has managed to attract interest in this project at an earlier stage, with potential to be the next crypto to explode. Dual Lending System: Flexibility and Returns The two-lending structure of Mutuum Finance is one of the important components of this project. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses automated liquidity pools that have variable interest rates. For example, if one invests $4,000 in ETH, it might generate an interest rate between 8% and 12% per annum. In this manner, without doing anything else, it is possible to generate an additional $320 to $480 per annum. The Peer-to-Peer system, on the other hand, lets users set interest rates by themselves. A lender might seek a higher interest rate in a volatile asset such as Shiba Inu. Security & Transparency Security is also a key part of this platform. The smart contract of this platform is audited by both Certik and Halborn Security. The contract also has safety features against liquidation and collateral. MUTM is set to be the next crypto to explode with its distinct lending mechanisms and a scalable and secure system. What Makes MUTM Stand Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) symbolizes much more than another cryptocurrency in an already saturated market. Its low entry fee of only $0.04, presale growth, dual lending platform, and Layer-2 scalability solution combine to represent an unprecedented investment opportunity for those looking to invest in the next crypto to explode. MUTM has all the right elements to bring growth-hungry investors to the table in a way that was represented in SHIB. As such, it has become known as the best crypto to buy today because of its perceived ability to be one of the next cryptos to explode.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-breaking-out-of-6-month-descending-wedge-heres-the-implication/,"XRP is capturing attention in early 2026 as price action nears a critical inflection point . After months of consolidation, the digital asset has compressed within a tightening structure, hinting at a potential breakout that could redefine short-term momentum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring key technical levels, anticipating a move that could unlock renewed upside and attract both retail and institutional participation. Bird Highlights the Wedge Breakout Potential On X, crypto analyst Bird (@Bird_XRPL) spotlighted XRP’s six-month descending wedge on Binance, with price trading around $2.07, roughly 15% below the wedge’s upper resistance near $2.38. Bird suggested that a single strong green candle could flip the chart’s structure bullishly, potentially accelerating XRP toward its all-time high of $3.84 from 2018. His observations reflect a broader consensus among technical traders that XRP sits on the cusp of a decisive move. XRP is ~15% from breaking out of this 6 month wedge. One strong green candle flips structure and opens the path toward all time highs very fast imo. This MAY VERY WELL be the moment. Hold your breath. Count to three. pic.twitter.com/IWwoK3jLGI — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 17, 2026 Technical Structure: Descending Wedge Dynamics A descending wedge forms when price makes progressively lower highs and lower lows that converge, indicating weakening selling pressure. In technical analysis, this pattern often precedes trend reversals to the upside. XRP’s wedge displays classic characteristics: diminishing volatility, contracting ranges, and steady accumulation, signaling that buyers may soon overpower sellers. To confirm the breakout, the price must move above the wedge’s upper boundary with increasing volume, ensuring genuine market conviction supports the advance. Current Price Action and Market Context Since late 2025, XRP has consolidated around the $2.00 mark while broader market factors—including institutional inflows and overall crypto market strength—have supported price stability. Early January 2026 saw XRP rally toward $2.34, demonstrating resilience and reinforcing the potential for the wedge breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Indicators such as rising on-chain activity, accumulation patterns, and alignment with other short-term bullish structures suggest that XRP’s price is primed for a swift upward trajectory once resistance yields. Implications of a Breakout A confirmed breakout above $2.38 would invalidate the six-month descending trend, creating a structural shift that could accelerate momentum toward higher targets. This scenario may attract renewed attention from both retail traders and institutional participants, amplifying buying pressure and potentially triggering a rapid advance. Conversely, failure to clear the resistance may maintain price within the wedge, prolonging sideways action but still preserving the setup for a future breakout. XRP’s current positioning within this descending wedge represents a pivotal moment for the asset’s short-term narrative, with the potential to catalyze a meaningful rally if buyers assert dominance.

Metaplanet recently purchased $632.5 million worth of Bitcoin and plans to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, while Bitmine currently holds over 4.2 million ETH and aims to own 5% of all Ethereum in existence. Metaplanet’s Gerovich explains why companies choose Bitcoin Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, noted earlier today that most management teams do not discuss Bitcoin, and the few teams that do consider it must be willing to be misunderstood by the markets for years while they build their positions. In January 2026, Metaplanet made its largest Bitcoin purchase yet, buying 5,419 BTC for approximately $632.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 25,555 BTC. Metaplanet is now the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. The company is following a new strategy called the “555 Million Plan.” The goal is to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. This would represent 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Metaplanet has since launched a U.S. subsidiary called Metaplanet Income Corp. that will focus on “Bitcoin income generation,” using financial tools like derivatives to create more value from their holdings. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum, controlling about 3.45% of the token’s total supply. Tom Lee’s ultimate goal, which Bitmine calls the “Alchemy of 5%,” is to own 5% of all Ethereum in circulation. The company’s Chairman, Thomas Lee, also known for his work at Fundstrat, believes Ethereum will see a major breakout in 2026. Standard Chartered also recently predicted that Ethereum could reach a price of $7,500 to $12,000 by 2026. If Ethereum reaches $12,000, Bitmine projections suggest its share price could rise significantly to $500. As Cryptopolitan reported during the week, Bitmine is investing $200 million into Beast Industries, the company founded by the famous YouTuber MrBeast. Bitmine plans to integrate DeFi services into MrBeast’s upcoming financial platforms, targeting those in his audience of over 450 million subscribers who are already comfortable with digital technology. Strategy, ETFs, and other corporate BTC, ETH reserves in 2026 Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, has continued with its “HODL” strategy in 2026, and as of January 12, it reported total holdings of 687,410 BTC. Financial analysts at TD Cowen recently raised their acquisition forecasts for the firm, predicting that Strategy will purchase approximately 155,000 Bitcoins during the 2026 fiscal year. In mid-January 2026, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a single-day inflow of $843.62 million, pushing total net inflows for these funds above $58 billion. Ethereum ETFs also raked in $175 million in a single day this month. Massive inflows of cash into the market have helped stabilize it, with Bitcoin trading near $95,000 and Ethereum at $3,367 as of January 17. Bitmine revealed that it plans to generate between $402 million and $433 million in annual pre-tax income through “staking” its Ethereum. The process will be done through the “Made in America Validator Network” (MAVAN), set to be launched in the first quarter of 2026. Get seen where it counts.

What was once viewed as a niche interest among tech enthusiasts is now gaining traction across broader segments of the state’s population. As residents become more curious about digital assets, conversations are shifting from speculation to understanding how BTC works and what it could mean for personal and regional economic resilience. Bitcoin As A Tool For Regional Economic Growth West Virginia has been making headlines in the Bitcoin space recently, particularly with fresh legislative moves as of January 2026. MartyParty revealed on X that the biggest current development is Senator Bill 143 (SB143), which was introduced this week by State Senator Chris Rose. This is officially titled the Inflation Protection Act of 2026, which would allow the state’s Board of Treasury Investment to allocate up to 10% of public funds into precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum. The bill requires any qualifying digital asset to have maintained an average market capitalization of at least $750 billion over the prior year, which qualifies only BTC. In addition, the bill also allows for regulated stablecoins , but only the US federal or state regulators can approve the assets. However, the bill frames this as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation, and empowering the state treasurer to invest in BTC without directly naming it in most of the statute. Although the purpose section explicitly mentions empowering investment in gold, silver, and BTC. These assets would need to be made through qualified custodians, ETFs, or other secure frameworks. What Pension Funds And Endowments Think About Bitcoin The Bitcoin price prediction by funds indicates a bullish outlook for 2026. CryptoRank.io has mentioned that the institutional analysts are pricing in a bullish scenario for BTC in 2026. The average target across the forecasts shown is around $150,000 per BTC, implying roughly 75% upside from current levels. At the same time, longer-term valuation models assume a more gradual growth path . Popular asset manager VanEck predicts BTC could reach approximately $2.9 million by 2050, which equates to around 15% annualized growth broadly in line with the BTC historical long-term performance as a macro asset. In contrast to institutional forecasts, prediction markets maintain a more conservative outlook. On Polymarket , the pricing base-case range between $110,000 to $130,000. This consensus could shift toward the institutional targets if spot ETF inflows remain strong and if the US regulatory uncertainty continues to decline, including initiatives such as the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Chris Rose|CryptoRank.io|gold|Inflation Protection Act of 2026|Platinum|Polymarket|SB143|Senator Bill 143|silver|Spot ETF|Stablecoins|US Regulatory Uncertainty|vaneck,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 21:00:00

Although the second-largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the $3,300 price level, it could not break above $3,400 to continue its path towards higher price levels. As it stands, it appears that the Ether token is taking on a short-term bearish structure. However, an on-chain evaluation has recently been put out, which suggests that market participants might be gearing up for a significant move in the near-term. Related Reading: The Ethereum MACD Crossover That Could Lead To A Massive Bull Wave Ethereum Futures Activity Reaches Monthly High Following Market Inactivity In a recent QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, analytics group Arab Chain reveals that there has recently been a spike in futures trading activity on the Binance derivatives market. This revelation is based on the Binance: ETH Futures Daily Volume metric, which monitors the total value of Ethereum futures contracts being traded on Binance each day, hence reflecting market activity, trader participation, and potential leverage exposure. The latest reading of the metric has highlighted a major shift, with trading volume climbing as high as $21.7 billion. According to Arab Chain, this reading marks the highest level since mid-December, reflecting that strong momentum has returned to the futures market. Notably, the spike in futures trading volume was preceded by a period of relative decline in the second half of December. This event coincides with a period of price stability, alongside a tapering risk appetite among traders. Interestingly, institutional investors also contributed prevalent aversion to risk. Arab Chain explains that the decline is a typical sign that market participants want to “wait and see,” instead of speculatively opening large positions. However, the present scenario — where futures volume surged — paints an opposing story. As the futures trading volume reflects levels above its mid-December high, it becomes apparent that interest among Ethereum traders is being rekindled. This is because increasing futures volume “is typically associated with higher leverage usage, hedging activity, and speculative positioning” — a line up which indicates that the market is preparing for significant movement. The reason for this spike could also be attributed to traders who are reacting to key technical levels or shifting expectations around near-term price action of a potential trend reversal. In the grand scheme, however, the Ethereum price reacts to this activity, depending on the alignment of spot demand with derivatives activity. Till such a definite sign comes up, the market stands at a point of uncertainty.

Commentators have noted that unlike previous spikes characterized by lower trading volumes, this surge seems to be backed by considerable trading activity and bullish market sentiments. Axie Infinity’s AXS is up over 100% in the past week According to data from Coingecko , Axie Infinity’s token $AXS went on a run today, surging by about 64% to approximately $2.02 and topping charts as the leader in the broader GameFi sector . Today’s rally comes after months of bearish movements and is happening as interest in the gaming sector is returning with multiple gaming tokens turning green, much to the delight of traders and investors. The price surge of the AXS token comes amid a marked improvement in daily trading volume, with the past 24 hours pulling in over $997M while the overall market cap stands at over $346M, indicating increased investor engagement. Analysts have attributed this positive price action to a return of investor appetite for high volatility sectors like GameFi as well as futures market activity and staking adjustments. The futures trading volume has exceeded $500M with open interest hovering around $44M, signaling short coverings and the creation of new positions. All that is happening amid recent changes to the project’s staking program as well as the introduction of new incentives, including an Axie Score rewards experiment scheduled for this year. More about Axie Infinity’s score reward The score reward is a metric that will reportedly reflect a player’s contributions to the Axie Infinity community, influencing governance and rewards. According to recent announcements, that reward will be transitioned into an app token version of AXS (bAXS). The token will be able to be spent in Axie core as well as staked. The team plans to integrate Axie’s reputation, the Axie score, into the selling mechanic. There will also be a variable fee, paid to the treasury, that gets charged to a seller of the token, with the fee reduced for those with higher tiers of Axie score. “A good day for $AXS, but the true story here is the structural changes to supply that we’re making this year,” the project’s cofounder wrote on X. According to more recent updates, bAXS (Bonded AXS) will be backed 1:1 by AXS and designed to keep value circulating within the ecosystem and rewarding its citizens. “This is the start of a transformative year for Axie Infinity, something is coming and the strongest will survive by working together as one digital nation,” one X post shared via the Axie Infinity account on X read. Which GameFi tokens are doing well in 2026? The GameFi sector is witnessing a resurgence in interest. The overall sector’s market cap is currently around $7 billion, up 6.3% in the past 24 hours. While Axie Infinity is leading the charge, it is not the only GameFi project witnessing bullish movement. Based on data from Coingecko , other tokens doing well in the GameFi sector include Ronin (RON), the Sandbox (SAND), Smooth Love Potion (SLP), Decentraland (MANA), and Illuvium (ILV). RON’s price has gone up by about 20% in the past 24 hours and 28% in the past seven days; SAND’s is up 30% in the past 24 hours and 32% over the past 7 days; SLP is up 14% in 24 hours and 16% over the past week; MANA is also up 21% in 24 hours and 18% over the past seven days and ILV is up 15% in 24 hours and 14% over the past seven days.

The records cover closed-door debates from 2020 and show how the Fed chair pushed hard for clear promises on interest rates , even as several officials warned the move could box the central bank in later. Those warnings stayed mostly private at the time. The September 2020 meeting took place six months into the pandemic, with rates already pinned near zero since March. Powell argued the moment demanded blunt guidance. He wanted the Fed to spell out exactly what had to happen before rates could rise again. The goal was to support a recovery he believed would take years, not months. Some policymakers objected. Most fell in line. Powell forces rate guidance through internal resistance The transcripts show Powell pressing for language that tied rate hikes to two conditions. One was maximum employment. The other was inflation reaching 2 percent and moving above that level for a period of time. That language went into the public statement after the meeting. At the time, inflation sat at 1.3 percent using the Fed’s preferred gauge. The median forecast showed inflation not hitting 2 percent until 2023. That forecast proved wrong. Inflation surged the next year and peaked at 7.2 percent in mid-2022. Still, many officials, including Powell, described the jump as transitory and waited to react. Two policymakers dissented in September 2020. Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan opposed locking in near-zero rates. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari wanted an even stronger commitment. Others shared Kaplan’s concern but did not vote. Those included Eric Rosengren in Boston, Tom Barkin in Richmond, and Raphael Bostic in Atlanta. Voting members Patrick Harker from Philadelphia and Loretta Mester from Cleveland also raised concerns. Mester called the new liftoff rules very significant. She said she would have preferred more discussion before making such a change. She still supported the final decision. Powell rejected waiting. He told colleagues the expansion was underway and policy messaging needed to support the long path back. He said delays could damage the Fed’s credibility after holding steady for six months. Powell said weaker guidance would repeat eight years of old Fed behavior The September debate followed a major policy overhaul announced a month earlier. The Fed changed how it handled inflation and jobs. Officials moved away from raising rates early just because unemployment fell. That old playbook had failed for years, as low joblessness did not spark inflation. The transcripts show Powell worried that markets and the public did not believe the Fed would stick to the new framework. He warned that weak guidance would sound like the same reaction function used for eight years. He pushed for strong wording to show the shift was real. Five years later, those conversations became public. The Fed releases edited minutes three weeks after each meeting, but full transcripts come out only after five years. Critics now argue that the firm guidance slowed the Fed’s response when inflation took off. In November 2022, after rate hikes were already underway, Powell publicly acknowledged regret. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, he said the guidance tying liftoff to both jobs and inflation was the one decision he would not repeat. He said it was not tied directly to the inflation surge, but still would not do it again. The transcripts also show Powell spotting COVID risks early. On March 2, 2020, before the virus hit the U.S. hard, he described rising concern after a G‑20 meeting in Riyadh. He said the virus was likely to spread worldwide. He told officials markets needed a clear signal that central banks understood the threat and would act fast to prevent tighter financial conditions. That day, the Fed cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

White House Could Withdraw Support For CLARITY Act The White House has threatened to withdraw its support for the crypto market structure bill following Coinbase’s sudden withdrawal. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, the White House is beside itself over Coinbase’s decision to withdraw its support for the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, calling the move a “unilateral action that blindsided the administration.” Terrett stated in a post on X, “The White House is said to be furious with Coinbase’s “unilateral” action on Wednesday, which it apparently was not notified of in advance, calling it a “rug pull” against the White House and the rest of the industry.” Terrett claimed her source believes the Trump administration may fully abandon the bill unless Coinbase returns to the negotiating table and agrees to a compromise on stablecoin yield provisions that would satisfy banking interests. The source added, “This is President Trump’s bill at the end of the day, not Brian Armstrong’s.” Visit the following links for more information on Husky Inu: Website: Husky Inu Official Website Twitter: Husky Inu Twitter Telegram: Husky Inu Telegram Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The bots tried to empty the wallet after it detected the deposited funds. The compromised wallet’s private key is a transaction identifier (txid). Specifically, it’s the coinbase txid of block 924,982. Bots exploit exposed private key On-chain data shows that Bitcoin bots drained funds from the compromised wallet within minutes. The SegWit wallet received 0.00020305 BTC through two transactions. However, it ended up with a zero balance and no unspent outputs left. Every incoming BTC transfer was quickly spent by bots. The first transaction sent 0.00018209 BTC to the address. At the same timestamp, the funds were spent out in a separate transaction with a fee rate of 12.8 sat/vB. The spending speed indicates an automated sweep. The second deposit added 0.00002096 BTC. The funds were again removed almost immediately. The bot paid 4.80 sat/vB then sent 0.00001572 BTC to an external address. Bots continuously monitor Bitcoin’s mempool for deposits sent to wallets derived from weak or publicly known private keys. A bitcoin mempool is a waiting area for unconfirmed transactions. Once funds appear, the bots already control the private key and can instantly sign withdrawal transactions. Bots instantly send replace-by-fee (RBF) transactions to compete by raising fees for miners to approve a withdrawal. An RBF or replace by fee, is a node policy that allows bots to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new transaction that pays a higher fee to miners. On-chain fee data shows sudden jumps in satoshi-per-byte (sat/vB) rates. This indicates transactions being replaced with higher-fee versions. Only one transaction ultimately confirms, while competing versions are dropped or replaced. The balance history of the compromised BTC wallet. Source: mempool.space . Watching greedy bots send more aggressive RBF transactions can be somewhat entertaining. “Sometimes I send small transactions to compromised wallets, just to see the beauty in this automated RBFs,” said Brevsolution on X. But some people send larger amounts to compromised wallets, and the reason is unclear. “I’d really like to know why that happens,” said Ottosch on X. Such transactions could be a mistake from the sender’s side. In November, $70,000 was carelessly sent to a wallet linked to a predictable private key. Brevsolution explained that bots react instantly and use RBF to reduce transactions down to one satoshi. This causes the bots to pay almost 100% of the deposited BTC in fees. Bitcoin private keys could be compromised Weak private keys and seed phrases could be hacked. They are predictable like easy passwords. Storing the private key securely is essential to protect BTC. Exposing it or any other related data often leads to quick theft by hackers. Using a txid to hash a private key does not provide enough entropy to secure the private keys. Bitcoin private keys are just numbers. It is possible to derive a public address and private keys from block hashes and transaction IDs (txids). Any txid or block hash is a valid 256-bit number and can technically be used as a private key. Bots exploit this by precomputing addresses from known public data. Then they watch those addresses forever and drain them instantly.

Those looking to invest in projects that are in their early stages of development, Mutuum Finance provides substantial potential for growth, compared to Cardano’s ADA. With a total investment close to $20 million, along with over 18,800 supporters, this project has all it takes to exceed the projected growth of Cardano’s ADA. Cardano (ADA): Stable, Yet Limited Momentum Cardano recently bounced out of its $0.32-$0.34 support area, retesting nearby levels of consolidation to make a small higher low on rising volume. Current levels for support are $0.38-$0.39, and a breakout above $0.45-$0.46 may place ADA on a steady course for $0.48-$0.50. Although this is a sign of strength, the current short-term momentum is decidedly measured, reflecting the fact that ADA may have far more conservative investment potential than Mutuum Finance. Investors seeking a new crypto with strong growth potential find MUTM far better than Cardano. MUTM Price Prediction: Could It Reach $1? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now at Phase 7 of its presale stage at a price of $0.04, having increased from $0.01, thus realizing a 300% profit for those who invested during the first stage. Additionally, with the launch price at $0.06, those who participate in the presale today can look forward to realizing additional gains before it even reaches the exchanges. This new crypto represents one of the most promising avenues for investors seeking outsized returns in 2026. As the dual-lending protocol gains more adoption, MUTM may reach $1. This will be an astonishing 2,400% jump from the current $0.04 per token price. Those who invest in the presale will greatly benefit from this potential upside. Take, for instance, an investment in Phase 7 valued at $3,000; this will be able to rise to $4,500 upon the launch of the marketplace, yielding an instant profit of $1,500. With MUTM potentially hitting $1 in value, this investment will be able to rise to $75,000. Such returns make it the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for enormous gains. Layer 2 Integration Makes DeFi More Accessible Historically, gas prices have been an issue for small investors in the Ethereum network. Take, for example, an individual locking $2,000 worth of ETH to borrow stablecoins in Mutuum Finance. The total cost of deposit, borrow, repay, and withdraw would easily surpass $20. In this regard, Mutuum Finance’s Layer-2 and multi-chain focus will make this entire process cost less than a dollar. The cost savings will enable small investors to participate in DeFi with ease. Higher usage will lead to bigger revenue, a portion of which will go to stakers via a buy and redistribute mechanism. In this way, MUTM is among the best cheap cryptos for small investors. Security and Incentives MUTM is secure by design. It has also undergone an independent audit by Halborn Security , in addition to having scored 90/100 in a token scan audit by CertiK. This is in addition to having a $50,000 bug bounty program to ensure that vulnerabilities are highlighted prior to its final deployment on mainnet. Mutuum Finance also encourages people to participate early with a presale giveaway of $100,000, where 10 people will win $10,000 worth of MUTM, and a leaderboard that rewards $500 to the top buyer of its token every day. With this kind of strategy, this new crypto promotes both adoption and retention. Why MUTM Might Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now Mutuum Finance brings together nascent pricing models, presale incentives, genuine DeFi functionality, and economical Layer 2 integration. In this way, it represents a unique investment opportunity with asymmetric profit-making potential. MUTM is one of the best cheap crypto coins for investors seeking both utility and early-stage growth. Compared to already established layer 1 networks such as Cardano, MUTM stands out as a new crypto with remarkable potential.
