SOL was trading for $5 before its huge rally in 2021. Currently, MUTM is in phase 7 of presale for $0.04, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking asymmetrical gains. MUTM is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, creating real on-chain demand for investors. If MUTM were to tap the DeFi market in the same way that SOL did, it could reach multiples similar to what Solana achieved in 2021, positioning itself as the best crypto to invest in. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana has recently stabilized above long-term support following a trend of lower highs, which means that it might be overcoming some of the downward pressure that it was facing. Currently, it’s testing downward resistance lines, which will define its future trend. Although SOL is a strong long-term investment, it’s no longer an asymmetrical investment opportunity, unlike projects that are still in their earlier cycles, for example, MUTM, which many analysts now consider the next crypto to explode. MUTM Presale Growth The Mutuum Finance presale has been effective in incentivizing early investors while also promoting a smooth process of token distribution. From a price of $0.01, the token has appreciated to $0.04 in Phase 7, a tremendous 300% increase for the initial investors. Phase 8 is set at $0.045, while trading will commence at $0.06. Early investors get a head start, as seen below, where a $5,000 investment made today will increase to $6,250 at the opening of Phase 8, realizing a $1,250 profit long before the token listing on exchanges. With more than 18,800 participants and close to $19.8 million raised, MUTM appears to be gaining significant adoption momentum, making it a highly notable rising star of 2026 and the best crypto to invest in during the presale stage. Dual Lending System: Real Utility & Real Returns Mutuum Finance provides a two-way lending system to achieve the highest possible flexibility and returns. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools enable lenders to contribute liquid funds such as ETH and USDC, earning variable interest rates depending on the pool’s usage ratio. An investor could for instance deposit 20,000 USDC in a P2C lending pool, earning 10-15% APY. This could see their initial investment grow into up to $23,000 by the end of the first year. Further compounding over the years could mean reaching as high as $100,000. In contrast, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending option is designed for riskier and less liquid tokens, such as meme coins, where the terms of the loan can be customized and agreed upon by the borrower and the lender. A borrower, for instance, can acquire a 30-day loan of $20,000 in USDC collateralized with a total of $25,000 in PEPE at an interest rate of 15% APR, making MUTM a flexible tool for those searching for the next crypto to explode with real utility. Risk Management Risk management practices are a top priority at Mutuum Finance, with Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation levels determined according to the volatility of each asset. For instance, ETH and USDT support up to 75% Loan-to-Value with an 80% liquidation level, enabling an investor with $8,000 of ETH to take a loan of up to $6,000 of USDT without selling their holdings. More volatile assets support lower Loan-to-Value levels, ensuring that both lenders and the system are safe. Automated liquidation of positions maintains a stable system and inspires trust among users that their assets and returns are safe and secure, which is why analysts consider MUTM the best crypto to invest in for high-potential gains. Prior to deploying on mainnet, Mutuum Finance will roll out Version 1 of its lending/borrowing solution on the Sepolia Testnet . Users will be able to engage with ETH, USDT liquidity pools, mtTokens, which are tokens of deposits, debt tokens issued as a result of taking loans, as well as the automated liquidator bot. In this way, test users will be able to see, hands-on, how interest rates work, how collaterals are handled, among other aspects of the platform. Upside Post-Launch Looking forward from the presale, market analysts believe that as MUTM implements layer-2 scaling, multi-chain expansion, and the launch of interest-bearing pools, adoption-driven market demand may drive token prices substantially upwards. Phase 7 presale token investments of $0.04 may potentially break through several times to mirror Solana’s growth. This solidifies Mutuum Finance’s status as the best crypto to invest in this year.

Monero is built around private, censorship-resistant transactions, using cryptography to obscure wallet balances and transfer details on-chain. That privacy-first design has kept XMR in its own category for years, often moving independently from large-cap altcoins when narrative-driven momentum returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Hits Level Seen Only 7 Times In 6 Years – A Rare Historical Signal Since the beginning of the year, XMR has surged from roughly $410 to nearly $799, a near-vertical move that reflects both aggressive demand and a rapid shift in trader attention toward the privacy coin sector. The breakout comes after similar sharp rallies in names like Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH), which also experienced explosive upside followed by fast pullbacks. Zcash climbed to around $750 before reversing toward the $400 zone, while Dash ran to roughly $120 and later dropped to near $35. Those moves set the tone for a volatile privacy coin rotation, where price action tends to accelerate quickly once momentum enters the sector. Now, with Monero leading the pack, the market is watching whether this rally can establish higher support levels, or if it becomes another short-lived spike driven by crowded positioning and thin liquidity. Retail Hype Signal Flashes As Monero Extends Its Breakout Monero’s surge is now starting to show the same “retail frenzy” footprint that appeared earlier in other privacy coins, raising questions about how sustainable this move really is. A trading frequency signal—often associated with crowded participation and late-stage chasing—previously lit up in Zcash and Dash near their local tops, before both coins reversed sharply. In Zcash, the retail-heavy activity spike aligned with a push to roughly $698, and the price has since slid back to around $442, a drawdown of about 37%. Dash followed a similar pattern. The trigger appeared near $120, before the market cooled off aggressively and dragged the price down to the $57 zone. A decline of roughly 52%. Now, the same signal is flashing for Monero. The retail-frequency threshold appeared around $714 as XMR traded deep into its parabolic advance. That matters because these setups often reflect emotional participation, where buyers enter late, liquidity thins, and volatility increases sharply. This doesn’t guarantee an immediate top, but history suggests a clear risk: once retail demand becomes dominant, the rally can become fragile. The bigger question is whether Monero can absorb profit-taking without breaking structure—or if it repeats the same post-spike unwind seen in ZEC and DASH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $97K As Long-Term Holders Supply Stays Locked XMR Surges Into Parabolic Territory Monero is showing one of the strongest price trends in the market. The weekly chart is now moving into a clear parabolic expansion phase. After spending much of 2024 in a slow accumulation range, XMR gradually built a base and repeatedly defended higher lows. This has set the stage for the subsequent breakout. Once Monero reclaimed the $200 area, momentum accelerated sharply, and buyers began to absorb sell pressure without allowing deep pullbacks. The chart shows a clear bullish structure. With price holding above rising moving averages and using them as dynamic support during each consolidation phase. This type of price behavior usually reflects sustained demand rather than a single short-lived spike. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Take Control: Futures Positioning Turns Bullish for First Time Since October However, the most notable development is the latest impulse candle. We saw the price surge into the $700 zone with almost no overhead resistance. These kinds of vertical advances often signal aggressive market participation and can lead to a volatility expansion event. Price either continues trending higher or enters a sharp correction after exhaustion. From a market structure perspective, the key is whether Monero can hold above previous breakout zones near $500–$600. If buyers defend those areas, the uptrend remains intact. If not, a deeper retracement could unfold quickly.

Ripple CEO Highlights Crypto Impact On CPI Data In an X post , the Ripple CEO noted that the latest CPI data shows a 3.5% reduction in financial services costs for consumers. He then raised the possibility that this decline could be partly due to the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies . The administration has created a regulatory environment for the crypto industry that may have made financial services more accessible, reducing their cost. Notably, the CPI data came in line with expectations, which was a positive for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . The CPI came in at 2.7% year-over-year (YoY), in line with expectations. The core CPI came in at 2.6% YoY, lower than expectations of 2.7%, signaling that inflation in the country has remained steady. Following the release of the CPI data, Bitcoin broke $92,000 and since surged to a new yearly high above $97,000. Major altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple-linked XRP , Solana, and Dogecoin have also recorded significant gains. The inflation data is bullish for the market as it could, in the long run, influence the Fed to make more rate cuts if inflation holds steady rather than trends upwards. Polymarket data show an increase in the number of rate cuts the Fed could make following the release of the CPI data. There is now a 27% chance of three rate cuts this year, while a 21% chance of two. Previously, crypto traders were betting on only two rate cuts this year. Trump is also expected to nominate a rate-cut advocate as the next Fed chair , which would be positive for lower interest rates. Ripple CEO Also Comments On Crypto Legislation The Ripple CEO also commented on the CLARITY Act’s markup , just before its postponement. He noted that the markup was long overdue, but that it is a massive step forward in providing workable frameworks for crypto while continuing to protect consumers. Garlinghouse further remarked that he and his company know firsthand that clarity beats chaos and that the bill’s success is crypto’s success. The Ripple CEO also mentioned that they will continue to move forward with a fair debate and remain optimistic that issues can be resolved through the markup process. The Senate Banking Committee has since postponed the markup after Coinbase withdrew its support for the bill due to concerns about DeFi and stablecoin yield provisions. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse has yet to comment on the postponement, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes that progress with the bill hasn’t stalled despite the setback.",Ripple|altcoins|bitcoin|Brian Armstrong|CLARITY Act|coinbase|DeFi|dogecoin|Donald Trump|Ethereum|Polymarket|ripple|solana|stablecoin|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-16 22:00:46

As this focus on tangible applications grows, investors are seeking out new ecosystems that offer similar utility. This trend has put a spotlight on GeeFi, a decentralized wallet platform that has already raised over $2.6 million in its presale by delivering a user-centric experience and a clear product roadmap. Building a Comprehensive Financial Ecosystem GeeFi is developing a suite of financial tools designed to offer real-world utility, mirroring Avalanche’s focus on payments and rewards. The project’s roadmap includes the upcoming launch of a proprietary Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and specialized Cryptocards. The DEX will provide a seamless environment for trading digital assets directly within its decentralized wallet. At the same time, the Cryptocards will connect users’ digital holdings to everyday commerce, making it easy to spend crypto for goods and services. These features are designed to create sustained demand for the $GEE token. Substantial ROI Potential for Early Backers The investment metrics for GeeFi’s presale are compelling. The $GEE token is currently priced at $0.10 , a significant discount from its confirmed exchange listing price of $0.40 . This provides an immediate 300% ROI for presale participants at the time of listing. Market analysts further project that the token’s value could rise to $3.00 as the platform’s full feature set is rolled out. A $1,500 investment at the current price could potentially grow to $45,000 , representing a 2900% return . Direct Presale Access Fuels User Growth Ease of use is a critical factor in driving adoption, and GeeFi has made participating in its presale remarkably simple. The team recently integrated the $GEE token presale directly into the GeeFi Wallet application. This strategic move eliminates the complexities often associated with early-stage investing, allowing users to purchase tokens instantly with Ethereum (ETH), USDT, or a standard bank card. This seamless experience has significantly boosted participation, pushing Phase 3 of the presale to 90% sold out . With only 3 million tokens remaining at the $0.10 price, the opportunity for entry is quickly diminishing. Rewarding Community and Long-Term Holding GeeFi has implemented a multi-faceted rewards system to foster a strong and engaged community. The platform offers a staking feature that allows token holders to earn a passive yield on their assets, which encourages long-term holding and helps stabilize the token’s economy. In addition, a 5% referral commission rewards users for bringing new participants into the ecosystem. These incentives, alongside a bonus system for early presale investors, create multiple avenues for maximizing returns. A Strong Commitment to Security and Privacy As institutional products like tokenized credit come on-chain, security becomes more important than ever. GeeFi is addressing this by fortifying its wallet with advanced security and privacy features. The latest update includes enhanced encryption and robust backend protocols designed to protect user assets and data from digital threats. This commitment to building a secure and trustworthy platform provides users with the confidence needed to manage their digital finances, establishing GeeFi as a reliable hub in the decentralized economy. Conclusion GeeFi is proving that a focus on utility, security, and accessibility is a winning strategy. As the broader market matures, with platforms like Avalanche leading the charge in institutional adoption, GeeFi stands out as a high-potential project for investors seeking real value. The window to join the presale at the current price is closing.

57225236,https://cryptonews.com/?p=475515,1768602600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57225236.jpeg,"New ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, PEPE and Ethereum By the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/new-chatgpt-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-pepe-and-ethereum-by-the-end-of-2026/,"OpenAI’s world famous AI , ChatGPT, predicts veritably explosive price scenarios for XRP, Pepe and Ethereum, offering a clear warning to investors with FOMO this year. The AI suggests that a sustained bull market, potentially reinforced by clearer and more supportive U.S. regulation, could propel these cryptocurrencies to fresh all-time highs (ATHs) in the next major cycle. Below is how ChatGPT expects these leading cryptocurrencies to perform during a projected 2026 bull market. XRP ($XRP): ChatGPT Sees XRP Reaching $12 by 2027 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) started the year on solid footing, gaining 19% in the opening week alone. Over the past fortnight, it grew 9% to trade at $2.06. According to ChatGPT, sustained bullish momentum could see XRP climb to $12 by 2027. Source: ChatGPT XRP was one of the strongest-performing large-cap cryptocurrencies throughout much of last year. In July, it notched its first new ATH in seven years, hitting $3.65 after Ripple achieved a landmark legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That court decision significantly reduced regulatory ambiguity around XRP and eased concerns that the SEC could classify similar altcoins as securities. Since New Year’s Day, XRP has risen roughly 12.5%, while its Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 58, indicating the token’s current price is strong with plenty of headroom for a weekend rally. Reaching ChatGPT’s bullish target would require substantial upside, however, as XRP needs to gain approximately 483% from current levels to hit $12. The recent launch of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., is channeling institutional capital into XRP, similar to the strong consistent multibillion dollar inflows seen following Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. Pepe ($PEPE): ChatGPT Predicts a 2,000% Price Explosion Pepe ($PEPE) , which debuted in April 2023, has become the largest meme coin not based on a doge avatar, boasting a market cap of about $2.5 billion. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comics, PEPE’s immediately recognisable face and ongoing cultural relevance have given it a strong presence across crypto-focused social platforms. Despite intense competition within the meme coin space, PEPE’s loyal community keep it pumping near the top of the sector. Periodic cryptic posts from Elon Musk on X have also fueled speculation that PEPE could rank alongside his widely known DOGE and BTC interests. PEPE is currently trading near $0.0000059, placing it roughly 79% below its December 2024 ATH of $0.00002803. In ChatGPT’s most bullish scenario, PEPE could surge as much as 1,934% to around $0.00012, a move that would take it well beyond its previous record high. Ethereum ($ETH): ChatGPT Models a Potential Rally Toward $15,000 Ethereum ($ETH) , the world leading blockchain for smart contracts, decentralized applications, and DeFi, remains the leading platform driving Web3 innovation. With a market capitalization approaching $400 billion and $75 billion in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols, Ethereum is crypto’s primary hub for on-chain commercial activity. Ethereum’s track record for security, dependable settlement, and its early dominance in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization make it a prime candidate for deeper institutional adoption, particularly if U.S. lawmakers advance clearer, comprehensive crypto legislation. ETH is currently trading around $3,308, with strong resistance expected near $5,000. It set its all-time high of $4,946.05 back in August. If ChatGPT’s bullish thesis plays out, a decisive break above the $5,000 level could open the door to multiple new ATHs this year in the $7,000 to $15,000 range. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Play With Explosive Upside Potential Beyond ChatGPT’s forecasts, the crypto presale market continues to attract investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as one of January’s most discussed presales, raising around $4.5 million ahead of its expected exchange launch. The project puts an louche, muscle-bound twist on Dogecoin. Brash, over-the-top, and intentionally absurd, Maxi Doge channels the raw meme energy that originally fueled meme coin culture. After years of watching his cousin DOGE dominate the spotlight, Maxi Doge is rallying a his own degen army driven by meme loyalty, aggressive trading strategies, and an unapologetic embrace of volatility. MAXI is an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a considerably lower environmental footprint than Dogecoin’s proof-of-work design. The current presale phase offers staking rewards of up to 69% APY, although returns decrease as more users join the staking pool. MAXI is priced at $0.0002785 in the latest round, with automatic price increases scheduled for future stages. Tokens can be purchased using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Maxi is sending Dogecoin back to the kennel with his tail between his legs! Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The attack was detected around 14:01 UTC, and CyversAlerts, a web3 security platform, posted it shortly after at 14:34 UTC, making it one of the first reported cases of address poisoning in the new year. How the $500K address poisoning scam happened According to the alert posted by CyversAlerts, the victim had initially sent a small test transaction of 5,000 USDT to what they thought was the intended recipient address, which ended in D3E6F. However, this was a poisoned fake address being monitored by the scammer. The scammer’s address ended in f3e6F, only differing subtly in the middle characters, which is usually abbreviated with dots for aesthetic purposes, something that these scams exploit . Two minutes after the victim sent the $5,000, he followed up with a bulk transfer of 509,000 USDT to the same incorrect address, bringing the total loss to a whopping $514,000. According to the attack flow timeline shared by CyversAlerts, the scammer put a lot of preparation into the effort, sending multiple small transactions from various similar addresses to poison the victim’s transaction history. In this way, they were able to fool the victim into thinking the fake address was legitimate when they copied it from their history. Unfortunately, once confirmed onchain, funds lost to such scams are rarely recoverable. They prey on human error and “copy pasta” habits. Victim lost $50M in December 2025 Last year, address poisoning scams contributed significantly to the millions of dollars lost to crypto scams. One of the biggest known losses was recorded in December. That attack saw a seasoned trader fall victim, losing a shocking $50 million in a single transaction after they copied a fraudulent wallet address from their transaction history. The victim transferred 49,999,950 USDT to the attacker-controlled address because it also closely mimicked their intended destination, with the first three and last four characters matching. The scammer quickly converted the stolen funds to ETH and distributed them across multiple wallets. Then they partially funneled it through the Tornado Cash mixer. According to reports, the victim’s wallet had been active for approximately two years and was primarily used for USDT transfers, with the stolen funds withdrawn from Binance shortly before the poisoned transfer occurred. Like the person who lost $500K today, the victim from last year also sent a test transaction, but theirs actually went to the correct address. This made them not doublecheck when they pasted the address again from their transaction history to send the bulk of the funds. It was one of the largest onchain scam losses in recent times. The victim followed up with an onchain message demanding a return of 98% of the stolen funds within 48 hours and backed it up with threats to involve law enforcement and legal entities, even offering the attacker a $1 million white hat bounty if they returned the funds in full. “This is your final opportunity to resolve this matter peacefully,” the message read. “If you fail to comply: we will escalate the matter through legal international law enforcement channels.” However, as of the time of this writing, no response has come from the scammer, and there is no proof the funds were recovered.Since it was laundered via Tornado Cash, the trail quickly went cold and recovery is unlikely.

Central to this is whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delivers Project Crypto quickly, a proposal aimed at updating federal securities laws to provide digital asset firms with long-overdue regulatory clarity. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market dominance has been sliding since summer , which indicates people are ditching it for altcoins. All of these factors ferment the high upside potential of XRP, Shiba Inu and Bonk in the next major bull cycle. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Eyes New Q1 Breakout With a market cap exceeding $125 billion, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) remains the largest cryptocurrency purpose-built for cross-border payments, offering rapid settlement times and very low transaction fees. Ripple designed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) primarily for banks and financial institutions, positioning itself as a faster and more cost-efficient alternative to SWIFT, which can be slow and expensive. Ripple’s underlying technology has also come up on the radars of organizations such as the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House, underscoring its increasing relevance. XRP surged to an all-time high of $3.65 in mid-2025 after Ripple resolved its long-running legal battle with the SEC. Since then, the token has declined roughly 43% amid a broader crypto downturn and is now trading near $2.06 after gaining 9% in the last fortnight. One recent game changer was the debut of multiple spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), giving traditional investors a regulated pathway into the asset. Additional ETF approvals, alongside a more favorable macro backdrop, could drive XRP toward $5 by Q2. A move toward $10 later in the year is possible if supported by regulatory progress, positive macro signals, and continued expansion of the Ripple ecosystem. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Origins to a High Utility Network Introduced in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has grown into the second-largest meme coin, with a market capitalization around $5 billion. Supported by a vast community and an expanding range of products, SHIB is increasingly viewed as a blue-chip altcoin contender rather than a purely-for-entertainment meme coin. At the time of writing, it trades around $0.0000084. Breaking above the sticky $0.000022 resistance level could set the stage for a move toward $0.00003 by March. In a sustained bullish scenario, SHIB could even finish the quarter near $0.00005. Shiba Inu’s utility is more than just a sales pitch. Shibarium, its Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution, reduces fees and enhances scalability. Additional privacy features and upcoming upgrades further reinforce SHIB’s transition from meme culture to a broader blockchain ecosystem. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin on the Rise Bonk ($BONK) , a dog-themed meme coin native to Solana, launched on December 25, 2022, triggering a holiday surge that pushed Solana ($SOL) up 34% in just two days and firmly established BONK as a key player within the ecosystem. Now trading at $0.00001077 with a market cap near $1 billion, it is one of the largest meme coins on Solana and is close to flipping the Official Trump ($TRUMP) token as the network’s flagship meme coin. Beyond speculation, BONK is actively used across Solana DeFi for tipping, micropayments, and NFT collateral. A falling wedge formation between late November and mid-March anticipated BONK’s July rally, during which it peaked at $0.00003906 before retracing alongside the broader meme coin market. Although still roughly 80% below its November 2024 all-time high of $0.00005825, renewed market momentum could see it set a new ATH by spring. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): It Looks Like a Meme Coin; It’s Really a High-Performance Bitcoin Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer-2 initiative that pairs playful visuals with serious technical ambitions, delivering faster transactions, lower fees, and advanced smart contract functionality on Bitcoin. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper incorporates decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables seamless cross-chain transfers involving Bitcoin. The project’s presale has already raised approximately $30.7 million, and market watchers anticipate 10x to 100x upside once the token lists on exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit reported no critical vulnerabilities in the smart contract. The HYPER token plays multiple roles within the ecosystem, including payment of transaction fees, governance voting, and staking rewards. Early presale participants can currently earn staking yields of up to 38% APY, although returns are expected to decline as the staking pool expands. With a full rollout planned for 2026, Bitcoin Hyper is an onramp for both long-term Bitcoin maxis and newcomers alike into the next evolution of the Bitcoin network.

Patrick Witt posted an update on X regarding the sale of 57.55 BTC forfeited by Samourai Wallet developers Keonne Rodriguez and Will Lonergan Hill. Did the SDNY violate Presidential orders? Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month that the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had sold approximately $6.3 million worth of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin was handed over by Samourai Wallet developers Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill as part of a guilty plea. On November 3 last year, on-chain data recorded a transfer of the seized 57.55353033 BTC from a government-controlled address (bc1q4pntkz06z7xxvdcers09cyjqz5gf8ut4pua22r) to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. The Coinbase address soon showed a zero balance, causing many analysts to believe that the assets had been sold for cash, directly violating Executive Order 14233, signed by President Trump in March 2025. The order specifically mandates that any “Government BTC” acquired through criminal or civil forfeiture “shall not be sold” and must instead be held in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). Patrick Witt, the Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the situation. “We have received confirmation from (the) DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated, per EO 14233. They will remain on the USG balance sheet as part of the SBR,” he said . Will the SDNY continue to defy the White House? Despite Todd Blanche’s memo from May 2025 that instructed the DOJ to only go after cases where there’s evidence of “knowing and willful” criminal intent by the developers themselves, the SDNY went ahead to successfully secure convictions for Roman Storm, a co-founder of Tornado Cash. In August 2025, a jury found him guilty of conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The SDNY also sentenced Rodriguez and Hill in November 2025 to five and four years in prison, respectively. President Trump told reporters in December last year that he is “looking into” a pardon for Rodriguez . Tim Scott, the Senate Banking Committee Chair, was forced to postpone a high-profile hearing for the CLARITY Act after Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, announced on social media that he would no longer be supporting the current draft. Armstrong said he is concerned that the bill gives too much authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over stablecoins and DeFi protocols. And without the backing of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, the bipartisan consensus led by Senator Cynthia Lummis has begun to fracture. Despite this, she has so far stated that lawmakers are “closer than ever” to a final deal. The current draft of the CLARITY Act includes rules that ban platforms like Coinbase from offering interests or rewards on stablecoins. The ban is a major win for traditional banking platforms, which claim that high stablecoin returns were taking away trillions of dollars from their sector. If these issues aren’t resolved, the bill could fail to pass before the 2026 election cycle starts and freeze all legislative processes. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

But even with the short-term dip, ETH is still up 7% this week and 13% over the past month, holding strong while setting the stage for a bigger breakout. Fueling this bullish momentum is a major announcement from BitMine , the largest Ethereum treasury in the market, which just invested $200 million into Beast Industries , the media company founded by YouTube icon MrBeast . This move signals confidence in Ethereum as the foundation for the next wave of digital platforms, content economies, and Web3 media. Ethereum remains the largest and most battle-tested layer-one network, and with institutional capital flowing in, the long-term Ethereum price prediction continues to look increasingly bullish. Ethereum Price Prediction: MrBeast Just Got a $200M Backing From One of ETH’s Biggest Whales – What Happens Next? As explained in the accompanying press release , BitMine – which currently holds just over 200,000 ETH (c. $13.7 billion) – has announced a $200 million equity investment into Beast Industries, with Beast CEO Jeff Housenbold indicating that there may also be collaboration between the two firms at some point. 2/ For those not familiar, @MrBeast is the number #1 content creator in the world and central to the lives of GenZ, GenAlpha and even Millennials – BitMine has targeted 5% of its balance sheet for ""moonshots"" and this is strategically sound move pic.twitter.com/iMLaJeNHWu — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) January 15, 2026 “Their support is a strong validation of our vision, strategy, and growth trajectory and it provides additional capital to achieve our goal to become the most impactful entertainment brand in the world,” he said. “We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.” This is bullish for both BitMine and MrBeast, and (by extension) it’s also bullish for the Ethereum price, although the latter hasn’t reacted all that positively to this news. As we see from its chart below, it continues to ride some significant momentum, despite the slight correction of the past 24 hours. It recently broke out of a bullish pennant, while its two main indicators – the relative strength index (yellow) and the MACD (orange, blue) – are still in the ascendancy, having been subdued for several months previously. Source: TradingView It therefore remains a very opportune time to buy Ethereum, which still remains 33% down from its ATH of $4,946, which it set in August. And fundamentally, Ethereum is one of the most bankable cryptos in the market. Its TVL accounts for 58% of the entire crypto ecosystem , and that’s not including Ethereum-based L2s, while Ethereum ETFs and digital funds currently sit on assets worth $25.26 billion . The future is therefore very bright for the token, with the Ethereum price likely to reach $4,000 by the end of Q1, and then $5,000 by H2. SUBBD Is Preparing to Launch An AI-Powered Content Creation Platform: Next 100x Alt? While Ethereum is one of the safer altcoins to invest in, traders looking for bigger, quicker gains may also want to diversify into smaller cap tokens. This may include allocating a percentage to presale coins, which in building up momentum during their sales can then go on to rally strongly when they list on exchanges. One token generating some early momentum right now is SUBBD ($SUBBD), a new Ethereum-based project that’s preparing to launching an adult content creation platform. Earn up to $500 per day with your own AI Creator Start here: https://t.co/9jJM0SyyiQ https://t.co/v7oruRW0ag — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) December 28, 2025 SUBBD launched its presale a couple of months ago, and has so far raised more than $1.4 million, a signal of just how much interest it’s attracting. Much of this interest comes from how it’s planning to combine AI and crypto in order to give its content creation platform an edge over pre-existing rivals. Its platform will offer a suite of AI tools that will make it easier for content creators to produce engaging content, including tools that help with ideas, that produce media and videos, and that also produce AI agents/performers. These promise to make users much more efficient, while the use of crypto means that payouts will be transparent and immediate. Together, this combination promises to make SUBBD one of the most advanced content platforms on the Web, and given that the SUBBD token will be necessary to pay subscriptions, it could experience substantial demand. Investors can buy it now by going to the SUBBD website , where the token is currently selling for $0.057475.

57227040,658018,1768604407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57227040.jpeg,"Bitcoin Smart Money Buys, While Retail Dumps: Why The Latest Rally Looks Well-Founded",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rally-looks-well-founded/,"A few days ago, the price of Bitcoin experienced a bounce after weeks of trading below the $91,000 mark. However, this renewed momentum appears to be gradually fading as the crypto market slowly shifts toward a bearish state, with large and retail BTC investors moving in a distinct direction. What’s Happening Behind The Bitcoin’s Rise Bitcoin may have slightly pulled back from its most recent bounce, but the price is still holding strong above the $95,000 level. Meanwhile, the latest jump has attracted significant attention in the broader cryptocurrency market, with the move being increasingly viewed as well-justified rather than speculative. Currently, on-chain and market data are showing a clear divergence in who is driving the ongoing move. Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain data analytics platform, disclosed that itcoin’s surge to a high of $97,800 on Wednesday seemed more than warranted due to the behavior of large and retail investors. Institutions, long-term investors, and big wallets, together referred to as smart money, have been discreetly accumulating while retail traders have been gradually lowering their exposure and selling into strength. With the rotation of supply from weaker hands to more conviction-driven investors reducing selling pressure , the rally’s foundation is being strengthened. When whales are buying more BTC, and retail investors are dumping, it reflects a very bullish market outlook. Since January 10, whales and sharks, particularly wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have been amassing BTC, collectively scooping up more than 32,693 BTC. This massive purchase represents a +0.24% rise to their collective holdings. On the other hand, retail or shrimp holders, those holding less than 0.01 BTC, have collectively offloaded over 149 BTC since January 10. Data shows that the dump represents a 30% decline in their holdings altogether. Santiment highlighted that the key signal underneath the action is that smart money is finally buying consistently, while micro money bows out. Furthermore, it is considered an ideal setup for a bull run. However, how long retail doubts the formed tiny rally will determine how long it lasts, and the “Very Bullish” green zone is still in place for the time being. Ongoing FUD In The Market Set To Propel BTC’s Price Even with the recent recovery, Bitcoin is seeing negative interactions from crypto enthusiasts and analysts on social media platforms. This behavior implies that the crowd is not entirely confident in the BTC rally that occurred on Wednesday. Although the development may seem present itself as negative, it is actually a good sign that the rally might extend . Social data reveals that commentary toward BTC across social media platforms has sharply leaned to a bearish outlook as prices have bounced this week. With markets often moving in the opposite direction of retail sentiment, Santiment noted that the most FUD in 10 days is likely to propel BTC to its first return above the $100,000 mark, which was last seen on November 13, 2025.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Retailers|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|fud|Santiment,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-16 23:00:07

After weeks of uneven price action, the ETH/USD chart on the 3-day timeframe is now printing a MACD bullish crossover, a signal that has preceded some of Ethereum’s rallies in the past. The setup is notable because it proposes a situation where Ethereum is laying the groundwork for another sustained rally that plays throughout the entirety of 2026. Bullish MACD Crossover For Ethereum The latest analysis shared by Javon Marks points to Ethereum climbing steadily following another MACD bullish crossover in December 2025. This bullish crossover is visible on the 3-day chart, where the MACD line crossed above the signal line from below. Related Reading: Ethereum Chart Turns Bullish: New Cycle Energy Points To $5,000 This is a change that shows downside momentum has faded and bullish pressure is starting to rebuild among Ethereum traders. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around the $3,300 region, about 33% below its August 2025 peak, but holding above swing lows in November 2025. According to Javon Marks, this recent price action is potentially the early stages of a much larger bull wave. This projection is based on the fact that the current crossover looks like an earlier crossover that occurred before Ethereum transitioned into an extended upside move in early 2025. Back in April 2025, the 3-day MACD also recorded a bullish crossover after an extended period of consolidation and pullbacks that lasted for a few months. That signal was the start of a multi-month rally that steadily pushed Ethereum higher, eventually culminating in a new all-time high in August 2025. Price action following that April crossover did not explode immediately. Ethereum first stabilized for a few days, then began forming higher lows above $1,500. Once resistance at $2,000 gave way, the rally gained much momentum and carried Ethereum from the mid-$2,000 range all the way above $4,800, broke above its old record of $4,878 that had stood since Nov. 2021, before finally peaking at $4,946 in late August. Price Targets To Look Forward To The final message of this technical analysis is that Ethereum is about to embark on a comparable rally and break out to new all-time highs. According to the updated outlook by Javon Marks, the first major level that defines this potential continuation is $4,811.71. This price acted as an important resistance level during the previous rally in 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Overbought Levels With Weekend Pump, Why A Crash Could Be Coming A decisive break and sustained hold above $4,811.71 would confirm that Ethereum has exited its corrective phase and re-entered into a broader expansion move. If that breakout unfolds as expected, the measured move projected from the chart points to $8,557.68 as a target to look forward to. This target is based on the magnitude of Ethereum’s last MACD-driven advance and would translate to a 160% increase from current price levels.

It marks the formal end of a two-and-a-half-year investigation into the Zcash Foundation into whether its altcoin offering complies with anti-money laundering (AML) and economic sanctions requirements. We are pleased to announce that the SEC has concluded its review and informed us that it does not intend to recommend any enforcement action or other changes against Zcash Foundation regarding this matter. https://t.co/zjxfh3mmst — Zcash Foundation (@ZcashFoundation) January 14, 2026 Until now, the privacy coin narrative has functioned in a regulatory dark spot, keeping meaningful adoption and capital largely sidelined. Much-needed input, as privacy coins find new relevance in this institution-led market cycle. Institutional use-cases need rails that offer privacy, yet are compliant with regulations and selective disclosure. The initial announcement triggered a 9% daily surge. With regulatory uncertainty lifted, Zcash could unlock sidelined capital and explore more mainstream use cases over the longer term. Still, near-term focus remains on internal conflict. The exodus of the core Electric Coin Company (ECC) development team raises doubts about the Zcash ecosystem’s integrity. Zcash Price Prediction: Could Regulatory Clarity Rekindle the Bull Run? Regulatory clarity may have been the catalyst Zcash needed to ease near-term pressure and refocus attention on a two-month bull flag continuation pattern that has been quietly developing. Momentum indicators hint at the potential return of bullish momentum as the structure nears its apex. ZEC USDT 1-day chart, bull flag pattern nears apex. Source: TradingView . The RSI appears to be carving out a higher low after rejection at the 50 neutral line. While not yet strong enough to confirm a bullish flip, underlying strength is building. The MACD reads much the same, closing in on a potential golden cross above the signal line and hinting that the early stages of a new uptrend may be taking shape. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout is all-time highs around $760. This interim resistance stands as the key proving grounds for a push into new price discovery. Fully realised, the bull flag pattern sets a potential $5,000 target , a 1,150% gain . That scenario, however, likely hinges on sustained institutional adoption and the emergence of a clear, mainstream use case for Zcash. Bitcoin Hyper: A Key Bitcoin Upgrade Most Traders are Missing Those who bet on narratives like Privacy coins over the leading cryptocurrency may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Bitcoin could soon gain deeper exposure in mainstream narratives like DeFi and RWAs. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale , and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

This prediction hinges not on speculative trading, but on a fundamental shift: Ethereum is rapidly becoming core financial infrastructure for major Wall Street institutions. According to analysis from Etherealize co-founders Vivek Raman and Danny Ryan, recent U.S. regulatory clarity has unlocked a wave of institutional adoption that could revalue the entire network. Ethereum Price Prediction Anchored in Regulatory Clarity The pathway to a $15,000 ETH valuation by 2027 is fundamentally linked to recent legislative developments. Specifically, the passage of definitive U.S. stablecoin legislation has provided the legal certainty large financial entities required. Consequently, firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan are now actively building on the Ethereum blockchain. This institutional adoption represents a critical phase change for the network, moving it beyond regulatory uncertainty. Moreover, this trend signals a broader acceptance of blockchain technology within traditional finance. Vivek Raman of Etherealize provided a clear rationale for this optimistic Ethereum price prediction. He stated that growth in two key sectors could propel Ethereum’s market capitalization into the trillions. First, the stablecoin market, which largely operates on Ethereum, is poised for exponential expansion. Second, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) like treasury bonds and real estate is gaining immense traction. Stablecoin Growth: Legislation has effectively legalized and structured the stablecoin market, encouraging traditional finance to participate. RWA Tokenization: Converting physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain creates efficiency and new financial products. Network Effect: As more institutions build, Ethereum becomes more valuable and secure for all participants. The Engine of Institutional Adoption on Ethereum Institutional interest in Ethereum is not a new phenomenon, but it has recently accelerated at a remarkable pace. Major asset managers are launching Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), providing a regulated gateway for traditional investors. Simultaneously, investment banks are exploring Ethereum for settling complex transactions and creating digital bonds. This institutional embrace provides a powerful validation of the network’s security and scalability post its transition to proof-of-stake. The following table contrasts the drivers of Ethereum’s value in previous cycles versus the current institutional cycle: Previous Cycle Drivers (Pre-2023) Current Institutional Cycle Drivers (2024+) Retail speculation and DeFi yield farming Stablecoin issuance for global payments NFT and digital collectible mania Tokenization of treasury bonds and real-world assets Layer-2 scaling promises Actual deployment of institutional-grade Layer-2 networks General smart contract potential Specific, regulated financial applications Expert Analysis: From Niche Technology to Financial Plumbing Danny Ryan, an Ethereum core developer and Etherealize co-founder, emphasizes the technological readiness. He notes that Ethereum’s development roadmap, including proto-danksharding, is directly aimed at supporting high-volume, low-cost transactions necessary for finance. This technical evolution, combined with regulatory progress, creates a unique convergence. Financial institutions are no longer just experimenting; they are deploying production systems. Therefore, the $15,000 price prediction by 2027 reflects a belief that Ethereum will capture a significant portion of the future digital asset economy’s value. Quantifying the Trillion-Dollar Revaluation Thesis The core of the $15K forecast rests on a quantifiable market expansion thesis. Raman suggests that if both the stablecoin and RWA markets grow fivefold from current levels, the fee demand and value secured on Ethereum would skyrocket. Currently, hundreds of billions in stablecoin value exist on Ethereum. A fivefold increase would place this figure in the multi-trillion dollar range, all requiring ETH to pay for transaction security. Similarly, tokenizing just a fraction of the global real-world asset market would represent an enormous value transfer onto the blockchain. This revaluation would be driven by several concrete factors. First, increased transaction fee revenue would make the network more valuable. Second, ETH would be staked by institutions to secure these high-value applications, reducing circulating supply. Finally, ETH would function as the primary collateral and settlement asset within this new financial system. As a result, its utility would expand far beyond its current uses. Conclusion The Ethereum price prediction of $15,000 by 2027 represents a fundamental analysis based on institutional adoption and regulatory maturation. The convergence of clear U.S. stablecoin laws, active development from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, and Ethereum’s own technical upgrades creates a compelling growth narrative. While price forecasts are inherently uncertain, the shift of Ethereum into the core infrastructure of Wall Street is a tangible, ongoing trend with profound implications for the network’s long-term value and the broader digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason behind the $15,000 Ethereum price prediction for 2027? The primary driver is institutional adoption accelerated by new U.S. stablecoin legislation, which is encouraging major financial firms like BlackRock and JPMorgan to build on Ethereum for stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization. Q2: How does stablecoin growth affect Ethereum’s price? Stablecoins are predominantly issued on Ethereum. Their growth increases network usage and transaction fees, which requires ETH to pay for gas. It also demonstrates Ethereum’s utility as core financial infrastructure, boosting its perceived value. Q3: What are Real-World Assets (RWAs) and why do they matter for ETH? RWAs are traditional financial assets like bonds, real estate, or commodities that are represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. Tokenizing them on Ethereum brings immense value onto the network, increasing demand for ETH to secure and transact these assets. Q4: Is this prediction just speculation? The prediction cited is based on observed trends: enacted legislation, public announcements from financial institutions, and the growing market size of Ethereum-based financial applications. It is an analytical forecast, not market speculation. Q5: What are the biggest risks to this Ethereum price prediction? Key risks include potential new regulatory hurdles, the rise of competing blockchain platforms for institutional use, unforeseen technical challenges, or a broader macroeconomic downturn that slows financial innovation.

This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as it indicates that Wall Street is quietly accumulating the token. Data from SoSoValue shows that XRP ETFs have only experienced one day of negative net inflows since the first of these products was launched in the U.S. As a result, the total assets held by these funds have skyrocketed to $1.51 billion in just two months, surpassing Solana’s ETF assets by more than $300 million. In the past 7 days, XRP has booked a 2% drop, although its year-to-date gains currently sit at 12% due to a spike in the price during the first few days of the year. This streak of positive net inflows indicates that both institutional and retail investors are steadily increasing their holdings, creating a strong floor for the token in case this pullback accelerates. XRP Price Prediction: Move to $3 Likely If XRP Breaks Out of Descending Triangle Again The 4-hour chart shows that XRP has formed a descending triangle once again. The last time this happened, the token broke out of this setup and delivered strong gains in the near term. Now that its bearish structure has been invalidated on higher time frames, another breakout could result in a much more explosive move that pushes XRP back to $3 at least. Source: TradingView The price has now crossed above the 200-period EMA in this lower time frame, favoring a bullish outlook. If the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rises past the mid-line and makes a bullish crossover above the 14-day moving average, that would confirm a buy signal for this altcoin. As altcoins seem ready to make a loud comeback, top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could benefit from a market-wide recovery. This project leverages Solana’s speed and low transaction costs to kickstart a new era for Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Will Transform BTC’s DeFi Via Solana’s High Speed and Low Fees Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a fast-moving presale that connects Solana’s high-speed blockchain with the Bitcoin network, giving investors a brand-new way to earn passive income on BTC. With the Hyper Layer 2 , users can stake, lend, and earn yield on their Bitcoin while enjoying low fees and faster transactions that help maximize gains instead of losing them to costs. In just a few months, the project has raised over $30 million. Its ambitious roadmap is what has investors all excited, as developers will now be able to launch highly efficient Bitcoin-native applications that BTC holders will love. As top wallets and exchanges increasingly adopt the Hyper L2, demand for its native token, $HYPER, will likely explode.

Crypto YouTuber Mason Versluis has cautioned investors against expecting XRP to surge to $1,000 in the foreseeable future, describing such forecasts as detached from economic and structural realities. Versluis shared his position on X, where he emphasized the need for more grounded expectations among XRP holders. While acknowledging the asset’s long-term potential, he made it clear that a $1,000 valuation is not something he anticipates in the near or medium term, including the period leading up to 2026. Why a Four-Figure XRP Price Is Unlikely According to Versluis, the global financial system is not currently positioned to sustain an XRP valuation anywhere near $1,000. He argued that regulatory frameworks, liquidity depth, and overall market maturity would all need to undergo substantial changes before such pricing could be justified. In his view, expectations have outpaced the actual pace of adoption and infrastructure development. Rather than focusing on extreme long-term targets, Versluis believes market participants should assess XRP’s progress based on measurable growth and realistic benchmarks tied to broader market behavior. More Achievable Price Levels Before 2026 Although Versluis is dismissive of the $1,000 narrative , he remains positive about XRP’s performance over the next few years. He outlined several price levels he considers more reasonable, suggesting that movements toward $5 or $10 would be consistent with current adoption trends. He also noted that a rise toward $20, while ambitious, is not entirely out of reach if market conditions remain favorable. These projections reflect ongoing discussions within the XRP community, where enthusiasm about long-term utility often contrasts with near-term price constraints. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Position and Growth Requirements At the time of writing, XRP is trading at approximately $2.04 , reflecting a modest weekly loss of 3.38%. A move to $5 would require a little more than a doubling of its current price, while reaching $10 would imply a fivefold increase. A $20 valuation, however, would necessitate a significantly larger expansion, pushing XRP’s market capitalization beyond $1 trillion. Versluis believes that such growth could occur before the end of 2026, though he acknowledges it would depend heavily on broader market momentum and capital inflows. Long-Term Outlook: The Case for $30 Versluis has previously outlined why a $30 XRP price could be plausible over the long term. His argument centers on market structure rather than short-term speculation, noting that XRP would need roughly a twelvefold increase from current levels to reach that price. He linked this possibility to Bitcoin’s long-term expansion. If Bitcoin’s market capitalization were to grow substantially, capital rotation into major altcoins could support higher valuations across the sector, potentially placing XRP near a $2 trillion market cap. However, Versluis stopped short of assigning a timeline, emphasizing that such outcomes depend on evolving market cycles rather than fixed dates.

Consequently, senior Judiciary Committee leaders have declared a proposed liability shield for software developers inappropriate for inclusion in a major market structure bill. This development, reported by CoinDesk, highlights a fundamental tension in regulating the nascent industry. Crypto Developer Protection Clause Faces Bipartisan Opposition Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the ranking member and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee respectively, have taken a firm stance. They argue the provision, which aims to exempt cryptocurrency software developers from criminal liability if their code is misused by third parties, does not belong in financial market structure legislation. Their primary concern centers on the potential weakening of federal laws targeting unlicensed money transmitters. Specifically, they cite platforms like Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixing service sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. This opposition creates a significant procedural hurdle. The provision has become a major point of contention within the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the market structure bill. Indeed, disagreements over this clause are directly cited as a reason for the recent delay in the bill’s deliberation timeline. The debate forces a critical examination of how to foster innovation while preventing illicit finance. The Core Legal Debate: Innovation vs. Enforcement Proponents of the developer protection clause often draw parallels to other technologies. They argue that developers of neutral, general-purpose software tools should not be held criminally liable for actions of end-users, similar to how telecom companies are not liable for illegal phone calls. This perspective emphasizes the open-source nature of much crypto code and the need for clear legal boundaries to encourage U.S.-based development. Opponents, however, see a dangerous loophole. Their analysis focuses on the unique financial capabilities of certain decentralized protocols. The clause, they warn, could inadvertently protect entities that build and launch software explicitly designed to obscure financial transactions, potentially crippling enforcement against money laundering and sanctions evasion. The case of Tornado Cash looms large here; its developers face charges, setting a contentious legal precedent. Expert Analysis on the Legislative Impasse Legal scholars note this debate reflects a broader struggle to apply existing legal frameworks to decentralized technology. “The Senate is grappling with a classic ‘code is law’ dilemma,” explains a former CFTC counsel specializing in digital assets. “They must decide if writing financial software is an act of speech and creation, or an act of operating a financial service. The Judiciary Committee’s intervention signals concern that the Banking Committee’s approach may undermine other critical statutes.” This inter-committee dynamic adds complexity, as the Judiciary Committee oversees criminal law. The timeline is also crucial. This delay comes amid increased global regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency. The European Union has implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, while other jurisdictions are advancing their own rules. Observers suggest the U.S. legislative process risks falling behind, creating uncertainty for businesses. The table below outlines key positions: Position Key Argument Potential Impact Pro-Protection Clause Shields innovators from downstream misuse, fostering U.S. tech leadership. Could limit developer prosecution but may attract regulatory scrutiny. Anti-Protection Clause (Judiciary) Preserves DOJ/FinCEN power to combat illicit finance via software. May chill open-source development; upholds current enforcement. Banking Committee Goal Create clear market rules to protect consumers and define asset status. Bill stalled without compromise on this ancillary issue. Broader Implications for the Crypto Market Structure The market structure bill itself aims to answer foundational questions. It seeks to clarify which digital assets are commodities or securities, assign regulatory roles between the SEC and CFTC, and establish rules for trading platforms. The developer clause, while seemingly niche, touches the heart of a key question: what constitutes a regulated entity in a decentralized ecosystem? Resolving this is essential for the bill’s success. Industry reaction has been mixed. Some advocacy groups express deep disappointment, arguing the clause is essential for legal certainty. Conversely, compliance-focused firms and traditional finance entrants often prioritize strong anti-money laundering (AML) provisions. This internal industry split mirrors the divide in the Senate. The path forward likely requires a narrowly tailored solution that distinguishes between different types of software development and intent. Conclusion The Senate debate over the crypto developer protection clause represents a critical inflection point for U.S. digital asset policy. The opposition from Judiciary Committee leaders Grassley and Durbin underscores the serious law enforcement concerns intertwined with technological innovation. As deliberations continue, the outcome will significantly influence whether the comprehensive market structure bill can advance. Ultimately, this conflict will shape the legal landscape for software developers and define the boundaries of liability in the decentralized financial world for years to come. FAQs Q1: What is the crypto developer protection clause? It is a proposed legislative provision aiming to shield software developers from criminal liability if their decentralized code is misused by others for illegal activities, such as money laundering. Q2: Why are Senators Grassley and Durbin opposed to it? They argue its inclusion in a financial market structure bill could weaken existing federal laws against unlicensed money transmission, hindering enforcement against services like Tornado Cash. Q3: How does this affect the broader crypto market structure bill? The disagreement over this clause is a primary reason for the bill’s recent delay, creating a major obstacle to passing comprehensive digital asset regulation in the U.S. Senate. Q4: What is Tornado Cash, and why is it relevant? Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency “mixer” or privacy tool sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. Its developers face criminal charges, making it a central case study in the debate over developer liability. Q5: What happens next with this legislation? The Senate Banking Committee must either revise the clause to address Judiciary concerns, remove it entirely, or face continued stalemate, potentially pushing final action into the future.

This dramatic escalation follows an earlier investigation announcement and represents one of the most significant regulatory actions against generative AI technology to date. xAI Cease-and-Desist Order Targets Grok’s ‘Spicy’ Mode The California Department of Justice formally demanded that xAI stop all creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Attorney General Bonta emphasized California’s zero-tolerance policy toward such content in his public statement. The agency specifically cited Grok’s ‘spicy’ mode feature as a primary concern, noting its explicit content generation capabilities. Consequently, the AG’s office gave xAI just five days to demonstrate concrete steps addressing these serious issues. This rapid timeline underscores the urgency regulators now attach to AI safety concerns. Furthermore, the investigation revealed disturbing patterns of misuse. The AG’s office claimed xAI appeared to facilitate large-scale production of nonconsensual nudes used to harass women and girls online. This troubling development mirrors broader industry challenges with generative AI tools. Meanwhile, X’s safety account previously condemned such user activity, warning that prompters of illegal content would face consequences. However, regulatory authorities clearly seek more proactive platform responsibility. Global Regulatory Response to AI-Generated Content The controversy extends far beyond California’s borders. Multiple nations have launched their own investigations into Grok’s operations. Japan, Canada, and Britain have all opened formal probes examining the platform’s content generation features. Additionally, Malaysia and Indonesia have taken more drastic measures, temporarily blocking access to the platform entirely. This international coordination signals growing global consensus on AI regulation needs. Simultaneously, United States lawmakers have intensified their scrutiny. On Thursday, Congressional representatives sent letters to executives at several major technology companies including X, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Alphabet, and Meta. These letters specifically inquired about plans to combat sexualized deepfake proliferation. The coordinated timing suggests a deliberate regulatory strategy unfolding across multiple government levels. The Technical and Ethical Challenge of Content Moderation Generative AI platforms face fundamental technical challenges in content moderation. Unlike traditional social media where users upload existing content, AI systems generate entirely new material based on prompts. This creates novel moderation complexities. xAI implemented some restrictions on image-editing features late Wednesday, but regulators deemed these measures insufficient. The core difficulty lies in balancing creative freedom with harm prevention—a challenge affecting the entire AI industry. Industry experts note several critical considerations: Prompt filtering effectiveness: Current systems struggle to interpret nuanced user intent Real-time generation monitoring: AI can produce harmful content faster than human review Cross-platform coordination: Bad actors often use multiple services simultaneously Age verification systems: Preventing minor access remains technically challenging Historical context reveals this isn’t entirely new territory. Previous technologies from photocopiers to Photoshop prompted similar regulatory discussions. However, generative AI’s scale and accessibility represent a qualitative difference. The advent of free, powerful AI tools has indeed led to a disturbing increase in nonconsensual sexual material across multiple platforms. Legal Precedents and Future Implications California’s action establishes important legal precedents for AI regulation. The state has positioned itself as a leader in technology governance through previous legislation like the California Consumer Privacy Act. This cease-and-desist order represents a natural extension of that regulatory philosophy into artificial intelligence. Legal experts anticipate this case could influence pending federal legislation and international standards. The following table outlines key regulatory developments in AI content moderation: Jurisdiction Action Taken Timeline California Cease-and-desist order to xAI June 2025 United Kingdom Online Safety Act implementation Ongoing since 2023 European Union AI Act enforcement Phased from 2024 Japan Grok investigation launched June 2025 Industry response has been notably cautious. When Bitcoin World contacted xAI for comment, they received an automated email response stating ‘Legacy Media Lies.’ This suggests potential tension between the company and media outlets covering the story. Meanwhile, traditional technology companies face parallel pressures as lawmakers demand clearer content moderation strategies. Conclusion The California Attorney General’s cease-and-desist order against xAI represents a watershed moment for artificial intelligence regulation. This action highlights growing governmental impatience with self-regulation approaches to AI safety. As generative AI tools become increasingly powerful and accessible, regulatory frameworks must evolve correspondingly. The xAI case will likely influence how platforms worldwide approach content moderation, user safety, and ethical AI development. Ultimately, this incident underscores the urgent need for balanced approaches that foster innovation while preventing tangible harm. FAQs Q1: What specifically did the California AG order xAI to do? The cease-and-desist order demands xAI immediately stop creating and distributing deepfake nonconsensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material through its Grok chatbot. The company must demonstrate compliance within five days. Q2: Which feature of Grok is causing the most concern? Regulators have focused particularly on Grok’s ‘spicy’ mode, which xAI designed specifically to generate explicit content. This feature appears central to the nonconsensual imagery creation problem. Q3: Are other countries taking similar action? Yes, Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, while Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform entirely. This indicates a coordinated international regulatory response. Q4: How has xAI responded to these allegations? xAI implemented some restrictions on image-editing features recently, but the California AG deemed these insufficient. The company’s automated response to media inquiries has been ‘Legacy Media Lies,’ suggesting a contentious relationship with press coverage. Q5: What broader implications does this case have for AI regulation? This action establishes important precedents for holding AI companies accountable for content generated through their platforms. It will likely influence pending legislation and industry standards worldwide, particularly regarding content moderation responsibilities.

57226959,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262386,1768607711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Silver Market Cap Skyrockets $3.9 Trillion, Stunningly Outperforming Stocks and Crypto",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/silver-market-cap-surge-outperforms/,"BitcoinWorld Silver Market Cap Skyrockets $3.9 Trillion, Stunningly Outperforming Stocks and Crypto Global financial markets witnessed a historic shift over the past year, as the silver market cap exploded by a staggering $3.9 trillion, decisively outperforming traditional stocks, volatile cryptocurrencies, and even its peer gold. According to data from CryptoBriefing, this monumental rally has propelled silver’s total valuation past the $5 trillion threshold, cementing its position as the world’s second-largest tangible asset class. The price of silver itself reached an unprecedented high near $93 per ounce before stabilizing, marking a period of exceptional performance that has reshaped investment portfolios and analyst forecasts worldwide. Silver Market Cap Achieves Historic Trillion-Dollar Growth The scale of silver’s ascent is unprecedented in modern financial history. Over a concise 12-month period, the asset’s total market valuation swelled by over $3.9 trillion. This growth trajectory far exceeded gains in every other major asset class. Consequently, silver now commands a market capitalization exceeding $5 trillion. This figure places it firmly behind only gold, which maintains an approximate $32 trillion valuation. The sheer velocity of this expansion has captured the attention of institutional investors and central banks alike. Several interconnected factors drove this explosive growth. First, sustained industrial demand from the renewable energy and electronics sectors created a solid demand floor. Second, macroeconomic uncertainty prompted a significant flight to tangible assets. Finally, constrained mining supply and strategic national stockpiling exacerbated the supply-demand imbalance. These elements combined to create a powerful bullish catalyst for the white metal. Comparative Asset Performance Analysis When placed in direct comparison, silver’s performance highlights a dramatic divergence from broader market trends. The following table illustrates the stark contrast in returns across major asset classes during the same 12-month window: Asset Approximate Performance Silver Market Cap +$3.9T / Price to All-Time High Gold ~ +70% S&P 500 Index ~ +17% Nasdaq Composite ~ +21% Bitcoin (BTC) ~ -4% This comparative data reveals a clear narrative. While traditional equity markets posted modest, positive gains, and Bitcoin experienced a slight contraction, precious metals soared. Gold’s strong 70% advance was impressive, yet it was ultimately overshadowed by silver’s parabolic move. This outperformance is partly due to silver’s higher volatility and its dual role as both a monetary and industrial metal. Investors seeking a hedge against inflation and currency debasement flooded into the sector, with silver offering greater potential leverage than gold. Expert Insight on the Structural Shift Market analysts point to a fundamental repricing of risk as the core driver. “The movement into silver represents more than a simple commodity trade,” explains a veteran commodities strategist cited in financial reports. “It is a strategic reallocation reflecting deep concerns over sovereign debt levels, geopolitical fragmentation, and the long-term store-of-value proposition of digital versus physical assets.” This sentiment echoes across trading desks, where silver is increasingly viewed not just as an industrial input but as a critical strategic reserve. The price surge to approximately $93 per ounce, followed by a consolidation around $89, demonstrates robust underlying support and healthy profit-taking activity rather than speculative froth. The Driving Forces Behind the Rally The rally’s foundations are built on verifiable macroeconomic and sector-specific trends. Firstly, global initiatives for green energy infrastructure have massively increased photovoltaic (PV) panel production. Silver is a critical component in solar cells, and demand from this sector has grown exponentially. Secondly, ongoing geopolitical tensions have accelerated central bank purchasing of precious metals for diversification. Nations are actively bolstering their tangible asset reserves. Key industrial demand drivers include: Solar Energy Expansion: Record installations of solar farms worldwide. Electronics Manufacturing: Continued use in conductors, contacts, and solders. Automotive Electrification: Increased use in electric vehicle components and charging infrastructure. Simultaneously, supply has struggled to keep pace. Major mining outputs have faced headwinds from rising operational costs, regulatory challenges, and long lead times for new project development. This persistent deficit between annual mine supply and total demand has systematically drained above-ground inventories, creating a tight physical market that amplifies price moves. Implications for Investors and the Global Economy The recalibration of the global asset hierarchy carries significant implications. For portfolio managers, the dramatic rise of the silver market cap necessitates a review of traditional 60/40 stock-bond allocations. Many are now advocating for a permanent strategic weighting in physical commodities, with precious metals forming its core. Furthermore, silver’s outperformance challenges the dominance of purely digital stores of value, prompting a broader debate about asset resilience in different economic climates. On a macroeconomic level, soaring commodity prices can act as a leading indicator for broader inflationary pressures. Central banks now monitor these markets not just for investment flows but for signals about future consumer price trends. The strength in silver also reflects a potential weakening of confidence in fiat currency systems, driving a renewed interest in asset-backed monetary history. This shift could influence future monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding reserve asset management. Conclusion The data presents a clear and compelling story: the silver market cap has undergone a transformation, surging by $3.9 trillion to surpass $5 trillion and outperform every other major asset class. This was not an isolated event but the result of converging industrial demand, investment safe-haven flows, and constrained supply. While gold remains the larger asset, silver’s explosive growth highlights its unique position at the intersection of industry and finance. As markets continue to evolve, the performance of silver will remain a critical barometer for global economic health, investor sentiment, and the ongoing dialogue between tangible and digital value. This historic rally redefines silver’s role in the modern financial ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly does ‘market cap’ mean for a commodity like silver? The market capitalization for silver is an estimate of the total value of all investable silver above ground. It is calculated by multiplying the current spot price by the total estimated volume of refined silver held in bars, coins, ETFs, and other liquid forms, representing its total financial footprint. Q2: Why did silver outperform gold during this period? Silver typically exhibits higher price volatility than gold. Its smaller market size means investment flows impact its price more dramatically. Additionally, strong industrial demand, particularly from the solar sector, provided a fundamental demand boost that pure monetary metals like gold do not experience to the same degree. Q3: Does this price surge indicate a bubble in the silver market? While the rapid price increase warrants caution, analysts note the move is supported by documented supply deficits and sustained industrial demand. The consolidation from the $93 high to the $89 range is seen as healthy. A bubble is typically characterized by purely speculative buying, whereas current demand appears structurally driven. Q4: How can an average investor gain exposure to silver? Investors can access silver through physical bullion (bars/coins), shares of silver mining companies, publicly traded silver streaming and royalty companies, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold physical silver. Each method carries different risk profiles concerning liquidity, storage, and direct price correlation. Q5: What are the main risks to silver’s price going forward? Key risks include a sharp global economic downturn reducing industrial demand, a significant strengthening of the US dollar, a sudden resolution of geopolitical tensions reducing safe-haven buying, or technological substitution in key applications like photovoltaics. Increased mining output from new projects could also ease the supply deficit over time.

On-chain activity and the real-world tokenization of assets point to a network that is becoming increasingly useful and more deeply embedded in financial infrastructure. The price action movement shows that ETH is stuck in a range where it is struggling to attract sustained momentum. Why Fundamentals And Price Are Diverging Ethereum is stuck in the middle, with the price hovering around $3,300, which is slightly up from earlier this month, but it remains compressed within the same triangle that has been forming since November. An investor known as Pepeisfriend mentioned on X that this kind of price action usually means pressure is building and a move is coming. However, the direction hasn’t been specified. Related Reading: Ethereum Outlook Has Improved, And It Could Outperform Bitcoin – Here’s What To Know As a result of this move, big money doesn’t seem very excited. ETH whales have been slowly reducing their exposure since mid-December, with no panic selling, just lightening positions. This kind of behavior signals a lower willingness from large investors to carry risk at these levels. The ETF flows have shown that there have been a few days of positive inflows, but the overall net flows are still negative, showing institutions haven’t truly rotated back into ETH the way they did during the previous hype phase. Meanwhile, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) activity looks weaker, and total value locked (TVL) has dropped noticeably, suggesting that on-chain capital is either leaving or just sitting on the sidelines. When DeFi isn’t active, ETH struggles to generate sustained upside momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Balance at Support—But the Next Move Matters Investor Pepeisfriend concluded that ETH isn’t bearish, but also not inspiring confidence for a breakout. This is a clear “wait for confirmation” phase that must be held, but probably still too early to go all-in or expect an immediate breakout. The Moment That Will Look Obvious In Hindsight While the market is obsessed with layer-1 competition, Ethereum is transitioning from a speculative asset into a yield-bearing, productive asset. Analyst Senior pointed out that on January 15, 2026, Sharplink Gaming deployed $170 million worth of ETH into a combined staking and restaking strategy on Linea. This move shows that institutional treasuries have moved beyond simple accumulation to active yield generation. At the same time, Visa is piloting stablecoin payouts directly on-chain, and EIP-7702 infrastructure is finally going live to eliminate biometric authentication seed phrases via Face ID. The user experience gap that once held ETH back has officially closed. This is the moment ETH is positioning itself as the most secure and liquid on-chain neobank financial platform in the world, and why the $3,500 breakout attempt will feel obvious.

57227043,658045,1768608020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57227043.jpeg,Ethereum Exchange Outflows Signal Supply Is Stepping Back,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-exchange-outflows-signal-supply-step-back/,"Ethereum is struggling to push above critical supply levels after a brief surge above $3,300, as the market attempts to stabilize following weeks of sustained selling pressure. While the rebound has sparked renewed optimism, price action remains fragile, with bulls still needing clear confirmation before a broader recovery can take hold. Still, the fact that ETH is holding near key levels has led some analysts to start calling for higher prices, arguing that the market may be entering a new phase after the recent downtrend. Supporting this view, a CryptoQuant analyst highlighted Ethereum Exchange Netflow spot data showing persistent ETH outflows from spot exchanges during price pullbacks, while inflows during upward moves remain relatively limited. This pattern suggests a more disciplined supply environment, where holders are reluctant to sell into weakness and are not aggressively distributing during rallies. In other words, sell-side pressure appears to be easing, even as Ethereum remains capped below major resistance. If demand returns, this type of netflow structure can support sharper upside moves, as fewer coins are available on exchanges to meet new buying interest. For now, Ethereum is caught between fading fear and unfinished recovery, with the next breakout attempt likely to define the short-term trend. ETH Supply Tightens As Exchange Outflows Persist Ethereum’s recent Exchange Netflow behavior suggests that the latest pullbacks have been met with holding and accumulation rather than broad-based distribution. Instead of rushing to send ETH onto exchanges during weakness, many participants appear willing to sit through volatility, reducing the immediate sell pressure that typically accelerates downtrends. This supports the idea that supply is gradually stepping back, even as price remains capped below key resistance zones and market sentiment stays cautious. However, Exchange Netflow alone is not enough to define direction. A favorable supply structure can still fail if demand remains weak, or if macro conditions deteriorate and force investors back into risk-off positioning. In that scenario, downside continuation cannot be ruled out, even if exchange balances remain constrained. That said, in the absence of major systemic stress, the current netflow profile offers a constructive backdrop for upside. The lack of supply expansion during drawdowns and the restrained profit-taking during rebounds imply that sellers are not in control. If demand rotates back into Ethereum, price could respond more efficiently because there is less readily available liquidity sitting on exchanges. In this sense, the on-chain data is not signaling an immediate breakout. Instead, it highlights a market structure that appears increasingly prepared for upward price action once broader conditions align and buyers regain conviction. Ethereum Bulls Fight Structural Resistance Ethereum is attempting to stabilize above the $3,300 zone after a sharp rebound from the December lows, but the chart shows bulls are still battling heavy overhead supply. Price recently pushed into the $3,300–$3,400 band, a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot point during this downtrend. While momentum has improved, ETH is still trading below key moving averages, reinforcing the idea that this move may be more of a recovery leg than a confirmed reversal. The blue moving average overhead continues to slope downward and sits above current price, highlighting that the broader structure remains pressured. At the same time, the green moving average is flattening near the $3,300 area, adding to the resistance cluster and making this zone difficult to reclaim cleanly. From a market structure perspective, ETH has shifted from a clear downtrend into a tighter consolidation, with buyers stepping in on dips and building higher lows since early January. However, volume remains relatively muted compared to the October and November selloffs, suggesting that conviction is still developing.

While the asset has managed to stay above the psychologically important $2 level, technical analysis suggests that a deeper correction could still unfold under unfavorable conditions. According to recent market assessments, XRP has already declined significantly from its prior cycle peak. Despite this pullback, analysts emphasize that the current phase does not necessarily indicate a breakdown of the long-term bullish trend. Instead, the focus has shifted to understanding how severe a downside move could become if bearish pressure intensifies. Analyst Outlines Worst-Case Price Range Crypto market analyst EGRAG Crypto addressed this scenario in a recent commentary where he deliberately approached XRP’s outlook from a defensive perspective. His analysis was designed to examine potential downside risk rather than predict an imminent reversal of the broader trend. #XRP – The Nightmare Scenario vs. Conviction : Today I’m wearing the #Bears hat briefly Not because I’m #Bearish , but to assess the worst-case scenario objectively. Long term, nothing is bearish in #XRP ’s fundamentals or structure. Only HATERS stays negative, not… pic.twitter.com/4Nd0pGIFqY — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 15, 2026 While maintaining confidence in XRP’s long-term fundamentals, he acknowledged that short-term volatility could still drive prices lower. Under this framework, EGRAG identified a possible decline of between 31% and 47% from current levels as the most severe outcome within the existing market cycle. Should such a move materialize, XRP could temporarily trade within a price band ranging from approximately $1.20 to $1.40. He described this range as a stress scenario rather than a base expectation, stressing that it would represent an extreme test of market confidence rather than a structural failure. Recent Performance and Market Positioning XRP’s current position reflects mixed momentum. After reaching a cycle high of $3.66 in July 2025, the asset has since retraced by roughly 43.7%. The latter part of 2025 proved particularly challenging, with XRP closing the year down 11.54% following a weak fourth quarter. Although a modest recovery of about 12.54% has occurred in early 2026, the price remains well below its previous peak. This uneven performance highlights XRP’s vulnerability to broader market sentiment, even as long-term adoption narratives continue to support optimistic projections. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Drawdowns Provide Context EGRAG’s downside estimates draw heavily from XRP’s historical behavior during previous market cycles. In earlier periods, XRP experienced corrections of similar magnitude before resuming upward movement. For example, following the 2018 market peak, XRP declined by roughly 31% before eventually rebounding in the subsequent bull phase. A later cycle saw an even steeper drop of about 47%, coinciding with widespread market stress during 2022. These historical precedents form the basis of the analyst’s view that a comparable retracement, while uncomfortable, would not be unprecedented. He noted that such outcomes would only be relevant if XRP’s current structure closely mirrors those earlier cycles, a theory that some market observers have already suggested. Outlook Remains Constructive Despite Risks Despite acknowledging the possibility of further declines, EGRAG reaffirmed his belief that XRP remains within a broader bullish cycle. He argued that macro-level indicators still support higher valuations over time, potentially reaching double-digit price levels once the current phase of consolidation resolves. He also clarified that any decision to increase exposure during a downturn reflects his personal investment strategy and should not be interpreted as financial guidance. Investors, he cautioned, should base their decisions on independent analysis and risk tolerance rather than analyst conviction alone. While near-term uncertainty persists, the prevailing view among bullish analysts is that XRP’s longer-term trajectory remains positive, even if the path forward includes additional volatility.

The platform has around 320 million active users and an average of 143 million active users on mobile as of January 2026, according to Forbes, citing Similarweb data. In December 2025, more than 30 million new users signed up for Threads. The platform keeps growing quickly as Elon Musk’s X has trouble holding onto its position with several policy changes and Elon Musk’s controversial streak since he shelled out $44 billion to buy the platform. The report also claims that Brands are moving toward Threads’ more advertiser-friendly environment as X faces user and ad revenue declines amid leadership and moderation concerns. Zuckerberg’s Threads is riding the hot hand On January 3, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Threads now has 320 million active users, surpassing X. He emphasized that the platform’s growth was purely organic with no aggressive marketing campaigns. Also, the integration with Instagram makes it easy to onboard existing Instagram users. Following the acquisition by Elon Musk, X has been losing daily active users . Estimates suggest that X has seen a decline of about 11.9% year-over-year as daily active users in January, while Threads has increased its active user count by about 38%. One of the major reasons for the growth of Threads is that it provides a more advertiser-friendly platform compared to X. Meta also continues to refine Threads’ features by addressing user feedback and directly competing with X’s functionality. Analysts project that Threads could generate about $11.3 billion in revenue. Brands are moving away from X due to the growing discomfort around Musk’s leadership, along with concerns around content moderation. About 68% of X’s revenue is generated from ads and in 2024, it generated $2.5 billion in revenue from ads, which represents a 13.7% decline year-over-year. X isn’t the only platform in decline. Bluesky, which came out as a direct competitor to X has been shedding users. Bluesky grew from a user base of about 10 million to about 40 million in late 2025. However, Bluesky’s daily active users are down to about 3.6 million, representing a 44.4% year-over-year decline. Zuckerberg and Musk’s competition plays out on the social media landscape Zuckerberg and Musk have a rivalry that has played out publicly at times. It even escalated to the point of a cage match in 2023. However, their real rivalry has been in the tech domain, where they often find themselves sponsoring competing causes. Threads’ growth challenges X’s historical dominance in real-time conversation and news distribution. Both the US and international user counts have been declining since 2024, even though there are spikes in usage during major news events. However, for all its problems, X still has more daily active users on mobile in the United States, with 21.2 million compared to Threads’ 19.5 million. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This pivotal reading, reported by data analytics firm Alternative, indicates a market sentiment squarely in neutral territory, a condition often associated with periods of consolidation and deliberation among investors. The index’s movement provides a crucial snapshot of collective psychology, a key driver of price action in the volatile digital asset space. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Methodology The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a daily barometer for market emotion. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” A score of 50, therefore, marks the exact midpoint, suggesting a balanced and arguably rational market environment. The calculation is not arbitrary; it synthesizes data from six distinct market dimensions to form a composite view. Specifically, the index weights its components as follows: Volatility (25%): Measures current price swings against historical averages. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading volume and momentum. Sustained high volume can indicate greed-driven buying or fear-driven selling. Social Media (15%): Tracks sentiment and buzz across platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from periodic polls of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can signal a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Gauges retail interest through search volume for key terms like “Bitcoin” or “crypto crash.” This multi-factor approach aims to mitigate the bias of any single metric, providing a more robust gauge of the market’s emotional temperature. The Significance of a Neutral Reading in 2025 A score of 50 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index carries substantial weight for analysts and traders. Historically, prolonged periods in the “Neutral” zone (typically 45-55) have often preceded significant directional moves. For instance, the index hovered near neutrality in late 2020 before the massive bull run of early 2021, and again in mid-2023 before a sustained rally. This neutrality suggests a market at a crossroads, where bullish and bearish forces are in relative balance. Market veterans interpret this equilibrium in several ways. Some view it as a cooling-off period after emotional extremes, allowing fundamentals to reassert their influence. Others see it as a consolidation phase where assets build a base for their next major trend. Crucially, a neutral reading often indicates reduced panic selling and diminished FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying, potentially leading to healthier, more technically-driven price action. Expert Analysis on Current Market Dynamics Financial analysts point to several concurrent factors supporting this neutral sentiment. Firstly, Bitcoin’s price has demonstrated relative stability around key psychological levels, reducing volatility. Secondly, trading volume, while healthy, lacks the frenetic pace associated with market tops or bottoms. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in major economies like the EU and partial frameworks in the US have provided a more predictable, if cautious, environment. “A neutral Fear & Greed Index is arguably one of the most interesting signals,” notes a veteran market strategist from a leading blockchain analytics firm. “It tells us the market is digesting information rationally. Investors are neither capitulating in fear nor chasing prices in euphoria. This is often when savvy accumulation or distribution occurs quietly.” This perspective underscores that major institutional moves frequently happen when retail sentiment is calm, not when it is at an extreme. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis To appreciate the current reading, one must examine historical extremes. The index plunged to single digits—indicating “Extreme Fear”—during major sell-offs like the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 and the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in May 2022. Conversely, it soared above 90—into “Extreme Greed”—during the peak of the 2021 bull market and the NFT frenzy. The journey from these extremes back to neutrality often marks a transition in market cycles. The table below illustrates recent key readings and their market context: Index Score Sentiment Approximate Period Market Context 10 Extreme Fear May 2022 Terra-Luna collapse, Celsius issues 85 Extreme Greed November 2021 Bitcoin ATH near $69,000 25 Fear December 2022 FTX bankruptcy aftermath 50 Neutral Current (2025) Post-ETF adoption, regulatory digestion This historical comparison reveals that the market has navigated through profound fear and greed to reach its current balanced state, suggesting a maturation in investor behavior and market structure. Practical Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For individual and institutional investors, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading serves as a strategic tool, not a direct trading signal. It primarily advises on market psychology. In “Extreme Fear” zones, contrarian investors might see a potential buying opportunity, albeit with high risk. In “Extreme Greed” zones, it can act as a caution flag for overexposure. At 50, the index suggests a market where neither contrarian extreme is present. Consequently, investment decisions in a neutral sentiment environment should rely more heavily on other analyses. These include fundamental research on blockchain adoption, technical analysis of price charts, and macro-economic factors like interest rates and inflation. The neutral sentiment effectively removes extreme emotion as a primary market driver, allowing other factors to take precedence. This period is often ideal for portfolio rebalancing, disciplined dollar-cost averaging, and thorough research without the noise of market mania or panic. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 50 represents a significant moment of equilibrium for digital asset markets. This neutral reading reflects a collective pause, where neither overwhelming fear nor unchecked greed dominates investor psychology. By synthesizing data from volatility, volume, social media, and search trends, the index provides a validated, multi-dimensional view of market sentiment. For observers and participants, understanding this tool’s methodology and historical context is essential. While the index does not predict the future, a score of 50 highlights a market in balance—a condition that often sets the stage for the next major phase based on fundamentals and macro developments, rather than emotion alone. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 50 mean? A score of 50 indicates the market is in “Neutral” sentiment. It sits exactly midway between “Extreme Fear” (0) and “Extreme Greed” (100), suggesting a balanced emotional state among investors with no overwhelming bias toward panic or euphoria. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is compiled and published daily by the data provider Alternative. They use an automated system to gather and weight data from its six core components, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment. Q3: Is a neutral Fear & Greed Index a good time to buy cryptocurrency? The index measures sentiment, not value. A neutral reading suggests the market is not driven by extreme emotion, which can be a healthier environment for making rational decisions. However, it is not a standalone buy or sell signal. Investment decisions should combine this data with fundamental and technical analysis. Q4: How accurate has the Fear & Greed Index been at predicting market turns? The index is a descriptive tool, not a predictive one. It reflects current sentiment. Historically, prolonged periods at extreme readings (below 20 or above 80) have often preceded market reversals, as they indicate unsustainable emotional states. Neutral readings often indicate consolidation. Q5: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market dominance is a 10% component, the other metrics—like volatility, volume, and social media—encompass the broader cryptocurrency market. Therefore, it is widely regarded as a sentiment indicator for the crypto asset class as a whole, with Bitcoin as its most significant single influence.

This pivotal policy shift represents one of the most significant integrations of digital assets into traditional American finance to date, potentially opening homeownership doors for millions of crypto investors who have previously faced barriers when applying for conventional mortgages. Crypto Mortgage Policy Details and Implementation Newrez’s new crypto mortgage program specifically recognizes several categories of digital assets during the underwriting process. According to official documentation reviewed by financial analysts, the company will accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. This comprehensive approach covers both direct cryptocurrency ownership and regulated investment vehicles that track crypto prices. However, the implementation includes crucial safeguards and requirements. Applicants must hold their digital assets at regulated U.S. exchanges or financial institutions, ensuring proper custody and verification protocols. Furthermore, Newrez applies specific volatility adjustments during asset evaluation, recognizing the price fluctuations inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Despite accepting crypto for qualification, all loan repayments and associated fees must still be made in U.S. dollars, maintaining traditional currency requirements for the actual mortgage servicing. Technical Framework and Risk Assessment Financial technology experts note that Newrez’s approach incorporates sophisticated risk assessment models. The company reportedly uses a combination of historical volatility data, stress testing scenarios, and conservative valuation methods when evaluating cryptocurrency holdings. For instance, the lender might apply a significant discount to the current market value of crypto assets or use a multi-month average price rather than spot prices to account for market fluctuations. This technical framework represents a substantial advancement from earlier, more tentative approaches to crypto-backed lending. Previously, most financial institutions either completely rejected cryptocurrency holdings or required their conversion to traditional currency before consideration. Newrez’s methodology acknowledges crypto as a legitimate asset class while implementing appropriate risk management protocols. Demographic Drivers and Market Context Newrez explicitly cited demographic trends as a primary motivation for this policy innovation. Company representatives noted that approximately 45% of Generation Z and Millennial investors own cryptocurrency, according to recent surveys from financial research firms. This substantial ownership rate among younger Americans creates both a market opportunity and a potential solution to declining homeownership rates in these age groups. The timing coincides with broader financial industry developments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, creating regulated investment vehicles that have attracted billions in institutional and retail investment. These ETFs provide a bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets, making digital assets more accessible to conventional financial institutions. Additionally, cryptocurrency adoption has reached significant milestones. Recent data from the Federal Reserve indicates that approximately 15% of American adults now own some form of cryptocurrency, with ownership rates highest among younger, college-educated demographics. This growing adoption has created pressure on traditional financial institutions to accommodate digital assets in their service offerings. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Mortgage Requirements To understand the significance of Newrez’s policy, consider traditional mortgage qualification requirements: Asset Type Traditional Mortgage Treatment Newrez Crypto Mortgage Treatment Cash/Savings Full value considered Full value considered Stocks/ETFs Market value with moderate adjustments Market value with moderate adjustments Retirement Accounts Partial value considered Partial value considered Cryptocurrency (Pre-2025) Generally excluded or must be sold Adjusted value considered without selling This comparison highlights how Newrez’s policy creates parity between cryptocurrency and other investment assets in the mortgage qualification process. The approach recognizes that for many younger applicants, cryptocurrency represents a substantial portion of their investment portfolio and net worth. Industry Precedents and Regulatory Landscape While Newrez represents the largest traditional mortgage lender to adopt such a comprehensive crypto policy, several precedents exist in the financial industry. Some smaller lenders and specialized fintech companies have offered crypto-backed loans in various forms since the early 2020s. However, these typically involved using cryptocurrency as collateral for cash loans rather than integrating digital assets into conventional mortgage underwriting. The regulatory environment has evolved significantly in recent years. Key developments include: 2023 Banking Guidance: Federal banking regulators issued clarified guidance on cryptocurrency custody and valuation for financial institutions 2024 ETF Approvals: SEC approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs created regulated investment vehicles State-Level Initiatives: Several states have passed legislation recognizing digital assets in various financial contexts Tax Clarifications: IRS guidance on cryptocurrency taxation provided clearer frameworks for asset valuation These regulatory developments have reduced uncertainty for traditional financial institutions considering cryptocurrency integration. Newrez’s policy appears designed to operate within existing regulatory frameworks while pushing boundaries in product innovation. Potential Impacts on Homeownership Rates Housing economists have begun analyzing the potential effects of crypto-inclusive mortgage policies on broader homeownership trends. Early models suggest that such policies could modestly increase qualification rates among younger applicants, particularly in the 25-40 age range where cryptocurrency ownership is highest relative to traditional assets. However, experts caution that cryptocurrency volatility remains a significant consideration. The substantial price fluctuations characteristic of digital assets could create qualification volatility for applicants whose net worth is heavily concentrated in cryptocurrency. Newrez’s adjusted valuation approach attempts to mitigate this risk, but the long-term stability of such models remains untested through full market cycles. Technical Implementation and Operational Challenges Implementing cryptocurrency valuation in mortgage underwriting presents several technical challenges that Newrez has addressed through its policy framework. Key implementation aspects include: Verification Protocols: The requirement for assets held at regulated U.S. institutions enables proper verification and anti-money laundering compliance Valuation Methodology: Using adjusted values rather than spot prices accounts for market volatility Documentation Standards: Creating standardized documentation requirements for cryptocurrency holdings Staff Training: Educating loan officers and underwriters on cryptocurrency fundamentals and valuation These implementation details demonstrate that Newrez has developed a comprehensive operational framework rather than simply announcing a policy change. The company reportedly began developing this capability in 2023, working with cryptocurrency exchanges, regulatory experts, and financial technology partners to create a robust system. Broader Implications for Financial Inclusion Beyond immediate homeownership impacts, Newrez’s policy has implications for financial inclusion and asset recognition. For years, cryptocurrency advocates have argued that digital assets represent a form of wealth creation outside traditional financial systems, particularly for younger generations and underserved communities. By recognizing cryptocurrency in mortgage underwriting, Newrez validates this perspective within mainstream finance. This recognition could have cascading effects across other financial products and services. If cryptocurrency proves viable in mortgage underwriting, other credit products might follow suit, potentially including auto loans, personal loans, and business financing. Such developments would further integrate digital assets into the broader financial ecosystem. Risk Considerations and Consumer Protection While innovative, Newrez’s crypto mortgage policy includes several risk considerations that potential applicants should understand. The volatility adjustments applied to cryptocurrency valuations mean that applicants cannot necessarily qualify based on peak prices during market rallies. Additionally, the requirement to hold assets at regulated institutions excludes decentralized wallets and some international platforms. Consumer protection advocates have raised questions about how well applicants understand these nuances. There are concerns that some crypto investors might overestimate their qualification potential or misunderstand the valuation adjustments. Newrez has addressed these concerns through enhanced disclosure requirements and applicant education materials that clearly explain the valuation methodology. Furthermore, the policy creates potential complications during market downturns. If cryptocurrency values decline significantly during the loan application process or shortly after approval, applicants might face qualification challenges or need to provide additional assets. These scenarios require careful management through the underwriting and closing processes. Conclusion Newrez’s decision to accept cryptocurrency for mortgage applications represents a significant milestone in the integration of digital assets into traditional finance. This crypto mortgage policy acknowledges the substantial cryptocurrency holdings among younger generations while implementing appropriate safeguards for volatility and verification. The approach could expand homeownership access for crypto investors who have previously faced barriers in traditional mortgage markets. As financial institutions continue adapting to digital asset adoption, Newrez’s initiative may establish precedents for how cryptocurrency integrates with conventional lending practices, potentially influencing broader industry standards for crypto mortgage programs in the coming years. FAQs Q1: What specific cryptocurrencies does Newrez accept for mortgage qualification? Newrez accepts Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, and spot cryptocurrency ETFs that trade on regulated exchanges. The policy does not currently extend to other cryptocurrencies or tokens. Q2: How does Newrez account for cryptocurrency price volatility in mortgage underwriting? The company applies volatility adjustments during asset evaluation, potentially using discounted values, multi-month averages, or stress-tested valuations rather than current spot prices. This conservative approach helps mitigate risk from price fluctuations. Q3: Can I make mortgage payments using cryptocurrency instead of U.S. dollars? No, all loan repayments and associated fees must be paid in U.S. dollars. The policy only allows cryptocurrency holdings to be considered as qualifying assets during the application process, not as payment currency. Q4: Where must I hold my cryptocurrency for it to qualify with Newrez? Cryptocurrency must be held at regulated U.S. exchanges or financial institutions. This requirement ensures proper custody, verification, and compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Q5: How might this policy affect homeownership rates among younger generations? By recognizing cryptocurrency as qualifying assets, the policy could help younger applicants who have substantial crypto holdings but limited traditional assets qualify for mortgages. However, the actual impact depends on adoption rates, cryptocurrency values, and how many lenders follow similar approaches.

This stunning financial milestone, confirmed by founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh in an exclusive interview, traces its origins not to Silicon Valley boardrooms, but to a simple Reddit post and a basement cryptocurrency mining hobby. The company’s journey from a side project to a major player in the competitive AI infrastructure space offers a compelling blueprint for bootstrapped success. Runpod’s Unconventional Path from Basement to Boardroom The genesis of Runpod is a story of adaptation and developer frustration. In late 2021, corporate developers Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh faced a common domestic dilemma. They had invested approximately $50,000 in specialized GPU rigs for Ethereum mining in their New Jersey basements. However, the venture proved financially lackluster and, critically, was facing obsolescence due to the impending Ethereum “Merge” upgrade. More importantly, the founders found the process simply boring after a few months. Simultaneously, their professional work exposed them to the burgeoning field of machine learning, revealing a significant problem: the software stack for managing GPUs was, in Lu’s words, “hot garbage.” This intersection of personal necessity and professional insight became their catalyst. Consequently, they made a pivotal decision to repurpose their mining hardware into AI servers. This move preceded the public explosion of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E 2. As they converted their rigs, they intimately experienced the pain points developers faced when working with GPU infrastructure. They identified a clear market gap for a platform that prioritized developer experience, speed, and easy configuration. Therefore, Runpod was born not from a grand venture capital pitch, but from a practical need to solve a tangible problem they themselves encountered. The Reddit Launch That Sparked Traction By early 2022, Lu and Singh had a basic platform ready. It focused on hosting AI applications with an emphasis on developer tools like APIs and command-line interfaces. However, as first-time founders with no marketing experience or network, they faced the classic chicken-and-egg problem of attracting users. Their solution was ingeniously simple and low-cost. Lu recalled, “I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.” They posted in AI-focused subreddits, offering free access to their servers in exchange for feedback. This direct, community-driven approach worked brilliantly. It provided immediate, authentic user testing and gradually converted those beta testers into paying customers. Astonishingly, within nine months, this Reddit-driven growth enabled them to quit their corporate jobs at Comcast after reaching $1 million in revenue. Navigating Growth and the Shift to Enterprise Initial success brought a new, unexpected challenge. Within six months, business users began requesting to run production workloads on the platform. As Lu recounted, these users explicitly stated they could not rely on servers located in personal basements. This feedback forced a strategic evolution. Initially averse to venture capital, the founders pursued creative, bootstrapped solutions. They formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to rapidly scale capacity without taking on debt or diluting equity. This period was intensely stressful, requiring them to constantly forecast demand and secure hardware in a market where GPU shortages were becoming common. Singh emphasized the pressure, noting that if capacity lagged, user sentiment would shift and customers would migrate to competitors. Meanwhile, their organic community on Reddit and Discord continued to swell, especially following the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT, which ignited global demand for AI compute. This visibility serendipitously caught the eye of venture capitalists scouting for investments. Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, discovered Runpod through Reddit and initiated contact. This first VC interaction was educational for Lu, who admits he didn’t know how to pitch. Malik provided crucial guidance on the venture capital mindset, setting the stage for a future relationship while the company continued its disciplined, revenue-focused growth for nearly two more years without external funding. Strategic Funding and Market Positioning The company’s fortunes accelerated dramatically by May 2024. The AI application boom was in full swing, and Runpod’s early bet on developer-centric AI hosting was yielding massive returns. The platform had grown to serve 100,000 developers. This traction enabled them to secure a $20 million seed round, a significant event co-led by the venture arms of industry giants Dell and Intel. The round also included participation from notable angel investors like Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond—who had discovered the product as a user and reached out via support chat—and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. This funding validated their bootstrap-to-scale model and provided capital for aggressive expansion. Today, Runpod serves an impressive 500,000 developers. Its customer base ranges from individual hobbyists to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multi-million-dollar annual contracts. The platform’s cloud infrastructure now spans 31 global regions and boasts high-profile clients including Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow. The founders are now planning a Series A funding round, entering negotiations from a position of remarkable strength with a proven, high-growth business model. The Competitive Landscape and Runpod’s Developer-Centric Vision Runpod operates in an intensely competitive arena. Developers can choose from hyperscale clouds like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as specialized GPU providers like CoreWeave and Core Scientific. This landscape requires clear differentiation. Runpod’s founders position their platform not merely as infrastructure, but as a foundational tool for the next generation of software development. They argue that while the nature of coding will evolve, it will not disappear. Instead, programmers will increasingly become creators and operators of AI agents. Runpod’s key differentiators include: Developer-First Design: Built by developers for developers, focusing on API simplicity and integration. Serverless GPU Option: Automates configuration to reduce devops overhead. Bootstrapped Discipline: A focus on profitability and avoiding unsustainable free tiers. Community Roots: Maintains a strong connection to its open, community-driven origins. “Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu stated, outlining a vision where Runpod becomes the default platform for building and deploying AI-powered applications. This long-term, product-centric view, forged in the constraints of a New Jersey basement, continues to guide their strategy against well-funded incumbents. Conclusion The Runpod narrative is a powerful case study in modern startup development. It underscores that profound success can originate from solving genuine, personal pain points and engaging directly with a community. The company’s achievement of a $120 million annual revenue run rate, starting from a Reddit post and repurposed mining rigs, challenges conventional startup wisdom. It highlights the value of bootstrapping, product-led growth, and strategic patience. As the AI infrastructure war intensifies, Runpod’s unique origin story and steadfast developer focus position it as a formidable and authentic contender in shaping the future of how AI applications are built and scaled globally. FAQs Q1: What is Runpod’s core business? Runpod is a cloud platform specifically designed for hosting and scaling AI applications. It provides developers with easy access to GPU-powered servers, developer tools, and a serverless option to build and run AI models. Q2: How did Runpod initially attract its first users? The founders, lacking a marketing budget, posted offers on AI-related subreddits in early 2022. They provided free access to their GPU servers in exchange for user feedback, which successfully built an initial community of beta testers who later became paying customers. Q3: Why did Runpod’s founders switch from crypto mining to AI? Their Ethereum mining hobby was becoming unprofitable ahead of “The Merge” network upgrade and was personally unfulfilling. Their professional experience in machine learning revealed a major gap in developer-friendly GPU management software, prompting them to repurpose their hardware. Q4: Who are Runpod’s main competitors? Runpod competes with major public clouds (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) and specialized GPU cloud providers like CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, and Crusoe Cloud. It differentiates through a strong focus on developer experience and tools. Q5: What is Runpod’s current scale and customer base? As of 2025, Runpod serves approximately 500,000 developers. Its infrastructure spans 31 global regions, and its customers range from individual developers to large enterprises like OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow.

This crucial metric, a barometer for alternative cryptocurrency performance, now sits at its highest level in recent weeks, prompting traders and analysts to scrutinize underlying blockchain activity and capital flow patterns with renewed intensity. The movement, though incremental, occurs within a complex macroeconomic landscape characterized by evolving regulatory frameworks and institutional adoption trends, making its implications far-reaching for portfolio strategies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Rise to 27 CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a primary gauge for market sentiment cycles. Fundamentally, the index algorithmically measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have outperformed Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. The calculation deliberately excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus purely on speculative and utility-driven assets. Consequently, a score approaching 100 strongly suggests a broad-based ‘altcoin season,’ where capital rotates from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets seeking higher returns. Conversely, a low score indicates a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where the pioneer cryptocurrency dominates market momentum and risk appetite. The recent ascent to 27, therefore, represents a measurable shift. While still far from the threshold indicating a full altcoin season, the upward trajectory suggests a growing number of altcoins are beginning to outpace Bitcoin’s price action over the medium-term horizon. This movement often correlates with increased on-chain activity for networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, as developers and users engage with decentralized applications. Market data from the past week shows notable volume increases for several major altcoins, potentially foreshadowing the index’s climb. Index Value Market Interpretation Typical Investor Action 0-25 Strong Bitcoin Dominance Capital preservation, focus on BTC 26-50 Early Rotation Signs Research and selective altcoin accumulation 51-75 Developing Altcoin Momentum Diversification into high-conviction alts 76-100 Full Altcoin Season Heightened risk-taking, profit-taking from BTC Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Understanding the current index position of 27 requires examining historical precedents. Previous crypto market cycles have demonstrated that transitions between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance are rarely abrupt. Instead, they typically unfold through phases of accumulation, recognition, and mania. For instance, in the lead-up to the 2021 altcoin season, the index hovered in the 20-40 range for several weeks before a decisive breakout. Analysts often monitor supporting indicators like Bitcoin’s dominance chart, which measures BTC’s share of the total crypto market cap, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. Currently, Bitcoin dominance has shown slight weakness, retreating from recent highs. This minor pullback often provides the necessary liquidity and psychological space for altcoins to rally. Furthermore, the broader financial environment plays a critical role. Rising or falling interest rates, inflation data, and traditional equity market performance directly influence risk asset appetite, including cryptocurrencies. The present increase to 27 may reflect a market cautiously testing the waters for altcoin exposure after a period of consolidation, rather than committing to a full-scale rotation. Expert Insights on Metric Interpretation Seasoned market analysts emphasize that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator, confirming trends already in motion rather than predicting them. ‘A move to 27 is noteworthy, but it’s the sustained direction and velocity that matter,’ notes a report from a major blockchain analytics firm. ‘Investors should cross-reference this with on-chain data, such as exchange net flows and network growth for specific altcoins, to validate the trend.’ The firm’s data indicates that smart money wallets have begun making small, incremental purchases of select altcoins over the past month, a pattern that sometimes precedes larger market moves. Additionally, the structure of the index itself warrants consideration. By focusing on the top 100 assets, it captures established projects with significant communities and development activity. This means a rising index often reflects strength in large-cap altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Polkadot (DOT) first, before potentially trickling down to mid and small-cap tokens. Therefore, the current reading suggests these major alternative networks are starting to demonstrate relative strength, which could build a foundation for a broader rally if sustained. Potential Impacts and Strategic Considerations The rise of the index to 27 carries several immediate and longer-term implications for different market participants. For retail investors, it acts as a signal to review and potentially rebalance portfolios. For institutional entities, it may influence the weighting of crypto assets within a diversified fund. Moreover, project developers often see increased engagement and funding interest when altcoins enter a period of outperformance. Key areas to watch include: Layer-1 Blockchain Activity: Transaction counts and fees on networks like Solana and Avalanche. DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL): An increase often accompanies altcoin strength. Funding Rates: Positive funding rates in perpetual swap markets can indicate bullish sentiment. Regulatory Developments: Clear guidelines can remove uncertainty and boost altcoin investment. Strategically, a prudent approach involves monitoring whether the index can hold above 25 and challenge the 30-35 zone in the coming weeks. A failure to do so might see it revert, reaffirming Bitcoin’s short-term dominance. However, a successful breach could accelerate momentum, drawing more capital into the altcoin space. This dynamic creates a critical observation period for traders, where confirmation from other metrics is essential before making significant allocation changes. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s climb to 27 marks a perceptible, though early, shift in cryptocurrency market dynamics. This movement away from extreme Bitcoin dominance suggests a budding investor appetite for the differentiated risk-return profiles offered by alternative digital assets. While the index remains firmly outside ‘season’ territory, its upward trajectory provides a crucial data point for navigating the complex 2025 market landscape. Ultimately, sustained movement will depend on a confluence of technological innovation, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory clarity. Observers and participants should now watch closely for follow-through in both the index and complementary on-chain datasets to gauge the durability of this emerging trend. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 27 mean? An index value of 27 indicates that a modest, but growing, number of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) are outperforming Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. It suggests early signs of market rotation but does not confirm a full altcoin season has begun. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates the index by tracking the percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (by market cap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have yielded a higher return than Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. The score reflects that percentage. Q3: What is the difference between a Bitcoin season and an altcoin season? A Bitcoin season is characterized by Bitcoin significantly outperforming most other cryptocurrencies, often during periods of market uncertainty or mainstream adoption focus. An altcoin season occurs when the majority of altcoins outperform Bitcoin, typically during phases of high risk appetite and niche narrative speculation. Q4: Should I immediately buy altcoins when this index rises? Not necessarily. The index is a lagging indicator. Prudent investors use it as one tool among many, combining it with fundamental research, technical analysis, and on-chain data before making investment decisions. A rising index suggests a good time for research and due diligence. Q5: Has the Altcoin Season Index been a reliable indicator in the past? Historically, the index has been effective at identifying confirmed trends and market cycle phases. However, like all market indicators, it is not infallible and should not be used in isolation. It works best when confirming trends suggested by other data sources like trading volume, developer activity, and macroeconomic factors.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2029 expects the token to reach a peak price of $12.20. By 2032, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $19.21. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2026? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.13 Market Cap $2.26B Trading Volume $256.16M Circulating Supply 547.24M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.23 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-h High $4.65 24-h Low $4.09 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 9.67% (High) 14-Day RSI 67.91 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $3.37 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $4.44 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is consolidating after a strong breakout, not reversing. Daily momentum is still bullish, but upside is capped for now. Short-term weakness appears if $4.05 fails. ICP 1-day price analysis On the 1-day timeframe for January 17, ICP is trading around $4.14 after a sharp impulse from the $3.10–$3.20 base, with price now stalling just below the upper Bollinger Band near $4.36. The strong bullish candle that pushed the price vertically has been followed by smaller-bodied candles, signaling momentum exhaustion rather than outright reversal. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI has cooled from near-70 to the mid-60s, which reflects healthy consolidation rather than weakness, while MACD remains positive with expanding histogram bars, suggesting bullish momentum is still present but slowing. As long as ICP holds above the $3.85–$3.90 region and the mid-band around $3.38, the daily structure remains bullish, with $4.35–$4.60 acting as the next upside test. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4H chart, price is compressing between the Alligator averages, hovering near $4.13–$4.17, which highlights indecision after repeated rejections from the $4.45–$4.60 zone. OBV has flattened and CMF has slipped slightly negative, pointing to fading demand and mild distribution during this range. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The inability to reclaim and hold above the green Alligator line near $4.22 keeps short-term pressure tilted sideways-to-bearish, with a loss of $4.05 likely opening a retrace toward $3.80–$3.90, where prior demand and dynamic support converge. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $3.94 BUY SMA 5 $3.59 BUY SMA 10 $3.35 BUY SMA 21 $3.20 BUY SMA 50 $3.37 BUY SMA 100 $3.86 BUY SMA 200 $4.44 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 3.38 BUY EMA 5 $ 3.31 BUY EMA 10 $ 3.21 BUY EMA 21 $ 3.19 BUY EMA 50 $ 3.48 BUY EMA 100 $ 3.87 BUY EMA 200 $ 4.47 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is likely to remain range-bound in the short term, but as long as $3.85 holds, the broader bias favors continuation toward $4.60 rather than a full breakdown. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 after 2032. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Though the current internet computer sentiment is sideways, future price movements and market cap are expected to be positive. Will ICP reach $1000?

The company has claimed the money will help them grow and expand their services before share offerings begin publicly. Based in New York, the company provides custody and security services for digital assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Its subsidiary, Anchorage Digital Bank, made history as the first federally chartered digital-asset bank in the United States, giving it official regulatory recognition. Sources have said the company’s valuation has yet to be finalized. A spokesperson for Anchorage Digital declined to comment on fundraising efforts or IPO plans, citing their private nature. Anchorage to launch its own stablecoins Anchorage Digital Bank NA’s federal license allows it to issue stablecoins in the US under the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law in July. In September, the firm announced plans to partner with El Salvador-based Tether Holdings SA, the world’s biggest stablecoin issuer, to launch the USAT token for the US. Thus, stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar and are backed by real money or other assets held by the bank. As a result, stablecoins have gained popularity as consumers and businesses can use digital currency without the worries of sudden price changes. Anchorage announced a major partnership with Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin company, in September. The partnership has culminated in a new stablecoin, USAT Stablecoin for the U.S. Market. Nathan McCauley, the company’s chief executive, said Anchorage aims to expand its stablecoin team substantially over the next year. As digital dollars gain momentum and new regulations open up opportunities to develop innovative banking services. Anchorage’s stablecoins are secure, reliable, and in compliance with all existing laws and regulations, and the company plans to hire experts in technology, finance, and compliance to conduct that work. Anchorage’s foray into stablecoins is also part of a larger trend in the cryptocurrency world. In this context, real cryptocurrencies offer both the comfort and stability traditional currencies do — thus, financial institutions and investors are progressively looking to digital assets backed by real money. Anchorage expands despite market challenges According to Anchorage Digital, the year 2025 has been a year of growth for the company. That growth was achieved partly through acquisitions, new partnerships, and the launch of new services, including stablecoin issuance. Those moves aim to keep the company at the forefront of digital money for large investors and institutions. “2025 was our year of scale. We made a series of acquisitions, inked major partnerships, and launched new business lines like stablecoin issuance to solidify our lead in institutional crypto,” an Anchorage spokesperson said in a statement. The firm secured $350 million in funding from major investors, including KKR, Goldman Sachs, GIC, and Apollo, in late 2021. At that time, the company was valued at more than $3 billion. Even though cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin, dropped later in October, Anchorage is moving forward with fundraising. Many crypto companies are going public, and some, like Tether, are raising record amounts of money. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Priced at $0.04 during Phase 7 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising new crypto investment alternatives to ADA. MUTM is in the early stages of establishing a decentralized lending and borrowing service with interest-yielding assets and liquidity pools. Already, its presale has attracted close to $20 million in investment from more than 18,800 individuals. Cardano Price Analysis ADA is observed to have support points around $0.404-$0.406, with a modestly bullish trend, but has yet to break past the resistance points at $0.408-$0.410. Its bullish trend is rather limited, with possible price movements likely to remain within the range of $0.415-$0.418. For those who are looking for more significant asymmetric gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the newly developing crypto project, is becoming increasingly popular with the presale model, utility approach, as well as the impending launch of the protocol. This further cements its standing as the top crypto for those who are seeking gains beyond conventional assets. MUTM Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance offers rewards to early investors through the sale of tokens at a discount price prior to the initial public offer. From $0.01 at the start of the presale to the current price of $0.04 during Phase 7, this represents a 300% increase. For those who have missed this move, phase 7’s price is the cheapest the token will ever cost. An investor who puts $3,000 into MUTM at $0.04 will see the investment rise to $4,500 when it reaches $0.06 at launch, realizing a profit of $1,500. After the launch, MUTM is expected to rise to $1, thereby growing $3,000 to $75,000 with a 25x ROI. Such investment opportunities make MUTM the top crypto for early-stage investors. Market Interest & High-Profile Participants The presale event is witnessing the participation of both retail and whale investors, along with institutional investors. Some investors who had success stories in the past in projects such as Cardano have also invested substantial amounts in this presale event, with one whale investing over $75,000. This also shows that the roadmap of this new project is appreciated, thus making MUTM the new cryptocurrency being noticed in the DeFi market. Scarcity Creates FOMO The tokenomics of Mutuum Finance are also an added feature that makes it attractive. The total supply of the tokens is fixed at 4 billion, with no minting of more tokens. This ensures that there is no dilution of the existing tokens. Out of the total of 4 billion tokens, 1.82 billion tokens are allocated for the presale stage of the project, with more than 850 million tokens already claimed. This momentum speaks to the project’s FOMO. Real-time Infrastructure Analysis If DeFi is to succeed, proper pricing and risk management are necessary, and in MUTM, Chainlink oracles are utilized in the verification of the price of assets like USD, ETH, and AVAX. In the scenario where a user locks in 10 ETH at a price of $3,000, the user would have a collateral value of $30,000, and at a Loan-to-Value ratio of 70%, the user would get a loan of $21,000. Chainlink then continuously updates the price of ETH as market conditions change, ensuring the protocol always has an accurate view of the collateral’s real-time value. More Adoption Indicates Future Successes Now that the presale is in place and the factor of scarcity is added to the list of strengths of the project on the chain, MUTM is slowly gaining popularity as an alternative to Cardano and other altcoins. As the project offers investment in the early stages of development and the potential for growth post-launch, Mutuum Finance is slowly becoming the top crypto to buy and hold for asymmetrical gains in the coming months.

Their balance sheets grew sharply, and their actions left a clear mark on supply and markets. The numbers tell a story of heavy buying, pause, and then corporate moves to protect share value. Related Reading: Crypto Money Floods US Politics As $21 Million Backs Trump PAC Large Treasury Buying Spree Reports have disclosed that these treasury firms deployed close to $50 billion into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens during 2025. At the start of the year, treasuries held more than $56 billion in crypto. By January one, 2026, that figure had risen to $134 billion — a gain of 137%. This buying helped push institutional ownership higher, with treasuries holding more than 5% of both Bitcoin and Ethereum supply by year-end. Public companies alone raised their Bitcoin reserves from about 598,714 coins to more than 1 million, an increase near 500,000 BTC. Market Drop Came Late In The Year The broader market did not keep its earlier momentum. Total crypto value fell almost 8% in 2025 and finished the year near $3 trillion. Most of the damage came late. 2025 Annual Crypto Industry Report is now LIVE 📊 Last year marked crypto’s first down year since 2022, featuring a brief $4.4T peak in Q4 before a historic $19B liquidation ended the year at $3.0T. Here are 7 key highlights you shouldn’t miss 👇 pic.twitter.com/HLbI5BrzwN — CoinGecko (@coingecko) January 15, 2026 The market shed almost a quarter of its value in the last three months, and a liquidation wave near $19 billion in October sped the decline after total market value briefly hit about $4.4 trillion. Bitcoin slipped roughly 1.4% to near $95,300 at one point as investors weighed policy moves in the US and shifting rate expectations. Supply Now Held By Treasuries By the start of 2026, treasuries were holding more than 1 million Bitcoin and 6 million ETH. That concentration matters because assets put on corporate books are less likely to be traded frequently. When large shares of supply are locked up, price swings can be smaller in calm times, but the effect can flip if selling is forced.

The move was traditional: protect investors’ equity value rather than add more tokens into a weakening market.

This bullish prediction comes after the cryptocurrency has seen years of strong performance, climbing past $126,000 and setting a new all-time high in 2025. With ETFs driving demand, whales accumulating , and global adoption steadily rising, a surge to $200,000 seems inevitable for the crypto founder. Binance Founder Predicts Bitcoin Price Could Hit $200,000 Bitcoin spent the past few years in a major uptrend, reaching multiple ATHs after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Following this, adoption and demand for the cryptocurrency skyrocketed , and for months, its price continued to appreciate with minimal pullbacks. In 2025, Bitcoin hit a peak above $126,000 . While many anticipated this achievement, some raised doubts , especially critics like Peter Schiff. Against this backdrop, the recent statement by CZ foresees another significant milestone for BTC that some analysts still believe won’t happen , at least not for another couple of years. Although Bitcoin has since shed a significant portion of its gains since its peak, the Binance founder has boldly stated that BTC reaching $200,000 is “the most obvious thing in the world.” He emphasized that it was only a matter of time before the Bitcoin price rises to this level, representing almost double its current ATH. While CZ acknowledged that the exact timing of the projected rally remains uncertain, his confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains unwavering. Notably, CZ’s bullish prediction for Bitcoin comes as the US regulatory landscape continues to evolve, aiming to create a safer, potentially bullish environment for digital assets. With bills like the CLARITY Act under consideration , the crypto market could benefit from clearer guidelines, increased institutional adoption, and greater investor confidence. Although the bill was initially scheduled for a vote by the US Senate Banking Committee on January 15, the decision was ultimately delayed , leaving the timeline for regulatory clarity uncertain. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market In addition to his bullish Bitcoin forecast, CZ has also predicted that a crypto “ Super Cycle ” could be approaching. The Binance founder pointed to recent developments involving the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a key factor behind his optimism. He highlighted a report on X, revealing that the SEC had officially removed crypto from its 2026 priority risk list, a move that could provide the industry with greater regulatory relief and create more room for future bullish growth. Analyst Forecasts $200,000 BTC In 2026 Sharing a similar outlook to CZ, a popular crypto analyst, Rekt Fencer, who has over 336,000 followers on X, has also predicted that Bitcoin could surge to $200,000. Despite the broader crypto market still recovering from a prolonged bear market, the analyst remains confident in BTC’s near-term prospects, noting that the cryptocurrency could replicate its explosive growth seen during the 2020 bull cycle . Unlike CZ, who has not provided a specific timeline for his $200,000 forecast, Rekt Fencer believes that BTC could hit this level before the end of 2026.

The tech giant adopted this decision at a time when individuals showed heightened interest in faster internet, driven by surging demand for AI technology and other data-intensive applications. Google seeks to stay competitive in the tech ecosystem This new firm is set to feature Google Fiber’s fiber-optic Internet service, GFiber, as well as Radiate’s business, also known as Astound. Stonepeak is believed to own the largest share of this company. At the same time, Google is expected to retain a smaller stake, said sources familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous, as the talks were private. To verify this claim, these sources cited an earlier statement from Stonepeak noting its plan to allocate approximately $1 billion in preferred equity. This situation prompted reports to reach out to Stonepeak, Google, and Radiate for clarification; however, they did not respond. Notably, talks are still ongoing; therefore, the deal is more likely to undergo amendments. On the other hand, reports from reliable sources reveal that the American technology company has been evaluating options to separate its fiber business. According to a 2024 report, sources familiar with the situation alleged that Alphabet is open to investments from GFiber’s outside investors to back its global adoption. Meanwhile, apart from this fiber project, Google claimed to have made significant investments totaling tens of billions of dollars in AI to strengthen its global position in AI data centers. Towards the end of last year, the tech giant invested about $15 billion in India and $9 billion in South Carolina. This move backs the tech firm’s long-standing goal of becoming a leader in the tech industry. To further illustrate its commitment to achieving this goal, the CEO of Google Cloud, Thomas Kurian, released a statement disclosing that Google intends to allocate around $15 billion over the coming half-decade to build a new AI-driven data center in southern India. With this initiative in place, the tech company seeks to establish a global network of its AI data centers. During an event in New Delhi, Kurian commented that, “This will be the largest AI hub we’re building outside of the United States,” adding that, “it is part of a worldwide network of AI centers across 12 different countries.” Google seeks to explore the tech industry with significant AI innovations Following Google’s focus on AI expansion, sources highlighted that the new AI data center hub, anticipated to begin operations in July 2028, will feature improved AI infrastructure, enhanced fiber-optic networks, and significant energy reserves across three regional sites. Moreover, the company noted that the facility will be geographically located in Visakhapatnam, a major port city and industrial hub in Andhra Pradesh, India. It is set to start with an initial capacity of 1 gigawatt and later increase to several gigawatts. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, weighed in on this development, calling the India-based AI hub a “landmark development that will introduce Google’s AI innovations to the country’s vast population”.

One of the most recent moves making waves in the space is the investment to support LMAX and strengthen market infrastructure. LMAX Gains Major Boost With Ripple Investment A recent report discloses that Ripple has taken yet another significant step in its institutional expansion by investing to support LMAX’s worldwide business strategy. With the aim of reinforcing its commitment to building a robust, enterprise-grade market infrastructure, the firm has invested over $150 million to support this strategy. Ripple’s move underscores its focus on strengthening the railroads that link digital assets with traditional finance, expanding access to regulated trading platforms, and deepening liquidity. Such a move marks the persistent efforts of the company in transforming global trading models. According to market expert and trader Pumpius on X, this is a far bigger move than a simple strategic investment from the payment firm. Instead, it is a strategic integration move aimed at hardwiring the adjacency of XRP to institutional price discovery and execution infrastructure. The expert highlighted that LMAX operates high-performance, low-latency venues for FX, metals, and digital assets, which are being used by banks, funds, and professional liquidity providers. This creates a period where size is traded under stringent regulatory standards , and risk is controlled. By supporting LMAX’s global expansion, Pumpius stated that Ripple is making sure XRP is positioned within venues that institutions already trust for hedging funds, market making, and balance sheet management. This seems to be a better move in comparison to relying on fragmented retail liquidity. Interestingly, this bolsters Ripple’s end-to-end stack across settlement, liquidity provisioning, custody, and execution. While it may seem complex, this is vital since tokenized deposits, compliant stablecoins , and on-chain settlement are shifting into production. However, Pumpius added that the outcome is deeper liquidity, tighter spreads, and routine XRP usage within regulated market infrastructure, long before the wider market notices the underlying shift. XRP Charting Path To New All-Time High? XRP is regaining bullish traction as market structure points to a historical trend that preceded a massive wave up to previous highs. From a weekly timeframe chart shared by ChartNerd, XRP is forming a pivotal Golden Cross pattern, which could shape its next trajectory. It is worth noting that the last time this pattern appeared on the weekly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the altcoin rallied to new all-time highs. With the same structure unfolding, a similar price trend is expected to occur. Currently, the MACD is in oversold territory, and the Golden Cross formation is expected to form in the upcoming weeks. Given that the market structure is protecting a 400-day defense zone, expansion seems likely.",XRP|ChartNerd|FX|Golden Cross Formation|LMAX|MACD|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|ripple|Stablecoins|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 02:00:07

Although the meme coin has since slipped back into negative territory, a crypto analyst believes another bullish reversal may be approaching soon. According to the analyst, a key technical pattern has recently emerged on the chart, suggesting that PEPE has formed a bottom and could be on its way to a massive 3,000% price rally. PEPE Price Prepares For Massive 3,000% Rally In a post shared on X this Thursday, market analyst CryptoLinx outlined a bullish outlook for PEPE, pointing to a key shift on the weekly chart that he believes could trigger a 3,000% rally in the meme coin’s price. He stated that PEPE has just printed a bullish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) cross on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $57,000: The Bullish Path That Could End In Tears The analyst’s chart shows the weekly MACD lines crossing upward with momentum shifting from red to green. This move comes after an extended downtrend and coincides with price stabilizing and starting to curl higher, a pattern often associated with a rounded bottom. In his post, CryptoLinx emphasized that most traders and investors do not fully understand just how powerful the weekly MACD can be when it crosses at a true market bottom. Such moments often mark the market’s transition from an accumulation phase to a sustained uptrend. In previous cycles, similar setups have led to substantial price appreciation in PEPE. Moves of 200% to 300% were recorded in the PEPE price as momentum shifted in favor of buyers. CryptoLinx has suggested that if PEPE has indeed found its true bottom, its potential price rally could be significantly more explosive than past cycles. Based on the analyst’s predictions, the bullish MACD cross would not fuel a simple price recovery for PEPE, but an explosive surge that could completely flip its ongoing downtrend and mark a new ATH. The analysis points to a potential upside of 1,500% to 3,000% for PEPE this year. Such a rally could see the meme coin jump from its current levels around $0.00000585 to $0.0000928 and $0.000179, respectively. An Update On PEPE Price Action In 2025, the Pepe price spent several months in a sustained downtrend, closing the year in the red and extending its losses into the first few days of 2026. However, as meme coins saw a sudden market revival at the beginning of the year, PEPE jumped by more than 30%, briefly rallying before shedding some of its gains. Related Reading: Next XRP Wave Shows Where Price Is Headed Next, But There’s A Catch According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the PEPE price remains down over 68% Year-to-Date (YTD). Despite this broader decline, the meme coin has shown signs of recovery, climbing more than 44% over the past month. At the time of writing, PEPE is down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours and about 4.5% in the past week.

According to a detailed report from DL News, the potential for a so-called ‘Erdoğanization’ of the Fed under a Trump administration presents a structural shift with profound implications for the U.S. dollar and alternative assets like Bitcoin. This analysis draws direct parallels to recent international monetary crises, providing a sobering framework for understanding potential 2025 market dynamics. Federal Reserve Independence Faces a Critical Test The concept of central bank independence remains a cornerstone of modern economic stability. For decades, the Federal Reserve has operated with a mandate to control inflation and maximize employment, theoretically free from direct political interference. However, recent political discourse has placed this long-held principle under intense scrutiny. Analysts now actively debate the resilience of this institutional firewall. André Dragosch, Head of Research for Europe at the asset manager Bitwise, coined the term ‘Erdoğanization’ to describe this risk. He directly references the economic trajectory of Turkey, where government intervention eroded central bank autonomy. Consequently, this led to severe currency devaluation and hyperinflation. Dragosch’s analysis posits a clear causal chain for the United States. Political pressure to artificially lower interest rates could compromise the Fed’s ability to combat inflation effectively. This situation, in turn, would likely devalue the U.S. dollar over the medium to long term. Financial markets historically react negatively to uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. Therefore, investors systematically seek assets perceived as hedges against currency weakness and institutional fragility. Historical Precedent: The Turkish Lira and Bitcoin Demand Understanding the potential ‘Erdoğanization’ thesis requires examining the recent Turkish economic experiment. Beginning around 2018, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly pressured the Turkish Central Bank (TCMB) to slash interest rates despite soaring inflation. He famously described high interest rates as the ‘mother and father of all evil.’ The TCMB eventually capitulated, sacrificing its operational independence. The results were severe and predictable. Currency Collapse: The Turkish lira (TRY) lost over 80% of its value against the U.S. dollar between 2018 and 2023. Hyperinflation: Official inflation rates soared above 85%, devastating savings and purchasing power. Capital Flight: Both domestic and international investors fled lira-denominated assets. In this environment, Turkish citizens and investors turned to alternative stores of value. Gold demand surged, but notably, Bitcoin adoption accelerated dramatically. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volumes in Turkey consistently ranked among the highest globally. Citizens used the cryptocurrency not for speculation, but primarily for wealth preservation. This real-world case study provides a tangible model. It demonstrates how a loss of faith in centralized monetary authority can directly increase demand for decentralized, non-sovereign assets like Bitcoin. André Dragosch’s Structural Analysis for 2025 Dragosch applies this framework to the potential U.S. situation with analytical precision. He avoids speculative price predictions, focusing instead on structural relationships. ‘A weakening of Fed independence structurally implies higher inflation and a weaker dollar,’ Dragosch stated in the DL News report. He views this macroeconomic outcome as fundamentally positive for Bitcoin’s value proposition. His reasoning hinges on Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature. Unlike fiat currencies, no political actor can increase Bitcoin’s supply or mandate its monetary policy. This makes it a pure hedge against currency debasement. The analysis further suggests that the mere perception of compromised Fed independence could trigger market movements. If a Fed Chair were replaced explicitly for not acquiescing to political demands, or if public statements clearly undermined the institution’s autonomy, investor confidence could erode rapidly. In such a climate, Bitcoin could emerge not merely as a speculative tech asset, but as a prominent, legitimate alternative within diversified portfolios. This re-categorization would represent a significant evolution in Bitcoin’s market role. The Mechanics of Dollar Weakness and Crypto Correlations A structurally weaker U.S. dollar creates multiple pathways for Bitcoin appreciation. Firstly, since Bitcoin is globally priced in dollars, a falling dollar makes each bitcoin cheaper for holders of other, stronger currencies. This can increase international buying pressure. Secondly, and more importantly, investors globally hold U.S. dollar-denominated assets as a primary reserve. Perceived dollar weakness prompts a search for non-correlated or inversely correlated assets. Potential Impact Channels of Fed Politicization Channel Mechanism Potential Bitcoin Impact Inflation Expectations Political pressure prevents rate hikes, leading to sustained high inflation. Increased demand for Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Currency Devaluation Weaker dollar reduces purchasing power of dollar reserves. Bitcoin gains appeal as a global, neutral reserve asset. Loss of Institutional Credibility Markets lose trust in the primary anchor of the global financial system. Capital flows toward decentralized systems outside traditional finance. Geopolitical Realignment Other nations reduce dollar reliance, exploring alternative settlement layers. Bitcoin’s network could benefit as a cross-border settlement option. Furthermore, the U.S. Treasury and bond markets deeply interconnect with Fed policy. Any doubt about the Fed’s commitment to price stability could increase yields on long-term Treasuries, reflecting higher inflation risk premiums. This volatility in traditional safe-haven assets could push some institutional capital toward digital assets with different risk-return profiles. It is crucial to note that this relationship is not guaranteed to be immediate or linear. Short-term market reactions can be chaotic. However, the structural argument posits a strengthening long-term correlation between perceptions of fiat currency fragility and Bitcoin’s valuation. Broader Context: The Global Search for Monetary Alternatives The discussion about Fed independence and Bitcoin does not occur in a vacuum. It aligns with a broader, global trend of exploring monetary alternatives. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are in development worldwide, often raising concerns about financial privacy and state control. Simultaneously, several nations continue to diversify their foreign exchange reserves away from the U.S. dollar. Gold purchases by central banks have reached multi-decade highs. This macro backdrop is essential for a complete analysis. Bitcoin exists within this ecosystem as a unique, apolitical, and software-based competitor. Its potential rise in a scenario of Fed politicization would be part of a larger narrative of de-dollarization and financial fragmentation. Other cryptocurrencies might also benefit, but Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, robust security, and clear narrative as ‘digital gold’ position it uniquely to capture this specific type of hedge demand. The 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced new supply issuance, further tightens its economic model just as these macroeconomic questions intensify. Conclusion The analysis highlighting the risk to Federal Reserve independence presents a significant, experience-driven hypothesis for 2025 financial markets. Drawing from the tangible precedent of Turkey, experts like André Dragosch outline a scenario where political pressure leads to dollar weakness, thereby boosting Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative, non-sovereign asset. While the future path of U.S. monetary policy remains uncertain, the structural relationship between institutional credibility, currency strength, and demand for decentralized assets is becoming increasingly clear. Investors and policymakers alike must now consider how the delicate balance of Federal Reserve independence could fundamentally alter the landscape for traditional and digital assets in the coming year. FAQs Q1: What does ‘Erdoğanization of the Fed’ mean? It is an analytical term comparing potential political pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to the documented erosion of central bank independence in Turkey under President Erdoğan, which led to high inflation and currency collapse. Q2: How could a weaker U.S. dollar specifically benefit Bitcoin? A weaker dollar makes Bitcoin cheaper for international buyers using stronger currencies and increases demand for assets perceived as hedges against currency devaluation and inflation, a role Bitcoin is increasingly adopted for. Q3: Is central bank independence legally protected in the United States? While the Federal Reserve was designed to be independent within the government, its board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, creating a potential channel for political influence over time. Q4: Did Bitcoin actually help people in Turkey during the lira crisis? Yes, data shows Turkish Bitcoin trading volumes surged as citizens used it to preserve savings, make international transactions, and hedge against the lira’s rapid devaluation and capital controls. Q5: Are other assets besides Bitcoin considered hedges in this scenario? Yes, traditional hedges include gold, commodities, and real estate. However, Bitcoin offers a digital, borderless, and fixed-supply alternative that appeals particularly to a younger, tech-oriented demographic and for cross-border capital preservation.

USDC, CRCL’s flagship stablecoin, posted 66% YoY revenue growth to $740 million and 57% adjusted EBITDA margin, underscoring strong profitability. Management guides for 40% CAGR in USDC circulation, but acknowledges growth headwinds from lower interest rates and competitive pressures. While not 'dirt cheap,' CRCL’s GARP profile and secular stablecoin adoption thesis support expectations for double-digit returns over the long term. Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) has not escaped the volatility that hit high-growth stocks late last year. That volatility has coincided with lower interest rates and potentially slower USDC growth, which might have contributed to the downward pressure. Yet I still see a clear case for increasing stablecoin adoption long term, with USDC looking positioned to benefit courtesy of its various partnerships. Despite the dampened growth outlook, I reiterate my buy rating as the valuation is looking as reasonable as ever. CRCL Stock Price I last covered CRCL in September , where I initiated coverage as a high-risk, high reward play. The stock has plunged - without hyperbole - since. Data by YCharts The air has left the balloon. In the above report, I had written that “I find the stock buyable at these levels but expect significant volatility as investors may be uneasy about the high valuations given potentially low conviction in the consistency of forward growth rates.” The 40% slide has thoroughly addressed any such reservations. CRCL Stock Key Metrics CRCL is the owner of the stablecoin network ( USDC-USD ). USDC is the second largest stablecoin in the world, behind Tether ( USDT-USD ). Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that do not fluctuate in value due to being backed by reserves of cash and short-term US Treasury bills (or at least this is the case for USDC). Stablecoins are a new frontier, and CRCL is racing to grow its network. 2025 Q3 Presentation CRCL has been working with financial industry leaders to increase adoption and discover new use cases. 2025 Q3 Presentation In my eyes, the overarching thesis behind USDC and stablecoins in general is the lightning fast and secure transaction speeds that they allow for. The potential opportunity may then be viewed as corporations around the world replacing their “checking account cash” (working capital) with USDC. This is cash that corporations otherwise are not expecting to earn significant interest from in the first place. USDC has grown rapidly, helping to offset headwinds from declining short term US Treasury rates. 2025 Q3 Presentation This culminated in revenues growing 66% YoY to $740 million. 2025 Q3 Presentation The company was also significantly profitable, with adjusted EBITDA jumping 57% YoY to $166 million, representing a 57% margin. 2025 Q3 Presentation I note that the company is solidly profitable on a GAAP basis as well, with GAAP operating income coming in at 27.8% of gross profits even after subtracting out “other income.” 2025 Q3 Presentation Management continues to guide for around 40% CAGR in USDC circulation over the medium term. 2025 Q3 Presentation On the conference call , management noted their conviction in taking market share, noting that overall “stablecoin transaction volumes have grown approximately 130% year-over-year with USDC share expanding to 40% in Q3.” Management did note that they are “not focused on monetizing the network” but instead “want the network to grow so that it's creating value for all participants.” Management noted that “over time” there may be “many opportunities for very small fees,” as this is a “winner-take-most market structure.” I may be reading too much into the tea leaves, but I suspect that management may be trying to prepare investors for the potential for profit margins to decline in the near term. Is CRCL Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold? CRCL stock has struggled as of late. I see two primary reasons. First, interest rates continue to move lower as the market makes progress on inflation. Second, the company has seen some struggles to USDC growth in recent months . At recent prices, CRCL traded at just around 5.5x forward revenues. Seeking Alpha At this point, the optimism has let itself out. There are valid concerns with the bullish thesis. Revenues will face pressure if interest rates keep going lower, and that appears to be the current trend. It is possible, if not likely, that management’s guidance for 40% USDC circulation growth proves optimistic, as it is not immediately clear how they came to that target. It is, however, important to remember that USDC is still just around $75 billion. This is lower in comparison to the $700 billion in “trapped working capital” estimated by JP Morgan in 2024 . Of course, one must note that USDT already stands at nearly $200 billion, so a lot of the growth runway indeed has been played out. But that is to be expected at this stage in the bull market. I won’t make the claim that the stock is “dirt cheap.” I continue to assume that the company can achieve at least 15% net margins (implying around 50% margins based on gross profits). That places the valuation at around 37x long term earnings. The company might need to sustain around 15% to 20% growth to justify that valuation, which looks achievable long term, as at this point I view the move from checking account cash to stablecoin as being similar to e-commerce or video streaming. I was clearly early in my previous buy rating, and my growth outlook has dampened since, as I did not expect USDC growth to slow down on a sequential basis so quickly. Even so, the lower stock price has adequately priced-in the slight deterioration in fundamentals, and thus the stock looks like it’s priced for double-digit returns from here. I can see the company delivering around 20% growth at the very least over multi-year periods, as it benefits from its partnership with leading cryptocurrency firm Coinbase ( COIN ). Even after the fall, I do not see an immediate case for multiple expansion, which heightens the potential volatility, but this looks like a “GARP” kind of stock from here. CRCL Stock Risks If short term interest rates continue to decline, then CRCL may eventually see revenue growth compress. I would focus more on the growth of the USDC network, but it is also possible that USDC growth proves volatile or falls far short of management’s guidance. It is possible that USDT or others will win the market. It is possible that governments outlaw the use of stablecoins, preventing further growth. CRCL Stock Conclusion I must reiterate that CRCL is not that cheap here. It’s significantly less expensive than it was just a handful of months ago, but the company may see some volatility as it laps tough comparables and grapples with declining interest rates. That said, I like the GAAP profitability and long-term secular thesis, as stablecoins do appear to offer significant advantages over the slower and more expensive traditional financial system. I do not see “100-bagger” kind of upside potential here, as the real addressable market might be focused on checking account cash instead of all cash, but the valuation looks right given the strong momentum the company is seeing in rising USDC circulation.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-17 02:30:00

57230662,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=896613,1768618009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57230662.jpeg,"JustLend DAO Completes Second JST Buyback and Burn, Removing Nearly 11% of Total Supply",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/justlend-dao-completes-second-jst-buyback-and-burn-removing-nearly-11-of-total-supply/,"Singapore January 16, 2026 — JustLend DAO , TRON’s premier decentralized lending platform, announced the completion of a second buyback and burn of its JST token, permanently removing 525 million tokens, representing an estimated $21 million USD in value, from circulation. The burn represents approximately 5.3% of the total supply, and brings the cumulative reduction to roughly 1.08 billion JST, or 10.96% of total supply, achieved in less than three months. The successful buyback and burn reflect JustLend DAO’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a deflationary token supply. The latest burn was supported by continued growth in activity across the JustLend DAO ecosystem. Total value locked surpassed $7.08 billion, consistently placing the protocol among the three largest decentralized lending markets. Activity in the SBM market reached a new cycle high, and the reserves used for the buyback came from SBM USDT balances created during the first burn, supporting a self-sustaining model for ongoing supply reduction. JustLend DAO continues to expand and diversify its product suite: sTRX Staking : Supports on-chain participation while preserving liquidity for broader DeFi use cases, with more than 9.3 billion TRX staked to date. Energy Rental : Reduced base fees from 15% to 8% in September 2025, contributing to increased on-chain usage. GasFree Smart Wallet : Enables users to pay transaction fees directly from transferred assets such as USDT, supported by a gas subsidy that has lowered costs to approximately 1 USDT per transfer. The wallet has processed $46 billion in transaction volume, delivering meaningful fee savings for users. Additional buyback capacity has been supported by growth within the USDD multi-chain ecosystem. USDD has expanded across major networks including Ethereum and BNB Chain, with total value locked exceeding $1 billion as of January 14, more than doubling in less than two months. The expansion strengthens the linkage between stablecoin adoption, protocol activity, and ongoing JST supply reduction, reinforcing a closed-loop model that supports ecosystem participation and liquidity over time. The reduction in JST supply has transformed the token’s structure by more closely linking its value to protocol activity while increasing overall scarcity. With fewer tokens outstanding, each remaining JST carries greater governance weight, expanding holder influence over protocol parameters, treasury decisions, and future product development. Market data reflected heightened activity following the burns, with CoinMarketCap showing JST’s market capitalization surpassed $400 million for the first time on January 8. On the same day, 24-hour trading volume rose 21.92% to $31.49 million, while the token’s price increased 10.82% over the past month and 3.1% in a single day. The continuation of quarterly buyback-and-burn cycles sets a clear and measurable path for reducing JST supply over time. As the ecosystem continues to grow, the supply of JST is expected to decline in a predictable way, increasing scarcity. The latest burn marks an early stage of this process, with future reductions expected to build over time alongside ongoing product development and broader ecosystem participation.

His comments highlight the complex regulatory landscape confronting digital assets as financial institutions increasingly engage with tokenization and blockchain technologies. This development comes amid growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency markets and increasing pressure for regulatory clarity from traditional finance sectors. Goldman Sachs CEO Details Crypto Bill Challenges David Solomon specifically addressed the Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act, commonly known as the CLARITY Act. He emphasized that Goldman Sachs monitors this legislation carefully due to its potential impact on financial innovation. The bill aims to establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including clear definitions and jurisdictional boundaries. Solomon noted that recent developments suggest considerable time will pass before meaningful progress occurs. His assessment reflects broader institutional concerns about regulatory uncertainty in cryptocurrency markets. Financial analysts immediately recognized the significance of Solomon’s comments. They indicate that major financial institutions remain cautious about expanding cryptocurrency services without clearer regulatory guidelines. The delayed legislation affects planning for tokenized asset platforms and digital custody solutions. Market observers note that regulatory uncertainty may temporarily advantage jurisdictions with more established digital asset frameworks. Consequently, U.S. financial innovation could face competitive pressures from global markets. Legislative Timeline and Recent Setbacks The CLARITY Act experienced a significant setback when the Senate Banking Committee postponed its planned markup session. This delay followed Coinbase’s withdrawal of support for the current draft legislation. The cryptocurrency exchange cited concerns about specific provisions that might hinder innovation. Committee members subsequently requested additional time for revisions and stakeholder consultations. Legislative analysts now predict the bill may not reach committee vote until late 2025 at the earliest. Several factors contribute to the legislative complexity. First, lawmakers must balance consumer protection with innovation facilitation. Second, jurisdictional questions between regulatory agencies require careful resolution. Third, technological developments continuously outpace legislative processes. The table below illustrates key stakeholders and their positions: Stakeholder Position on CLARITY Act Primary Concerns Traditional Banks Generally Supportive Clear regulatory boundaries, compliance frameworks Crypto Exchanges Mixed Support Innovation restrictions, operational requirements Consumer Groups Cautiously Optimistic Investor protection, transparency mandates Regulatory Agencies Seeking Clarification Jurisdictional authority, enforcement mechanisms Historical context reveals that comprehensive financial legislation typically requires multiple congressional sessions. The Dodd-Frank Act, for instance, underwent extensive revisions over several years. Similarly, cryptocurrency regulation involves novel technological considerations that complicate traditional legislative approaches. Committee staff members continue working on technical amendments while maintaining dialogue with industry representatives. Institutional Impact on Tokenization and Stablecoins Solomon specifically highlighted the legislation’s potential effects on tokenization and stablecoin markets. Tokenization refers to representing real-world assets as digital tokens on blockchain networks. Financial institutions increasingly explore this technology for various applications: Asset Fractionalization: Dividing high-value assets into smaller investment units Settlement Efficiency: Accelerating transaction settlement through smart contracts Regulatory Compliance: Embedding compliance requirements directly into token protocols Market Accessibility: Expanding investment opportunities to broader participant groups Stablecoin regulation represents another critical component. These digital assets maintain stable values by pegging to traditional currencies or other reserves. The CLARITY Act proposes specific frameworks for stablecoin issuance and operation. Regulatory clarity would enable traditional financial institutions to engage more confidently with stablecoin technologies. Currently, uncertainty limits institutional participation despite growing market demand for dollar-pegged digital assets. Goldman Sachs has publicly explored tokenization initiatives through various pilot programs. The firm recognizes blockchain technology’s potential to transform traditional financial services. However, regulatory ambiguity creates implementation challenges. Solomon’s comments reflect this practical reality for institutional adoption. Other major banks echo similar concerns about navigating uncertain regulatory environments while pursuing technological innovation. Comparative Global Regulatory Approaches While U.S. legislation faces delays, other jurisdictions advance their cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. The European Union implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in 2024. This comprehensive framework establishes clear rules for cryptocurrency service providers and token issuers. Asian financial centers including Singapore and Hong Kong also developed progressive regulatory regimes. These jurisdictions aim to attract cryptocurrency businesses through regulatory certainty. The United Kingdom recently announced its own cryptocurrency regulatory package. British authorities emphasize innovation-friendly approaches while maintaining robust consumer protections. This global regulatory patchwork creates complex compliance requirements for international financial institutions. Many firms establish operations in multiple jurisdictions to navigate varying regulatory environments. The delayed U.S. legislation may temporarily disadvantage American financial innovation relative to global competitors. International regulatory cooperation continues through organizations like the Financial Stability Board and International Organization of Securities Commissions. These bodies develop global standards for cryptocurrency regulation. However, national implementation varies significantly across jurisdictions. The delayed CLARITY Act complicates U.S. participation in these international coordination efforts. Regulatory divergence could eventually create market fragmentation and compliance challenges for global financial institutions. Expert Analysis and Market Implications Financial regulation experts analyze the delayed legislation’s potential consequences. Dr. Eleanor Vance, former SEC senior counsel and current Georgetown University professor, explains the situation. “Comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation involves unprecedented technical complexity,” she notes. “Lawmakers must understand blockchain fundamentals while addressing legitimate regulatory concerns. This educational process naturally extends legislative timelines.” Market participants already adjust strategies based on regulatory expectations. Institutional cryptocurrency adoption continues through existing regulatory frameworks. However, ambitious projects requiring novel regulatory approvals face implementation delays. Venture capital investment in cryptocurrency infrastructure remains strong despite legislative uncertainty. Investors recognize that regulatory clarity will eventually emerge, creating substantial opportunities for compliant solutions. The delayed legislation affects various market segments differently. Established cryptocurrency exchanges continue operating under existing regulatory interpretations. New financial products involving tokenization await clearer guidelines before full-scale launch. Traditional financial institutions proceed cautiously with blockchain initiatives while monitoring legislative developments. This cautious approach may temporarily slow innovation but potentially reduces regulatory risk exposure. Conclusion Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon’s assessment highlights significant challenges facing U.S. cryptocurrency legislation. The CLARITY Act requires additional time for legislative refinement and stakeholder consensus. This delayed timeline affects institutional planning for tokenization and stablecoin initiatives. While regulatory uncertainty persists, financial institutions continue exploring blockchain applications within existing frameworks. The eventual establishment of comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation will likely accelerate institutional adoption and innovation. Market participants should monitor legislative developments while maintaining flexible implementation strategies for digital asset initiatives. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act represents proposed U.S. legislation establishing comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets. It addresses market structure, consumer protection, and jurisdictional questions for cryptocurrency markets. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the current draft? Coinbase expressed concerns that specific provisions might unnecessarily restrict innovation. The exchange continues advocating for balanced regulation that protects consumers while enabling technological advancement in cryptocurrency markets. Q3: How does delayed legislation affect tokenization? Regulatory uncertainty creates implementation challenges for tokenization projects. Financial institutions hesitate to launch comprehensive tokenization platforms without clearer regulatory guidelines, potentially slowing innovation in this emerging sector. Q4: What are stablecoins and why do they need regulation? Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain stable values, typically pegged to traditional currencies. Regulation establishes standards for reserve management, issuance transparency, and operational reliability to protect users and maintain financial stability. Q5: How does U.S. cryptocurrency regulation compare globally? The United States currently lags behind jurisdictions like the European Union in establishing comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. This regulatory divergence creates compliance complexities for international financial institutions operating across multiple jurisdictions.

This strategic move, first reported by Cointelegraph in May 2025, positions the regulated crypto bank for a significant expansion phase, directly coinciding with a transformative period of regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. The funding round underscores growing investor confidence in compliant crypto infrastructure ahead of a speculated 2026 IPO timeline. Anchorage Digital Funding Strategy and IPO Pathway Anchorage Digital’s pursuit of new capital represents a calculated step in its corporate evolution. The company, which secured a coveted national trust charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in 2021, is now building its war chest. This capital infusion will primarily fuel two parallel objectives: scaling its core institutional services and aggressively expanding into the burgeoning stablecoin sector. Consequently, the firm plans to double the size of its dedicated stablecoin team within the year, a direct response to recent legislative developments. Industry analysts view this pre-IPO round as a bid to solidify market position and achieve a stronger valuation before entering the public markets, a common strategy for late-stage fintech startups. The reported valuation for this round remains undisclosed, but previous funding provides context. Anchorage Digital last raised $350 million in a Series D round in late 2021, achieving a valuation exceeding $3 billion. The current effort suggests the company aims to build upon that foundation significantly. Furthermore, the 2026 IPO window aligns with broader market expectations for a maturation cycle in crypto-focused public listings, following the earlier waves of exchange-based offerings. The Catalytic Impact of U.S. Stablecoin Legislation The timing of Anchorage Digital’s expansion is not coincidental; it is deeply intertwined with regulatory progress. The passage of the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act in early 2025 provided the first comprehensive federal framework for issuers and custodians. This legislation effectively removed a primary source of operational uncertainty for regulated entities like Anchorage Digital. The law establishes clear requirements for reserve composition, redemption policies, and oversight, creating a legitimate playing field for compliant operators. For Anchorage Digital, this regulatory green light transforms its stablecoin ambitions from a speculative venture into a core business line with predictable rules. The company’s existing infrastructure for institutional custody and trading seamlessly integrates with stablecoin services, offering clients a unified platform. This legislative catalyst is prompting a sector-wide shift, as evidenced by the following comparative moves by competitors: Coinbase Custody: Enhanced its stablecoin management tools and regulatory reporting features. Fidelity Digital Assets: Announced research into offering stablecoin yield products for institutional clients. Traditional Banks (e.g., BNY Mellon): Accelerated pilot programs for digital asset custody, including stablecoins. This competitive landscape underscores why Anchorage Digital is moving decisively to capture market share early in the new regulatory era. Expert Analysis on Institutional Crypto Adoption Financial technology experts point to this funding round as a bellwether for the broader institutional adoption of digital assets. “Anchorage Digital’s move is a clear signal that sophisticated capital sees long-term value in regulated crypto banking rails,” notes Dr. Elena Vargas, a fintech professor at Stanford University. “The focus on stablecoins is particularly telling. It indicates that the near-term growth vector is in tokenized real-world assets and payment systems, not just speculative crypto trading.” This perspective is supported by data from PwC’s 2024 Global Crypto Report, which projected that institutional investment in crypto infrastructure would grow by over 150% between 2023 and 2026, with custody and compliance services being the largest segment. The potential IPO also carries symbolic weight for the industry. A successful public listing for a chartered crypto bank would demonstrate to traditional finance that compliant digital asset business models can achieve mainstream capital market success. It would provide a tangible benchmark for profitability and governance, aspects that have historically concerned institutional investors. Core Business Lines: Custody, Trading, and Staking To understand the significance of the funding, one must examine Anchorage Digital’s established business model. The company operates as a full-service platform for institutions like hedge funds, venture capital firms, and corporations. Its three pillars are: Digital Asset Custody: Provides secure, insured storage for cryptocurrencies using a combination of hardware security modules and multi-party computation (MPC) technology. This eliminates single points of failure for private keys. Institutional Trading: Offers a liquid marketplace for large-volume trades, connecting clients with a network of counterparties while ensuring settlement finality. Staking Services: Allows institutions to earn yield on their proof-of-stake assets (like Ethereum) through a non-custodial, slashing-insured service, which maintains compliance. The new capital will likely be deployed to enhance these core offerings through technological upgrades, geographic expansion, and increased sales and compliance personnel. The goal is to create an unrivaled, holistic platform that serves as the primary gateway for any traditional institution entering the digital asset space. Conclusion Anchorage Digital’s reported pursuit of a $200 million to $400 million funding round is a pivotal event at the intersection of finance, technology, and regulation. It highlights a strategic push to dominate the institutional crypto custody and emerging stablecoin market, empowered by new U.S. legislation. This pre-IPO maneuver sets the stage for a potential 2026 public listing that could serve as a landmark moment, validating the maturity and viability of regulated cryptocurrency banking. The success of this Anchorage Digital funding effort will be closely watched as a key indicator of institutional capital’s enduring commitment to the digital asset ecosystem’s infrastructure layer. FAQs Q1: What is Anchorage Digital? Anchorage Digital is a federally chartered digital asset bank and platform that provides custody, trading, staking, and financing services exclusively to institutional clients like asset managers and corporations. Q2: Why is Anchorage Digital raising new funds now? The company is raising capital to expand its business, particularly its stablecoin operations following new U.S. laws, and to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of a potential Initial Public Offering (IPO) targeted for 2026. Q3: How does recent stablecoin legislation affect Anchorage Digital? The 2025 Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act created a federal regulatory framework, giving compliant firms like Anchorage Digital clear rules to operate stablecoin services, which the company is now prioritizing for growth. Q4: What makes Anchorage Digital different from a regular crypto exchange? Unlike consumer exchanges, Anchorage Digital holds a national trust charter, allowing it to operate as a regulated bank. It focuses solely on institutional clients, offering higher security standards, insurance, and services tailored to large-scale investors. Q5: What would an Anchorage Digital IPO mean for the crypto industry? A successful IPO would be a major milestone, demonstrating that regulated crypto-native financial institutions can achieve public market success, potentially attracting more traditional investors and legitimizing the sector further.

57230775,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=876191,1768618817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/57230775.jpeg,"XRP Breakout Possible Before The Weekend, Expert Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-breakout-possible-before-weekend/,"XRP could be approaching an inflection point as a closely watched chart pattern tightens into its apex and broader “risk-on” signals in equities flash green, according to XRPL developer Bird (@Bird_XRPL). In a series of posts on X, Bird, the developer behind XRPL meme coin DROP, pointed to XRP’s hourly structure as setting up for a decisive move “before the end of the week,” arguing that a technical breakout could accelerate quickly toward a nearby upside objective. “Take a look at XRP on the hourly. A move is about to happen before the end of the week,” Bird wrote alongside a chart showing a contracting triangle with price compressing into the tip. “A measured move if we send upwards could push us straight to that $2.69 mark which finally gets us into ‘bull run’ mode.” Russell 2000 Breakout Puts XRP on Alert Beyond the short-term pattern, Bird anchored his thesis to US small caps, arguing that the Russell 2000’s behavior has historically mattered for XRP and the broader altcoin complex. Related Reading: XRP In A ‘Super Cycle’? SuperTrend Suggests Another Story “The Russell 2000 is about to close its highest weekly close in history. That matters ALOT for XRP,” Bird said. “Historically, XRP and altcoins have always tracked the Russell 2000 extremely closely. It’s the true risk on index for mid caps (not mega caps like the S&P or MAG7 where most capital has been parked).” Bird’s argument is that XRP still trades more like a mid-cap risk asset than a mega-cap “store of value” proxy, making the Russell’s breakout a useful macro tell for when speculative capital rotates back into higher beta exposures. He described the current backdrop as “capital rotating” and “risk … back on,” suggesting that the market may be entering a window where positioning can change quickly if narratives align. In a longer follow-up thread, Bird described XRP’s extended consolidation as increasingly out of sync with what he views as constructive macro conditions across risk assets. “We’re at a genuinely clinical moment for XRP. We’ve gone sideways for over a year, yet the Russell 2000 is now in full price discovery, other stock markets have been at all time highs for a long time, metals are elevated, and Bitcoin dominance is chopping at levels that historically dumps at,” he wrote. Related Reading: Ripple Builds XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’: Developer Claims ‘Billions Incoming’ Bird also pointed to a prior episode as a reference point: “In November ’24, the Russell turned green and XRP went parabolic roughly 10 days later,” he said, arguing that this time the Russell has gone further by reclaiming highs and holding strength across timeframes. In his view, the remaining constraint is rotation, not necessarily a sharp drawdown in metals or other assets, but simply a pause that allows risk appetite to re-price. On XRP and Ripple specific context, Bird said “acquisitions done, partnerships rolling out, NDAs lifting, legal clarity forming,” and argued that the market is nearing a point where “a single narrative, catalyst, or push can ignite XRP fast.” The key near-term test is whether the tightening technical structure resolves upward as Bird expects and whether cross-asset risk appetite continues to support alt beta. If both align, Bird’s framework suggests traders will be watching for a momentum break that could carry XRP toward the $2.69 objective and, in his view, potentially open the door to a faster path toward fresh cycle highs. At press time, XRP traded at $2.06.

57232019,658071,1768618822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57232019.jpeg,A New Bitcoin Market Regime: Spot Absorption Offsets Futures Noise,https://bitcoinist.com/new-bitcoin-market-spot-absorption-offsets-futures/,"Bitcoin is facing a critical test as bulls try to push price above a key resistance zone, hoping to confirm that the recent rebound has real traction. After weeks of choppy trading and repeated rejections, the market is again pressing into levels that could decide whether BTC transitions back into recovery mode or slips into another leg of consolidation. While momentum has improved in recent sessions, the broader structure still reflects uncertainty, with investors split between breakout expectations and caution after the latest correction. A report from XWIN Research Japan suggests Bitcoin is not currently in a strong directional trend, but instead remains trapped in a consolidation phase defined by range-bound price action and ongoing structural rebuilding. In this environment, the market is attempting to reset positioning after heavy volatility, while supply and demand continue to balance out near major technical levels. According to the analysis, the bias remains conditionally bullish, meaning upside continuation is still possible if Bitcoin can secure acceptance above resistance and hold it as support. However, the report also warns that short-term overheating risks persist, especially if leverage builds too quickly or price surges without sustained spot demand behind it. With Bitcoin approaching a pivotal inflection point, the next move could be decisive for broader market sentiment. Whales Take Control as Retail Activity Stays Muted The report adds that one of the most important shifts in Bitcoin’s current structure is the change in participant quality. CryptoQuant data suggests retail involvement in both spot and futures markets remains muted, while “Big Whale Orders” continue to appear across spot exchanges and derivatives venues. This points to a market that is being driven less by impulsive speculation and more by larger players gradually positioning through size and patience, shaping liquidity conditions around key price levels. This trend is reinforced by the 90-day Spot Taker CVD, which has flipped back into Taker Buy Dominant territory. In simple terms, aggressive market buying is increasing again, yet price has not accelerated sharply. That combination often implies that sell-side pressure is being absorbed, and available supply is being quietly taken off the table at lower levels. Rather than signaling euphoric demand, the behavior aligns more with structural accumulation and controlled risk-taking. At the same time, futures markets are heating up. Rising volumes and taker buying in derivatives suggest a more speculative layer is returning, raising the risk of short-term volatility if leverage becomes overcrowded. Still, spot flows indicate whales are absorbing supply, meaning futures-driven shakeouts can occur while underlying accumulation continues. The base case remains retail fading as whales take control, unless leverage distorts the structure again. Bitcoin Faces Heavy Moving Average Resistance Bitcoin is holding near $95,500 after a sharp recovery rally that began from the late-November lows. The chart shows BTC rebounding aggressively from the $85,000–$88,000 area, forming a clean sequence of higher lows and higher highs into mid-January. This move suggests that buyers have regained short-term control, but the market is now entering a key resistance zone where rallies have repeatedly stalled since the breakdown in November. The most immediate level to watch is the cluster between $95,000 and $98,000, where price is now pressing into overhead supply. BTC is also approaching the declining medium-term moving averages, which are acting as dynamic resistance and signaling that the broader trend is still recovering, not fully reversed. A clean daily close above this zone would strengthen the case for continuation toward the $100,000 psychological level and potentially a retest of the $105,000 area. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above $94,000–$95,000, the breakout risks turning into another liquidity sweep followed by consolidation. In that scenario, support sits near $92,000, with a deeper pullback targeting the $88,000–$90,000 range where buyers previously stepped in. For now, the trend is improving, but confirmation depends on reclaiming resistance with sustained volume.

He warned that proposed changes to a Senate market structure bill could slow economic growth by stifling innovation, limiting certain cryptocurrencies, and preventing Americans from earning interest on their stablecoins. During an in-depth interview with Fox Business under the host of Maria Bartiromo on Mornings With Maria, Armstrong highlighted that the most recent version of the Senate Banking Committee’s proposed legislation serves the interest of banks, therefore, cautioned that this could result in over-regulation, ending up harming recent bipartisan moves concerning crypto policy. Consequently, the industry executive stated that Coinbase carefully reviewed the Senate Banking Committee draft over the last 48 hours and concluded that it cannot support the bill in its current form. To further explain this decision, the CEO indicated that specific parts of the bill would come close to prohibiting tokenized securities, implement comprehensive regulatory constraints on the DeFi sector, weaken the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and eliminate rewards for stablecoins. Armstrong identifies several risks associated with the recently shared Senate Banking draft Armstrong expressed gratitude for the Senate’s collective efforts, particularly those of Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis. However, the industry executive sparked concern after alleging that the draft shared recently posed serious threats that would be difficult to address upon reaching a final vote on the Senate floor. According to him, the primary issue concerns the rewards associated with stablecoins. Regarding this problem, Armstrong asserted that recently enacted crypto regulations, such as the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act), which Trump signed into law, permitted stablecoin issuers to offer interest. He perceived this as crucial for enabling Americans to acquire returns on their investments. “The banks are really trying to undermine the president’s crypto plans,” Armstrong stated. “They want to protect their profits by taking money from hardworking Americans and putting it into the hands of big banks that are making record profits.” Afterwards, Coinbase’s CEO contrasted stablecoins that the GENIUS Act requires to be fully backed by short-term US Treasuries with traditional fractional-reserve banking, arguing that cryptocurrencies pose minimal risk to the financial system. To further elaborate on this point, he stated that these stablecoins do not rely on fractional reserves; therefore, they should not be regulated similarly to banks. Following his remarks, host Bartiromo asked Armstrong whether crypto platforms should be subject to regulations similar to those of banks. Examples of these regulations include deposit insurance and safeguard measures for investors. Responding to this question, he noted that these regulations primarily aim to manage risks associated with fractional-reserve lending, and that FDIC insurance covers deposits up to $250,000 per depositor. “If customers choose to lend out their funds, they can do so,” he said. “You don’t need a bank license for that. A bank license is necessary when you lend someone else’s money without their permission.” Armstrong expressed disapproval of the proposed change regarding the CFTC and the SEC Some analysts raised concerns that stablecoins pose a serious risk to community banks. Nonetheless, Armstrong called this claim false, describing it as a calculated distraction employed by major financial institutions. Based on his argument, assertions that stablecoins are draining community bank deposits lack substantiated evidence, and he noted that the consolidation driven by major banks poses a far greater risk since the Dodd-Frank era. Moreover, the industry executive condemned the Senate proposal that would make the CFTC subordinate to the SEC. In this approach, digital assets must pass through SEC oversight before potentially falling under CFTC control. “I can’t understand why the Senate Ag Committee would make the CFTC a subsidiary of the SEC,” he said, citing the CLARITY Act , which the House passed.

This signals significant concerns about the bill’s alignment with the interests of cryptocurrency firms compared to traditional banking institutions, not only for the exchange but also for broader market participants. Coinbase CEO’s Concerns Over Fair Competition On Friday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong elaborated on the rationale behind the exchange’s withdrawal in an appearance on FOX Business, expressing his frustration with the notion that banks could use regulatory means to stifle competition in their favor. “It just felt deeply unfair to me that one industry [banks] would come in and get to do regulatory capture to ban their competition,” Armstrong stated. He also underscored the importance of a level playing field, asserting that competition should thrive without undue interference from powerful financial entities. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bill Draft Criticized For Allowing Continued Developer Prosecution Coinbase CEO emphasized that his concerns resonate with “much of the industry,” highlighting his obligation to advocate for customers who he believes are being shortchanged by the provisions of the proposed market legislation. “I declined to opine on the exact—whether the hearing, the markup should happen or not… But I did feel like I had to speak up on behalf of our customers and all Americans here,” he articulated. Debate Heats Over CLARITY Act Central to the ongoing debate surrounding the CLARITY Act is a critical disagreement between banks and crypto firms regarding the fate of stablecoin holders and whether they should be entitled to receive reward payments. Armstrong has previously raised alarms that the bill might prohibit tokenized equities, impose restrictions on decentralized finance (DeFi), and expand governmental access to financial data, thereby compromising individual privacy. Furthermore, he warned that the legislation could shift regulatory authority away from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and towards the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), sidelining competition within the crypto space. Armstrong Critiques Banking Lobbying Tactics Armstrong noted the irony in the current situation, pointing out that while banks are indeed leveraging the advantages of cryptocurrency, their lobbying efforts seem aimed at restricting competing firms. “Many of these banks are actually very smart,” he acknowledged, referencing the commercial side of banking that is increasingly engaging with crypto. “They’re actually doing deals with Coinbase. We’re powering a lot of crypto and stablecoin infrastructure for them on the commercial side.” Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto ETFs Set To Attract $130 Billion-Plus Inflows This Year, JPMorgan Predicts Despite his criticisms of the banking sector’s lobbying tactics, Armstrong expressed optimism that legislators could ultimately resolve the outstanding issues within the crypto market structure bill: And then their lobbying arm comes to D.C. and thinks of it as very zero-sum and is trying to kill the competition. So, I suspect, like many things, if we get the principles in the room, we can actually get this figured out and make a good deal.

This discussion is always around how it can realistically trade at huge price levels in the double and triple digits with such a huge total supply. However, discussion around its burn rate has resurfaced due to current figures showing a steady reduction in the cryptocurrency’s total supply. According to data shared by an expert on X, XRP’s supply has declined by more than 2 million tokens over the past two years, with comments about how the burn mechanism works, what it actually means for long-term supply, and how it fits into discussions about its valuation and use in large-scale payments. XRP Burns: Millions Are Gone Forever XRP does not rely on a discretionary burn program or periodic token destruction events. Instead, the XRP Ledger permanently destroys a small amount of the token every time a transaction is processed. This fee is not paid to validators or any network participant. Once it is consumed by the protocol, it is removed from circulation permanently. According to numbers shared on X by 24HRSCRYPTO, the total supply stood at 99,988,313,728 about 806 days ago. Today, that number is closer to 99,985,726,061. The difference is 2,587,667 XRP that no longer exist, meaning a little over 3,200 of the altcoin is destroyed per day. That number may not look dramatic compared to its nearly 100 billion maximum supply. However, it shows consistent on-ledger usage leading to a steady reduction in supply. This has led to the cumulative amount of the token burned slowly moving higher over the full lifetime of the Ledger. Pre-Mined, How Institutions Fit Into The Design The post by 24HRSCRYPTO also revisits a long-standing aspect of XRP’s structure. The token’s entire supply of 100 billion tokens was created at inception, although not all were released at launch. Furthermore, its supply has always been fixed, and burns will continue to reduce the total number of the token in existence. This is in contrast to networks like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana that see their total circulating supply increase over time. Furthermore, Ripple, which developed the Ledger, has consistently framed the altcoin from a payments and financial infrastructure perspective. This trend is also unlike most other cryptocurrencies, which are built to work in parallel against traditional finance. 24HRSCRYPTO notes that this design reflects an institutional mindset, noting that supply certainty is something banks and large financial players tend to prefer. When trillions start to flow into the altcoin, the circulating supply will continue to decrease. According to the analyst, $100 per XRP is inevitable in this case. This viewpoint is based on the fact that higher price targets for the token are not speculations but a functional requirement for global-scale usage.",XRP|24HRSCRYPTO|dogecoin|Ethereum|ripple|solana|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 04:00:48

The frontier has experienced remarkable growth in the last few years due to the influx of financial institutions such as BlackRock and J.P. Morgan. Tokenized assets now emerge as a rapidly evolving sector in the crypto ecosystem. The sector has attracted major financial institutions and corporations, including BlackRock and J.P.

The firm noted that these platforms have become strategic hubs for crypto start-ups and global financial institutions to launch financial products for users worldwide. The data platform highlighted that more than 2,100 tokenized assets have been deployed as of January 16. Token terminal also noted that the sector has grown to have more than 140 issuers across more than 80 different blockchains and more than 12 standardized metrics per asset. Cryptopolitan reported that the value of real-world assets on blockchain networks has skyrocketed by 232% in 2025, reaching $18.6 billion, up from $5.6 billion in 2024. The report credits the sudden growth to the recent increase in institutional adoption and investments. The year saw traditional assets such as bonds, commodities, and private credit undergo tokenization. The report noted that tokenized equities witnessed significant growth in RWAs, bringing traditional stocks and ETFs onto the blockchain. Metals such as Gold and Silver can also be traded publicly as perpetual contracts on exchanges such as Hyperliquid. In Asia, the United Arab Emirates exported its real estate tokenization expertise to Georgia earlier this week. PRYPCO Mint, the first licensed real estate tokenization platform in the UAE, partnered with the Dubai Land Department and VARA (Dubai’s Virtual Regulatory Authority) to tokenize ownership certificates. The first tokenized certificate attracted 224 investors from over 40 different nationalities with an average investment of $2,900. The report noted that PRYPCO signed an MOU with the Ministry of Justice of Georgia, which mandates both parties to explore, develop, and implement an innovative real estate tokenization initiative in the U.S. state. In Europe, Swift announced it had completed a tokenized assets pilot with BNP Paribas Securities Services, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Société Générale. The coalition developed mechanisms for the exchange and settlement of tokenized bonds. Crypto execs predict tokenization will continue to grow in 2026 According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, tokenized assets will redefine global trading activities. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan on January 11, the Coinbase executive mentioned that tokenized stocks will expand their international access and continue to offer fractional stock purchases and round-the-clock trading. He added that they will provide perpetual futures, real-time settlement, and novel governance innovations. Armstrong said Coinbase developers are building an all-inclusive exchange platform that will include different financial markets outside crypto, such as stocks and commodities, in 2026. The plan is set to position Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, as a competitor in the stock and equities brokerage industry. Coinbase recently partnered with Kalshi, a rapidly growing prediction market, to advance tokenization of betting and prediction markets. Last year, the Head of Operations at Bitfinex Securities, Jesse Knutson, also mentioned that emerging markets are expected to drive strong growth in real-world asset tokenization this year. According to Knutson, tokenization allows retail investors to access investments that would otherwise be costly to them by owning a fraction of the asset. He also revealed that organizations find it easy to provide fixed returns to investors but struggle to acquire stable traditional funding to benefit most from asset tokenization.

OpenAI said on Friday it will begin testing ads inside chatbot responses for free users in the U.S. and those on its new $8 Go plan. That includes a lot of people. If you’re not paying for Plus, Pro, or Enterprise, you’re going to start seeing ads in your chatbot replies. The company said these ads will show up at the bottom of ChatGPT’s responses, and they’ll be clearly labeled so users know exactly what’s an ad and what’s AI output. If you’re under 18, you won’t see any ads at all. Ads also won’t appear near things like politics, health, or mental health topics, OpenAI said. OpenAI expands testing and keeps paid plans ad‑free Sam Altman’s team is already deep into spending mode. OpenAI locked in over $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals last year, and they’re now aiming to cover that kind of commitment. Sam had said back in November that OpenAI was already reaching a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate. So yeah, this isn’t about pocket change. To keep that growth going, OpenAI is finally turning to digital ads, just like Google and Meta have done for years. Sam posted Friday on X: “It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don’t want to pay, so we are hopeful a business model like this can work.” Translation: if you want AI for free, you’re going to see some ads. The Go plan, which launched Friday in the U.S., is OpenAI’s low-cost $8 tier, and it’ll include ads too. That’s now the entry point for anyone who wants access to more advanced features than the free tier but doesn’t want to pay $20 a month. But again, ads are part of the deal. Want to skip ads? You’ll need to go Plus or higher. Sam’s always had mixed feelings about putting ads into ChatGPT. He’s warned before that it could mess with user trust, saying publicly that he didn’t want ads to change how people felt about the product. But he also said back in November that OpenAI would probably try ads “at some point,” even if he didn’t expect it to be the biggest money-maker. OpenAI said ChatGPT’s answers won’t be changed by the ads, and they also vowed that they’re not selling user data to advertisers. Users will also be able to dismiss ads, learn why they’re seeing them, and send feedback. According to the company, “We’ll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won’t change.” Don’t just read crypto news.

Recent data tracking the most searched cashtags on the platform shows XRP consistently appearing among the dominant assets drawing user attention. Interestingly, this surge in visibility is not happening in isolation but in tandem with a series of regulatory, institutional, and ecosystem developments within the XRP ecosystem. XRP Surges Into The Top Cashtags On X Data tracking the most-searched cashtags on the social media platform X shows XRP climbing alongside other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a closer look at the data shows that XRP has received many more cashtags compared to other cryptocurrencies. This trend was revealed by Nikita Bier, head of product at X, who shared a visualization chart of recent search behavior on X. The chart data shows that XRP has consistently appeared among the most queried assets on X since December 2025. Throughout the period depicted, top cashtag traffic has been fluctuating with daily rhythm as X users scan the platform and post on X with cashtags. The share of searches attributable to $xrp slices into a larger portion of the total during days in early January 2026, which indicates extended interest. On some dates, XRP’s presence in the search mix rivals that of $btc and $eth, which are typically the dominant anchors of crypto attention on social media. The chart also shows how other tags wax and wane alongside XRP’s performance. Some days show greater fragmentation, where interest is spread across stocks such as $iren (IREN), $tesla (Tesla), $gme (GameStop), and $asts (AST SpaceMobile Inc.). Nonetheless, the trajectory for XRP in the first half of January shows a growing base of people actively getting involved in the cryptocurrency. Top Cashtags Searched On X Why XRP Is Commanding So Much Attention Social interest on X is a mix of speculation and ecosystem developments, which XRP is currently sitting at the center of. Behind this spike in attention are tangible developments surrounding Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. One recent example is how Ripple secured regulatory approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, obtaining both an Electronic Money Institution license and cryptoasset registration. Ripple’s regulatory buildout is expanding across Europe, with additional approvals in Luxembourg as part of its push to operate on both sides of the continent. Interestingly, there are also indications of deeper engagement with Ripple’s ecosystem on the institutional side. Rumors and mentions on X indicate that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has started to use Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin (RLUSD) as collateral. However, this move is yet to be confirmed by BlackRock. These updates, combined with many others, help explain why social interest and cashtag searches for XRP have recently been on the rise on X and other social media platforms.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 05:00:46

A high-timeframe trader has identified a fractal that closely mirrored Bitcoin’s behavior ahead of the 2021 bull run. He argues that the current cycle is unfolding in line with a well-established structural script observed across multiple market cycles spanning more than a decade. Bitcoin’s Fractal: Rooted In High-Timeframe Structure The fractal highlighted by the trader is based on a direct structural comparison between Bitcoin’s current cycle and the 2021 setup, illustrated in a chart he attached to his analysis. The chart aligns both periods to show how price advanced into a broad distribution range, rolled over into a sharp corrective phase, and then attempted to recover while capped by descending resistance. In both cases, Bitcoin retraced to the 0.382 Fibonacci level before stabilizing, marking a shared technical inflection point rather than a coincidental price overlap. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Approaching A Key Decision Zone, But Structure Is Still Firmly Bullish This structural symmetry extends beyond price levels into timing. According to the trader, the current cycle has tracked the rhythm of prior four-year cycles with notable consistency, allowing historical all-time highs and lows to be mapped objectively. Using that same framework, the data previously supported a high-probability short near the peak candle around $123,000, reinforcing his view that recurring market structure continues to guide directional risk. By comparing the two cycles directly, the trader argues that Bitcoin’s behavior is being evaluated through a recurring structural pattern that has remained intact for more than 12 years, rather than through subjective bias. $100,000 As A Structural And Psychological Ceiling Within the identified fractal, psychological resistance is a key determinant of Bitcoin’s upside potential. Looking back at 2021, Bitcoin failed to decisively reclaim the $50,000 level and instead front-ran it before reversing, establishing a behavioral precedent for how traders respond to significant round-number thresholds. Applying this pattern to the current cycle, $100,000 now functions as the analogous psychological ceiling. As a result, some participants may act preemptively, which could generate selling pressure from underwater holders and distribution by larger players. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals The Biggest Enemy Of XRP Investors As Price Struggles At $2 This potential resistance is reinforced by diagonal trendlines that mirror the caps observed in 2021, creating a structural limit on upside momentum. Within this context, short-term extensions into the $98,000–$99,000 range remain plausible and are fully compatible with the fractal, as price can approach the psychological ceiling. Moreover, positioning data from the past six to eight months indicates that the median short-term buyer cost basis has clustered between $95,000 and $100,000, highlighting zones where profit-taking and defensive selling are likely to intensify. These elements suggest a scenario where price may test resistance, experience temporary stalls, and respect structural limits without invalidating the broader high-timeframe thesis. However, the trader notes that the framework is probabilistic: only a sustained move above $104,000–$105,000 would break the fractal pattern and necessitate a full reassessment of the high-timeframe trend.

The 10% credit card plan sits inside a broader affordability agenda. That agenda includes blocking institutional investors from buying single‑family homes and allowing savers to tap 401(k) plans for home down payments. Timing remains uncertain, but Trump said more details will come when he speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Fox Business that talks with major banks are active. “They think that the president’s on to something,” Kevin said during the interview. At the same time, housing policy is also under review. Officials are discussing whether to block stock buybacks by publicly traded homebuilders. Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, raised the idea earlier this week in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. No decisions have been finalized. White House officials say discussions are still moving. The administration did not respond to requests for comment as talks continued behind closed doors. Late last week, Trump called for a one‑year 10% cap on credit card rates and set January 20 as the deadline. His team has also met with homebuilders to discuss affordability. Financial firms spent days trying to figure out how the order would work. Industry trade groups began planning responses and warned the cap could hit lower‑income borrowers and disrupt lending. Pressure increased when Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt spoke on Thursday. She said companies are expected to lower rates by the deadline. She called it a “demand” from Trump. Banks push back as consumers and lobbyists weigh outcomes The issue dominated earnings calls at major banks this week. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America all raised concerns. Executives said they lack enough detail to measure the impact on their businesses. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said a government‑mandated cap could slow economic activity. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said it could limit access to credit if banks pull back. Bank trade groups also pushed back. “We’re talking about unsecured lending, so it’s not like an auto loan or a mortgage loan where there’s something you can take back,” said Rob Nichols, head of the American Bankers Association. Lobbyists spent the week trying to understand how Trump might implement the order. One option under discussion is using the interstate commerce clause to override state usury limits, according to a lobbyist involved in the talks. Some consumer advocates warned that a 10% cap could be too low and lead banks to cut lending. Others pointed to federal credit unions, which already operate under rate caps. “It’s about finding a reasonable rate that doesn’t undermine the ability of consumers who are struggling to get by,” said Adam Rust of the Consumer Federation of America. Kevin also floated the idea that banks could voluntarily launch new Trump cards. Bilt rolled out three cards earlier this week with rates capped at 10%, though the limit lasts one year and applies only to new purchases. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This development marks a significant escalation in the ongoing debate about how to regulate digital assets in the United States, potentially derailing years of legislative progress. White House Crypto Bill Faces Unprecedented Challenge The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Liquidity, and Institutional Transparency (CLARITY) Act represents the most comprehensive cryptocurrency market structure legislation proposed in Congress. Lawmakers designed the bill to establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance platforms. However, recent developments threaten to undermine this legislative effort completely. According to multiple sources familiar with the negotiations, the White House expressed serious concerns about Coinbase’s withdrawal from discussions. Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, first reported this development. Administration officials characterized Coinbase’s move as unexpected and potentially damaging to both regulatory progress and industry stability. The legislation’s future now depends heavily on whether Coinbase returns to negotiations with acceptable terms regarding stablecoin yields for traditional banking institutions. This specific issue has emerged as the primary sticking point in recent weeks. Coinbase’s Concerns About the CLARITY Act Coinbase officially rescinded its support for the legislation last week, citing several substantive concerns about the bill’s current language. The company identified four primary issues that prompted their withdrawal from negotiations: Tokenized Stock Restrictions: Provisions that could effectively ban tokenized traditional securities DeFi Limitations: Language that might block decentralized finance platforms from operating legally Financial Surveillance: Sections permitting unlimited access to user financial information Regulatory Authority Shifts: Provisions weakening CFTC authority while strengthening SEC oversight Coinbase representatives particularly emphasized concerns about stablecoin reward functions. They argued that certain provisions could prevent stablecoin issuers from offering yield-generating products. This limitation would significantly impact the economic viability of many stablecoin models currently operating in the market. Regulatory Jurisdiction Battle Intensifies The legislation’s treatment of regulatory authority has sparked considerable debate among industry observers. Currently, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees cryptocurrency derivatives and certain spot markets. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains jurisdiction over securities offerings and exchanges. The CLARITY Act proposes shifting more authority to the SEC, a move that concerns many cryptocurrency advocates. They argue that the SEC’s traditional securities framework doesn’t adequately address the unique characteristics of digital assets. This regulatory tension represents a fundamental challenge for cryptocurrency legislation in the United States. Key Regulatory Differences Between CFTC and SEC Approaches Aspect CFTC Approach SEC Approach Primary Framework Commodities Regulation Securities Regulation Registration Requirements Generally Lighter Extensive and Complex r> Disclosure Standards Market Transparency Focus Investor Protection Focus Innovation Philosophy More Accommodating More Restrictive Stablecoin Yield Negotiations Reach Impasse The most immediate conflict centers on stablecoin yield provisions for traditional banks. Banking institutions seek regulatory clarity about how they can offer yield-generating stablecoin products. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency companies worry about unfair competitive advantages for traditional financial institutions. Stablecoins represent digital assets pegged to stable reserves like the U.S. dollar. These cryptocurrencies have grown tremendously in recent years, with total market capitalization exceeding $150 billion. The yield debate specifically concerns how these assets generate returns for holders through various mechanisms. Traditional banks argue they need clear regulatory pathways to compete with cryptocurrency-native companies. Conversely, cryptocurrency firms express concerns about regulatory capture. They fear established financial institutions might use regulation to disadvantage innovative competitors. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Legislation This legislative effort follows years of regulatory uncertainty in the cryptocurrency space. Congress first began serious discussions about comprehensive digital asset legislation in 2022. Multiple bills have since been introduced, but none have reached the president’s desk for signature. The CLARITY Act emerged from bipartisan negotiations in 2024. Lawmakers from both parties worked with industry stakeholders to craft balanced legislation. Their goal was to provide regulatory clarity while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem. Previous legislative attempts faced similar challenges regarding regulatory jurisdiction and stablecoin treatment. However, the current dispute represents the most significant threat to legislative progress in recent memory. Industry observers note that without Coinbase’s support, the legislation faces substantial obstacles in Congress. Potential Impacts on Cryptocurrency Markets The uncertainty surrounding this legislation could have immediate effects on cryptocurrency markets. Regulatory clarity represents a crucial factor for institutional investment in digital assets. Many traditional financial institutions have delayed significant cryptocurrency investments pending legislative outcomes. Market analysts identify several potential consequences if the legislation stalls: Continued Regulatory Uncertainty: Extended period without clear rules for market participants Reduced Institutional Participation: Traditional financial firms may remain cautious Innovation Migration: Cryptocurrency companies might relocate to more favorable jurisdictions Market Volatility: Increased price fluctuations due to regulatory uncertainty International competition represents another significant consideration. Other jurisdictions, including the European Union and United Kingdom, have advanced their own cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. The United States risks falling behind in the global competition for digital asset innovation if legislation continues to stall. Broader Implications for Financial Innovation This dispute extends beyond immediate regulatory concerns to fundamental questions about financial innovation. The cryptocurrency industry represents one of the most significant technological disruptions in finance since the internet. How regulators approach this innovation will shape financial markets for decades. Traditional financial institutions increasingly recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Many major banks now explore various blockchain applications. However, regulatory uncertainty creates significant barriers to meaningful adoption and integration. The current impasse highlights the tension between innovation and regulation that characterizes technological disruption. Finding the appropriate balance remains challenging for policymakers worldwide. The United States’ approach will likely influence regulatory developments in other major economies. Conclusion The White House’s potential withdrawal of support for the crypto bill represents a critical juncture for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. The dispute between the administration and Coinbase over stablecoin yields and market structure provisions threatens to derail years of legislative progress. As negotiations reach this impasse, the future of comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation remains uncertain. Market participants, regulators, and policymakers now await Coinbase’s next move and the administration’s final decision regarding the White House crypto bill. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Liquidity, and Institutional Transparency (CLARITY) Act represents comprehensive legislation designed to establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance platforms in the United States. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the legislation? Coinbase cited concerns about tokenized stock restrictions, DeFi limitations, financial surveillance provisions, regulatory authority shifts, and stablecoin reward function limitations as reasons for withdrawing support. Q3: What are stablecoin yields? Stablecoin yields refer to returns generated by holding certain stablecoins, typically through mechanisms like staking, lending, or other interest-generating activities within decentralized finance platforms. Q4: How might this legislation affect cryptocurrency markets? Continued regulatory uncertainty could reduce institutional participation, increase market volatility, and potentially drive innovation to more favorable jurisdictions if comprehensive legislation fails to pass. Q5: What happens if the White House withdraws support? Without White House support, the legislation faces significant obstacles in Congress, potentially delaying comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation for years and extending the current period of regulatory uncertainty.

The comparison many economists are making is not subtle.In 2019, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey, fired central bank governor Murat Çetinkaya after he refused to cut rates.The result was brutal.The lira collapsed and inflation surged. Even then, Erdoğan never claimed the banker was a criminal. In the United States, Jay Powell, the Fed chair, is now facing a federal investigation over a $2.5bn renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Powell breaks protocol as Trump pressure escalates As Cryptopolitan reported , Powell had released a short video on the Fed’s website, saying the investigation was a pretext designed by Trump to force deep interest rate cuts. That public response broke decades of Fed tradition and what has been Powell’s own personal style. Larry Kudlow, who previously ran the National Economic Council, said Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in Washington, “may have pulled the trigger” on Powell “a little too fast.” Markets stayed calm. Stocks barely moved. Bond yields were steady. Investors are betting the Fed will resist pressure to cut rates to near zero. Still, economists called the moment alarming. Since World War II, the White House and the Fed have acted as anchors of global stability. Now they are openly clashing. Klaas Knot, former head of the Dutch central bank, said the U.S. once supported institutions needed for a market economy to work. “It was leading by example,” he said. “They have apparently chosen to set an entirely different example.” The timing matters. Trump is traveling to Davos to sell his economic agenda as the Supreme Court hears arguments in the case of Lisa Cook. She is a Fed governor he tried to fire over mortgage fraud claims. Lisa denies them and has not been charged. Political backlash complicates Trump plans for the Fed The conflict between Trump and Powell is long-running. After appointing Powell, the president turned on him following rate hikes. During his second term, attacks intensified. Trump called Powell a “stubborn mule” and a “numbskull.” He said he would “love to fire” him for refusing to cut rates to 1 per cent. The White House later focused on the Fed building project, now $700mn over budget, which sits at the center of the DOJ probe. Powell stayed silent for months, even when Trump attempted to remove Lisa Cook. That changed with the video. Capitol Hill reacted. Thom Tillis of North Carolina backed Powell. Lisa Murkowski and John Kennedy followed. On Wall Street, Jamie Dimon joined Christine Lagarde in calling for central bank independence. Glenn Hubbard, former chair of George W Bush’s economic council, said Powell handled the video well. “He clarified what had happened,” Hubbard said. “He didn’t editorialise.” Hubbard also signed a letter condemning the probe, alongside every living former Fed chair. Inside the administration, cracks appeared. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, publicly backed a review of the Fed but privately urged Trump not to pursue the investigation. Treasury officials later said there was “zero daylight” between Bessent and the president. Hubbard called the episode an “own goal of epic proportions.” The probe has made it harder for Trump to reshape the Fed. Powell’s chair term ends in four months, but he can stay on the board until January 2028. Allies say Powell is now reconsidering whether to step down. His exit would allow Trump to appoint another ally. Senate approval is another obstacle. Tillis has threatened to block any nominee until the probe is dropped. If that drags on, Powell could remain chair. The controversy has also hurt Kevin Hassett, a close Trump ally. Hassett backed the probe early, then said, “I expect that there’s nothing to see here.” Later, Trump hinted he might keep Hassett in his current role. Other names are floating. Kevin Warsh, Chris Waller, and Rick Rieder have stayed silent. Stephen Miran, already approved by the Senate, joined the Fed board last year. James Egelhof of BNP Paribas said the Fed would stick to its policy framework. Still, some funds are hedging. Pimco, which manages $2.2tn, is reducing exposure to the dollar. Paul Diggle warned of creeping politicisation. Adam Posen said governments are planning paths “not dependent on the US.” Even if the DOJ case fails, economists warn the damage may linger. Lael Brainard said officials may hesitate to speak freely. “Everybody is nervous,” she said, “that they too could be the subject of a criminal investigation.” Get seen where it counts.

Not because they don’t want to. They literally don’t have the tools. “We don’t have enough equipment to expand production of these chips, and we can’t put it together fast enough,” Jim said on his CNBC segment Friday night. Micron’s stock jumped 7.76% on Friday. Not a small move. The company makes memory and storage tech, especially for artificial intelligence. Its CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, told Jim there’s no sign of things slowing down. “AI driven-demand is accelerating. It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand,” Sanjay said. They just started building a 600,000-square-foot site in upstate New York. It’s part of their plan to spend $200 billion on new chip production in the U.S. Micron, Seagate and others can’t keep up with AI orders That massive site? It’s not saving anything tomorrow. It’s years away. And Jim pointed that out. The only reason this kind of construction is even happening is because of the CHIPS Act. That law gives U.S. chipmakers government support to build locally. But laws don’t pour concrete. It’ll take time. That means the shortage isn’t getting fixed right away. And as long as demand stays hot, Jim says prices will just keep rising. Besides Micron, Jim called out other chip stocks that are already up big. Western Digital, Seagate, Sandisk are all benefiting from this crunch. He also said the shortage didn’t show up out of nowhere. Last year, everyone thought there were too many chips. Now? Total reversal. Jim said only one company saw this coming: Nvidia. “Only Nvidia really saw it coming,” Jim said . “They teamed up with the best of the best, Taiwan Semiconductor, to make all the high-end chips that are needed. There’s no bottleneck there. There’s no shortage, at least not in comparison to memory.” Markets stay up as global chaos is mostly ignored Even with everything going on around the world, stocks are still going up. The S&P 500 is higher. So is the Dow Jones, with a 3% gain this year. The Nasdaq is up 1.2%. Nobody’s pulling out of the market, even with Trump talking about military action or Greenland. Anthony Esposito, who runs AscalonVI Capital, told CNBC that markets haven’t cared about geopolitical risk for a while now. “Israel bombs Iran — the S&P 500 was down 1% overnight and closed down just 50bps. U.S. bombs Iran — almost no reaction,” he said. Venezuela and Greenland, he added, could even help U.S. markets because of energy, rare-earths and infrastructure. Europe’s Stoxx 600 is up almost 4%, even while everyone’s guessing what Trump might try with Greenland. Over in Asia, the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index just hit a new high after jumping more than 5% this year. Japan’s Nikkei 225 and South Korea’s Kospi both hit records too. One last thing. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on Trump’s tariffs. It hasn’t happened yet. But investors don’t seem to be waiting.

This consistent pattern, derived from data provided by the analytics firm Farside Investors, signals a potential stabilization phase for these novel financial instruments following their highly anticipated launch. The data reveals a compelling divergence beneath the headline figure, however, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) attracting $14.9 million while the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) experienced an outflow of $10.2 million. Analyzing the Ethereum ETF Inflow Streak The five-day inflow streak for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs represents a notable milestone in the short history of these products. Analysts often scrutinize consecutive flow data to gauge underlying market sentiment and product differentiation. This period of consistent net inflows suggests a growing, albeit measured, comfort level among institutional and retail investors with gaining direct exposure to Ethereum’s native asset, Ether (ETH), through a regulated, exchange-traded structure. The structure of these ETFs is crucial; they hold the actual cryptocurrency, unlike futures-based products, which track derivative contracts. Market observers point to several contextual factors that may be contributing to this trend. Firstly, the broader cryptocurrency market has shown signs of consolidation after a period of volatility, potentially encouraging entry at perceived stable levels. Secondly, increasing discussion around Ethereum’s ongoing technological upgrades, particularly its full transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, may be renewing long-term investor interest. Finally, the sheer novelty of the product category means early adoption curves are still being established, making multi-day trends particularly informative. The Divergence Between Major Fund Providers A deeper analysis of the January 16 data uncovers a significant narrative of competition and investor preference. The performance split between the two largest funds by asset base is stark. BlackRock’s ETHA, managed by the world’s largest asset manager, posted a robust single-day inflow of $14.9 million. Conversely, Grayscale’s ETHE, which converted from a long-standing closed-end trust into an ETF, saw $10.2 million leave the fund. This divergence can be attributed to several key factors familiar to ETF analysts: Fee Structures: Management fees are a primary driver of ETF flows. BlackRock’s ETHA launched with a highly competitive fee, while Grayscale’s ETHE, carrying over from its trust structure, initially had a significantly higher fee. Although Grayscale has since reduced its fee, the initial disparity created a powerful first impression. Brand and Distribution Power: BlackRock’s iShares platform boasts unparalleled distribution networks among financial advisors and institutional platforms, facilitating easier access for a vast swath of investors. Tracking Efficiency and Liquidity: Newer funds like ETHA were built from the ground up as ETFs, potentially offering tighter tracking to the net asset value (NAV) and efficient creation/redemption processes. Converted funds can sometimes face initial technical arbitrage. The table below summarizes the key contrasts between the two funds based on available public data: Fund (Ticker) Provider Jan 16 Flow Primary Consideration iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) BlackRock +$14.9M Inflow Competitive fee, strong distribution Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) Grayscale -$10.2M Outflow Legacy fee history, conversion from trust Expert Perspective on Flow Dynamics Financial analysts specializing in fund flows emphasize that this pattern is not uncommon in nascent ETF markets. “The early days of a new ETF category are always a battleground for assets,” notes a veteran ETF strategist whose commentary is frequently cited in financial media. “Investors are rationally moving toward the combination of lowest cost and strongest brand credibility. The consistent net inflow for the category is the more telling macro story—it shows the product concept itself is gaining traction, even as assets shuffle between providers.” This expert view underscores that while individual fund competition is fierce, the aggregate positive flow is a stronger indicator of the Ethereum ETF market’s health. Furthermore, data from Farside Investors provides an evidence-based foundation for this analysis. The firm’s independent tracking of daily fund flows is a widely referenced source within the investment community, adding a layer of verifiable authority to the reported figures. The five-day streak provides a small but meaningful dataset that begins to move beyond launch-day anomalies and toward revealing sustained investor behavior. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets The steady inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs carry implications beyond the funds themselves. Firstly, they represent a continuous, incremental source of buying pressure on the underlying Ether asset. Each dollar flowing into ETFs like ETHA requires the fund’s authorized participants to purchase an equivalent amount of Ether to back the new shares, creating a direct link between traditional finance capital and the crypto market. Secondly, this activity validates the regulatory pathway established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in approving these products. The approval process was lengthy and scrutinized, making their subsequent market performance a point of interest for policymakers and future applicants, such as those proposing funds for other digital assets. The demonstrated investor demand supports the argument for a regulated access point to crypto assets. Finally, the flow data contributes to the maturation narrative of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The ability to track daily inflows and outflows with the same tools used for traditional equity or bond ETFs normalizes Ethereum as an asset class for a broader audience. It shifts the discussion partially away from pure price speculation and toward metrics like product adoption, fee competition, and market structure. Conclusion The fifth consecutive day of net inflows for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, culminating in a $4.7 million addition on January 16, 2025, underscores a building, if cautious, wave of investor adoption. While the headline Ethereum ETF flow number is positive, the internal dynamics reveal a competitive landscape where low fees and powerful distribution, exemplified by BlackRock’s ETHA, are winning significant assets. In contrast, Grayscale’s ETHE continues to navigate its transition from a legacy product. This ongoing streak provides critical, early-stage evidence of demand for regulated crypto exposure. As the market for these innovative funds evolves, sustained flow data will remain a key barometer for measuring their integration into the mainstream financial portfolio. FAQs Q1: What does a ‘net inflow’ mean for an Ethereum ETF? A1: A net inflow occurs when the total amount of new money invested into an ETF over a period exceeds the amount withdrawn. For a spot Ethereum ETF, this typically means the fund’s manager must buy more of the underlying Ether to create new shares, directly increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. Q2: Why is there a difference between BlackRock’s ETHA and Grayscale’s ETHE flows? A2: The difference is primarily driven by factors like the fund’s expense ratio (fee), brand recognition, distribution network, and structural history. BlackRock’s ETHA launched with a very competitive fee and the power of the iShares platform, while Grayscale’s ETHE converted from a higher-fee closed-end fund, leading some investors to reallocate. Q3: How does Farside Investors track this data? A3: Farside Investors aggregates daily flow data from publicly available sources and fund issuers. They calculate net flows by estimating the creation and redemption activity of ETF shares, a standard methodology in the traditional ETF industry now applied to crypto ETFs. Q4: Do inflows into the ETF guarantee the price of Ethereum will rise? A4: No, while inflows create direct buying pressure for Ether, the price is influenced by a vast array of other factors including broader market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, technological developments on the Ethereum network, and trading activity on global crypto exchanges. Q5: What is the significance of a ‘five-day streak’ of inflows? A5: In the context of a new financial product, a multi-day trend helps distinguish sustained interest from one-day volatility or launch hype. It suggests a pattern of accumulating interest rather than a fleeting reaction, providing a more reliable signal of early product-market fit.

This pivotal movement, reported by Farside Investors, decisively ended a four-day period of consecutive net inflows, prompting immediate analysis from market observers. The data provides a granular look at investor behavior across the major funds, revealing divergent strategies in a dynamic regulatory landscape. Breaking Down the Bitcoin ETF Outflow Data Farside Investors’ detailed flow data for January 16 presents a clear picture of the day’s activity. The figures highlight a notable divergence among the leading fund providers. While BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) managed to attract a modest $15.1 million in new capital, several other major funds saw substantial redemptions. Consequently, the aggregate effect tipped the scales toward a net negative flow for the entire product category. The specific outflows were led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which recorded a $205.2 million withdrawal. Similarly, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) posted outflows of $90.4 million and $69.4 million, respectively. Interestingly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which had previously dominated outflow figures since its conversion to an ETF, reported a comparatively lower $44.8 million outflow on this day. This shift in distribution suggests a potential rotation or a broadening of the factors influencing investor decisions. Contextualizing the Shift in ETF Flows To understand the importance of this single day’s data, one must consider the broader timeline. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024. The initial launch period saw massive inflows as institutional and retail investors gained a regulated, accessible pathway to Bitcoin exposure. The four-day inflow streak immediately preceding January 16 had buoyed market sentiment, suggesting sustained demand. However, ETF flows are inherently volatile and respond to multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific signals. Potential catalysts for the January 16 outflow include routine portfolio rebalancing by large institutions, profit-taking after a short-term price rally, or reactions to broader financial market conditions, such as movements in treasury yields or equity indices. Analysts consistently note that daily flow data represents a snapshot, not a long-term trend. Therefore, interpreting a single day’s movement requires caution and context. Expert Perspective on Market Mechanics Market structure experts often explain that ETF creation and redemption activity involves Authorized Participants (APs). These large financial institutions create new ETF shares by depositing the underlying asset—in this case, Bitcoin—with the fund issuer. Conversely, they redeem shares by returning them to the issuer in exchange for the underlying Bitcoin. The net flow figure represents the balance between these two processes across all funds. A net outflow indicates that share redemptions exceeded creations, leading to a reduction in the total Bitcoin held collectively by these ETFs, all else being equal. This mechanism directly links to on-chain Bitcoin movement. When an AP redeems shares, the trust must send Bitcoin to the AP, which may then sell it on the open market. This potential selling pressure is a key metric watched by traders. Data from blockchain analytics firms can often corroborate ETF flow data by tracking transfers from known custodian wallets, adding a layer of verifiable evidence to the reported figures. Comparative Analysis of Fund Performance A closer examination of the individual fund flows reveals strategic narratives. BlackRock’s IBIT maintaining a positive inflow, even if small, underscores its position as a market leader with strong brand recognition among traditional investors. Meanwhile, the significant outflow from Fidelity’s FBTC, a similarly trusted name, may point to specific client actions rather than a broad loss of confidence. The changing pattern for Grayscale’s GBTC is particularly noteworthy. In the weeks following its conversion from a closed-end fund, GBTC experienced billions in outflows, primarily attributed to investors exiting at a lower fee structure after being locked in at a premium or discount. The relatively smaller $44.8 million outflow on January 16 could signal that this major wave of exits is subsiding, allowing other funds’ flows to have a more pronounced impact on the daily net figure. The following table summarizes the key flow data for clarity: ETF Provider (Ticker) Net Flow for Jan. 16, 2025 Notable Context BlackRock (IBIT) +$15.1 Million Consistent inflow leader since launch. Fidelity (FBTC) -$205.2 Million Largest single-fund outflow of the day. Bitwise (BITB) -$90.4 Million Notable shift from prior inflow trends. ARK Invest (ARKB) -$69.4 Million Reflects volatility in growth-focused strategies. Grayscale (GBTC) -$44.8 Million Outflow magnitude has decreased significantly from initial post-conversion waves. Total Net Flow -$394.7 Million Ends a four-day net inflow streak. Potential Impacts and Forward Outlook The immediate impact of such an outflow often manifests in market sentiment and short-term price action. Traders monitor this data closely as an indicator of institutional demand. A single day of outflows, however, does not invalidate the structural success of the Bitcoin ETF product class. Since their launch, these funds have collectively gathered tens of billions in assets under management, representing a monumental shift in Bitcoin’s integration with traditional finance. Looking ahead, analysts will watch for whether January 16 marks an isolated event or the beginning of a new pattern. Key factors to monitor include: Fee Structures: Competitive fee wars among providers influence long-term asset gathering. Macro Environment: Interest rate expectations and inflation data affect all risk assets. Bitcoin Halving Cycle: The next Bitcoin block reward halving, anticipated in 2024, historically influences long-term market cycles. Regulatory Developments: Clarity from U.S. regulators on digital asset frameworks can boost or hinder confidence. Ultimately, the true test for Bitcoin spot ETFs will be their performance over quarterly and annual horizons, not daily fluctuations. Their ability to provide transparent, secure, and liquid exposure to Bitcoin for a vast investor base remains their core value proposition. Conclusion The $394.7 million net outflow from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 16, 2025, serves as a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility and the complex factors driving institutional capital movements. While the day ended a positive four-day inflow streak, the data offers nuanced insights into shifting dynamics among the major funds. The event underscores the importance of analyzing ETF flows within a broader context of market structure, investor behavior, and macroeconomic trends. As the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem matures, such data points will continue to provide critical, real-time indicators of sentiment in the evolving intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional finance. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed from an ETF exceeds the value of shares created. For a spot Bitcoin ETF, this typically means the fund’s managers must sell some of the Bitcoin held in custody to return assets to investors redeeming their shares. Q2: Why did Grayscale’s GBTC have a smaller outflow compared to previous weeks? Many analysts believe the initial, massive wave of outflows from GBTC was driven by investors who were previously trapped in the closed-end fund structure, often selling to realize losses for tax purposes or moving to lower-fee competitors. That initial pressure may be easing. Q3: Can a single day of ETF outflows impact the Bitcoin price? Yes, it can contribute to short-term selling pressure. If the Bitcoin supporting the redeemed shares is sold on the open market by the Authorized Participants, it increases the available supply for sale, which can push the price down, all else being equal. Q4: Is Farside Investors the only source for this ETF flow data? No, while Farside is a widely cited and trusted source, other data firms like Bloomberg and ETF.com also track and publish this information. Analysts often cross-reference data for accuracy. Q5: How should long-term investors interpret daily ETF flow data? Long-term investors should view daily flows as noise within a larger trend. They are more indicative of short-term trader activity and institutional rebalancing than a fundamental shift in the asset’s long-term value proposition. Sustained multi-week or monthly trends hold more significance.

This analysis examines the fundamental and technical factors that could determine BCH’s market performance, drawing from historical data, current adoption metrics, and verifiable blockchain developments. Market analysts particularly focus on Bitcoin Cash’s unique value proposition as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, especially as global payment networks undergo significant transformation. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Landscape Bitcoin Cash enters 2026 with several established advantages in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The network consistently processes transactions with lower fees than its Bitcoin counterpart, according to blockchain data from 2024. Furthermore, merchant adoption continues expanding across multiple continents, particularly in regions seeking affordable digital payment solutions. Technical analysis of BCH’s price history reveals established support levels that provide crucial context for future projections. Market sentiment toward Bitcoin Cash often correlates with broader cryptocurrency cycles, yet the asset demonstrates distinct characteristics during market fluctuations. Several measurable factors will influence Bitcoin Cash’s price trajectory in 2026. Network upgrade implementations, including potential smart contract enhancements, could significantly impact developer activity. Additionally, regulatory developments in major economies will affect institutional adoption rates. Historical volatility patterns suggest that Bitcoin Cash typically experiences heightened price movements during quarterly contract expirations on major exchanges. The relationship between Bitcoin’s dominance index and alternative cryptocurrency performance remains a critical analytical framework for predicting BCH behavior. Expert Perspectives on 2026 Price Ranges Financial institutions and blockchain analysts present varied but evidence-based projections for Bitcoin Cash in 2026. For instance, recent technical analysis reports reference Fibonacci retracement levels from previous market cycles. Meanwhile, fundamental analysts emphasize on-chain metrics like active address growth and transaction volume trends. The consensus among technical analysts suggests that Bitcoin Cash must maintain specific support zones to sustain bullish momentum. Conversely, breaking below established technical levels could trigger different market scenarios that analysts continuously monitor. Bitcoin Cash 2027 Forecast: Adoption Versus Competition The 2027 outlook for Bitcoin Cash involves complex interactions between technological development and market competition. Payment processor integrations announced throughout 2025 will reach full implementation, potentially increasing real-world utility. However, competing payment-focused cryptocurrencies continue evolving with their own technological improvements. Network effect becomes increasingly crucial as cryptocurrency payment adoption reaches potential inflection points. Bitcoin Cash’s development roadmap includes scalability enhancements that could differentiate its value proposition from both traditional payment systems and newer blockchain projects. Market analysts particularly watch Bitcoin Cash’s performance relative to other major payment cryptocurrencies. Comparative transaction speed and cost data from 2024-2025 provides benchmarks for evaluating competitive advantages. Furthermore, cross-border remittance partnerships established in developing economies could drive substantial volume increases. The technological architecture of Bitcoin Cash, with its emphasis on larger block sizes, faces ongoing tests as transaction volumes potentially approach new thresholds. These technical limits will influence both network reliability and investor confidence throughout the forecast period. Institutional Factors Influencing 2027 Valuation Institutional cryptocurrency adoption trends significantly impact Bitcoin Cash’s potential 2027 valuation. Investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and regulated custody solutions create new access points for traditional investors. Regulatory clarity emerging from legislative processes in multiple jurisdictions reduces uncertainty for institutional participants. Additionally, corporate treasury adoption of cryptocurrencies for payment systems and balance sheet diversification introduces new demand dynamics. These institutional factors interact with retail market sentiment to create complex price discovery mechanisms that analysts must carefully evaluate. The 2028-2030 Horizon: Long-Term Technical and Fundamental Drivers Projecting Bitcoin Cash prices toward 2030 requires analyzing both cyclical patterns and structural market evolution. Historical cryptocurrency market cycles suggest potential periodicity in price peaks and troughs, though each cycle demonstrates unique characteristics. The Bitcoin halving event scheduled for 2028 will likely influence the entire cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin Cash’s valuation. Long-term adoption curves for digital payment systems provide contextual frameworks for estimating Bitcoin Cash’s market penetration potential. Technological innovations in layer-two solutions and interoperability protocols could further enhance Bitcoin Cash’s utility beyond its current capabilities. Demographic shifts in cryptocurrency adoption present another crucial consideration for long-term projections. Younger generations increasingly familiar with digital assets may drive different usage patterns than early adopters. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations continue influencing institutional investment decisions toward cryptocurrencies with specific technical characteristics. Bitcoin Cash’s energy consumption profile relative to proof-of-work alternatives remains a subject of ongoing analysis and technological development. These multifaceted factors collectively shape the probability distribution of potential price outcomes through the decade’s end. Quantitative Models and Scenario Analysis Financial analysts employ various quantitative models to project Bitcoin Cash prices through 2030. Time-series analysis incorporating volatility clustering and mean reversion characteristics provides statistical frameworks for price forecasting. Monte Carlo simulations generate probability distributions for potential price outcomes based on historical volatility and correlation data. Furthermore, network value models relating price to measurable adoption metrics like transaction count and active addresses offer fundamentally-grounded valuation approaches. These analytical methods consistently emphasize the inherent uncertainty in long-term cryptocurrency price predictions while identifying key variables that drive potential outcomes. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction Summary 2026-2030 Year Key Drivers Potential Scenarios 2026 Regulatory developments, network upgrades, Bitcoin market correlation Consolidation within established ranges or breakout based on adoption metrics 2027 Payment integration expansion, competitive landscape evolution Significant movement based on real-world utility milestones 2028-2030 Halving event impacts, generational adoption shifts, technological innovation Potential for exponential growth or stabilization based on market maturity The $1000 Question: Analyzing Probability Factors The possibility of Bitcoin Cash reaching $1000 involves specific technical and fundamental prerequisites. Market capitalization calculations indicate the required valuation increase relative to current levels and circulating supply. Historical resistance levels and psychological price barriers create technical hurdles that Bitcoin Cash must overcome. Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization would need to expand significantly to support such valuations across multiple assets. The $1000 price point represents not just a numerical threshold but a symbolic milestone that could influence market psychology and media coverage. Several measurable conditions could increase the probability of Bitcoin Cash achieving $1000 valuation. Sustained increases in daily transaction volume would demonstrate growing utility beyond speculative trading. Major payment processor integrations reaching critical mass could drive consistent demand unrelated to market sentiment. Technological innovations successfully addressing scalability while maintaining security would strengthen the fundamental investment thesis. Additionally, regulatory frameworks that legitimize cryptocurrency payments without stifling innovation could accelerate adoption curves. These factors interact in complex ways that defy simple linear projection but establish boundary conditions for potential outcomes. Risk Factors and Alternative Scenarios Realistic Bitcoin Cash price prediction must acknowledge significant risk factors and alternative scenarios. Technological vulnerabilities or successful attacks on the network could undermine confidence and valuation. Regulatory crackdowns in major markets could restrict access and utility, depressing prices. Furthermore, superior competing technologies could capture market share in the payment cryptocurrency segment. Macroeconomic conditions including interest rate environments and traditional market performance influence cryptocurrency valuations through risk appetite channels. These risk factors necessitate probabilistic thinking rather than deterministic prediction when considering long-term price targets like $1000. Conclusion Bitcoin Cash price prediction for 2026 through 2030 involves analyzing interconnected technological, regulatory, and market dynamics. The potential for BCH to reach $1000 depends on multiple factors aligning favorably, including adoption acceleration, technological robustness, and supportive market conditions. While historical patterns and current fundamentals provide analytical frameworks, cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile and unpredictable. Investors should consider Bitcoin Cash’s unique value proposition as electronic cash alongside rigorous risk assessment when evaluating long-term price projections. The evolving cryptocurrency landscape will undoubtedly present both opportunities and challenges as Bitcoin Cash approaches these forecast horizons.

Now, they are advocating for Coinbase to get back on board with lawmakers after the exchange’s CEO said it “can’t support the way the law is written.” According to a source close to the administration, the White House is prepared to walk away from the legislation if Coinbase does not return to negotiations and agree to a yield framework that satisfies banking interests and brings all parties back to consensus. On Wednesday through Thursday, senior administration officials, lawmakers, and industry figures were prepared to vote on the nearly 300-page Clarity Act. Coinbase’s word that it would not be part of its supporters forced the committee to postpone the vote and hold more discussions, much to the disappointment of the Oval Office. White House is angry over Coinbase’s surprise withdrawal Speaking to Crypto In America journalist Eleanor Terrett, the source said Coinbase made a “unilateral” move that blindsided the White House and other stakeholders. The White House has privately called Coinbase’s action a “rug pull” against the administration and the crypto industry, according to the source. Washington has blasted the crypto exchange for trying to “dictate the fate of industry-wide legislation,” reiterating that the bill was negotiated by a coalition of lawmakers, regulators, and market participants. “This is President Trump’s bill at the end of the day, not Brian Armstrong’s,” the source said. President Trump has been very supportive of digital asset innovation since his return to the US top seat, and his administration backed the House version of the Clarity Act earlier this year. But the POTUS’s camp is now willing to let the bill fail rather than accept “pressure from a single company.” Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong defended his company’s decision in a CNBC interview on Thursday, saying the firm had identified provisions that would harm consumers. “The high-level principle is that you can’t really have banks come in and try to kill their competition at the expense of the American consumer,” he told the news outlet. Armstrong had first publicized Coinbase’s opposition in a post on X late Wednesday, writing: “Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written. This version would be materially worse than the current status quo. We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill.” As Cryptopolitan reported on Friday, he explained that traditional savings accounts pay about 14 basis points on average, and stablecoin rewards that can reach 3.8%, which is an opportunity for banks to innovate with no risks to their business models. Months of discussions halted by one company Congressional staff had reportedly worked with industry representatives for months to craft the Clarity Act, meant to define regulatory boundaries for trading, custody, issuance, and decentralized finance. Coinbase, now publicly traded on Nasdaq with a market value near $70 billion, helped finance a network of political action committees that spent more than $130 million during the 2024 election cycle to back crypto-friendly candidates. Some netizens think the support may have gotten the company its loud influence on crypto-related bills. “Coinbase alone does not speak for the crypto industry and should not have a stranglehold on legislation. I also do not believe that the yield on stablecoins should be the deciding factor. This bill, at its core, has nothing to do with yield on stablecoins,” said one proponent of the market structure bill on X. When asked whether talks had resumed after the surprise withdrawal, Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s head of US policy, said the pause was a “shock to the system.” “We want to be respectful of the fact that blood, sweat, and tears have gone into this bill. I can’t stress enough how impressive it has been for the Senate staff and the Senators themselves who met for hundreds of hours at the member level to discuss these details…We want to make sure we are at the table working through this details, that we are going to get this done, and I don’t think anyone is walking away, Democrat, Republican, and I think even the industry is still absolutely united,” she said in an interview with Crypto In America.

This strategic acquisition, confirmed by corporate filings in Indianapolis, Indiana, on April 2, 2025, follows the company’s earlier pledge to accept BTC payments and hold all received cryptocurrency. Consequently, this action transforms the restaurant operator into a notable participant in the corporate digital asset treasury landscape. Steak ‘n Shake Bitcoin Strategy: From Payments to Treasury Reserve The recent $10 million Bitcoin purchase represents a significant escalation of Steak ‘n Shake’s public cryptocurrency strategy. Initially, the company announced it would begin accepting Bitcoin for customer payments. Importantly, the firm stated it would not immediately convert these crypto payments to fiat currency. Instead, management planned to hold them as a long-term strategic reserve on its balance sheet. Therefore, this latest direct market purchase of $10 million in BTC demonstrates a committed, multi-pronged approach to Bitcoin accumulation. Corporate treasury adoption of Bitcoin has evolved through distinct phases. First, pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla made headline-grabbing allocations. Subsequently, a second wave focused on payment integration and balance sheet hedging emerged. Steak ‘n Shake’s strategy uniquely combines both approaches. The company now sources Bitcoin directly from operational revenue and through deliberate treasury allocation. This dual-path method potentially mitigates price volatility risks associated with a single acquisition method. Analyzing the Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Timeline The journey of Bitcoin into corporate treasuries provides essential context for Steak ‘n Shake’s decision. Notably, MicroStrategy began its aggressive accumulation strategy in August 2020. Since then, dozens of publicly traded companies have followed, albeit with varying levels of commitment. For a traditional consumer brand like Steak ‘n Shake, this move signals a maturation of the thesis beyond the technology sector. Several key factors typically drive these corporate decisions: Inflation Hedging: Companies seek assets uncorrelated to traditional monetary policy. Long-Term Store of Value: Bitcoin’s finite supply contrasts with expansive fiat currency systems. Strategic Differentiation: Adoption can attract new customer demographics and signal innovation. Operational Integration: Using Bitcoin for payments tests future financial infrastructure. Steak ‘n Shake’s announcement explicitly connects its payment system to its treasury strategy. This creates a closed-loop ecosystem where cryptocurrency circulates within the brand’s economic sphere. Furthermore, holding customer-paid Bitcoin aligns corporate and customer interests in the asset’s long-term performance. Financial Implications and Balance Sheet Considerations From an accounting perspective, Steak ‘n Shake’s Bitcoin holdings introduce specific considerations. Under current U.S. accounting standards, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are typically classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. This classification requires impairment testing if the market price falls below the carrying value. However, upward revaluations are not recognized until the asset is sold. Therefore, the $10 million purchase will appear on the balance sheet at cost, subject to potential impairment charges. This accounting treatment creates a notable asymmetry. Significant price increases do not boost quarterly earnings, while declines can trigger impairment losses. Nevertheless, companies like MicroStrategy have maintained this approach, prioritizing long-term holding over short-term earnings impact. Steak ‘n Shake’s management appears to embrace a similar long-term horizon, viewing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve rather than a trading asset. The following table compares recent corporate Bitcoin purchases in the consumer sector: Company Sector Approximate BTC Purchase Announcement Date Stated Strategy Steak ‘n Shake Fast Food / Restaurants $10 Million April 2025 Treasury Reserve & Payment Acceptance A publicly traded gaming company (2024) Entertainment $25 Million Q3 2024 Inflation Hedge & Diversification A regional retail chain (2024) Consumer Retail $5 Million November 2024 Technology Investment & Brand Positioning Market Impact and Industry Reaction The announcement immediately generated discussion among financial analysts and industry observers. Many experts highlight the symbolic importance of a mainstream, legacy brand making such an allocation. While technology companies often lead innovation adoption, consumer-facing brands like Steak ‘n Shake operate closer to the everyday economy. Their embrace of Bitcoin potentially normalizes cryptocurrency for a broader audience. Market reaction also extends to Bitcoin’s perceived role as a corporate asset. Each public company addition to the Bitcoin treasury club adds validation to the underlying investment thesis. Moreover, it creates a growing cohort of businesses with aligned interests in the development of supportive regulation and infrastructure. This collective advocacy could influence future policy decisions regarding digital asset accounting, custody, and disclosure. However, critics consistently point to Bitcoin’s price volatility as a primary risk. Quarterly earnings could experience unnecessary volatility due to impairment charges. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty remains a concern for all corporations holding digital assets. Steak ‘n Shake’s management presumably conducted thorough risk assessment before proceeding. Their decision to proceed indicates a calculated acceptance of these risks in pursuit of potential long-term strategic benefits. The Practical Mechanics of Payment Integration Beyond the treasury purchase, the operational aspect of accepting Bitcoin payments presents its own challenges and opportunities. Steak ‘n Shake must implement a point-of-sale solution that can securely process Bitcoin transactions. This likely involves a partnership with a established cryptocurrency payment processor. These processors typically instantly convert the Bitcoin to fiat at the time of sale, shielding the merchant from price fluctuations during the transaction. Steak ‘n Shake’s model differs significantly. The company intends to retain the Bitcoin received. Therefore, it must manage private key security, a non-trivial operational responsibility. Best practices involve using qualified custodians or institutional-grade cold storage solutions. The company’s willingness to undertake this operational complexity underscores the strategic nature of its commitment. It is not merely a marketing gimmick but a foundational shift in how it views a portion of its assets. This approach could also influence customer behavior. Patrons who own Bitcoin might be incentivized to spend it at Steak ‘n Shake, knowing the company becomes a long-term holder alongside them. This creates a novel form of brand alignment and community. Furthermore, it introduces Bitcoin as a practical medium of exchange for a tangible good—a hamburger and milkshake—moving beyond abstract investment discussions. Conclusion Steak ‘n Shake’s $10 million Bitcoin purchase represents a consequential step in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency. By combining direct treasury allocation with a customer payment integration strategy, the company has crafted a multifaceted approach to Bitcoin exposure. This move provides real-world evidence of Bitcoin’s evolving role from speculative asset to potential corporate reserve asset. While risks related to volatility and regulation persist, Steak ‘n Shake’s decision reflects a growing trend among diverse businesses to explore digital assets as a component of long-term financial strategy. The success of this Steak ‘n Shake Bitcoin initiative will undoubtedly influence other consumer brands considering similar pathways into the digital economy. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin did Steak ‘n Shake purchase? Steak ‘n Shake purchased an additional $10 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This follows its earlier strategy to hold all Bitcoin received from customer payments. Q2: Why would a fast-food company buy Bitcoin? Companies like Steak ‘n Shake may allocate to Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve, a potential hedge against inflation, and to integrate innovative payment technologies that align with future financial systems. Q3: Can I pay for my meal at Steak ‘n Shake with Bitcoin? According to the company’s announcements, Steak ‘n Shake plans to accept Bitcoin for payments. The specific rollout timeline and store locations for this feature should be confirmed directly with the company. Q4: How does this purchase affect Steak ‘n Shake’s financial statements? Under current accounting rules, the Bitcoin will be held as an intangible asset on the balance sheet at its purchase cost. The company may need to record impairment charges if Bitcoin’s market value falls below its carrying value, but increases in value are not recorded until sale. Q5: Is this a common practice for restaurants? While a growing number of companies across sectors hold Bitcoin, it remains relatively uncommon for major fast-food chains. Steak ‘n Shake’s move places it among the early adopters in the restaurant industry exploring corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy.

57234583,658099,1768629603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57234583.jpeg,Belarus Opens Door To Crypto Banks With New Presidential Decree,https://bitcoinist.com/belarus-opens-door-to-crypto-banks-with-new-presidential-decree/,"Belarus took a major step on January 16, 2026, when President Aleksandr Lukashenko signed Decree No. 19 to set rules for so-called “cryptobanks.” The move creates a clear legal spot for companies that want to mix token services with classic banking and payment work. Decree Defines Cryptobanks And Rules According to the decree, a cryptobank is a joint-stock company that may carry out token operations alongside banking, payment and other financial services. Reports have disclosed that these firms must be residents of the Belarus High-Tech Park (HTP) and will be listed in a special register kept by the National Bank. The new document ties cryptobank status to HTP residency, which aims to concentrate activity inside a known tech zone. That requirement also means the HTP’s rules will play a role in daily oversight. Requirements For Market Entry Based on reports from regulators, cryptobanks will face dual supervision: oversight from both the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus and the HTP’s governing bodies. This twin structure is meant to let token services grow while keeping closer control of financial risks. Officials say cryptobanks will follow many of the rules that apply to non-bank credit and financial organizations, including standards for capital, risk controls and anti-money-laundering checks. That suggests applicants will need to show robust compliance systems before being accepted into the register. Belarus: Short-Term Business Plans National Bank officials said that the decree could be followed by real market steps fast. Aliaksandr Yahorau, the First Deputy Chairman of the National Bank, said Belarus could see its first operating cryptobank within six months after laws and rules are aligned. He added that cryptobanks may be able to issue loans secured by cryptocurrency, provide payment cards linked to crypto accounts, and allow self-employed people to receive salaries in tokens. What Comes Next For Belarus The decree builds on earlier efforts to attract tech and crypto business to Belarus, and it clearly signals a state interest in bringing token activity under formal control. The next steps will include drafting implementing rules, creating the special registry at the National Bank, and deciding capital and licensing thresholds for applicants.

This analysis provides a data-driven, long-term forecast for RNDR, examining the fundamental technological adoption, market dynamics, and macroeconomic factors that will shape its trajectory over the next six years. The decentralized GPU rendering marketplace has evolved from a niche solution to a vital infrastructure component for industries ranging from Hollywood visual effects to architectural visualization and artificial intelligence training. Render (RNDR) Price Prediction: Foundation and Market Context Launched by Jules Urbach’s OTOY in 2017, the Render Network fundamentally reimagines digital rendering. The platform connects users needing GPU power with providers who have idle capacity, creating a decentralized marketplace. Consequently, RNDR tokens facilitate all transactions on this peer-to-peer network. The network’s migration to the Solana blockchain in late 2023 marked a pivotal upgrade, drastically improving transaction speed and reducing costs. This technological shift provides essential infrastructure for scaling, a critical factor for any long-term RNDR price prediction. Market analysts from firms like Messari and CoinShares frequently highlight Render’s unique position at the intersection of blockchain and the high-growth digital creation economy. Current Adoption Metrics and Network Growth Render’s adoption provides concrete evidence of its utility. According to public network data, the platform has completed millions of rendering jobs for major studios and independent creators. Furthermore, partnerships with industry-standard software like OctaneRender create a powerful ecosystem lock-in. The network’s total value locked (TVL) and quarterly job volume serve as key performance indicators. These metrics, rather than pure speculation, form the basis for a rational RNDR price prediction. For instance, increased adoption by AI companies for model training could represent a new, massive addressable market beyond traditional media. Analyzing Key Drivers for RNDR’s 2026-2030 Trajectory Several interdependent factors will primarily determine the Render token’s price movement through the end of the decade. First, the exponential growth in demand for GPU compute, driven by AI, metaverse development, and high-fidelity rendering, creates a powerful tailwind. Second, the network’s ability to scale efficiently and maintain competitive pricing against centralized cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud is crucial. Third, broader cryptocurrency market cycles and regulatory developments for utility tokens will inevitably influence investor sentiment. Finally, the execution of the Render Network’s roadmap, including proposed features like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs, will impact its perceived future value. GPU Compute Demand: The global shortage of high-end GPUs and rising cloud costs benefit decentralized alternatives. Network Scalability: Solana’s infrastructure must support exponentially more transactions without congestion. Market Sentiment: RNDR remains correlated, though not perfectly, with major crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Roadmap Execution: Timely delivery of promised technical upgrades builds trust and utility. Render RNDR Price Prediction: Year-by-Year Forecast Model (2026-2030) The following table presents a scenario-based forecast model. It synthesizes historical volatility, projected network usage growth, and analyst consensus from institutional reports. Importantly, these figures represent potential ranges based on current data and should not be considered financial advice. They assume continued technological execution and no catastrophic regulatory intervention in the decentralized compute sector. Year Conservative Scenario Base Case Scenario Bullish Scenario Primary Catalyst 2026 $12 – $18 $18 – $28 $28 – $40 Mainstream AI studio adoption 2027 $20 – $30 $30 – $45 $45 – $65 Integration with major 3D software suites 2028 $35 – $50 $50 – $75 $75 – $110 Network effects and significant market share capture 2029 $50 – $70 $70 – $100 $100 – $150 Ubiquity in real-time rendering for immersive media 2030 $65 – $90 $90 – $130 $130 – $200+ Establishment as core Web3 infrastructure Expert Insights and Comparative Analysis Industry experts emphasize the total addressable market (TAM) as a core valuation metric. “The cloud rendering market alone is projected to exceed $20 billion by 2030,” notes a senior analyst from a fintech research firm. “Render’s model captures value from this and adjacent AI training markets.” Comparatively, other decentralized compute projects like Akash Network (AKT) operate in a broader cloud marketplace, while Render’s specialized focus provides deeper vertical integration. This specialization could command a premium valuation multiple if execution succeeds. Technical analysts also monitor on-chain data, such as token holder concentration and exchange flow, to gauge long-term investor conviction versus short-term trading activity. Potential Risks and Challenges to the Forecast Any long-term RNDR price prediction must acknowledge substantial risks. Technological competition is fierce, with both traditional cloud giants and new blockchain projects vying for market share. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding the classification of utility tokens persists in major economies like the United States and the European Union. Additionally, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency asset class means macroeconomic events, such as interest rate shifts or geopolitical tensions, can cause severe price dislocations unrelated to Render’s fundamentals. Finally, execution risk remains; any failure to scale the network or a critical security vulnerability could severely impact trust and token value. Conclusion This Render (RNDR) price prediction for 2026 through 2030 outlines a growth trajectory fundamentally tied to the network’s real-world utility and adoption. The expansion of the digital creation economy, coupled with rising demand for efficient GPU compute, positions RNDR as a potentially critical infrastructure token. While price targets provide a framework, the ultimate valuation will depend on the Render Network’s execution against its roadmap, its competitive positioning, and the broader maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Investors and observers should prioritize monitoring network usage metrics, partnership announcements, and technological milestones over short-term price fluctuations to assess the long-term health of the project. FAQs Q1: What is the main utility of the RNDR token? The RNDR token is the exclusive medium of exchange on the Render Network. Clients use it to pay for GPU rendering jobs, and node operators earn it for providing their spare computational power. It functions as a utility token within this specific ecosystem.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Have Made Profit Transactions To Exchanges In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the exchange deposit transactions of Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs). Related Reading: XRP In A ‘Super Cycle’? SuperTrend Suggests Another Story STHs include the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. They make up for one of the two main sides of the network divided on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as long-term holders (LTHs). Historically, the STH cohort has proven to represent the weak hands of the market, who easily react to market volatility. In contrast, LTHs include the diamond hands of the sector. Bitcoin has witnessed a recovery rally recently, so, considering the track record of STHs, some selling from them is likely to have occurred. One way to track distribution from the group is through its exchange inflow data. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the exchange deposit transactions that Bitcoin STHs have made over the last couple of months. In the graph, the STH exchange inflows are shown separately for profit and loss transactions, based on whether holders held an unrealized gain or loss before sending the tokens to exchanges. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 24-hour sum of the STH exchange deposit transactions in profit has shot up as the cryptocurrency has gone through its rally, reaching a high of 41,800 BTC. Meanwhile, loss exchange inflows have shrunken, falling to a low of 1,800 BTC. Thus, it would appear that selling focus from STHs has largely shifted to profit-taking. Though, while some STHs may be harvesting profits, the cohort has a whole is still in a state of net unrealized loss as Bitcoin is trading below the STH Realized Profit, as highlighted by the analyst in another X post. The “Realized Price” is an on-chain metric that measures the average cost basis of Bitcoin investors or addresses as a whole. The STH version specifically tracks the break-even level of the supply purchased within the past 155 days.

This transaction, occurring just nine hours before reporting, represents one of the most notable institutional acquisitions of 2025 and provides critical insights into evolving market dynamics. Furthermore, this purchase follows a pattern of accumulating behavior from similar addresses, suggesting a coordinated strategy rather than an isolated event. Bitmain ETH purchase reveals institutional accumulation pattern Blockchain analysts identified the transaction through on-chain tracking tools that monitor large wallet movements. The purchase occurred at approximately $3,270 per ETH, representing a slight premium to the market price at the time of execution. Consequently, this substantial acquisition immediately impacted market sentiment, with derivatives data showing increased bullish positioning following the news. Moreover, the transaction’s timing coincided with broader market consolidation, suggesting strategic accumulation during price stability periods. Lookonchain, the blockchain analytics platform that reported the transaction, has established credibility through accurate wallet identification methodologies. The firm correlates wallet activity with known exchange addresses and previous transaction patterns to establish probable ownership. Additionally, their reporting includes verification through multiple blockchain explorers, ensuring data accuracy before publication. This meticulous approach provides the transparency necessary for market participants to make informed decisions based on reliable information. Ethereum accumulation trends among institutional investors Institutional interest in Ethereum has accelerated throughout 2025, driven by several fundamental developments. The network’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus has reduced its environmental impact by approximately 99.95%, addressing previous concerns about energy consumption. Simultaneously, Ethereum’s scaling solutions have achieved significant adoption, with layer-2 networks now processing more transactions than the base chain. These technological advancements have created a compelling investment thesis for institutions seeking exposure to blockchain infrastructure with real-world utility. The cryptocurrency market has witnessed increasing institutional participation since 2023, with several notable trends emerging: Exchange-traded product growth: Global ETH ETP assets under management surpassed $45 billion in early 2025 Corporate treasury allocations: Multiple publicly traded companies added Ethereum to balance sheets following Bitcoin adoption Infrastructure investment: Venture capital flowing into Ethereum ecosystem projects exceeded $8 billion in 2024 Regulatory clarity: Improved framework definitions in major jurisdictions reduced institutional adoption barriers These developments collectively created an environment conducive to large-scale accumulation by sophisticated market participants. The Bitmain-linked transaction fits within this broader institutional narrative, representing continued confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition despite short-term market volatility. Historical context of Bitmain’s cryptocurrency involvement Bitmain Technologies, founded in 2013, initially gained prominence as the world’s largest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware. The company’s Antminer series dominated the Bitcoin mining industry for years, controlling significant market share. However, following Bitcoin’s 2020 halving and subsequent mining profitability challenges, Bitmain diversified its strategy. The company gradually increased its cryptocurrency treasury holdings while expanding into artificial intelligence chips and other semiconductor applications. Previous blockchain analysis reveals that addresses associated with Bitmain have accumulated cryptocurrencies systematically since 2022. The company’s investment strategy appears focused on established assets with clear utility cases, particularly those supporting the broader blockchain infrastructure ecosystem. Ethereum’s position as the primary platform for decentralized applications, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized finance makes it a natural allocation choice for technology-focused investors like Bitmain. Recent Large Ethereum Purchases by Institutional Entities Entity Date ETH Amount Approximate Value Source Exchange Bitmain-linked address March 2025 20,000 ETH $65.4 million Kraken European Asset Manager February 2025 15,000 ETH $48.1 million Coinbase Institutional Asian Technology Fund January 2025 12,500 ETH $39.5 million Binance US Family Office December 2024 8,000 ETH $24.8 million Gemini Market impact and analytical perspectives The immediate market response to the reported transaction included a 2.3% price increase in Ethereum over the following six hours, though broader market movements contributed to this movement. More significantly, options market data revealed increased demand for Ethereum call options with strike prices between $3,500 and $4,000 expiring in the second quarter of 2025. This derivatives activity suggests that sophisticated traders interpreted the Bitmain-linked purchase as a bullish signal for medium-term price appreciation. Market analysts emphasize that large purchases from identifiable entities often create positive sentiment cascades. Retail investors frequently monitor whale activity through blockchain explorers and analytics platforms, using this data to inform their own positioning decisions. Therefore, transparent reporting of institutional accumulation can create self-reinforcing bullish cycles, particularly when accompanied by supportive fundamental developments. However, analysts also caution against overinterpreting single transactions, noting that market dynamics remain influenced by macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments. Kraken’s role as the source exchange for this transaction highlights the platform’s continued importance for institutional cryptocurrency trading. The exchange has developed specialized services for large-volume traders, including over-the-counter desks with personalized liquidity solutions. These institutional offerings have positioned Kraken as a preferred venue for discreet large transactions, with the exchange reportedly handling over $12 billion in institutional volume during the first quarter of 2025 alone. Technical analysis of Ethereum’s current market position Ethereum’s technical chart structure presented an accumulation opportunity at the time of the Bitmain-linked purchase. The cryptocurrency had consolidated between $3,100 and $3,300 for approximately three weeks following a rally from January lows near $2,400. This consolidation represented a healthy pause within a broader uptrend, allowing the market to absorb previous gains while establishing support levels. Large buyers often target these consolidation phases to accumulate positions without significantly impacting prices through slippage. On-chain metrics provided additional context for the accumulation decision. Ethereum’s network realized profit/loss ratio had returned to neutral levels following a period of profit-taking in February. Meanwhile, the percentage of ETH supply in profit remained above 85%, indicating strong underlying holder confidence. These metrics, combined with reduced exchange balances and increasing staking participation, created favorable conditions for strategic accumulation by long-term oriented investors. Regulatory environment and institutional adoption The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency investments has evolved significantly since 2023, with clearer frameworks emerging in major jurisdictions. The United States approved multiple spot Ethereum exchange-traded products in late 2024, following the earlier approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Similarly, European Union markets implemented the comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, providing legal certainty for institutional participants. These regulatory advancements reduced compliance uncertainty for traditional financial entities considering cryptocurrency allocations. Institutional adoption typically follows a predictable pattern, beginning with treasury allocation and progressing to more sophisticated investment strategies. The Bitmain-linked Ethereum purchase represents a middle phase in this adoption curve, where technology companies with cryptocurrency expertise expand their strategic holdings. The next phase likely involves traditional asset managers and pension funds allocating to Ethereum through regulated vehicles, potentially creating additional demand pressure throughout 2025 and 2026. Industry experts note that institutional cryptocurrency investment decisions increasingly incorporate environmental, social, and governance considerations. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus directly addresses environmental concerns that previously limited institutional participation. The network’s energy consumption now compares favorably with traditional financial systems, with recent estimates suggesting the entire Ethereum network uses less electricity than the country of Uruguay. This environmental efficiency has become a significant factor in investment committee discussions at sustainability-focused institutions. Conclusion The Bitmain-linked address purchase of 20,000 ETH for $65.4 million represents a significant data point in cryptocurrency market analysis. This transaction highlights continued institutional confidence in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition and long-term growth potential. Furthermore, the purchase aligns with broader accumulation patterns among sophisticated investors throughout early 2025, suggesting coordinated positioning ahead of anticipated network developments and regulatory milestones. Market participants should monitor similar large transactions while maintaining perspective on the multifaceted factors influencing cryptocurrency valuations. The Bitmain ETH purchase ultimately reinforces Ethereum’s position as a core institutional allocation within diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. FAQs Q1: How do analysts link cryptocurrency addresses to specific companies like Bitmain? Blockchain analysts use multiple methodologies including transaction pattern analysis, exchange withdrawal tracking, and wallet clustering techniques. They correlate addresses with known company wallets through historical transactions, exchange interactions, and sometimes through unintentional disclosures in regulatory filings or corporate communications. Q2: Why would Bitmain purchase Ethereum rather than just mine it? While Bitmain manufactures mining hardware, Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022, eliminating traditional mining. Purchasing ETH directly provides exposure to the asset’s potential appreciation and allows participation in staking rewards, which currently offer approximately 3-4% annual yield on staked Ethereum. Q3: How significant is a $65.4 million purchase in the context of Ethereum’s total market? Ethereum’s market capitalization exceeded $400 billion in March 2025, making this purchase approximately 0.016% of total market value. While not market-moving by itself, such transactions signal institutional sentiment and often precede similar accumulation by other large investors. Q4: What risks do institutional investors consider when allocating to Ethereum? Primary considerations include regulatory uncertainty, technological execution risk (particularly regarding scaling solutions), competitive pressure from alternative smart contract platforms, market volatility, custody solutions, and the evolving staking economics following Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. Q5: How does this purchase affect ordinary Ethereum investors? While direct price impact is typically limited, institutional accumulation generally supports price stability and reduces volatility over time. Additionally, institutional participation often leads to improved infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and mainstream adoption, which can benefit all ecosystem participants through network effects and increased utility.

57234906,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262428,1768630511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Crypto Fraud: Devastating $13.8M Scheme Leads to Prison Sentences in Landmark Appeal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-crypto-fraud-sentencing-appeal/,"BitcoinWorld AI Crypto Fraud: Devastating $13.8M Scheme Leads to Prison Sentences in Landmark Appeal In a landmark ruling that underscores the escalating global crackdown on digital asset fraud, a South Korean appeals court has upheld prison sentences for perpetrators of a sophisticated $13.8 million AI crypto fraud. This decisive legal action, reported by Yonhap News, sends a powerful message to would-be scammers exploiting the convergence of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency markets. Anatomy of the $13.8M AI Crypto Fraud The convicted group orchestrated a complex scheme that defrauded investors of approximately 19 billion won. They specifically targeted individuals by promoting a seemingly revolutionary investment opportunity. The perpetrators claimed their proprietary AI-powered computer system could generate guaranteed, high-frequency profits. This system allegedly exploited minute price differences, known as arbitrage, between various global cryptocurrency exchanges. However, investigators later revealed the operation as a classic Ponzi structure. Consequently, the promised AI technology was either non-existent or grossly misrepresented. Early investors received payouts funded solely by capital from newer victims, creating a facade of legitimacy. This fraudulent activity continued until the scheme inevitably collapsed under its own weight, leaving numerous investors with significant losses. The Legal Reckoning and Appeal Process The initial trial resulted in convictions and prison terms for the key organizers. Following this, the defendants pursued an appeal, likely challenging the severity of their sentences or the specifics of the fraud charges. The appellate court’s recent decision to uphold and potentially reinforce the original sentences marks a critical juncture. This outcome demonstrates the judiciary’s growing sophistication in handling technologically complex financial crimes. Legal experts note that such cases often hinge on proving deliberate deception. Prosecutors successfully demonstrated that the group’s claims about their AI trading bot’s capabilities were knowingly false. Evidence presented included internal communications, financial audits tracing the flow of funds, and testimony from defrauded investors. The court’s firm stance in the appeal reinforces a zero-tolerance policy for fraud disguised as technological innovation. Expert Analysis: A Warning for the Crypto Industry Financial compliance analysts point to this case as a textbook example of “technobabble” fraud. Scammers increasingly use buzzwords like “AI,” “machine learning,” and “algorithmic trading” to lend credibility to otherwise unsustainable schemes. The promise of exploiting arbitrage is particularly seductive, as it suggests a low-risk, high-reward model. In reality, genuine arbitrage opportunities in mature crypto markets are fleeting and require immense capital and speed, not a secret bot sold to retail investors. This sentencing aligns with a broader international regulatory trend. Authorities worldwide are prioritizing investor protection in the digital asset space. Furthermore, the case highlights the importance of due diligence. Investors must scrutinize claims of guaranteed returns, especially when they involve opaque technology. Key Case Details: AI Crypto Fraud Sentencing Element Detail Total Fraud Value ~19 Billion KRW ($13.8 Million USD) Core Deceptive Promise AI-powered arbitrage trading bot Scheme Type Ponzi/Pyramid Structure Legal Stage Appeals Court Upholding Sentences Primary Impact Significant financial loss for investors Broader Impacts and Investor Lessons The repercussions of this fraud extend beyond the courtroom. Affected investors face a long and uncertain path to potential restitution. Moreover, such high-profile cases can erode public trust in legitimate AI and blockchain projects. They create regulatory headwinds for ethical startups operating in the fintech space. For individual investors, the case offers several crucial lessons: Scrutinize “Guaranteed” Returns: Promises of consistent, high profits with no risk are a universal red flag in investing. Understand the Technology: If you cannot understand how a proposed investment works, it is prudent to avoid it. Verify Licenses and Audits: Legitimate investment firms operate under regulatory oversight and undergo independent financial audits. Beware of Social Proof Manipulation: Scammers often fabricate testimonials and use pressure tactics to create false urgency. Regulators are increasingly leveraging technology themselves, using blockchain analytics tools to trace illicit fund flows. This technological arms race between fraudsters and authorities is intensifying globally. Conclusion The upheld prison sentences for this $13.8 million AI crypto fraud represent a significant victory for financial justice and a stern warning to the industry. This case perfectly illustrates how cutting-edge terminology can mask age-old fraudulent schemes. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, robust legal frameworks and informed investor vigilance remain the strongest defenses against such sophisticated deception. The finality of the appeal court’s decision underscores that exploiting technological hype for criminal gain carries severe and lasting consequences. FAQs Q1: What was the main promise used in this AI crypto fraud? The fraudsters claimed to have a proprietary artificial intelligence computer system that could generate risk-free profits by automatically exploiting price differences (arbitrage) between cryptocurrency exchanges. Q2: Why is an “arbitrage” promise common in crypto scams? Arbitrage sounds technically plausible and low-risk, making it an attractive hook. Scammers exploit the complexity of crypto markets to convince investors that a secret algorithm can consistently find these opportunities. Q3: What does the appeals court decision signify? The appeals court upholding the sentences strengthens the legal precedent for prosecuting complex, technology-based financial fraud. It signals that higher courts are backing stringent punishments for such crimes. Q4: How can investors avoid similar AI crypto fraud schemes? Investors should be extremely skeptical of guaranteed returns, research the team and technology behind any project, check for proper regulatory licenses, and remember that genuine AI trading tools are not sold as mass-market investment products. Q5: Are all AI-related cryptocurrency projects fraudulent? No. Many legitimate projects research AI applications in crypto, such as for market analysis or security. The key differentiators are transparency, realistic claims, regulatory compliance, and the absence of guaranteed profit promises.

According to the stablecoin issuer’s press statement published on Friday, Ripple University’s Blockchain Research Initiative is launching a University Digital Asset Xcelerator (UDAX) that promises to provide founders with hands-on technical support, direct mentorship, and access to capital networks. Ripple is adding its academic footprint through UBRI, the multi-year program based at UC Berkeley that has been contributing to blockchain research and talent. UDAX debuts after a six-week pilot cohort at Berkeley According to Ripple, the first iteration of UDAX launched in fall 2025 as a pilot cohort hosted at UC Berkeley. The program was a product of a collaboration between Ripple engineers and a multidisciplinary group of Berkeley faculty and lecturers. Over six intensive weeks, nine startups worked alongside mentors to develop their concepts into solutions for market deployment. The program began with a launch summit held in Berkeley, where founders were introduced to the XRP Ledger’s architecture and the Ripple ecosystem. It all concluded with a closing summit and demo day at Ripple’s San Francisco headquarters, featuring words of encouragement from Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and CTO Emeritus David Schwartz, placing the startups in front of XRP Ledger developers, Ripple executives, and representatives from 13 venture capital firms. One of the several startups involved in the program is WaveTip. This platform provides instant tips for Twitch streamers, which completed its transition to the XRP Ledger Mainnet during the accelerator and is now available through the Chrome Web Store. X-Card, another startup that converts physical collectibles into liquid digital assets, onboarded more than $1.5 million in inventory during the six-week period. The team also secured partnerships with merchant communities and thousands of collectors, according to program disclosures. UDAX helped BlockBima, which is developing automated climate-risk microinsurance products for vulnerable communities, triple its active user base. The teams worked with mentors, including Andrea Barrica, to sharpen their pitches enough that they could appeal to investors. Ripple reported that participating teams hit an average 67% increase in product maturity and a 92% average increase in fundraising confidence after the program. Moreover, the accelerator also supported institutional finance and cross-border capital flow projects like CRX Digital Assets, which used UDAX for exporting Brazilian credit products and increased its tokenized asset volume from $39 million to $58 million. Stablecoin-based financial services Blockroll launched stablecoin-backed virtual cards for African freelancers in global markets. “Blockroll will use RLUSD as the institutionally accepted stablecoins to streamline remittance settlements from Sub-Saharan Africa’s leading source, and enable financial access use cases such as stablecoin-backed debit cards that work globally.” Sadiq Isiaka, Blackroll, CEO commented. “This also unlocks world-class wealth-building opportunities for African users, including stablecoin yields and tokenized US stocks.” Other teams addressed infrastructure and compliance challenges. WellArrive refined its platform into a dual-sided marketplace model after working with legal and corporate affairs mentors. Spout finalized a complex equity tokenization model and secured meetings with venture capital firms, while Mintara Labs worked to validate its go-to-market strategy for crypto-bank insurance. UC Berkeley and Ripple’s partnership grows The California University, Berkeley’s College of Engineering announced the launch of a new Center for Digital Assets in conjunction with Ripple Labs last October, Cryptopolitan reported . At the time, UCB stated that the research center would be used to study how blockchain and digital twin technologies can capture, value, verify, and exchange physical assets in digital form. Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative contributed $1.3 million in Ripple USD, the company’s US dollar-backed stablecoin. A 2025 report from the International Data Corporation estimates that worldwide data volumes will reach 175 zettabytes, with some projections mentioning 181 zettabytes. “Digital content has been part of our human experience and economic systems for decades,” said Tarek Zohdi, associate dean for research at Berkeley Engineering and the center’s faculty director. “The overall mission of the center is to foster pioneering research, education, innovation, and entrepreneurship within the broader digital asset technology landscape.” UCB engineers are also studying the “twinning” of physical assets, making replicas that can be analyzed, tested, and assigned present and future value to be traded onchain.

This substantial liquidation event highlights the ongoing volatility in crypto derivatives markets, particularly affecting Bitcoin traders who faced the most severe losses. Market analysts immediately noted the disproportionate impact on long positions, suggesting a potential shift in short-term sentiment despite broader bullish trends. Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations: The 24-Hour Breakdown Perpetual futures contracts represent one of the most popular derivative instruments in cryptocurrency trading, allowing participants to speculate on price movements without expiration dates. These instruments typically use funding rates to maintain their price alignment with spot markets. Consequently, when prices move sharply against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses, triggering what traders commonly refer to as liquidations. The recent 24-hour liquidation data reveals distinct patterns across different assets. Bitcoin, as the market leader, naturally experienced the highest absolute liquidation volume. Meanwhile, Ethereum followed with significant but comparatively lower figures. Interestingly, RIVER displayed a contrasting pattern that warrants deeper examination. The following table summarizes the key liquidation metrics: Asset Total Liquidations Long Position % Short Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $41.59 million 89.52% 10.48% Ethereum (ETH) $18.95 million 73.11% 26.89% RIVER $9.15 million 43.09% 56.91% These figures demonstrate that Bitcoin and Ethereum traders predominantly faced losses on long positions during this period. Conversely, RIVER traders experienced more significant losses on short positions. This divergence suggests varying market dynamics and trader positioning across different cryptocurrency assets. Market observers typically interpret such data as indicators of local tops or bottoms, though correlation doesn’t imply causation. Bitcoin’s Dominant Liquidation Pattern Explained Bitcoin’s $41.59 million liquidation volume, with nearly 90% coming from long positions, represents a substantial market event. This pattern typically emerges during rapid price corrections after extended upward movements. Traders using excessive leverage on long positions become vulnerable when prices decline even modestly. Several factors potentially contributed to this scenario: Overleveraged bullish sentiment : Extended bullish periods often encourage traders to increase leverage Technical resistance levels : Bitcoin may have encountered strong selling pressure at key price points Macroeconomic triggers : Traditional market movements or regulatory announcements can cascade into crypto markets Funding rate adjustments : Extremely positive funding rates can precipitate long squeezes Historical data from previous market cycles shows similar liquidation clusters often precede consolidation periods. However, they don’t necessarily indicate trend reversals. The cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility means such events occur regularly, though the magnitude varies based on market conditions and overall leverage in the system. Expert Analysis: Understanding Liquidation Cascades Market structure experts emphasize that liquidation events rarely occur in isolation. Instead, they often create cascading effects through several mechanisms. First, large liquidations can create immediate selling pressure as exchanges close positions. Second, they trigger stop-loss orders from other traders. Third, they can influence market sentiment, prompting additional selling from risk-averse participants. Derivatives analysts note that the concentration of liquidations in long positions suggests the market was overly optimistic before the correction. This pattern aligns with traditional contrarian indicators that sometimes identify crowded trades. Nevertheless, experienced traders caution against overinterpreting single data points, recommending instead to examine liquidation patterns within broader market contexts including: Open interest changes across exchanges Funding rate histories and extremes Spot market volume and price action Options market positioning and implied volatility Ethereum and RIVER: Contrasting Market Dynamics Ethereum’s $18.95 million in liquidations followed Bitcoin’s pattern but with slightly less long dominance at 73.11%. This moderate percentage suggests Ethereum traders maintained somewhat more balanced positioning. The correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidations remains historically strong, though divergence occasionally occurs during ecosystem-specific developments. RIVER’s distinctive pattern, with 56.91% of liquidations coming from short positions, presents an intriguing counter-narrative. This suggests RIVER experienced what traders call a “short squeeze,” where rising prices force short sellers to cover positions, accelerating upward momentum. Several factors could explain this phenomenon: Positive project developments : Protocol upgrades or partnership announcements Relative outperformance : Capital rotation from larger to smaller cryptocurrencies Low liquidity environments : Smaller markets can experience exaggerated moves Technical breakout patterns : Price movements triggering algorithmic trading This divergence highlights the importance of analyzing each cryptocurrency’s unique ecosystem rather than assuming uniform market behavior. Different assets attract distinct trader demographics with varying risk appetites and strategies. The Broader Context: Crypto Derivatives Market Evolution The perpetual futures market has evolved significantly since its inception, growing into a multi-trillion dollar ecosystem. Several developments in 2024 and 2025 have shaped current market conditions: Increased institutional participation : Traditional finance entities now constitute approximately 35% of derivatives volume Enhanced risk management tools : Exchanges have implemented more sophisticated liquidation mechanisms to reduce cascade risks Regulatory clarity advancements : Several jurisdictions have established clearer frameworks for crypto derivatives Cross-margin and portfolio margin adoption : These features allow more efficient capital usage but can increase interconnected risks Market infrastructure improvements have generally reduced but not eliminated liquidation volatility. The fundamental nature of leveraged trading ensures that rapid price movements will continue triggering position closures. However, better risk management across the ecosystem has decreased the frequency of extreme multi-hundred million dollar liquidation events compared to previous cycles. Historical Perspective: Learning from Past Liquidation Events The cryptocurrency market has experienced numerous significant liquidation events throughout its history. The May 2021 downturn saw over $10 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Similarly, the November 2022 FTX collapse triggered approximately $3 billion in liquidations. These historical precedents provide valuable context for understanding current market dynamics. Comparative analysis reveals that while absolute liquidation volumes have increased with market growth, relative percentages of total open interest have generally decreased. This trend suggests improving risk management practices among traders and exchanges. Nevertheless, the psychological impact of liquidation events remains substantial, often creating temporary market dislocations that savvy traders can potentially exploit. Risk Management Strategies for Perpetual Futures Traders Professional traders employ numerous strategies to navigate liquidation risks in perpetual futures markets. These approaches have evolved through multiple market cycles: Position sizing discipline : Limiting leverage to manageable levels, typically below 5x for most professionals Diversification across exchanges : Spreading positions to mitigate platform-specific risks Active monitoring of funding rates : Avoiding positions during extreme positive or negative funding periods Using stop-loss orders strategically : Placing stops at logical technical levels rather than arbitrary percentages Hedging with options or spot positions : Creating balanced portfolios that withstand volatility Educational resources from major exchanges now emphasize these practices, contributing to gradually improving trader sophistication. However, the accessibility of high leverage continues attracting inexperienced participants who often bear the brunt of liquidation events. Conclusion The recent $69.69 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidations provides valuable insights into current market dynamics and trader positioning. Bitcoin’s overwhelming long liquidations suggest localized excessive optimism, while RIVER’s short-dominated liquidations indicate unique ecosystem dynamics. These crypto perpetual futures liquidations events, while substantial, represent normal market functioning within an evolving derivatives landscape. Market participants should interpret such data within broader contexts including technical analysis, fundamental developments, and macroeconomic factors. As the cryptocurrency market matures, liquidation patterns will continue offering important, though not definitive, signals about market sentiment and potential turning points. FAQs Q1: What causes liquidations in crypto perpetual futures? Exchanges automatically close leveraged positions when traders’ collateral falls below maintenance margins, preventing further losses. Rapid price movements trigger most liquidations. Q2: Why were Bitcoin liquidations mostly long positions? This pattern typically occurs during price corrections after bullish periods when overleveraged long positions become vulnerable to modest downside moves. Q3: How do RIVER’s liquidations differ from Bitcoin and Ethereum? RIVER experienced majority short liquidations (56.91%), suggesting a short squeeze where rising prices forced short sellers to cover positions. Q4: Are liquidation events predictors of market direction? While liquidation clusters sometimes coincide with local tops or bottoms, they aren’t reliable standalone predictors. Professionals analyze them alongside other indicators. Q5: How can traders reduce liquidation risks? Strategies include using lower leverage, diversifying across exchanges, monitoring funding rates, implementing stop-loss orders, and hedging with other instruments. Q6: Have liquidation mechanisms improved over time? Yes, exchanges have implemented better risk management including partial liquidations, bankruptcy fund protections, and more sophisticated price oracle systems.

According to aggregated metrics from the top three futures platforms by open interest, short positions currently maintain a slight but persistent edge over long positions, creating important implications for market structure and potential price movements in the coming trading sessions. Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Show Consistent Short Bias Over the past 24-hour period, comprehensive data analysis reveals a clear pattern across major cryptocurrency derivatives platforms. The aggregate long/short ratio for Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts stands at 49.13% long positions versus 50.87% short positions. This seemingly marginal difference actually represents significant capital allocation when considering the substantial open interest across these exchanges. Furthermore, the consistency of this pattern across multiple platforms suggests a coordinated market sentiment rather than exchange-specific anomalies. Market analysts typically monitor these ratios as sentiment indicators because perpetual futures represent leveraged positions that sophisticated traders utilize for directional bets. The current data indicates that professional traders, who predominantly use these instruments, exhibit slightly bearish expectations for Bitcoin’s near-term price trajectory. However, the narrow margin between long and short positions also suggests market uncertainty rather than strong conviction in either direction. Exchange-Specific Analysis Reveals Uniform Patterns Detailed examination of individual exchange data shows remarkably consistent patterns across all three major platforms. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, reports a ratio of 47.63% long positions to 52.37% short positions. Similarly, OKX displays 47.88% long versus 52.12% short, while Bybit shows 47.58% long compared to 52.42% short. This uniformity across geographically diverse platforms with different user bases indicates a global rather than regional sentiment pattern. The consistency becomes particularly noteworthy when considering the substantial open interest involved. According to recent market data, these three exchanges collectively represent over $15 billion in Bitcoin perpetual futures open interest. Consequently, even the slight percentage differences translate to hundreds of millions of dollars in directional bias. Market structure analysts emphasize that such uniform patterns across exchanges typically precede periods of increased volatility as opposing positions eventually require resolution. Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratios (24-Hour Data) Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 47.63% 52.37% Short +4.74% OKX 47.88% 52.12% Short +4.24% Bybit 47.58% 52.42% Short +4.84% Aggregate 49.13% 50.87% Short +1.74% Historical Context and Market Implications Current positioning data gains additional significance when examined against historical patterns. Throughout 2024 and early 2025, Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios have fluctuated between extreme bullish and bearish positioning, often preceding significant price movements. The current slight short bias follows a period of elevated long positioning that persisted through much of the previous quarter. Market historians note that similar transitions from net long to net short positioning have frequently preceded consolidation phases before directional moves. Several fundamental factors potentially contribute to the current sentiment. Institutional adoption continues expanding, with traditional finance entities increasingly participating in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Regulatory developments across major jurisdictions have created both opportunities and uncertainties for market participants. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions, including interest rate policies and inflation metrics, continue influencing cryptocurrency as an alternative asset class. These factors collectively create the backdrop against which traders position their perpetual futures contracts. Understanding Perpetual Futures Mechanics Bitcoin perpetual futures represent sophisticated financial instruments that differ significantly from traditional futures contracts. Unlike conventional futures with set expiration dates, perpetual contracts continue indefinitely, utilizing funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. This structure makes them particularly popular among active traders seeking continuous exposure without managing contract rollovers. The funding rate mechanism involves periodic payments between long and short position holders, creating additional dynamics that influence trader behavior and positioning. Key characteristics of perpetual futures include: No expiration dates enabling continuous position maintenance Funding rate payments every eight hours between counterparties High leverage availability up to 100x on some platforms Direct price correlation with underlying Bitcoin spot prices Liquidity provision through market makers and arbitrageurs These features make perpetual futures particularly sensitive to market sentiment shifts. The current slight short bias suggests traders anticipate potential downward pressure or at least limited upside in the near term. However, the narrow margin indicates uncertainty rather than strong conviction, potentially setting the stage for rapid sentiment shifts if market conditions change. Expert Analysis on Current Positioning Derivatives market specialists emphasize that current positioning represents typical market behavior during consolidation phases. According to institutional trading desk analysis, the slight short bias often develops when markets approach technical resistance levels or when uncertainty increases around macroeconomic events. The uniformity across exchanges particularly interests analysts because it suggests coordinated institutional behavior rather than retail trader sentiment. Historical data analysis reveals important patterns about similar positioning scenarios. During the past three years, slight short biases in perpetual futures have preceded both significant price declines and powerful rallies, depending on subsequent market catalysts. The current environment features several potential catalysts including regulatory decisions, institutional adoption announcements, and macroeconomic policy shifts. Consequently, traders appear positioned cautiously while awaiting clearer directional signals. Market Structure and Liquidity Considerations The current derivatives positioning occurs within a broader market structure context. Spot market volumes have remained relatively stable while derivatives open interest has gradually increased throughout 2025. This divergence suggests growing sophistication among market participants who increasingly utilize derivatives for hedging and speculation. The concentration of activity on three major exchanges reflects ongoing market consolidation as regulatory clarity drives volume toward compliant platforms. Liquidity metrics across these exchanges remain robust despite the slight positioning bias. Order book depth analysis shows sufficient liquidity for large position entries and exits without significant market impact. Funding rates have remained relatively neutral, indicating balanced interest between long and short positions despite the slight quantitative bias. This balanced funding environment reduces the cost of maintaining positions and encourages continued participation from market makers and institutional players. Market surveillance data indicates normal trading patterns without signs of excessive leverage or position concentration that might signal impending volatility events. Open interest distribution analysis reveals well-diversized positioning across various leverage levels rather than concentration at extreme multiples. This distribution suggests responsible risk management among participants rather than speculative excess that sometimes precedes sharp market movements. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Markets The cryptocurrency derivatives market continues evolving toward greater sophistication and correlation with traditional financial instruments. Current Bitcoin perpetual futures positioning shows similarities to traditional equity index futures during uncertain market periods. The slight short bias mirrors behavior often observed in S&P 500 futures when investors hedge against potential downside while maintaining core long exposure. Important distinctions remain, however, between cryptocurrency and traditional derivatives markets. Cryptocurrency markets operate continuously without traditional market hours, creating different dynamics around news events and position adjustments. Regulatory frameworks continue developing, creating additional considerations for institutional participants. Despite these differences, the maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives markets increasingly allows similar analytical approaches to those used in traditional finance. Risk Management Perspectives Professional trading firms emphasize disciplined risk management approaches given current market positioning. The slight short bias creates potential for rapid sentiment shifts if unexpected positive catalysts emerge. Consequently, risk managers recommend position sizing that accounts for potential volatility in either direction. Historical volatility metrics suggest typical daily ranges, but positioning data indicates potential for expanded movements if sentiment shifts decisively. Funding rate monitoring becomes particularly important in current conditions. Neutral to slightly negative funding rates reduce the cost of maintaining short positions but could quickly shift if long interest increases. Experienced traders typically monitor funding rates alongside positioning data to anticipate potential sentiment reversals. Current funding rate patterns show no extreme readings that might signal imminent positioning squeezes or forced liquidations. Conclusion Bitcoin perpetual futures data reveals a market in cautious equilibrium with a slight but consistent short bias across major exchanges. This positioning reflects professional trader sentiment during a period of market consolidation and uncertainty about near-term catalysts. The uniformity across exchanges suggests coordinated institutional behavior rather than fragmented retail sentiment. While the quantitative difference appears marginal, its consistency and the substantial capital involved make it significant for market structure analysis. Current conditions suggest continued range-bound trading potential until clearer directional catalysts emerge, though the slight positioning bias indicates professional expectations leaning toward limited near-term upside. Market participants should monitor these Bitcoin perpetual futures metrics alongside spot market developments and broader financial market conditions for comprehensive market assessment. FAQs Q1: What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? Bitcoin perpetual futures are derivative contracts that track Bitcoin’s price without expiration dates, using funding mechanisms to maintain alignment with spot prices. They allow continuous trading without contract rollovers. Q2: Why does the slight short bias matter if it’s only 1-2%? Even small percentage differences represent significant capital allocation given the billions in open interest. Consistent patterns across multiple exchanges also indicate coordinated market sentiment rather than random fluctuations. Q3: How do perpetual futures differ from regular futures contracts? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding rate payments between traders to maintain price correlation. Regular futures have set expiration dates requiring position rolling. Q4: What typically happens when perpetual futures show short bias? Historical patterns show varied outcomes. Sometimes short biases precede price declines, but they can also indicate hedging that precedes rallies. Context including funding rates and spot market conditions determines implications. Q5: How reliable are these ratios for predicting price movements? They indicate current sentiment rather than predict future prices. Extreme positioning often signals contrarian opportunities, while balanced positioning like current conditions suggests uncertainty and potential for volatility in either direction.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.3438 Market Cap $669.24M Trading Volume $72.85M Circulating Supply 1.944B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.3448 24-hour Low $0.3267 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.60% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3052 14-Day RSI 58.66 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.5304 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Buyers are cautious right now, but sellers are not in control yet. The $0.35–$0.36 area decides whether the price goes higher or pulls back. As long as the price stays above $0.316, the trend is still healthy. Optimism 1-day price chart As of January 17, OP is trading around $0.345, up roughly 1.3% on the session, after an aggressive expansion from the $0.31 region earlier this week. The price briefly pushed into the upper Bollinger zone near $0.368 and has since pulled back about 6–7% from that swing high, signaling profit-taking rather than outright trend failure. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView As long as price continues to rotate above the Bollinger mid-band near $0.316, the daily structure remains constructive. However, the slowing MACD momentum suggests upside continuation now needs fresh participation rather than volatility alone. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP is rebounding from the $0.325–$0.33 demand pocket and is now pressing into the Alligator cluster around $0.34–$0.345, a recovery of roughly 5% from the local dip. This reclaim improves short-term structure, but CMF staying negative and OBV still heavy show that buying pressure is tentative. The $0.35–$0.36 zone remains the key short-term ceiling; failure there likely sends price back toward $0.33, while acceptance above it would reopen the path to $0.38. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3474 SELL SMA 5 $0.3331 BUY SMA 10 $0.3175 BUY SMA 21 $0.3037 BUY SMA 50 $0.3052 BUY SMA 100 $0.3670 SELL SMA 200 $0.5304 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3250 BUY EMA 5 $0.3196 BUY EMA 10 $0.3079 BUY EMA 21 $0.2991 BUY EMA 50 $0.3214 BUY EMA 100 $0.3936 SELL EMA 200 $0.5355 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is transitioning from expansion into consolidation. Holding above $0.33 keeps the bias mildly bullish, but a clean push through $0.36 is required to restart momentum. Losing $0.316 would shift focus to a deeper corrective leg. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

In a detailed letter on January 15, 2026, addressed to SEC Chair Paul S. Atkins, Democratic lawmakers expressed deep concern about the agency’s recent decisions to dismiss, close, or put on hold more than a dozen high-profile crypto enforcement actions filed since early 2025. This development has prompted questions about the SEC’s commitment to protecting investors and enforcing securities laws in the digital asset space. Allegations of Enforcement Retreat and Political Influence The letter , authored by Representatives Maxine Waters, Brad Sherman, and Sean Casten, asserts that the SEC’s dismissal of over twelve major crypto cases, including those against Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, represents a dramatic shift away from robust enforcement. According to the lawmakers, in each of these matters,s the SEC had previously secured favorable court rulings or had established substantive allegations of regulatory violations, yet opted to walk away from litigation or agreed to dismiss enforcement actions on discretionary or procedural grounds. Within the text of the letter, the Democrats characterized the timing of these enforcement retreats as particularly troubling, given that many of the companies whose cases were dropped had made substantial political contributions to President Donald Trump’s campaign and inauguration events . The lawmakers stated that firms such as Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple , Robinhood, and Crypto.com each contributed significant sums in the context of these political activities, a pattern that, in their view, creates what they described as an inference of “pay-to-play” dynamics influencing regulatory outcomes. BREAKING: House Democrats just blasted SEC Chair Atkins in a scathing Jan 15, 2026 letter accusing the SEC of dropping 12+ major crypto cases (including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken… and Ripple!) since 2025 amid massive Trump donations & “pay-to-play” concerns. They demand… pic.twitter.com/PMtQYFUaqE — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) January 16, 2026 Focus on the Justin Sun Litigation The letter places particular emphasis on the SEC’s handling of its enforcement action against Justin Sun , the founder of the Tron Foundation. The SEC initially filed civil charges against Sun in 2023, alleging that he orchestrated unregistered securities offerings, manipulated trading volumes, and improperly promoted digital assets. In February 2025, the agency requested that a federal court stay the proceedings to explore a potential settlement, and that stay has remained in place for approximately eleven months. Democrats argue that the extended pause in the Sun case undermines confidence in the consistent application of securities laws. They contend that this situation sends a concerning signal to market participants about selective enforcement, particularly given Sun’s significant investments of tens of millions of dollars in crypto ventures linked to the Trump family and affiliates. The lawmakers called on the SEC either to lift the stay and pursue litigation consistent with the strength of its original complaint or to negotiate a settlement that adequately reflects the gravity of the alleged misconduct.

Lawmakers demanded documentation and communications relevant to the agency’s choices to dismiss or halt these cases, including any external contacts or influences that may have played a role. Their communication underscores a wider concern that inconsistent enforcement threatens investor protection and the credibility of the SEC’s regulatory mission. Stakes for Crypto Oversight The House Democrats’ letter represents a significant moment in the intersection of public policy, financial regulation, and digital asset markets. By challenging the SEC’s recent actions and calling for transparency and accountability, these lawmakers have signaled heightened legislative scrutiny of federal crypto enforcement practices and raised fundamental questions about the integrity of U.S. securities regulation in the digital era.

ChatGPT Analyzes the Most Recent Ripple Price Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-at-10-this-month-chatgpt-analyzes-the-most-recent-ripple-price-predictions/,"Given the sheer size of the XRP Army, it’s no wonder that the underlying asset is often the subject of some mind-blowing price predictions. In this article, we will review one of the latest, which represented a forecast of a double-digit price pump within the next couple of weeks. John Squire, among the most popular and vocal members of the XRP Army, posted a picture of the token and asked whether a $10 price tag is possible as early as this month. $10 XRP in January? From where we are standing, the answer is obvious. And it’s not good for the Ripple bulls. After all, the asset currently trades below $2.10, so it would require a nearly 400% surge within just 14 days to reach such a massive target. Given our pessimistic views, we decided to ask ChatGPT for its perspective to see if it’s more optimistic. Well, it wasn’t. Its short answer was, “extremely unlikely.” It noted that several things would need to happen simultaneously for such a far-fetched goal to be reached: A broad crypto market breakout led by Bitcoin Massive, sudden institutional inflows into XRP specifically A clear regulatory or adoption shock that redefines XRP’s valuation overnight. It admitted that none of those are currently in place. Additionally, even when XRP had posted some of its biggest rallies, it took months, not mere weeks. “Without an extraordinary black-swan catalyst, a $10 XRP this month falls firmly into the low-probability, hype-driven narrative category,” concluded the AI solution. $10 XRP in 2026? On the question of whether Ripple’s cross-border token can reach that same target at any point in 2026, ChatGPT said, “The conversation changes dramatically.” Although it still believes it’s more of a speculative goal, it noted that “it’s not impossible.” XRP would still need some major catalyst, including: Sustained institutional adoption of Ripple’s payment infrastructure Continued expansion of XRP’s role in cross-border settlements Favorable regulatory clarity in major markets A broader bull market that lifts larger-cap altcoins OpenAI’s platform concluded that, in such a strong macro and crypto environment, the asset’s more realistic target would be somewhere around $5-$7, with “$10 representing the upper extreme of a bull-case scenario, not the base expectation.” It believes the actual odds for going to the low double digits at any point in 2026 are around 20%.

Analyst Forecasts 1,250% Expansion",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-to-repeat-its-2017-playbook-analyst-forecasts-1250-expansion/,"While XRP retests a crucial support area, some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is preparing for a massive expansion in the coming months, as a potential trend reversal begins to form and its 2017 formula repeats. Related Reading: CME Group To Launch Cardano, Chainlink, Stellar Futures Amid Crypto Lineup Expansion – Details XRP Gears Up For Massive Expansion On Friday, XRP reached a 12-day low, falling to the $2.02 area before bouncing. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2.05-$2.35 area for nearly two weeks, moving between the mid and lower zones of this price range for most of this period. Amid its recent performance, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that the altcoin “is starting to look better, especially after that bullish market structure break with a fresh higher high.” The analyst highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been consistently trending lower since August, exclusively printing lower lows and lower highs. However, it has broken out of this structure and recorded a higher high for the first time in months after the start-of-the-year rally, setting the stage for a potential reversal. “Now, we have to maintain this bullish structure at any cost and form a higher low on the next dip,” Sjuul warned. Meanwhile, market observer ChartNerd pointed to a striking similarity between XRP’s 2017 playbook and its current performance. In an X post, the analyst affirmed that the altcoin is repeating its 2016-2017 formula, which led to a massive rally toward its previous all-time high (ATH). At the time, XRP saw a textbook multi-year symmetrical triangle formation breakout, followed by a multi-month ABC consolidation before its 1,500% mark-up. This time, the cryptocurrency has repeated a similar symmetrical triangle pattern breakout, and it is currently in Wave C of its ABC consolidation period. To the analyst, a deeper Wave C retracement is possible if the multi-month $1.80 support is lost. Nonetheless, he added that “cycle formula repetition signals XRP is gearing up for expansion towards $8/$13/$27,” which would be a 300%-1,250% increase from the current levels. Q1 Close To Define XRP’s Future Despite his bullish forecast, ChartNerd also shared an important warning for the next two months. According to the analyst, “XRP has just over 2 months to invalidate this 3M bearish Heikin-Ashi candle formation,” or it will risk a massive correction. In a video analysis, he explained that, in the past, whenever the altcoin saw massive rallies followed by a red bearish candle on the three-month timeframe, it would “normally indicate the start of a downtrend or a macro consolidation period.” In 2014, XRP saw a bearish candle print in the three-month timeframe after a remarkable pump, which was followed by a correction and consolidation “for quite a couple of years,” he explained. “The same happened again in 2018. We had this massive rally for XRP, and as soon as we printed a three-month bearish candle in the Heikin-Ashi Candle formation, (…) we entered into the bear market,” ChartNerd continued. Related Reading: Analyst Says It’s Time For Ethereum’s ‘Big Test’ – Is ETH Season Loading? Similarly, the cryptocurrency repeated the same performance in 2021. Now, XRP is starting to form a red candle in this timeframe and has approximately 2 months and 16 days to close the quarter on a positive note. “We have until March before this candle closes. (…) So, what we don’t want to see is this full-bodied three-month Heikin-Ashi Candle, because if we see it, this is where we are likely to see a deeper correction for the next six to nine and even 12 months,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.05, a 1.7% decline in the weekly timeframe.

57235899,658111,1768633234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57235899.jpeg,CRYPTO Act Proposal: Unlicensed Operations In New York Could Lead To 15 Years In Prison,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-act-unlicensed-operations-could-lead-prison/,"On Thursday, a new legislation was proposed in New York that aims to impose additional regulations on digital asset firms. The proposed law, known as the “CRYPTO” Act—short for “Cryptocurrency Regulation Yields Protections, Trust, and Oversight”—would make it illegal for digital asset firms to operate without the necessary licenses. The announcement came from Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Alvin L. Bragg, Jr., and New York State Senator Zellnor Myrie, who emphasized the urgency of regulating the cryptocurrency marketplace in the State. NY’s Proposed Crypto Bill According to the duo’s press statement , organizations that exchange, trade, or transport cryptocurrencies in New York are required to register for a virtual currency license. Failure to do so has resulted in merely civil sanctions. In contrast, the proposed CRYPTO Act would introduce criminal penalties for operating without a license, bringing New York’s regulatory framework closer to that of the federal system, where unauthorized conduct can result in up to five years in prison. The new Act aims to ensure that digital asset businesses adhere to the same levels of diligence and transparency as traditional money transmitters. Under the new legislation , unlicensed operations would fall under the category of Unlicensed Virtual Currency Business Activity, leading to a series of graduated penalties based on the value of the transactions involved. Offenders could face charges ranging from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class C felony for activities involving $1 million or more within a year, potentially resulting in sentences of 5 to 15 years in state prison. A “Shadow Financial System” District Attorney Bragg expressed concern about the growth of cryptocurrency, describing it as a “shadow financial system” that facilitates money laundering and other criminal activities. “Crypto is the go-to means for bad actors to move and hide the proceeds of crime,” he stated. Bragg further urged that the time has come for unlicensed cryptocurrency businesses to face criminal repercussions for not adhering to due diligence requirements. Senator Myrie echoed Bragg’s sentiments, noting, “As the use of crypto has grown, so has illicit activity.” He emphasized that New York, as a major financial hub, must take seriously its regulatory responsibilities. Myrie’s bill aims to align the state with the 18 other jurisdictions that have made unlicensed virtual currency transactions criminal offenses, to enhance consumer protection against potential fraud and scams. This legislative push coincides with a letter from House Democrats to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, in which several lawmakers urged the reinstatement of enforcement actions against digital asset firms. The letter sent on Thursday and signed by Representatives Maxine Waters, Sean Casten, and Brad Sherman, expressed deep concerns regarding the SEC’s recent retreat from prosecuting violations related to “digital asset securities.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|crypto|Crypto firms|crypto news|crypto regulation|cryptocurrencies|Cryptocurrency|DeFi|New York crypto|NEW York Crypto regulations|U.S. crypto firms,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 07:00:34

In his post, Bird conveyed that long-term supporters of XRP are worn down, suggesting that the prolonged period of limited price movement has taken an emotional toll on those who have remained committed over the years. While brief in form, his statement “We are tired, boss” reflected a sentiment that has persisted among holders who have endured multiple market cycles without the outcomes they once anticipated. The message did not focus on market metrics or technical analysis. Instead, it focused on emotional endurance, recognizing that maintaining patience through prolonged periods of stagnation can be mentally taxing. I think I speak for every single XRP holder when I say this: We are tired, boss. — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 15, 2026 A Response Highlighting Detachment and Emotional Discipline An X user known as The White Horse responded by offering a contrasting perspective. According to this view, exhaustion often results from constant attention to price movements and allowing investment performance to dominate daily life. The user suggested that emotional detachment is essential, arguing that long-term success in cryptocurrency markets depends on the ability to mentally step away after committing capital. From this standpoint, fatigue is avoidable if investors reduce their emotional exposure and adopt a passive, long-term approach. Bird Clarifies His Position as a Builder on the XRPL Bird replied by distinguishing between passive investors and those actively developing within the ecosystem. He explained that his own exhaustion stems from sustained effort rather than price observation. Bird stated that he is currently engaged in building a large-scale project on the XRP Ledger , dedicating extensive daily hours to its development. According to him, the fatigue he experiences is intentional and tied directly to a broader mission rather than market frustration. He emphasized discipline and consistency, noting that he has maintained this pace for more than a year without abandoning the underlying objective. Bird also pointed to the potential impact of the work, indicating that the project is designed to onboard hundreds of thousands of new users onto the XRPL, positioning his efforts as infrastructure-focused rather than speculative.

This user described holding XRP through multiple hype cycles and prolonged periods of minimal activity, noting that the experience gradually leads to exhaustion rather than frustration. The comment underscored that despite the fatigue, commitment remains intact. Together, these exchanges illustrate a divide within the XRP community between passive holders who manage emotional endurance and active builders who channel fatigue into development, both shaped by long-term involvement in the same ecosystem.

This pivotal moment, reported by CoinDesk in January 2025, illuminates a crucial crossroads where artificial intelligence development nearly intersected with blockchain fundraising at an unprecedented scale. The proposal emerged during cryptocurrency’s peak frenzy, offering a fascinating glimpse into alternative funding paths for transformative technologies. The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO Proposal Details Internal documents from January 2018 reveal specific parameters for the proposed OpenAI initial coin offering. Elon Musk and OpenAI founders discussed creating a token that would grant holders access to future AI services or computing resources. The $10 billion target would have dwarfed most traditional venture capital rounds, potentially distributing tokens to thousands of global investors. This approach mirrored contemporary blockchain projects that promised utility rather than equity. Historical context clarifies why this method gained consideration. The 2017-2018 period witnessed extraordinary ICO activity, with projects like Filecoin raising $257 million and Telegram securing $1.7 billion through private token sales. Regulatory frameworks remained ambiguous globally, creating a window for innovative fundraising. Meanwhile, OpenAI faced substantial computational costs for training advanced models, estimated at millions monthly for cloud infrastructure. 2018 Major ICO Comparisons Project Amount Raised Date Primary Focus Telegram $1.7B Feb-Mar 2018 Encrypted Messaging EOS $4.1B Jun 2018 Blockchain Platform Filecoin $257M Aug 2017 Decentralized Storage Proposed OpenAI ICO $10B (Target) Jan 2018 Artificial Intelligence Musk’s Rapid Reversal and Departure Elon Musk withdrew his support within weeks of the initial proposal. Multiple factors likely influenced this reversal. First, regulatory scrutiny intensified dramatically in early 2018 as the SEC began classifying certain tokens as securities. Second, Tesla’s own challenges demanded increased attention, particularly regarding Model 3 production and Autopilot development. Third, Musk expressed growing concerns about AI safety and commercialization timelines. His subsequent resignation from the OpenAI board in February 2018 created significant organizational shifts. Musk cited potential future conflicts with Tesla’s AI work as the primary reason. This departure occurred just as OpenAI transitioned from a non-profit to a “capped-profit” structure, a move that would eventually enable Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in 2019. The abandoned ICO proposal represents a road not taken in the organization’s funding evolution. Expert Analysis: The ICO Landscape in 2018 Blockchain analysts note the proposal’s timing coincided with peak ICO enthusiasm but increasing regulatory pressure. “The first quarter of 2018 saw both record fundraising and mounting SEC warnings,” explains Dr. Sarah Chen, cryptocurrency historian at Stanford University. “Projects began facing legal challenges for unregistered securities offerings, creating substantial risk for high-profile initiatives.” Several key developments shaped this period: Regulatory Shifts: The SEC’s DAO Report in July 2017 established that some tokens qualified as securities, followed by multiple enforcement actions in early 2018. Market Correction: Cryptocurrency valuations declined approximately 80% from January to December 2018, reducing investor appetite. Technical Limitations: Blockchain scalability issues became apparent, with networks struggling under transaction loads. Scam Proliferation: Numerous fraudulent ICOs damaged the mechanism’s reputation among serious investors. Alternative Funding Paths for AI Development The abandoned OpenAI ICO proposal highlights fundamental questions about financing transformative technologies. Traditional venture capital, while substantial, often imposes different constraints and expectations than token-based fundraising. ICOs theoretically enable broader participation and align incentives through utility tokens rather than equity. However, they also introduce regulatory complexity and market volatility. OpenAI ultimately pursued hybrid funding approaches. The organization secured: $1 billion from Microsoft in 2019 Additional funding through strategic partnerships Revenue from API access to models like GPT-3 Investment from venture firms like Khosla Ventures This diversified strategy contrasts sharply with the single massive ICO initially contemplated. Each approach carries distinct advantages regarding control, regulatory exposure, and community building. The ICO model might have created a decentralized ecosystem of developers and users invested in the platform’s success through token ownership. The Tesla AI Priority Shift Elon Musk’s redirected focus toward Tesla’s artificial intelligence initiatives proved prescient. Tesla began developing custom AI chips in 2018, leading to the Full Self-Driving computer’s 2019 deployment. The company’s Dojo supercomputer project, announced in 2021, represents another massive AI infrastructure investment. These parallel developments suggest Musk channeled his AI ambitions toward vertically integrated applications rather than general research platforms. Financial analysts note Tesla’s market capitalization grew from approximately $60 billion in early 2018 to over $800 billion by 2025. This valuation increase provided resources far exceeding the proposed ICO’s $10 billion target. However, the funding mechanisms differ fundamentally—public market equity versus token sales—with implications for investor rights, liquidity, and regulatory oversight. Historical Significance and Modern Parallels The revealed OpenAI ICO discussions gain new relevance amid 2025’s AI and blockchain convergence. Modern decentralized AI projects like Bittensor and SingularityNET employ token-based models for coordinating distributed computation. These initiatives face similar questions about governance, incentive alignment, and regulatory compliance that the 2018 proposal encountered. Several key differences distinguish current approaches: Enhanced Regulation: Clearer frameworks exist for security versus utility token classification Technical Maturity: Layer-2 solutions and specialized blockchains improve scalability Market Sophistication: Investors better understand token economics and risks AI Progress: Proven commercial applications increase token utility potential The proposal’s $10 billion scale remains extraordinary by contemporary standards. For comparison, the largest cryptocurrency venture rounds in 2024 reached approximately $500 million. This magnitude reflects both the period’s exuberance and AI infrastructure’s substantial capital requirements. Training advanced models like GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million, with future generations requiring exponentially more resources. Conclusion The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO proposal represents a fascinating historical footnote with enduring implications. This $10 billion fundraising plan, briefly supported then abandoned, highlights critical moments in both artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency evolution. The decision to pursue traditional investment instead shaped OpenAI’s development path and governance structure significantly. Meanwhile, Musk’s redirected focus toward Tesla’s AI ambitions produced substantial autonomous driving advancements. As AI and blockchain technologies continue converging, this revealed proposal offers valuable perspective on funding mechanisms for transformative technologies. The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO consideration ultimately demonstrates how financing choices can redirect technological trajectories in profound ways. FAQs Q1: What was the proposed purpose of the OpenAI ICO tokens? The documents suggest tokens would provide access to future AI services or computing resources, creating a utility-based ecosystem rather than equity ownership. Q2: Why did Elon Musk withdraw support for the ICO? Multiple factors likely contributed, including increasing regulatory scrutiny of token sales, Tesla’s growing AI priorities, and concerns about AI safety and commercialization timelines. Q3: How does this proposal compare to modern AI crypto projects? Current decentralized AI initiatives employ more sophisticated token economics and operate under clearer regulatory frameworks, but share similar goals of democratizing access and aligning incentives. Q4: What fundraising path did OpenAI ultimately pursue? The organization secured traditional venture funding, including Microsoft’s $1 billion investment, alongside revenue from API access and strategic partnerships. Q5: How might AI development differ if the ICO had proceeded? A token-based model might have created more decentralized governance and broader community participation, potentially accelerating certain applications while introducing different regulatory challenges.

In the meantime, the firm has also filed a notice to postpone the court order requiring it to share its data with rival firms as a remedy for its illegal monopoly. Alphabet’s owned search engine firm filed the appeal on Friday alongside the request to pend the implementation of the remedies to reduce its competitiveness against other search engine firms. The U.S. Court of Appeals is likely to hear the case, which, based on statistics, may take about a year to issue a decision after the appeal notice. This means if the appeal goes through, Google still has about a year to continue its operations without sharing data with rival firms. Google asks a U.S. Court Judge to postpone the ruling to share data with rivals U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled in 2024 that Google used unlawful tactics to maintain a monopoly against other search engine firms in the online search and advertising business. The case was first filed in 2020 during Trump’s first term before entering trial in the fall of 2023. According to Mehta’s ruling , Google signed deals with smartphone companies, including Samsung Electronics Inc. and Apple Inc., to make Google’s search engine the default. The search engine firm pays roughly $20 billion for those deals, which denied other companies key distribution channels. The U.S. Justice Department filed to sell Google’s Chrome browser, a move Judge Mehta rejected in a second trial held last year. Instead, Mehta ruled that Google must continue to pay for its search engine and AI apps to be the default on its smartphone partners, but with the condition that the deals be rebid annually to allow its competitors an equal opportunity to compete. Additionally, Google was asked to share its company data with rivals. According to a Cryptopolitan report , the U.S. District Court ordered the firm to begin sharing specific data with its rivals, excluding exclusive deals that secure its default status on devices. The ruling meant that competitors, especially AI companies developing their own search engines, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, may directly benefit from Google’s market insights. Mulholland says the Court ignored the fact that people use Google willingly Google confirmed that it’s prepared to do everything in its power to overturn the ruling that would require it to share its trade secrets while the appeal is pending. The firm believes that the remedies imposed by the court were unwarranted and should never have been imposed in the first place. As of now, the U.S. Justice Department and other complainants have until February 3 to appeal Mehta’s ruling, which rejected strong remedies such as the sale of its Chrome browser and its Android partnerships. “As we have long said, the Court’s August 2024 ruling ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they’re forced to. The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded startups.” Lee-Anne Mulholland , Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs According to Mulholland, Mehta’s ruling discounted compelling testimony from browser makers like Apple and Mozilla, who confirmed that they chose to feature the Alphabet firm because it provides the highest quality search experience for its consumers. Alphabet’s stock price has dropped 1% following the announcement, trading at $330.34 at the time of publication. The stock has also recorded an approximately 78% increase since July, with the acceleration in September following the ruling, and investors hope that the firm will take the lead in the AI search business.

Large caps are still taking over headlines, but the most powerful multipliers may be those that are represented by new assets entering the market with actual utility and real adoption strategies. Mutuum Finance is one of the names that have been building momentum within this category, as the lending protocol is on the verge of unlocking the main milestones of the roadmap that may change the perception of value attributed to it in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol, which will enable users to provide and borrow crypto assets with the help of smart contracts. Suppliers will receive interest and get a yield and deposit-value-tracked mtTokens once live. Passive income is generated in this system without the necessity to source individual borrowers. To provide a basic example, when a user transacts ETH worth of $1,200 at an APY of 4%, their mtTokens would start to increase gradually with time as borrowers are paying interest to the pool. This is in line with the operation of major DeFi money markets in previous cycles. Mutuum Finance will as well facilitate isolated borrowing of assets which should be under closer control. In this case, users put collateral and draw loans using Loan to Value regulations. When a borrower pledges a collateral of $1000 with an LTV of 70%, he will be able to access up to 700 dollars of borrowed assets. The liquidators will intervene at unsafe situations in the sense they will repay part of the debt and purchase the collateral at a discount. This solvency is maintained in the system in times of volatility and is a common provision in advanced lending procedures. Allocation and Market Supply Mutuum Finance did not make an individual open sale. Rather, the token has gone through pricing phases where each stage has a fixed allocation. It is tailored to incentivize early involvement and replicate the manner in which a number of past DeFi releases distributed tokens. The project has already collected over $19.7 million and currently has over 18,800 holders all over the world. 1.82 billion tokens out of the 4 billion total supply are distributed to the presale. A strong percentage of that allocation has already been bought. At Phases 7, MUTM is being sold at $0.04. It started at 0.01 in the first stage and this implies that the early entrants are already enjoying about 300% MUTM appreciation. The subsequent pricing round is already announced, and will subsequently make the token price rise again upon the filling of the remaining allocation. In order to maintain the activity on engagement, the project will have a leaderboard that awards the highest daily purchaser with $500 in MUTM. Card payments are also enabled, and this increases its participation with other wallet users. According to analysts, these two characteristics have produced demand in the mid and late stages of the offering. Roadmap Catalysts As per the official X version, the V1 protocol is about to be ready to deploy testnet before the mainnet activation. It is interesting since lending platforms tend to reprice in instances where usage is evident. Traders have real measures to value rather than by speculation alone through borrowing, liquidation and revenue data. Security preparation has not been left out of the rollout. The V1 code has been audited by Halborn Security and the MUTM token has been given a score of 90 out of 100 by the token scan of CertiK. Bug bounty There is an active bug bounty of $50,000 to discover bugs before mainnet. There is a range of analysts who model the conservative valuation between $0.18 and 0.24 within the first post-launch window. At the current level of $0.04, that would represent about 350 percent to 500 percent growth should things work out. These estimates do not represent guarantees, yet they demonstrate the reason why focus has turned to the new crypto assets whose utility is less than 0.05. The important borrowing assets will be stablecoins. They enable the borrowing of funds against security without creating volatility in price in repaying them. Mutuum Finance intends to support Layer 2 networks as well to lower the liquidation cost and accelerate the speed of execution. These elements are identified by analysts as the scalability required in the long term in the DeFi crypto sector. As V1 approaches and as supply continues to tighten, Mutuum Finance is emerging as one of the best crypto under $0.05 to buy in case of those looking to buy utility and roadmap execution over hype.

The systemic importance of bank-funded lending makes stablecoin yield a likely compromise point in order to secure passage of the broader framework. Elon Musk’s X has banned InfoFi apps that pay users to post in an effort to curb AI-driven spam and low-quality engagement, showing growing backlash against attention-based crypto incentives that have distorted online discussion. Vitalik Buterin argues that decentralized stablecoins remain fundamentally fragile due to dollar dependence, oracle vulnerabilities, and staking-related risks, while we think that decentralized models are unlikely to achieve adoption and that stablecoins should instead remain U.S. dollar–pegged. This week’s newsletter examines the growing frictions in the industry, from the stalling of U.S. market structure legislation amid clashes over stablecoin yield, to Elon Musk’s X cracking down on InfoFi-driven attention farming, and Vitalik Buterin’s critique of decentralized stablecoins. Market Structure Bill Halts as Banks & Crypto Clash Over Yield The U.S. Senate Banking Committee has cancelled the scheduled markup of crypto market structure bill this week due to the growing fractures in negotiations among lawmakers, regulators, and industry groups. At the center of the debate is a fierce lobbying battle between the banking industry and the crypto sector. Banks argue that stablecoin rewards and yield programs siphon deposits away from the banking system, undermining the funding base that supports lending. Crypto firms counter this, claiming stablecoins are not deposits; rewards are not interest paid by issuers. The latest draft of the crypto market structure bill walks back earlier expectations by restricting stablecoin rewards when tokens are passively held in a way that resembles a saving account, while still allowing rewards tied to activity and transaction. Regarding the timeline, the Senate Banking Committee is set to consider amendments and hold a markup vote, while the Senate Agriculture Committee has postponed its own markup until later this month. After both committees advance their versions, the bill must be reconciled into a single Senate package before a full floor vote. Key Take The Market Structure Bill is the most important policy advance to watch this year, as it will draw clearer lines between the SEC and CFTC around when a digital asset is treated as a security or a commodity and how assets can evolve from security to commodity. It also builds on the GENIUS Act, sets rules about issuance, custody, and rewards, leading to the battle between banks and crypto. The criteria used to determine whether a token is treated as a commodity or a security will have direct market consequences. Tokens that qualify as commodities are likely to benefit from simpler regulatory treatment, while security tokens would face much higher compliance burdens. For the debate whether stablecoins can offer yield, it touches a foundational layer of the current financial system. Bank lending remains a primary source of funding for the whole economy, and lending is funded by deposits. If stablecoins meaningfully divert deposits away, it could hamper a bank's ability to extend credit. Therefore, the crypto sector is likely to compromise on the stablecoin yield in order to get the bill passed. Elon Musk’s X Bans InfoFi Apps That Pay Users to Post Elon Musk's X cracks down on so-called ""InfoFi"" projects, which monetize user attention through digital assets. X has announced that API access is revoked for applications that reward users for posting on the platform. X's Head of Product, Nikita Bier, said the decision is intended to curb AI-generated spam and low-quality engagement, which has flooded the platform with repetitive and inorganic content. InfoFi, short for Information Finance, gained popularity in 2024-2025, focusing on monetizing information and user attention through crypto mechanisms. Early adopters viewed it positively; it provided income opportunities for content creators and offered projects an efficient way to build awareness without relying on traditional KOLs. However, by mid-2025, there is growing criticism regarding InfoFi due to an explosion of low-quality, AI-generated content, to game the mechanism rather than provide real value. The move led to an immediate market impact. Kaito, one of the largest InfoFi projects, which tokenizes user engagement through its ""Yaps"" scoring system, saw its token fall more than 15% after the announcement. Key Take InfoFi has increasingly distorted crypto content by incentivizing attention farming, spam, and AI-generated content, bringing negative impact to information quality and credibility across social platforms, and at the same time reinforcing negative external perception of the crypto industry. This week's featured chart below showed the declining social metric across X and YouTube. While part of the slowdown reflects a lack of compelling industry narratives, the proliferation of low-quality content has also discouraged users from engaging with crypto-related discussions. Another reason for declining content quality on crypto Twitter is the shift in crypto's growth narrative from speculative, high-upside opportunities to stablecoins, tokenized assets, and financial infrastructure. While these areas have real potential to revolutionize the current financial system, they offer little excitement to retail participants. Vitalik Buterin’s Critique of Decentralized Stablecoin Design Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that the crypto industry has yet to resolve several foundational flaws in how to design decentralized stablecoins, arguing that many existing models depend on fragile assumptions that may fail in the long run. Buterin identified three core problems. First, he questioned the reliance on the U.S. Dollar as a reference asset, stating stablecoin should not be tied to a single national currency. Secondly, he pointed to Oracle dependence as a major vulnerability. Because decentralized systems rely on external data feeds for pricing, oracle feeds could be manipulated. Decentralized stablecoins protocols often rely on economic design to defend against these kinds of attacks by making attacks prohibitively expensive through fees or inflation. The third issue involves staking-backed collateral. When staked ETH is used as collateral for stablecoins, the staking yield needs to compete with returns users could get in other places, and slashing risk can erode collateral value. Key Take There are few novel decentralized stablecoins emerging in this cycle. The only example is Ethena's USDe, but it does not fully meet the criteria for decentralization, as its mechanism relies on a delta-neutral strategy executing on centralized exchanges to maintain stability. Contrary to Vitalik Buterin’s view, we believe stablecoins should remain pegged to a national currency, particularly the U.S. dollar. As a medium of exchange, a stablecoin’s primary function is transactional utility, not maintain purchasing power, and the U.S. dollar remains the dominant unit of account for global trade and everyday economic activity. A stablecoin pegged to an index or some other reference point will not gain mainstream adoption. We also do not expect a truly decentralized stablecoin to ever work, or even if it appears to work, it will not achieve real adoption, particularly as the regulatory environment becomes increasingly central, where regulators around the world recognize and legitimize only centralized, issuer-backed stablecoins. A decentralized stablecoin has to rely on some kind of mechanism, and this mechanism is often complex, where no regulators can confidently assess whether it is safe and stable in any market situation. Weekly Market Chart: Social Metrics as Leading Indicators Social metrics are a critical indicator category for the crypto industry, as they capture retail engagement and narrative momentum. Since mid-2025, social activity across YouTube and X, the two most important platforms for crypto, has been on a clear downward trend per data from The Block, suggesting weakening attention. More broadly, this reflects a shift in investor focus away from crypto toward other asset classes, particularly precious metals and technology firms, which have continued to grind higher and absorb attention. The deterioration in social engagement well ahead of the market peak in Q4 demonstrates the role of social metrics as leading indicators. As such, continued weakness in these indicators suggests limited upside momentum, while a reversal in social engagement would likely be an early signal of renewed market sentiment and a potential market rebound.

This development, announced on March 15, 2025, from the company’s San Francisco headquarters, represents the exchange’s ongoing commitment to diversifying its cryptocurrency portfolio while maintaining rigorous compliance standards that have become increasingly important in the evolving regulatory landscape of digital finance. Understanding Coinbase’s Listing Roadmap Strategy Coinbase introduced its public listing roadmap in 2022 as a transparency initiative. This forward-looking document provides the cryptocurrency community with advance notice about digital assets under consideration for potential listing. Importantly, inclusion on the roadmap does not guarantee eventual listing. The exchange must complete comprehensive technical, security, and compliance reviews first. This process typically involves multiple stages of evaluation. The company examines factors including blockchain security, regulatory compliance, and market demand. Furthermore, the exchange assesses project team background and token distribution methodology. This systematic approach has become increasingly important as regulatory scrutiny intensifies globally. The roadmap serves several crucial functions for market participants. First, it provides early visibility into the exchange’s strategic direction. Second, it allows projects to prepare necessary documentation and technical requirements. Third, it enables investors to conduct preliminary research on emerging assets. Fourth, it demonstrates Coinbase’s commitment to transparent operations. The exchange has listed over 250 assets since its inception. However, the selection process has become more rigorous following increased regulatory guidance from agencies including the SEC and global financial authorities. The Technical Evaluation Framework Coinbase employs a multi-stage technical evaluation for all potential listings. The process begins with initial screening against the exchange’s Digital Asset Framework. This framework evaluates several critical dimensions. Security assessment examines blockchain consensus mechanisms and network resilience. Compliance review analyzes regulatory alignment across multiple jurisdictions. Market structure evaluation considers liquidity and trading dynamics. Project evaluation assesses team expertise and development roadmap. Finally, the exchange considers broader ecosystem impact and innovation potential. Only assets passing all evaluation stages proceed to listing consideration. SKR Token: Background and Market Context The SKR token represents the native cryptocurrency of the Sekuritance platform, a regulatory technology provider focusing on compliance solutions for blockchain businesses. Founded in 2021, Sekuritance developed a comprehensive regtech ecosystem. This ecosystem addresses critical compliance challenges in cryptocurrency operations. The platform offers automated KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) solutions. Additionally, it provides transaction monitoring and regulatory reporting tools. The SKR token facilitates access to these compliance services. Token holders can utilize SKR for platform fee payments and service subscriptions. Sekuritance has established partnerships with several financial institutions. The platform currently serves clients across Europe and Asia. The project completed a successful initial exchange offering in 2021. Since then, the development team has consistently delivered platform upgrades. The most recent update introduced enhanced transaction screening capabilities. This improvement addresses evolving regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions. Market analysts note the project’s focus on compliance aligns with broader industry trends. Regulatory technology solutions have gained significant importance following increased oversight of cryptocurrency markets. The following table outlines key SKR token metrics based on available public data: Metric Detail Blockchain Platform Ethereum (ERC-20) Total Supply 500,000,000 SKR Current Circulation Approximately 350,000,000 SKR Primary Use Case Regulatory compliance service payments Notable Feature Integrated with multiple compliance APIs FIGHT Token: Gaming and NFT Integration The FIGHT token serves as the utility cryptocurrency for the Crypto Fight Club ecosystem, a blockchain-based gaming platform combining non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with competitive gaming mechanics. Launched in 2022, Crypto Fight Club developed a play-to-earn fighting game. This game allows players to collect, train, and battle digital fighter NFTs. The FIGHT token functions as the primary in-game currency. Players earn tokens through competitive victories and tournament participation. Additionally, token holders can stake FIGHT for governance rights and platform rewards. The gaming platform has demonstrated consistent growth since its initial release. Active user counts increased by approximately 300% throughout 2024. The development team recently announced partnership agreements with several esports organizations. These partnerships will facilitate competitive tournament series beginning in late 2025. Industry observers note the project’s alignment with growing interest in blockchain gaming. The global blockchain gaming market is projected to exceed $65 billion by 2027 according to recent industry reports. Crypto Fight Club distinguishes itself through several innovative features: Cross-platform compatibility: The game supports mobile and desktop play Interoperable NFTs: Fighter characters function across multiple gaming environments Sustainable tokenomics: The ecosystem implements controlled inflation mechanisms Community governance: Token holders participate in development decisions Competitive infrastructure: The platform supports ranked matches and tournaments Market Impact and Trading Considerations Historical data indicates that Coinbase roadmap announcements frequently influence market dynamics. Assets added to the roadmap typically experience increased trading volume on existing platforms. This volume increase often precedes formal listing decisions. However, market analysts caution against assuming automatic listing outcomes. Several assets have remained on the roadmap for extended periods without progressing to full listing. Investors should conduct independent research before making trading decisions. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile despite increasing institutional participation. Regulatory Compliance and Listing Implications Coinbase operates within an increasingly complex regulatory environment. The exchange must navigate requirements from multiple jurisdictions simultaneously. United States regulations require particular attention following recent SEC guidance. The exchange has developed sophisticated compliance protocols to address these challenges. Each potential listing undergoes rigorous legal analysis. This analysis examines securities law considerations and consumer protection requirements. Additionally, the exchange evaluates anti-money laundering compliance and sanctions screening capabilities. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency exchanges evolved significantly throughout 2024. Several jurisdictions implemented comprehensive digital asset frameworks. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation took full effect in December 2024. This regulation establishes harmonized rules across EU member states. Similarly, the United Kingdom implemented its cryptoasset regulatory regime in early 2025. These developments have increased compliance requirements for all market participants. Exchanges must demonstrate robust compliance programs to maintain operating licenses. Coinbase’s listing decisions reflect this regulatory reality. The exchange prioritizes assets with clear compliance characteristics. Projects demonstrating regulatory awareness receive particular consideration. This approach aligns with the exchange’s long-term strategy. Coinbase aims to establish cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Regulatory compliance represents a fundamental component of this objective. Market observers note the exchange’s careful balance between innovation and compliance. This balance has become increasingly important as regulatory scrutiny intensifies globally. Broader Market Context and Industry Trends The cryptocurrency exchange landscape continues evolving rapidly throughout 2025. Several trends are shaping market development and platform strategies. Institutional participation has increased significantly following regulatory clarity. Traditional financial institutions are allocating more resources to digital assets. This institutional interest has elevated compliance standards across the industry. Exchanges must demonstrate robust security and regulatory adherence. Additionally, technological innovation continues driving platform development. Layer 2 scaling solutions and cross-chain interoperability have gained prominence. Consumer preferences are also influencing exchange offerings. Demand for diverse asset selection has increased substantially. Investors seek exposure to various cryptocurrency sectors. These sectors include decentralized finance, gaming, and infrastructure projects. Exchanges are responding by expanding their available trading pairs. However, this expansion occurs within regulatory boundaries. The industry has matured beyond its early speculative phase. Sustainable growth now depends on legitimate use cases and regulatory compliance. Recent market data illustrates several relevant trends: Exchange-traded product volumes increased 45% year-over-year Regulatory technology investments reached $5.2 billion in 2024 Blockchain gaming user counts exceeded 50 million globally Institutional custody solutions managed over $150 billion in digital assets Cross-chain transaction volumes grew 300% throughout 2024 Conclusion Coinbase’s addition of SKR and FIGHT tokens to its listing roadmap represents a strategic expansion of the exchange’s potential digital asset offerings, reflecting both the growing diversification of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the platform’s commitment to providing investors with regulated access to emerging blockchain projects. This development occurs within a maturing market environment where regulatory compliance and legitimate use cases increasingly determine long-term viability. While roadmap inclusion does not guarantee eventual listing, it provides valuable visibility into the exchange’s evaluation process and strategic direction. Market participants should monitor official announcements for updates regarding these assets while recognizing that all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent volatility and risk. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a token is added to Coinbase’s listing roadmap? A1: Inclusion on Coinbase’s listing roadmap indicates the exchange is formally evaluating the asset for potential future listing. This represents an early stage in a multi-phase review process that includes technical, security, and compliance assessments. Roadmap addition provides transparency but does not guarantee eventual listing. Q2: How long does it typically take for a roadmap asset to get listed on Coinbase? A2: The timeline varies significantly based on multiple factors. Some assets progress to listing within weeks, while others remain on the roadmap for months without advancement. The evaluation process depends on technical complexity, regulatory considerations, and market readiness. Coinbase does not provide specific timelines for roadmap assets. Q3: Can I trade SKR and FIGHT tokens on Coinbase immediately? A3: No, roadmap addition does not enable immediate trading. These tokens are currently under evaluation for potential future listing. Investors can trade these assets on other cryptocurrency exchanges where they are already listed, but not yet on Coinbase platforms. Q4: What factors does Coinbase consider when evaluating potential listings? A4: Coinbase evaluates multiple dimensions including blockchain security, regulatory compliance, market structure, project team background, token distribution, liquidity characteristics, and broader ecosystem impact. The exchange uses a comprehensive Digital Asset Framework to guide these assessments. Q5: How does Coinbase’s roadmap announcement affect token prices? A5: Historical data shows roadmap announcements often increase trading volume and price volatility for affected assets on other exchanges. However, this effect varies significantly based on market conditions and specific token characteristics. Investors should exercise caution and conduct independent research before making trading decisions based on roadmap announcements.

Buterin made the declaration in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), stating that the Ethereum community will focus on reclaiming user autonomy and trustlessness that have eroded over time due to design trade‑offs in pursuit of mainstream adoption. “2026 is the year that we take back lost ground in terms of self‑sovereignty and trustlessness,” Buterin wrote, signaling a renewed emphasis on empowering users over third‑party intermediaries He added that the transformation will take time to materialize fully, noting that not all goals will be achieved in the next Kohaku release or even in subsequent hard forks. Nevertheless, he argued that the gradual progress will ultimately shape Ethereum into an ecosystem worthy not only of its current standing, but of a far greater role in the broader blockchain landscape. Vitalik says they hope to introduce social recovery wallets and timelocks Over recent years, Ethereum’s developers have quietly put the pieces in place for the needed enhancements. For starters, earlier this year, the Ethereum founder had noted that the ZK-EVM had progressed to alpha status, achieved production-level benchmarks, and shifted its focus to security. In his latest post, he explained that the network will now prioritize a setup that allows users to run nodes locally and independently verify the chain using ZK-EVM and BAL. He also asserted that users on the network can move away from trusting RPCs by default and toward actively verifying the data they deliver. Additionally, he shared that their plan to improve the user experience includes introducing social recovery wallets and timelocks — wallets that prevent losing everything if a seed phrase is lost. Buterin has backed social recovery wallets since at least 2021, and that vision began taking shape last year with the launch of EIP-7702 in Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade. In the last few months, he has also been increasingly vocal about the importance of privacy at both the user and protocol level. In a Friday post, he said privacy-focused design should let users send private payments as easily as standard transactions. So far, even the Foundation has stepped up its privacy agenda, refocusing internal teams and initiating development of the Kohaku wallet framework. It also introduced ERC-4337 and FOCIL, which could enhance the system’s resistance to censorship. Buterin also emphasized that users should be able to access dapps without relying on servers that might become unavailable or compromised. Buterin stressed the need for quantum-resistant cryptography On Monday, the Ethereum founder also stressed the urgent need to implement quantum-resistant cryptography for long-term security. In his earlier post, Buterin expressed his concerns about delaying quantum resistance for the sake of efficiency. He stressed that Ethereum should be able to pass the walkaway test, underlining its purpose as a home for trust-minimized apps. He also outlined the network’s main goals: ensuring complete quantum security quickly; building a scalable system for ZK-EVM and PeerDAS; maintaining a sustainable state model; implementing full account abstraction; designing a DoS-resistant gas pricing system; creating a durable decentralized PoS model; and developing a censorship-resistant block-building method. He argued that completing these infrastructure enhancements over the coming years would be essential for Ethereum’s enduring technological and community strength. He further noted, “Being able to say ‘Ethereum’s protocol, as it stands today, is cryptographically safe for a hundred years’ is something we should strive to get to as soon as possible.” Before, the crypto mogul had also insisted that the network should focus more on decentralization and resilience over efficiency and convenience.

Key Takeaways: The DOJ confirmed it has not sold any Bitcoin forfeited in the Samourai Wallet case. The clarification follows scrutiny over a 57.5 BTC transfer that sparked sale rumors. The forfeited Bitcoin will remain part of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as accumulation plans continue. Patrick Witt, executive director of the White House President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, said he received direct confirmation from the US Department of Justice that the assets were neither liquidated nor earmarked for sale. “We have received confirmation from DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated,” Witt wrote on X on Friday , adding that the Bitcoin would remain part of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 57.5 BTC Transfer Sparks Questions Over US Government Bitcoin Sales Questions first surfaced in November after blockchain analysts flagged a transfer of 57.5 BTC from a government-controlled wallet to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. The movement prompted speculation that US authorities may have sold or planned to sell the funds, drawing criticism from market participants who pointed to Executive Order 14233. Signed by President Donald Trump in March, the order requires that any Bitcoin obtained through criminal or civil forfeiture “shall not be sold” and instead be retained for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Some observers accused the US Marshals Service of violating the directive, allegations now denied following the DOJ clarification. Public data suggests the US government remains one of the world’s largest Bitcoin holders. Figures from Bitcoin Treasuries show federal authorities control 328,372 BTC, valued at more than $31 billion at current prices. UPDATE: we have received confirmation from DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated, per EO 14233. They will remain on the USG balance sheet as part of the SBR. https://t.co/v2GchC3vk8 — Patrick Witt (@patrickjwitt) January 16, 2026 That total includes 127,271 BTC forfeited in October from a Cambodia-based entity accused of running a so-called pig-butchering investment scam. Witt reiterated that expanding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve remains a policy priority. In a recent interview, he said progress depends on coordination between the Treasury and Commerce departments to address outstanding legal and operational issues. Legislative efforts are also underway. A bill sponsored by Cynthia Lummis proposes accelerating reserve accumulation, targeting the acquisition of up to 1 million Bitcoin over five years. The proposal emphasizes budget-neutral methods, with officials saying any accumulation would avoid costs to taxpayers. Trump Signals Possible Pardon for Samourai Wallet Developer Two developers behind Samourai Wallet were sentenced to prison in November after prosecutors said the privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet processed more than $237 million in criminal proceeds. Keonne Rodriguez received a five-year sentence on Nov. 6, while his co-developer, Hill, was sentenced to four years on Nov. 19. Both were also ordered to forfeit roughly $6.3 million in fees earned through the platform. The case took a political turn in December when Donald Trump said he would consider pardoning Rodriguez. Speaking to reporters during an Oval Office event on Dec. 16, Trump said he had “heard about it” and instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the case. Rodriguez later welcomed the remarks, arguing on social media that the prosecution reflected “lawfare” and a weaponized Justice Department under the Biden administration. Trump has previously pardoned Ross Ulbricht and Changpeng Zhao in related crypto cases, and has raised optimism of a similar pardon for Rodriguez.

57237098,658115,1768636834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57237098.jpeg,South Korea Advances Tokenized Securities Framework Amid Crypto Regulation Push,https://bitcoinist.com/south-korea-tokenized-securities-crypto-push/,"As South Korea intensifies its push for crypto regulation, lawmakers have advanced a bill to establish a legal framework for issuing and trading security token offerings (STOs) using distributed ledger technology (DLT). Lawmakers Amend Framework For Tokenized Securities On Thursday, South Korea’s National Assembly passed key amendments to the Capital Markets Act and the Electronic Securities Act, creating a legal framework for the issuance and distribution of tokenized securities. According to an official government release , the revised rules define tokenized securities as a broad category that extends to both debt and equity products, and recognize them as legitimate financial instruments. The amendments to the Electronic Securities Act will allow qualified issuers to launch tokenized securities using distributed ledger technology. Meanwhile, the Capital Markets Act changes will enable the products to be traded as investment contract securities on brokerages and other licensed intermediaries. Notably, the existing Capital Markets Act prohibited the distribution through securities firms, deeming investment contract securities “unsuitable for distribution due to their non-standard characteristics.” The changes are “expected to enhance accessibility to investments and improve the provision of investment information for these securities,” the official government release stated. After legislative approval, the bill will be submitted to the State Council, followed by official presidential promulgation. Therefore, the legislation is expected to be enacted one year after being signed into law, tentatively in January 2027. Moreover, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is set to lead the implementation, forming a joint “Token Securities Council” with relevant agencies to ensure seamless preparatory work, including the development of supporting infrastructure and enhanced safeguards. The consultation body will comprise the FSC, the Financial Supervisory Service, the Korea Securities Depository, the Financial Investment Association, industry participants, and experts. South Korea’s Crypto Regulatory Push Continues This major step follows South Korea’s efforts to develop and establish clear, comprehensive rules to regulate the local crypto industry. Last week, the government shared its 2026 Economic Growth Strategy, which included a plan to open its market to Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) this year. Crypto-based ETFs have been banned in South Korea since 2017. In 2024, the country’s regulator reaffirmed its stance after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the investment products. However, it has now cited the success of the US and Hong Kong’s crypto funds as a key factor for their shift. The FSC will also accelerate the next phase of its digital asset legislation this quarter to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. As reported by Bitcoinist, South Korea’s Second Phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act was delayed until the start of 2026 due to an ongoing disagreement between the FSC and the Bank of Korea (BOK). The financial authorities have been clashing for months over rules related to the issuance and distribution of stablecoins, disagreeing on the extent of banks’ role in the issuance of won-pegged tokens. Nonetheless, the main policies of the crypto framework have been decided, set to include investor protection measures, such as no-fault liability for crypto asset operators and isolation of bankruptcy risks for stablecoin issuers. Moreover, the country is lifting its long-standing ban on institutional crypto trading, which is anticipated to begin later this year. According to local reports, the FSC is considering a rule to limit corporate cryptocurrency investments at 5% of a company’s equity capital. Under the latest proposal, eligible firms would be able to allocate up to 5% of equity capital per year to digital assets, limited to the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The final draft version could be released as early as January or February.",Crypto News|crypto ETFs|crypto regulation|Financial Services Commission|FSC|South Korea|South korea stablecoins|south korean lawmakers|tokenized securities|total|total crypto market cap,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 08:00:34

For January 2026 alone, the XRP Ledger recorded 1.45 million daily transactions, following a steady upward trend in network usage that began in late 2025, coinciding with the introduction of new payment corridors through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platform and the integration of stablecoins such as RLUSD. Gaps Between XRP Demand And Price Market expert Sam Daodu highlighted in a recent report for 24/7 Wall St. that historical trends suggest that gaps between rising demand and stagnant prices often precede sharp rallies. With exchange reserves at eight-year lows and increasing institutional inflows seen with XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the current situation indicates that the altcoin may be quietly gearing up for its next breakout. Related Reading: XRP Will Skyrocket Beyond $18: Analyst Suggests 800% Growth Potential In 2026 Despite a slight rebound to $2.42 on January 6, which represented a nearly two-month high for the token, its price has since retraced to approximately $2.048 at the time of writing. This decline occurred despite the transaction surge, suggesting that XRP has yet to capitalize on its increased usage. Daodu noted that the discrepancy between XRP’s price and its on-chain activity isn’t unusual. He asserts that such gaps between usage and price have often been precursors to significant price movements, while also pointing out several factors contributing to the current delay in price reaction. Market-wide consolidation is one of the key reasons, as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded sideways in early 2026, dampening momentum for altcoins like XRP. In addition, profit-taking pressure has emerged following XRP’s July 2025 rally up to $3.65. Many short-term holders have cashed out, creating strong resistance levels in the $2.20 to $2.50 range. Until new catalysts arise, Daodu claims XRP may remain confined to this range without breaking out. Is A Major Price Breakout Ahead? Looking forward, Daodu posits that XRP has a historical tendency to lag behind its on-chain progress before initiating explosive price moves. In both 2017 and 2020, spikes in transaction volume and wallet activity preceded significant rallies for the token’s price by several weeks.

A similar scenario unfolded in late 2017, where heightened usage metrics preceded a jump in XRP’s price from $0.30 to $3.30 by early January 2018. This suggests that the current surge in on-chain transactions could be a leading indicator of a delayed price breakout for XRP.

This metric may be used as a proxy for the behavior of the network validators. When the value of the Hashrate goes up, it means new miners are joining the chain and/or old ones are expanding their facilities. Such a trend implies BTC mining is looking attractive to these validators. On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests some of the miners have decided to disconnect their rigs from the network, potentially because they are finding the cryptocurrency to be unprofitable. Now, here is a chart from Blockchain.com that shows the trend in the 7-day average value of the Bitcoin Hashrate over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate set a new all-time high (ATH) around 1,151 exahashes per second (EH/s) back in October. Since this record, however, the indicator’s value has gone down. What’s behind this trend? The answer to that question could lie in the miner revenue. Miners earn their income through two means: block subsidy and transaction fees. Out of these, the former contributes the largest portion to their revenue. Block subsidy remains fixed in terms of BTC value (outside of Halving events, during which they permanently get slashed in half), but its USD value changes alongside the cryptocurrency’s price. Thus, miner revenue is more-or-less dependent on the asset’s price action. Back in October, Bitcoin rallied to a new ATH, so miners responded by upgrading their facilities. When the bullish price action didn’t continue, however, the cohort started pulling back. As a result, the 7-day average Hashrate has fallen to around 998 EH/s, its lowest level in more than three months. Interestingly, the latest continuation of the decline in the indicator has come despite the fact that the cryptocurrency has made some recovery recently. This may be a possible sign that miners aren’t yet convinced by a return of bullish momentum. A potential consequence of the Hashrate decline may be a drop in the Bitcoin mining Difficulty during the next network adjustment. According to data from CoinWarz , miners have taken an average of 10.6 minutes per block since the last adjustment, which is notably slower than the blockchain’s target of 10 minutes. To correct for this, Bitcoin could be forced to decrease its Difficulty by 5.6% in the next biweekly adjustment. However, something to note is that there is still about a week to go until this event, so the network’s response could change depending on how the Hashrate behaves in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $95,500, up more than 5% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin hashrate|Bitcoin Miners|Bitcoin Mining Hashrate|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 08:00:37

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-coach-xrp-will-leave-a-dent-in-the-universe-heres-why/,"In a recent tweet accompanied by a detailed video commentary, finance coach and market commentator Coach JV argued that XRP will play a significant role in what he described as a fundamental transformation of the global financial system. He described digital assets not as short-term trading vehicles, but as components of an infrastructural shift that is already underway. According to Coach JV, the existing financial system is approaching its limits, and new technologies are being integrated to address structural inefficiencies. Coach JV stated that assets such as XRP, Bitcoin, Solana , HBAR, and others should be viewed through the lens of long-term system design rather than speculative opportunity. He emphasized that his focus is not on rapid wealth accumulation but on financial literacy and understanding how money, payments, and custody are evolving. In his words, “the system can’t continue the way it is,” and investors must recognize the depth of the change taking place. XRP Will Leave a Dent in The Universe… pic.twitter.com/CYHi4R0hXa — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 16, 2026 Speed, Regulation, and Institutional Adoption A central theme of Coach JV’s commentary was the alignment between technological progress and financial infrastructure. He drew comparisons between the rapid evolution of communication technology and the need for money to move with similar efficiency. From his perspective, regulation will be a defining factor in determining which digital assets endure, noting that survival through established regulations is essential for institutional adoption. He also argued that traditional banks are repositioning themselves. Institutions that once criticized digital assets, he said, are now preparing to offer custody services and investment exposure. Coach JV suggested that financial advisors will increasingly recommend small allocations to assets such as XRP and Bitcoin , reflecting a shift in institutional attitudes. ETFs, Accessibility, and Market Structure Coach JV devoted significant attention to exchange-traded funds as a likely entry point for mainstream participants. He explained that most individuals will gain exposure to digital assets through regulated products rather than self-custody, describing ETFs as a practical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. While he stated a personal preference for holding the underlying asset, he acknowledged that ETFs offer convenience, regulatory clarity, and reduced operational risk for many investors. He highlighted a Nasdaq MarketSite segment featuring Evernorth and its plans for a public listing, noting comments from Evernorth CEO Asheesh Birla that positioned XRP as a core component of the firm’s digital asset treasury. Birla stated that Evernorth is designed to simplify access for institutions by handling custody, compliance, and security, allowing investors to gain exposure through public markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Strategy Over Speculation Throughout the video, Coach JV returned to the importance of discipline, concentration, and cycle awareness. He cautioned against spreading capital too thin or chasing short-term trends, instead advocating a focused approach centered on assets he believes can withstand regulatory scrutiny. He also emphasizes combining offensive and defensive financial strategies, stressing that markets move in cycles and that preparation matters more than prediction. Coach JV wrapped up his message with an appeal for structured thinking rather than optimism-driven decision-making. His core argument was that understanding systemic change, rather than reacting to price movements, is what positions individuals to navigate the next phase of the financial system effectively.

The exchange and its CEO blamed banks for intervening and pushing for changes that prevent or limit users from earning yields on stablecoins. However, other industry experts disagreed. White House Threatens By citing a source close to the Trump administration, Terrett said the White House expects Coinbase to return with a more suitable agreement that “satisfies the banks and gets everyone to a deal.” She explained that the administration is “said to be furious” with the exchange’s “unilateral” decision on Wednesday, as they reportedly didn’t notify in advance. Moreover, the White House reportedly called the move a “rug pull” against it and the rest of the crypto industry. SCOOP: The White House is considering pulling its support for the crypto market structure bill entirely if @coinbase does not come back to the table with a yield agreement that satisfies the banks and gets everyone to a deal, a source close to the Trump administration tells me.… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 17, 2026 The source further asserted that this is “President Trump’s bill at the end of the day, not Brian Armstrong’s.” Recall that Coinbase pulled its support earlier this week after blaming banks for implementing too many changes that tend to limit users from earning yields on stablecoins. CEO Armstrong outlined numerous issues with the current draft, including: – A de facto ban on tokenized equities – DeFi prohibitions, giving the government unlimited access to your financial records and removing your right to privacy – Erosion of the CFTC’s authority, stifling innovation, and making it subservient to the SEC – Draft amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins, allowing banks to ban their competition Undermining the Bill? Coinbase’s decision caused a lot of controversy outside and inside the cryptocurrency industry. While some experts, such as Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, remained mostly on the sidelines, others, such as Citron Research, directly blamed Armstrong for undermining the bill. They argued that Coinbase’s official reasoning shows fear of competition from tokenized securities firms, as it seeks to benefit from regulatory clarity without opening the door to rivals. The Senate Banking Committee postponed its scheduled markup of the bill on January 15, and no new date has been set yet.

57237331,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262451,1768637411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Binance Delisting: Strategic Removal of BID, DMC, ZRC, and TANSSI Perpetual Futures Shakes Trading Landscape",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-delisting-perpetual-futures-contracts/,"BitcoinWorld Binance Delisting: Strategic Removal of BID, DMC, ZRC, and TANSSI Perpetual Futures Shakes Trading Landscape In a significant market development, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has announced the strategic delisting of four perpetual futures contracts, sending ripples through the digital asset trading community and prompting immediate portfolio reassessments. Binance Delisting Announcement: Key Details and Timeline Binance officially confirmed the removal of four specific perpetual futures trading pairs from its platform. The exchange will delist BID/USDT, DMC/USDT, ZRC/USDT, and TANSSI/USDT contracts precisely at 09:00 UTC on January 21, 2025. Consequently, all pending orders will automatically cancel at that time. Furthermore, traders cannot open new positions for these contracts after the announcement. The exchange strongly recommends users close any existing positions before the deadline to avoid automatic liquidation. This decision follows Binance’s standard quarterly review process for all listed trading products. Perpetual futures contracts, unlike traditional futures, lack an expiry date. Traders use them for leveraged speculation on cryptocurrency price movements. Binance regularly evaluates all listed products against rigorous performance metrics. These metrics include trading volume, liquidity, network stability, and regulatory compliance. The exchange’s review framework aims to protect users and maintain market quality. Therefore, contracts failing to meet these standards face removal from the platform. This process ensures a healthy trading ecosystem for all participants. Understanding the Affected Cryptocurrency Projects The delisting affects four distinct digital assets, each with unique characteristics and market positions. BID (Bidao) functions as a blockchain platform focusing on decentralized finance and stablecoin issuance. DMC (DataMarketCoin) supports data marketplace and storage solutions. ZRC (ZrCoin) originally linked to zirconium dioxide production but has evolved. TANSSI (Tanssi Network) provides appchain infrastructure services for developers. Market data shows declining trading volumes for these assets throughout 2024. Industry analysts note several common factors among delisted assets. Typically, these projects exhibit sustained low liquidity and diminished developer activity. They also often face increased regulatory scrutiny in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, competing projects with stronger fundamentals frequently outperform them. Exchange delistings can significantly impact a project’s visibility and accessibility. However, projects sometimes recover on other trading platforms or through protocol upgrades. The cryptocurrency market naturally experiences continuous evolution and consolidation phases. Historical Context and Exchange Governance Trends Binance has established a clear precedent for periodic contract reviews and removals. The exchange delisted multiple spot and futures trading pairs throughout 2023 and 2024. For instance, it removed ANKR/USDT and MULTI/USDT perpetual contracts in November 2024. These decisions consistently align with the platform’s risk management framework. Major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken follow similar governance practices. They regularly assess listed assets against evolving compliance standards. Regulatory developments significantly influence exchange listing policies. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in the European Union sets stringent requirements. Similarly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission maintains active enforcement posture. Consequently, exchanges proactively manage their product offerings. They aim to preempt potential regulatory challenges and protect user assets. This trend toward stricter governance reflects the industry’s maturation process. Market participants now expect more rigorous standards from leading platforms. Immediate Market Impact and Trader Response Strategies The announcement triggered immediate market reactions across several trading venues. Spot prices for BID, DMC, ZRC, and TANSSI experienced increased volatility following the news. Some traders initiated rapid position closures to avoid last-minute liquidity crunches. Others explored arbitrage opportunities between Binance and other exchanges still listing these assets. Derivatives traders particularly focused on managing their leverage exposure before the deadline. Professional trading firms recommend specific action steps for affected users. First, traders should immediately review all open positions involving these contracts. Second, they must decide whether to close positions manually or wait for automatic settlement. Third, users should explore alternative platforms if they wish to maintain exposure. Fourth, portfolio rebalancing can help mitigate concentration risks. Finally, staying informed about potential relisting announcements on other exchanges is crucial. Risk management remains paramount during such transitional periods. Recommended trader checklist: Audit all current perpetual futures positions Set reminders for the January 21 deadline Research alternative trading venues for these assets Adjust overall portfolio risk parameters Monitor official exchange channels for updates Liquidity and Settlement Process Mechanics Binance will execute the delisting process through a standardized technical procedure. The exchange will disable these trading pairs at the specified time. Then, it will cancel all remaining open orders automatically. Next, the system will settle any open positions at the final mark price. Users will receive their remaining equity in their futures wallets. The entire process typically completes within minutes after the cutoff time. Historical data from previous delistings shows minimal technical disruptions. Liquidity providers and market makers adjust their strategies before such events. They gradually reduce their exposure to affected markets. This action helps prevent sudden liquidity gaps that could disadvantage retail traders. The exchange’s risk management systems monitor order book depth continuously. Binance may intervene if volatility exceeds predetermined thresholds. These protective measures aim to ensure fair and orderly market conditions during the transition. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Market Structure This delisting event reflects larger trends within the digital asset ecosystem. The market continues consolidating around higher-quality projects with sustainable fundamentals. Exchanges increasingly prioritize assets with robust technology and clear regulatory compliance. This evolution benefits long-term investors seeking reduced counterparty risk. However, it may limit access to more speculative early-stage projects. The industry appears moving toward greater institutionalization and standardization. Market analysts observe several structural implications. First, exchange governance decisions now significantly influence asset valuations. Second, projects must maintain strong exchange relationships alongside technological development. Third, cross-exchange liquidity becomes increasingly important for asset resilience. Fourth, regulatory alignment emerges as a critical success factor. Fifth, transparent communication between projects and exchanges gains paramount importance. These developments collectively shape a more mature digital asset marketplace. Conclusion The Binance delisting of BID, DMC, ZRC, and TANSSI perpetual futures contracts represents a calculated governance decision aligning with broader market evolution. This action underscores the exchange’s commitment to maintaining high-quality trading products and protecting user interests. Affected traders must take proactive steps to manage their positions before the January 21, 2025 deadline. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry continues its maturation journey toward greater stability, compliance, and institutional participation. Market participants should view such delistings as natural ecosystem adjustments rather than anomalous events. FAQs Q1: What exactly is Binance delisting on January 21, 2025? Binance will remove four perpetual futures trading pairs: BID/USDT, DMC/USDT, ZRC/USDT, and TANSSI/USDT. The delisting occurs at 09:00 UTC, automatically canceling all open orders. Q2: What should I do if I hold positions in these contracts? You should actively close all positions before the deadline. If positions remain open, Binance will automatically settle them at the final mark price, potentially at less favorable terms. Q3: Will the delisting affect the spot trading of these tokens on Binance? This announcement specifically concerns perpetual futures contracts. However, spot trading pairs for these assets may undergo separate reviews. Monitor official Binance announcements for updates. Q4: Can these tokens get relisted on Binance in the future? Yes, potential relisting remains possible if the projects demonstrate improved trading volume, liquidity, and compliance. Projects must reapply and meet Binance’s current listing criteria. Q5: Where can I trade these assets after the Binance delisting? You may find these perpetual contracts or spot pairs on other cryptocurrency exchanges. Conduct thorough research to identify platforms that list these assets and ensure they operate in your jurisdiction legally.

California AG released the cease-and-desist letter on Friday in response to allegations that Grok was being used to create unlawful content involving kids and nonconsensual adult photographs, which prompted a California state inquiry. Bonta argued that it is illegal to create, distribute, publish, and display CSAM. California AG targets xAI over alleged misuse of Grok Earlier this week, the California attorney general’s office declared that it was looking into xAI due to allegations that the startup’s chatbot, Grok, was being used to produce nonconsensual, inappropriate pictures of women and children. In response, the government sent the corporation a cease-and-desist letter. “Today, I sent xAI a cease and desist letter, demanding the company immediately stop the creation and distribution of deepfakes, nonconsensual, intimate images, and illegal child abuse material. The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to comply immediately. California has zero tolerance for illegal child abuse imagery.” – Rob Bonta , California Attorney General. The AG’s office further asserted that xAI seems to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual, inappropriate photos, which are then “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” According to the AG’s office, one research found that over half of the 20,000 photos produced by xAI between Christmas and New Year’s showed persons wearing very little clothing, some of whom looked like children. Rob Bonta claimed in the announcement that the corporate practices violated California civil laws, including California Civil Code section 1708.86, California Penal Code sections 311 et seq. and 647(j)(4), and California Business & Professions Code section 17200. The California Department of Justice anticipates xAI will affirm its efforts to address these issues and take immediate action to resolve them over the next five days. However, X’s safety account had previously condemned this type of user behavior. It clarified on January 4 that it takes action against illicit content on X, such as CSAM, by deleting it, suspending accounts indefinitely, and collaborating with law authorities and municipal governments as needed. Notably, on January 4, Elon Musk warned that anyone using or prompting Grok to create illegal content will face the same consequences as if they uploaded it. Attorneys general intensify pressure on AI firms over child safety An unsettling increase in non-consensual adult content has resulted from the development of free generative AI tools. This issue has been plaguing several platforms, not only X. For instance, Attorney General Bonta and Attorney General Jennings of Delaware met with OpenAI in September of last year to voice their serious concerns about the growing number of reports about how OpenAI’s products interacted with youth. In August of the same year, AG Bonta, along with 44 other Attorney Generals, sent a letter to 12 leading AI companies following reports of inappropriate interactions between AI chatbots and children. The letters were sent to Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Google, Luka Inc., Meta , Microsoft, Nomi AI, OpenAI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI. AG Bonta and the 44 Attorney Generals informed the companies in the letter that states across the country were closely monitoring how companies develop their AI safety policies. They also emphasized that these businesses have a legal duty to children as consumers since they profit from children using their products. In 2023, AG Bonta joined a bipartisan coalition of 54 states and territories in sending a letter to congressional leaders advocating for the establishment of an expert committee to investigate the potential use of AI to exploit children through CSAM. The coalition requested that the expert commission suggest laws to shield kids from such mistreatment. “The production of CSAM creates a permanent record of the child’s victimization,” according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Evernorth aims to change that by bringing XRP to Wall Street as a familiar, publicly traded asset. Evernorth aims for a Q1 2026 Nasdaq IPO under ticker XRPN, offering investors direct XRP exposure without the hassle of wallets or compliance. Unlike typical crypto firms, it will actively manage an XRP treasury , buying from the open market and deploying assets into regulated yield strategies. During a recent interview, Evernorth CEO Asheesh Birla acknowledged that today's crypto landscape is unlike past cycles: institutions now benefit from clearer regulations, supportive policies, and growing investor demand for digital assets within familiar market framework. Birla said, “It was a record-breaking few weeks with XRP ETFs. That’s great news. That shows that there is a demand from the public market to gain exposure to XRP, a digital asset that is at the forefront of the financial revolution on blockchain.” Well, Evernorth leverages existing momentum by offering XRP exposure through a Nasdaq-listed public-equity structure, sidestepping the compliance and custody hurdles of direct crypto ownership. Investors simply buy Evernorth shares, while the company manages XRP holdings, treasury strategy, and DeFi participation behind the scenes. This model mirrors how institutions access commodities or digital assets via public vehicles, creating a compliant bridge for pensions, asset managers, and funds restricted from holding crypto directly. Beyond passive holdings, Evernorth plans to actively manage its XRP treasury, deploying assets into vetted DeFi strategies to generate yield and boost shareholder value. If executed successfully, the company could serve as both an XRP proxy and a digital asset income engine. With a potential Q1 2026 IPO, Evernorth could redefine XRP’s institutional story, offering regulated, stock-like exposure to the token and making it as accessible as buying shares on Wall Street. Conclusion Evernorth’s Nasdaq IPO could transform institutional crypto access. By offering XRP through a regulated, publicly traded vehicle, it eliminates custody and compliance hurdles, providing investors a secure, familiar gateway to the booming digital asset market.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 08:24:03

Steak ’n Shake made the announcement on Saturday through the company’s official X account, eight months after it began accepting Bitcoin payments in its US restaurants. The rollout began in May after weeks of teasers, and the company says it has seen improvements in same-store sales thanks to the Bitcoin initiative. “Eight months ago today, Steak n Shake launched its burger-to-Bitcoin transformation when we started accepting bitcoin payments. Our same-store sales have risen dramatically ever since.” The post added that all Bitcoin payments are funneled directly into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, with the latest purchase increasing exposure by “$10,000,000 in notional value,” the fast food company wrote . Steak ‘n Shake boasts of being the first restaurant with a Bitcoin reserve Steak ’n Shake is claiming a first-mover position among restaurant chains, saying it “made history as the first major restaurant to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” The company did not disclose the timing or execution details of the $10 million Bitcoin acquisition, nor whether it was purchased in a single transaction or accumulated over time. Our newly remodeled Steak n Shake leans hard into nostalgia. Funded by beef tallow and bitcoin 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/2Z0gfRjMgp — Steak 'n Shake (@SteaknShake) August 29, 2025 At the Bitcoin 2025 conference held that month, Chief Operations Officer Dan Edwards told attendees that the bitcoin payments had delivered immediate financial benefits for the Steakburgers maker. He mentioned that Bitcoin payments were cutting processing costs by 50% compared to fiat payment methods, while increasing transaction speeds at the register. “Bitcoin is a win for the customer, it’s a win for us as the merchant, and it’s a win for you in the Bitcoin community,” Edwards said during his remarks at the event. Steak ’n Shake confirmed all Bitcoin payments received will be retained in their digital currency form instead of being converted to dollars, a policy that directly feeds the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The firm reported an increase of about 10.7% in sales during the second quarter, followed by a 15% increase in the third quarter. Per Dan Edwards, its third-quarter performance exceeded that of competitors in the fast-food category, including McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Starbucks. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey lauded the restaurant by sharing images in June showing he had spent $100 in Bitcoin for meals. Steak ’n Shake has also woven Bitcoin into its menu and promotions through the Bitcoin Burger, a menu item featuring a bun stamped with the Bitcoin logo, alongside a Bitcoin Meal program, which takes funds from purchases to charitable and customer rewards. Last October, Steak ’n Shake said it would donate 210 satoshis from every Bitcoin Meal sold to Open Sats Initiative, Inc. over the next 12 months. However, the company has yet to provide an estimated total donation amount. Those who purchase and register a Bitcoin Steakburger or Bitcoin Meal can receive $5 in Bitcoin through the Fold app. The process requires customers to upload their receipt to a dedicated website, receive a redemption code, and activate an account within the Fold app to claim the reward. In November last year, the fast food chain took its operations into El Salvador after participating in the country’s Bitcoin Histórico event. El Salvador was the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a decision that executives purportedly resonated with. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This demand, first reported by Bloomberg on March 15, 2025, emerges not from financial necessity for the world’s wealthiest individual but from a profound dispute over the founding principles of artificial intelligence. The case, set for trial in late April in Oakland, California, represents one of the most consequential legal battles in tech history, pitting a visionary founder against the AI giant he helped create. Elon Musk OpenAI lawsuit: Unpacking the $134 billion damages calculus Financial economist C. Paul Wazzan, an expert witness with extensive experience in complex commercial litigation, prepared the damages analysis for Musk’s legal team. Wazzan’s calculation rests on a foundational premise: Musk should receive compensation equivalent to what an early investor would typically earn when a startup achieves extraordinary success. Specifically, Wazzan determined Musk deserves a substantial portion of OpenAI’s current estimated $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation in 2015. This methodology yields a potential 3,500-fold return on Musk’s initial investment. Furthermore, Wazzan’s analysis incorporates more than just financial contributions. It accounts for Musk’s technical expertise and business guidance during OpenAI’s formative years. The economist calculated wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI itself and an additional $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, its major partner. Musk’s attorneys argue this compensation framework reflects standard startup economics. Early investors who provide capital and strategic direction during a company’s vulnerable initial phase typically expect outsized returns if that company becomes a market leader. Consequently, they contend Musk’s requested damages represent the financial value of his early, risk-taking support. The contextual backdrop of unprecedented wealth The sheer magnitude of Musk’s damages demand becomes even more remarkable when viewed against his current financial standing. According to the latest Forbes billionaires list, Musk’s personal fortune now approaches $700 billion. This figure exceeds the wealth of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by approximately $500 billion. In November 2024, Tesla shareholders separately approved a historic $1 trillion compensation package for Musk. This corporate pay deal remains the largest in recorded business history. Against this backdrop of almost incomprehensible wealth, a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a significant sum by any ordinary measure. However, it would constitute a relatively modest percentage increase to Musk’s existing net worth. This financial context fuels OpenAI’s characterization of the lawsuit as strategic rather than financial. Company representatives have described Musk’s legal actions as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment.” They suggest the case serves purposes beyond monetary recovery, potentially involving competitive positioning or philosophical disagreement about AI’s future direction. Expert analysis: Legal precedents and valuation challenges Legal experts following the case note several unprecedented aspects. First, damages calculations in breach-of-contract or fraud cases typically focus on actual financial losses, not hypothetical investment returns. Second, valuing a private company like OpenAI at $500 billion involves substantial estimation, as the firm hasn’t conducted a recent public funding round. Third, attributing specific valuation increases to individual founders presents complex causal challenges. Technology companies grow through collective efforts of teams, market conditions, and technological breakthroughs. Isolating one person’s contribution, especially from the earliest days, requires sophisticated economic modeling that courts may scrutinize heavily. Finally, the case intersects with evolving legal standards for nonprofit organizations that transition toward commercial models. OpenAI began as a nonprofit research lab dedicated to developing safe artificial intelligence for humanity’s benefit. Its subsequent creation of a for-profit subsidiary and partnership with Microsoft forms the core of Musk’s allegations about mission abandonment. The core allegation: Mission drift and breached trust Musk’s lawsuit fundamentally alleges that OpenAI defrauded him by departing from its original nonprofit mission. When Musk co-founded the organization in 2015 alongside Sam Altman and others, the stated goal was to develop artificial intelligence safely and distribute its benefits widely. The organization’s charter explicitly prioritized humanity’s welfare over shareholder returns. The complaint argues that OpenAI’s 2019 restructuring and subsequent Microsoft partnership violated these founding principles. Specifically, Musk contends the organization effectively became a closed-source, for-profit entity primarily serving Microsoft’s commercial interests. This alleged shift, according to the lawsuit, constitutes a fundamental breach of the trust and agreement under which Musk provided his early support. OpenAI has consistently defended its evolution. Company statements emphasize that the partnership with Microsoft provided essential resources for developing advanced AI systems like GPT-4. They maintain that their work continues to prioritize safety and broad benefit, even within a structure that includes commercial elements. Comparative perspective: Tech industry founder disputes The Musk-OpenAI conflict follows other notable disputes between founders and the companies they helped establish. For instance, Facebook’s early legal battles with the Winklevoss twins involved allegations of stolen ideas rather than mission drift. Similarly, Uber’s conflicts with former CEO Travis Kalanick centered on governance and culture, not fundamental purpose. What distinguishes the current case is its focus on ethical and structural transformation. The lawsuit alleges not merely contractual breach but betrayal of a philosophical commitment to AI safety and accessibility. This dimension introduces novel questions about how courts evaluate promises made during a technology organization’s idealistic beginnings. Furthermore, the involvement of Microsoft adds another layer of complexity. As a strategic partner providing substantial computing resources and investment, Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s direction becomes relevant to the damages calculation. The lawsuit suggests Microsoft benefited improperly from OpenAI’s alleged mission shift, hence the inclusion of Microsoft in the damages claim. Broader implications for AI governance and ethics Beyond the immediate legal and financial stakes, the case raises profound questions about AI development governance. If successful, Musk’s lawsuit could establish precedent regarding the obligations of AI organizations to their founding principles. It might influence how courts view transitions from nonprofit to commercial structures in the technology sector. The trial also highlights ongoing debates about concentrated power in artificial intelligence. With a handful of companies controlling advanced AI capabilities, questions about accountability, transparency, and equitable access grow increasingly urgent. Musk’s allegations touch directly on whether commercial incentives inevitably undermine commitments to safety and broad benefit. Additionally, the case demonstrates how personal relationships among tech leaders can shape industry trajectories. Musk, Altman, and other OpenAI founders initially collaborated based on shared concerns about AI risks. Their subsequent divergence illustrates how strategic disagreements among influential figures can escalate into legal confrontations with industry-wide consequences. Conclusion The Elon Musk OpenAI lawsuit represents far more than a financial dispute between billionaires. At its core, the case grapples with fundamental questions about innovation, ethics, and accountability in artificial intelligence development. The staggering $134 billion damages figure underscores the immense value created in the AI sector, while the contrast with Musk’s $700 billion fortune reveals the suit’s symbolic and strategic dimensions. As the trial approaches in Oakland, California, the technology world watches closely. The outcome could influence how AI companies structure their organizations, how they honor founding commitments, and how courts evaluate damages in cases involving rapidly evolving technologies. Regardless of the verdict, this legal battle has already illuminated the tensions between idealism and commercial reality that define contemporary artificial intelligence development. FAQs Q1: Why is Elon Musk suing OpenAI for $134 billion? Elon Musk alleges that OpenAI defrauded him by abandoning its original nonprofit mission to develop safe AI for humanity’s benefit. His lawsuit claims the organization’s shift to a more commercial model, including its partnership with Microsoft, violated founding agreements. The $134 billion damages figure represents what an expert witness calculates as Musk’s rightful share of OpenAI’s current value based on his early contributions. Q2: How does Musk’s $700 billion fortune affect the lawsuit? Musk’s extraordinary wealth makes the financial damages less significant to his personal net worth, reinforcing OpenAI’s argument that the lawsuit constitutes “harassment” rather than legitimate financial grievance. The contrast highlights that the case primarily concerns AI ethics, governance, and alleged breach of trust rather than monetary need. Q3: What is OpenAI’s response to the allegations? OpenAI has characterized Musk’s legal actions as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment.” The company defends its evolution, arguing that partnership with Microsoft provided necessary resources for developing advanced AI safely. OpenAI maintains it continues to prioritize beneficial AI development despite structural changes. Q4: Who is C. Paul Wazzan and how did he calculate the damages? C. Paul Wazzan is a financial economist specializing in valuation and damages in complex commercial litigation. He calculated Musk’s potential damages by estimating what return an early investor would receive from OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation, considering both Musk’s $38 million seed funding and his non-financial contributions during OpenAI’s founding period. Q5: What broader implications does this case have for AI development? The lawsuit raises fundamental questions about AI governance, ethical commitments, and how organizations transition from nonprofit ideals to commercial realities. The outcome could influence legal standards for founder agreements, AI safety accountability, and how courts evaluate damages in rapidly evolving technology sectors.

Democratic Party representatives in the Financial Services Committee sent a letter to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, asking the regulator if it knowingly retreated from enforcing laws on Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. The policymakers, led by Rep Maxine Waters, said the commission has dismissed or closed at least a dozen crypto-related cases, including actions it had previously deemed legally sound. Several of those cases had already survived motions to dismiss and received favorable rulings from federal judges. “Given the industry’s history of investor-harm and the clear mandate of the securities laws to protect market participants, this turn raises troubling questions about the SEC’s priorities and effectiveness. Frankly, it puts both investors and the US economy at risk,” wrote the representatives. SEC left cases with clear probable cause, lawmakers argue In the letter, Democrats bashed the SEC for turning away from “meritorious” litigation even though the courts had already validated the commission’s claims. The lawmakers said this pattern has fueled perceptions that enforcement decisions are being influenced by outside interests and the Trump administration. Waters and her colleagues mentioned that the Commissions’ actions occurred while crypto executives and firms gave financial support to the US president and his allies. But according to the letter, securities laws require the Commission to protect market participants, regardless of their political biasness. They devoted significant attention to the SEC’s dismissal of its case against Binance after it sued the crypto exchange and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, in June 2023 for securities violations. The entity accused the company of deceptive practices, conflicts of interest, and running businesses in America without proper registration. Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to Bank Secrecy Act violations in Binance’s compliance failures and served a prison term, which he was pardoned for by US President Trump last year. In June 2024, US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson upheld most of the SEC’s allegations and allowed the case to proceed. The court found that the regulator had plausibly alleged fraud and unregistered securities activity in its token listings and services. Despite that ruling, the SEC dismissed the case with prejudice in May 2025 while “exercising discretion,” away from a judgment on the merits of its claims. Liberals said the dismissal was concerning, given the seriousness of the allegations and the court’s findings, in addition to the Trump administration’s pardon of Zhao, claiming the POTUS was making sure he and his companies “would avoid accountability.” Coinbase and Kraken cases were also dropped The documents also talked about the Commissions’ retreat from its actions against Coinbase and Kraken, where federal judges had also shunned the companies’ attempts to dismiss the lawsuits, much like the Binance case. The SEC charged Coinbase in June 2023 with operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, alongside failing to register its staking services. In the following year, a federal judge sided with the Commission and ruled that certain tokens sold on Coinbase qualified as securities under federal law. Fast forward to February last year, the commission reached an agreement with the US-based crypto trading platform to dismiss the case, citing the pending work of its Crypto Task Force as justification for ending the litigation. Kraken was facing similar allegations in a lawsuit filed in 2023, but the Commission and Kraken jointly moved to dismiss the case last March. FSC members Rep. Waters, Sean Casten, and Brad Sherman surmised that the choice to drop cases against crypto firms came at a time when political donations were pouring into the US government, with at least $85 million to President Trump’s reelection campaign. The firms whose cases or investigations were dismissed included Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, Robinhood, and Crypto.com, which all supposedly donated at least $1 million to Trump’s inauguration each.

Key Takeaways: Anchorage Digital is seeking $200 million to $400 million in funding as it prepares for a potential IPO next year. Its federally chartered crypto bank status positions the firm to benefit from new U.S. stablecoin and digital asset rules. Anchorage is expanding stablecoin, custody and wealth management services as institutional demand grows. The company is seeking between $200 million and $400 million in fresh funding, with an initial public offering under consideration for sometime next year, according to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter . Anchorage’s Federal Bank Charter Gives It an Edge Anchorage’s growing ambitions are tied closely to its regulatory standing. Its affiliate, Anchorage Digital Bank National Association, became the first federally chartered crypto bank in the United States in 2021. That status has increasingly set Anchorage apart from rivals, particularly as Washington moves to formalize rules around stablecoins and digital asset infrastructure. Following the passage of the GENIUS Act in July, Anchorage is positioning itself to play a central role in stablecoin issuance and related services. Chief executive Nathan McCauley said in September that the firm plans to double the size of its stablecoin team over the next year, anticipating a surge in demand for dollar-backed digital tokens from banks, fintech firms and global institutions. “2025 was our year of scale,” an Anchorage spokesperson told Bloomberg, pointing to a series of acquisitions, new partnerships and the launch of stablecoin issuance as key milestones. ANCHORAGE DIGITAL SEEKS $200M FUNDING ROUND AS IPO PLANS TAKE SHAPE Crypto custodian Anchorage Digital is seeking to raise $200 million in new funding as it moves forward with plans for a potential public listing. The fundraising effort underscores continued institutional… pic.twitter.com/7Un0hfBw4a — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) January 17, 2026 One of the most notable partnerships involves Tether, with the two firms announcing plans last year to launch a U.S.-focused stablecoin known as USAT. Beyond stablecoins, Anchorage has built a broad suite of services aimed at institutional clients, including custody, trading and staking for banks, hedge funds and venture capital firms. The company has also expanded into wealth management, acquiring Securitize for Advisors and integrating token lifecycle management through Hedgey to deepen its reach across tokenized assets. Anchorage is not new to large funding rounds. In late 2021, the firm raised $350 million in a round led by KKR & Co, with participation from Goldman Sachs, GIC and Apollo credit funds, valuing the company at more than $3 billion at the time. Crypto Firms Line Up for IPOs as Anchorage Prepares Public Debut Anchorage’s IPO ambitions come as other major crypto firms also line up for public listings. Custody rival BitGo filed confidential IPO paperwork last year, while crypto exchange Kraken submitted its own filing in November and is targeting a debut in early 2026. Bitpanda is also lining up for a Frankfurt stock market debut in the first half of 2026, putting one of Europe’s biggest retail crypto platforms on a path from bull market beneficiary to public market test. Last year, tZero Group, a New York–based blockchain infrastructure firm focused on tokenized securities and real-world assets, announced that it is preparing to go public in 2026 . Before that, BitGo officially filed for an initial public offering , becoming the first dedicated crypto custodian to pursue a listing on a US stock exchange.

Whale inflows to Binance have hit their lowest since 2021, with the 30-day moving average dropping to 48–56M XRP. This signals minimal selling pressure and a strong HODL mindset among the largest holders. This trend signals rising XRP scarcity on exchanges. As whales hold rather than move tokens, liquidity tightens and supply shrinks, reflecting investor confidence and patience, often a precursor to major rallies. Notably, U.S. trading hours have emerged as a key catalyst in sparking these price surges. Market sentiment shows cautious optimism as XRP holds $2.06 , well above the key $2 support. Low whale activity and steady price action signal accumulation over selling, boosting trader confidence. Why does this matter? Well, retail investors should take note that XRP whales are holding, signaling confidence in an imminent price surge. With supply tightening on exchanges, the token may be primed for its next upward move. Therefore, XRP’s on-chain data signals a bullish surge as whale inflows to Binance hit multi-year lows, accumulation rises, and price stability builds investor confidence. Historically, low selling from major holders often sparks explosive rallies. With supply tightening and committed holders, XRP could be primed for its next major move, making it a key watch for traders and long-term investors alike. Conclusion Whale activity indicates a shift from short-term trading to long-term holding. With XRP above $2 and inflows at multi-year lows, supply tightens as confidence grows. Historically, such quiet accumulation precedes major rallies, signaling a potential upward leg and making whale behavior a key market indicator.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 08:50:35

The dispute has raised fresh doubts about whether Washington can reach a compromise between crypto firms, banks, and lawmakers. White House Signals It Could Walk Away A source close to the Trump administration said the White House could drop its backing for the bill if Coinbase refuses to agree on yield rules. The source said the administration wants an outcome that satisfies banks and keeps negotiations moving. Besides, officials reportedly felt blindsided by Coinbase’s actions this week. They viewed the move as a setback for the wider push to pass the bill. The source also suggested the White House sees the bill as a national policy effort, not a single-company campaign. Consequently, the administration does not want any firm to shape the process alone. The anger reportedly stems from what officials described as an unexpected and independent shift by Coinbase. Coinbase Pushes Back on the Draft On Wednesday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the company cannot support the Senate Banking Committee draft as it stands. He argued the proposal could damage innovation across key crypto sectors. Additionally, he warned that parts of the bill could restrict tokenized equities and tighten rules around decentralized finance. Armstrong also raised concerns about broader government access to financial records. He said the draft could weaken privacy protections for users. Moreover, he criticized the balance of power between regulators. He argued the bill could reduce the CFTC’s role while giving more influence to the SEC. Stablecoins have also become a central point of tension. Armstrong said the bill could limit yield-style rewards on stablecoins. Hence, he suggested lawmakers may aim to shield banks from stronger competition. Banking groups have warned that stablecoin yields could pull deposits away from traditional savings products. Lawmakers Look for a Path Forward The wider crypto community has split over Coinbase’s approach. Some users supported its stance and blamed banks for blocking change. However, others worry that the conflict could stall progress at a critical moment. Several senators have said they still want to move the bill forward. Senator Mark Warner said lawmakers can find a way to keep talks alive. Still, the timing remains unclear, and some observers expect delays into February. Senator Cynthia Lummis also signaled the process may slow down as stakeholders reassess next steps. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz predicted the CLARITY Act could pass within two weeks after recent Senate meetings.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 08:52:39
57238400,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=876224,1768640420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/57238400.jpeg,"XRP Poised To Move On Its Own, Separate From Bitcoin: CEO",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-poised-to-move-on-its-own-separate-from-bitcoin-ceo/,"For a market that usually moves in one direction, some voices are starting to say this time might look a little different. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg said XRP could move on a different path from Bitcoin this year, pointing to enterprise use cases as a key reason. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 He made the remarks during a podcast with host Paul Barron, and outlined a cautious view of Bitcoin while singling out protocols tied to real-world tokenization. According to McClurg, the shift in focus toward practical applications may help a small set of tokens behave differently than the wider market. XRP And Hedera Seen As Practical Picks McClurg named the XRP Ledger and Hedera as examples of networks that could benefit from enterprise adoption and tokenization efforts. He argued that platforms with clear utility — like payment rails, tokenized assets, or stablecoin infrastructure — have a better chance of holding value when speculative momentum fades. Reports have disclosed that he does not expect these assets to race higher; instead, modest gains are the likeliest outcome, with growth described as low double-digit rather than explosive. Bitcoin Faces Additional Downside McClurg turned more negative on Bitcoin. He said he believes Bitcoin peaked on October 6, 2025, at $126,200. Since that date Bitcoin has slipped roughly 35% to about $95,800. He warned that prices could fall another 20–30% over the next six to nine months, which would place BTC roughly between $65,000 and $77,000 before the end of the cycle. Based on his view, a new all-time high is not expected in 2026 and the market may be entering a deeper correction. Markets Could Still Move Together Critics point out that altcoins often suffer greater losses when the market experiences a downturn, and history supports that caution. Liquidity tends to dry up during big Bitcoin sell-offs, and even assets with real use cases can be pushed lower in a broad risk-off episode. In layman’s phrasing, XRP might fall less than Bitcoin and therefore look stronger in comparison, but outright independence from Bitcoin is rare and usually temporary. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps Relative Outperformance The More Likely Outcome According to McClurg’s perspective, what is most realistic is relative outperformance rather than complete separation. That means XRP and similar tokens could remain flat or show modest positive returns while Bitcoin weakens. Such a pattern would still be notable for holders and for enterprises planning tokenization projects, but it falls short of a dramatic price surge.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-this-xrp-pattern-changes-everything-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) has published a video outlining a comparison that links XRP’s current positioning to a major commodity reversal from recent history. His focus was not on short-term noise. He pointed to a pattern that unfolded when oil markets faced widespread doubt, then moved sharply higher. In the video, Steph compared XRP’s current position to that of oil in 2020. Sentiment leaned heavily against oil before the price accelerated rapidly. Steph presented this parallel as a way to think about XRP’s current price structure and potential upside. This #XRP pattern changes everything! pic.twitter.com/TYnqdaR2Xl — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 14, 2026 Context Around XRP’s Position XRP trades at $2.09 at the time of his analysis. The asset experienced a slight resurgence in early 2026 , but it remains close to the $2 support level. Despite this, XRP remains one of the most liquid digital assets in the market. It also sits at the center of Ripple’s payment-focused infrastructure. Long-term holders continue to track XRP as a macro asset rather than a speculative token. Steph did not dwell on short-term indicators. He treated XRP as an asset that has already endured an extended period of compression . This set the stage for the oil comparison that followed. The Oil Comparison From 2020 Steph highlighted the oil market between 2020 and 2022. During that period, oil prices surged roughly 1,450%. The move followed a phase in which sentiment collapsed, and confidence disappeared. Oil then entered a sustained expansion that caught many observers off guard. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steph argued that XRP now occupies a comparable psychological and structural position. He noted that when everyone thought it was over for oil, its price exploded. He immediately connected that thought to the present. He believes that XRP is about to explode because many market participants have discarded it and are selling too early . Where is XRP Going? A 1,450% move represents a 14.5x increase from the starting price. Applying that scale to XRP’s current price of $2.09 produces a projected level near $32.4. Steph’s analysis centered on how markets behave after extended disbelief phases, especially when liquidity and visibility already exist, and it shows a strong correlation between both assets. Steph’s thesis places XRP in a longer cycle narrative. He presented oil’s recovery as evidence that deeply discounted assets can reprice aggressively once conditions align. The video positions XRP as an asset that could experience a similar breakout if the cycle he outlined plays out.

According to reports, the dissatisfaction was expressed to company executives at a recent meeting held in the country. This puts Ireland on a long list of countries worried about the implications of the actions of the chatbot. Over the last few weeks, countries and their leaders have called out the platform, its owner, Elon Musk, and its chatbot, Grok. This is because some users are now taking advantage of the chatbot to generate sexualized images of women and children. While some countries have threatened legal sanctions, others have called on the platform to take measures to protect children and women from being digitally abused. Ireland wants X to take corrective measures In the meeting, Artificial Intelligence Minister Niamh Smyth hailed the corrective measures that the company said it had taken to curb the menace. This was after the executives told her that Grok had been disabled from removing or reducing clothing on individuals worldwide. The new development came after the platform confirmed that it will ‘geoblock’ the ability of X and Grok users to create images of people in limited outfits. In its statement, the platform mentioned that these requests will be halted only in regions where the actions have been deemed illegal. During the meeting, the Irish AI Minister expressed her concerns that nonconsensual intimate imagery and child sexual abuse materials were being generated and posted on the public platform. She told the company executives that the sophistication of the safeguards needs to match the sophistication of the technology. However, Smyth noted that her concerns remain regarding Grok as a standalone application, noting that the Irish government will need to examine it further. She added that she will continue to monitor the situation closely. Niamh also added that she is scheduled to hold an in-person follow-up meeting with executives from X in the future to ensure that adequate and enduring protections against the technology remain in place. Countries continue to criticize X and its Grok chatbot The renewed criticism comes after the platform allegedly failed to curb the generation of the menace after it pledged to halt and suspend users who generate them. During the period, UK communication watchdog Ofcom noted that it had made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what they are doing to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. The regulatory body mentioned at the time that it would assess whether an investigation is necessary. After its statement, the government of Indonesia announced that it had taken decisive action concerning the chatbot. The country mentioned that the chatbot will remain temporarily banned, citing the need to protect its women and children from the dangers of AI-generated explicit content. “The government views non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and citizens’ security in the digital space,” the country said. The development came after Australian PM Anthony Albanese threw his weight behind countries criticizing the platform, calling on them to do what is right in terms of protecting its vulnerable users. The eSafety Office of Australia mentioned that the number of reports it received was relatively small; it noted that there has been a rise in reports in relation to the incident compared to previous years. The watchdog vowed to use its powers as defined in the Australian Online Safety Act to remove these contents. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The movement, involving 18.32 million LAYER valued at approximately $3 million, occurred just 26 minutes prior to the report’s publication, highlighting the real-time nature of blockchain transparency. Consequently, this event provides a critical case study in project treasury management and market signaling. Analyzing the Solayer LAYER Deposit to Binance The core transaction data reveals precise figures. According to the on-chain intelligence platform Onchainlens, the specific wallet address transferred exactly 18,320,000 LAYER tokens. Based on prevailing market prices at the time, this equated to a substantial $3 million valuation. Following this Binance crypto deposit, the same wallet retains a significant balance of 16.56 million LAYER, worth an estimated $2.7 million. This residual holding indicates the move was not a full liquidation but a strategic partial transfer. Blockchain analysts routinely monitor such wallets associated with project teams, as their actions can signal various operational needs, from treasury diversification to preparing for exchange liquidity provisions. Contextualizing Team Wallet Activity in Crypto Transactions from wallets linked to core development teams are never viewed in isolation. Instead, they form part of a broader narrative concerning project health and insider confidence. Typically, team token movements fall into several predictable categories: funding operational expenses, providing liquidity on decentralized or centralized exchanges, or executing planned vesting schedules. For instance, a large, unexpected deposit to a major exchange like Binance can sometimes precede increased selling pressure, potentially affecting the LAYER token’s market price. However, it may also simply facilitate necessary financial operations. The table below outlines common reasons for team-controlled wallet movements: Reason for Movement Typical Market Interpretation Vesting Schedule Unlock Planned, predictable, often neutral Liquidity Provision Generally positive for ecosystem growth Operational Funding Neutral, seen as standard business practice Large, Unplanned Exchange Deposit Can signal caution, leading to short-term volatility Therefore, understanding the context behind this Solayer team wallet activity is crucial for accurate assessment. The Solana ecosystem, which hosts the Solayer project, has established itself as a hub for high-throughput decentralized applications. Projects within it are often held to high standards of transparency regarding token allocation and team holdings. Expert Perspective on Treasury Management Signals Industry observers emphasize the importance of communication following such events. “A transparent project often pre-announces large treasury movements or provides a clear rationale shortly after they occur on-chain,” notes a veteran crypto-economist who specializes in tokenomics. This approach builds trust within the community. The lack of immediate public commentary from the Solayer team, while not unusual in the immediate aftermath, will likely prompt questions. Analysts will now monitor for follow-up transactions, official statements, or changes in exchange order book depth for LAYER. Furthermore, they will compare this action to the project’s original token distribution plan outlined in its documentation. Key metrics for watch include: Remaining Treasury Balance: The $2.7 million still held suggests ongoing runway or future planned use. Exchange Inflow Metrics: Aggregators will track if this deposit correlates with a spike in overall LAYER exchange inflows. Price Action Correlation: Analysts will study any immediate or lagged effect on the LAYER/USD trading pair. This event underscores a fundamental principle of decentralized finance: blockchain data is public, but interpretation requires nuance. A single transaction does not define a project’s trajectory but serves as one data point in a complex financial landscape. The Broader Impact on Solayer and Market Perception The immediate impact of this $3 million deposit extends beyond the transaction itself. Market participants use tools like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana to track these flows in real-time. Consequently, the speed at which Onchainlens reported the activity demonstrates the mature infrastructure for blockchain surveillance. For the Solayer project, this event tests its relationship with its holder community. Proactive communication can mitigate potential fears of a sudden sell-off. Historically, projects that maintain open dialogues about treasury management, even for routine operations, foster stronger, more resilient communities. Moreover, this incident highlights the evolving expectations for project teams in 2025, where sophisticated on-chain analytics are accessible to all market participants. Conclusion The reported deposit of $3 million in LAYER tokens from a Solayer team-linked wallet to Binance represents a significant on-chain event worthy of analysis. While the exact motive remains unconfirmed by official sources, the transaction provides a clear window into the continuous and transparent nature of blockchain-based asset movement. Monitoring the Solayer LAYER deposit and the team’s subsequent communication will be essential for understanding its strategic implications. Ultimately, this event reinforces the critical importance of transparency and well-communicated tokenomics in building sustainable cryptocurrency projects within the modern digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened with the Solayer team wallet? A wallet identified by on-chain analysts as belonging to the Solayer team transferred 18.32 million LAYER tokens (worth $3M) to the Binance exchange. The wallet still holds an additional 16.56 million LAYER. Q2: Why do people monitor team wallets? Team wallet activity can provide insights into a project’s financial strategy, signal potential future selling pressure, or indicate routine operational moves like vesting or liquidity provisioning. Q3: Does this mean the Solayer team is selling their tokens? A deposit to an exchange like Binance often, but not always, precedes a sale. It could also be for other purposes like providing liquidity or converting tokens for operational expenses. The intent is not confirmed solely by the deposit. Q4: How was this transaction discovered so quickly? Blockchain intelligence firms like Onchainlens use automated systems to track large transactions from known wallets, especially those linked to project founders or treasuries, and report them in real-time. Q5: What should LAYER token holders do in response to this news? Holders should seek official communication from the Solayer team for context, monitor credible market analysis for interpretation, and avoid making impulsive financial decisions based on a single data point.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2026? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2026 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.08181 Market Cap $235.62M Trading Volume (24-hour) $17.74M Circulating Supply 3.22B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.08262 24-h Low $0.07907 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.56% (High) 50-Day SMA $ 0.08855 14-Day RSI 43.11 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) 200-Day SMA $ 0.2173 Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : SONIC Price is consolidating after a recent move with mixed momentum Key support is being tested while resistance caps upside A clearer trend depends on stronger volume confirmation Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Sonic’s daily chart shows a short-term corrective phase following a strong early-January rally. Price surged toward the $0.095–$0.10 area but failed to hold above that zone, triggering profit-taking and a gradual pullback toward $0.082. Recent candles show smaller bodies, suggesting selling pressure is slowing. The MACD histogram has faded toward neutral, indicating weakening bullish momentum rather than a full bearish reversal. As long as Sonic holds above the $0.078–$0.080 support range, the broader structure remains constructive. A period of consolidation is likely before the next directional move, with buyers watching for stabilization and renewed volume. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the price has recently bounced after testing a lower support zone, suggesting buyers are stepping in at discounted levels. Momentum appears mixed, with the market struggling to maintain a clear upward trajectory after the rebound. Short-term highs are getting capped near a nearby resistance area, indicating some selling pressure still exists. Price is forming smaller candles, which signals indecision and potential consolidation rather than a strong breakout. If the current support holds, a gradual recovery could develop, but a breakdown below it would likely invite further downside. Overall, the structure leans toward range-bound movement with cautious sentiment. Sonic technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.09121 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.08464 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.08495 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.08334 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.08855 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.1233 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.2173 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.09059 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.08977 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.08653 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.08484 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.09848 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.1389 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.2162 SELL What can you expect from the Sonic (prev.FTM) price analysis next? Based on the current technical structure, Sonic is likely to enter a period of short-term consolidation as the market digests its recent moves. Price may oscillate between nearby support and resistance levels rather than trending in a straight line, reflecting mixed momentum and cautious trader sentiment. If buyers can defend key support, a gradual recovery attempt could follow with higher lows forming. However, failure to hold this level would increase the risk of a deeper pullback toward the next demand zone. Volume will be important, as a clear breakout requires stronger participation. Overall, expect choppy movement in the near term before a more decisive trend develops. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.1518 price by 2026 and $0.6729 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Why is Sonic (Prev FTM) down today? Sonic is down today because short-term profit-taking is outweighing buying interest after the recent upside attempt. Price approached resistance near the prior high and was rejected, triggering sellers to step in and cap further gains. Momentum indicators on the 4-hour chart have flattened and turned mildly bearish, suggesting buyers are losing short-term conviction. Additionally, lower trading volume on green candles compared with red ones indicates weaker demand. This, combined with broader market caution in risk assets, has led traders to reduce positions, resulting in intraday downside pressure. Until Sonic reclaims resistance with confirmation, downward moves remain more likely. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $0.5624 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $0.6729. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2032, S could attain a price of about $1.45. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $0.5624 and $1.45, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

In this context, a TradingView analysis shared on January 16 by TradingShot was based on a long-term cycle model that combines halving timelines, moving averages, and Fibonacci time extensions. The analysis suggested that Bitcoin is approaching a key technical test at the daily 200-day moving average ( MA ), a level that has historically triggered the second phase of bear cycles. Past behavior indicates that such rejections often lead to extended downside pressure rather than short-lived pullbacks, signaling a shift from a distribution phase into a deeper retracement. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, the rainbow cycle chart supports this view by aligning price action with halving events and Fibonacci time extensions . The next major time target is the 4.618 Fibonacci extension in the final week of September 2026, a zone that has previously marked cycle lows. At that point, the model projects Bitcoin trading around $60,000, a sharp decline from cycle highs but still consistent with its long-term uptrend. Notably, the outlook added that this projected bottom would occur well ahead of the next halving, estimated for April 2028, meaning the market would remain far from the next profit-taking phase. Bitcoin’s failure to hit $150,000 Additionally, Bitcoin’s failure to reach the upper orange rainbow band in the latest bull cycle above $150,000 reinforces the idea of diminishing returns, with each cycle delivering smaller percentage gains. This bearish outlook comes at a time when Bitcoin has attempted to target the $100,000 level before slightly retreating. The asset briefly reignited bullish optimism earlier this week, mainly driven by institutional inflows after breaking out of a prolonged consolidation near $90,000 and rallying to nearly $98,000. The move raised expectations that traders positioned for sideways or lower prices would be forced to unwind, potentially pushing the cryptocurrency back above the $100,000 mark. However, the momentum has faded just as quickly. Instead of extending the rally, Bitcoin has reversed course and is now showing signs of weakness, increasing the likelihood of a pullback toward the low-$90,000 range. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,123, down about 0.4% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe, the leading digital asset was up more than 5%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a moving average perspective, the 50-day SMA at $90,095 remains below the current price, signaling short-term bullish momentum as Bitcoin trades above this level, potentially indicating near-term upward pressure. In contrast, the 200-day SMA at $105,657 remains above the current price, suggesting longer-term bearish undertones or an ongoing correction from prior highs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s 14-day RSI of 63.30 remains neutral, avoiding overbought territory and implying room for further gains without immediate reversal risks, although it warrants monitoring for shifts in buying strength.

This is coming after UK ministers responded to the backlash faced by Grok, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot, by fast-tracking legislation to ban the generation of non-consensual intimate images. According to the former UK lawmaker, the country is following a “what-a-mole” approach to regulating big technology companies. While there has been increased support for the law, experts have also warned that the changes may not go far to limit the harms posed by generative AI chatbots. “It looks like we are behind the curve, because we are,” says Harriet Harman, a former deputy Labour leader. “And it looks like we’re running to catch up, because we are. And it looks like we’ve got a scattergun approach, because we have.” Former lawmaker says the UK is behind in AI regulation According to the former UK lawmaker, this includes the country failing to clarify what the law should classify as “intimate” imagery. Although in the US, lawmakers have described it as depicting nudity or underwear, backbenchers and ministers have argued that the creation of non-consensual images of women and children in bikinis and wet T-shirts using Grok shows a significant weakness in the approach. Technology secretary Liz Kendall has also noted that the law is being aimed at nudification applications and may not even apply to Grok. According to Clare McGlynn, a professor of law at Durham University, the nudification ban is not a solution that will tackle the generation of sexual images with Grok, noting that it won’t even apply to the chatbot. The offense is designed to apply only to applications developed for the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery. On the other hand, Grok is seen as a general-purpose artificial intelligence model capable of predicting images, text, and code, and would most likely be outside the scope of the law. In a letter to Labour MP Chi Onwurah, Kendall mentioned that Grok might not be covered under the proposals. She mentioned that during the analysis, they identified that not all chatbots were covered under the scope of the law. However, she noted that officials have been commissioned to look into it so as to address the gap. Experts warn about the risks of AI chatbots Last Wednesday, X released a statement, noting that it would geoblock the ability for users to generate images of real people in skimpy outfits, like bikinis, underwear, and similar attire, in areas where it is currently illegal. It remains to be seen if similar images can still be generated using the standalone Grok application or the website. xAI , Grok’s parent company, did not disclose if that would be the case or if the enforcement would cover these parts. The debate is unfolding against rising concerns about violence against women and girls (VAWG) carried out using technologies. Reports claim that around one in 10 recorded offenses involving VAWG already has a digital element, something that experts believe significantly underestimates the true scale. Younger people are prone to more risks as they spend more time online. According to campaigners, artificial intelligence can be a harm accelerant. The group also mentioned that AI allows abuse to be generated and shared on a larger scale. Meanwhile, experts have warned that other AI-chatbot controversies are likely to emerge in the future. Michael Birtwistle, associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute, an AI research body, mentioned that future flashpoints could include children being targeted with sexual interactions from chatbots or AI assistants dispensing questionable health or financial advice to their users.

Most big caps that have been already valuing years of growth are slowing down. Smaller assets that have real utility and those that are underdeveloped tend to exhibit more upside on entering major roadmap events. A recent crypto that attracts attention within this category can be Mutuum Finance, and analysts believe that it can be among the cheapest opportunities available prior to its protocol becoming live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Space Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol which will enable users to provide and issue crypto assets using smart contracts. The project follows a systematic presale system with the fixed pricing stages. The first market entrants bought at $0.01, and the token is being sold at the current stage of Phase 7 at $0.04. The price that is established is assured to be launched at $0.06. The presale has brought up more than $19.8 million and has increased the number of holders to more than 18,800 investors. Over 825 million out of the 4 billion tokens have been bought. Approximately 45.5% or 1.82 billion tokens are to be distributed in presale. Analysts observe that the demand has not been volatile since players are placing bets before the activation window of the protocol as opposed to listing. V1 Launch Mechanics Based on the official X announcement , the V1 protocol is fixed to launch testnet before mainnet. This is significant since lending platforms are usually priced at first when their use becomes evident. Markets can now have real data on which to value rather than make guesses about narrative power when users start to post collateral, borrow money, and repay interest. The deposits will be issued as mtTokens by Mutuum Finance. These tokens are the deposit value and the interest that is generated on borrowers. The model builds supplier yield and promotes holding, rather than selling. Mutuum Finance will also involve a buy and distribute mechanic in the future. Some of the protocol revenue will be spent to purchase MUTM in the open market. MUTM sold at the market is recredited to the users who commit mtTokens at the safety module. This model matches the buy pressure and actual use and not the short-lived hype cycles. Those analysts following the adoption models indicate that at early valuation cycles, MUTM has the potential to reach between $0.18 and $0.24 in case V1 acquires moderate activity. At the current price of $0.04, this would be an increase of between 350% and 500%. These estimates indicate how analysts are setting up scenarios when lending revenues are the basis of a projection and not just sentiment. Roadmap Milestones The main asset of borrowing within the protocol will be stablecoins. Borrowers are able to gain access to liquidity without selling long-term assets. Borrowing of stablecoins usually increases during bull cycles as traders borrow more in order to get leverage as the value of collateral gains. Mutuum Finance also intends to incorporate the Layer 2 networks to minimize the liquidation expenses and enhance the speed of executing the operations. To uphold solvency, liquidations should occur swiftly in the fluctuating markets. The layer 2 support will enhance the likelihood of effective collateral management during such times. Chainlink and fallback valuation Oracle price feeds will ensure precision in valuation during such liquidation events. Post-launch valuation modeling analysts believe that once the stablecoin borrowing and Layer 2 activity goes to magnitude in 2027, MUTM could be trading between $0.26 and $0.30. This is an implication of the fact that range suggests an increase of about 550% to 650% relative to the current presale price of $0.04. Security and Infrastructure Before deployment, a number of security steps have been undertaken at Mutuum Finance. Halborn Security conducted an audit of V1 lending code. CertiK token scan gave 90 out of 100 points to the MUTM token. There is a bug bounty of $50,000 currently in place to find more vulnerabilities prior to mainnet activation. There has also been good participation infrastructure. A leaderboard with rewards of 500$ of MUTM to the best daily contributor is created to encourage contributions. The card payments are encouraged in cases where users want to onboard without going through the complicated wallets. The token is currently valued below $0.05, and V1 is on the verge of launching, so analysts consider that Mutuum Finance can be one of the most inexpensive deals in the new crypto and DeFi lending market in 2026.

Belgium’s KBC Bank has opened regulated crypto trading, Iran’s ecosystem surged past $7.8 billion amid unrest, and a Jefferies strategist warns of quantum computing risks. Together, these developments highlight Bitcoin’s dual role as a growth asset and hedge, while technical charts point toward a possible breakout. Belgium Bank Opens Crypto Trading Belgium’s KBC Bank will allow customers to trade Bitcoin and Ether starting February 16 through its Bolero platform. The move coincides with the full rollout of the Markets in Crypto‑Assets (MiCA) framework, which went live in January 2026. KBC says it’s the first Belgian bank to offer crypto trading directly under its own custodial system, giving retail investors a regulated and secure entry point.

The launch underscores growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin in Europe, even as regulatory details remain in flux. Iran’s $7.8B Crypto Surge Iran’s cryptocurrency ecosystem expanded to $7.78 billion in 2025, with activity peaking during nationwide protests and economic unrest. As the rial collapsed and internet blackouts spread, citizens turned to Bitcoin as a store of value and financial lifeline. Daily withdrawals from exchanges surged, highlighting crypto’s role in bypassing traditional banking restrictions.

BTC Chart Shows Bullish Flag and EMA Support Near $95K Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC is trading near $95,188, holding firm above the $95,150 support zone. The 4‑hour chart shows a clear ascending structure with higher lows and a potential bullish flag formation just below $97,700 resistance. A breakout above this level could open the path toward $99,000 and the psychological $100,500 barrier. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview BTC remains above short‑, medium‑, and long‑term EMAs, all sloping upward, signaling sustained momentum. RSI readings at 57.94 and 53.56 are neutral but lean bullish, leaving room for continuation. Candlestick action adds weight to this view, with a recent bullish engulfing pattern near $93,000 and small‑bodied candles suggesting consolidation before another push higher. Candlestick behavior supports this view. Recent formations include a bullish engulfing pattern near the $93,000 level and a series of small-bodied candles, potentially signaling a pause before continuation. If price holds above $95,150 and breaks above $97,700 with volume confirmation, traders may consider long setups targeting $99,000 and $100,500, with stop-losses below $93,000. If price holds above $95,150 and breaks $97,700 with volume confirmation, traders may eye long setups targeting $99,000–$100,500, with stops below $93,000. With sentiment stabilizing and adoption expanding, Bitcoin looks poised for a fresh bullish leg. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $30.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013585 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

According to the official website of Ukraine’s cyber police unit, two Ukrainian nationals were revealed as active members of the group, with an unnamed Russian citizen as the alleged organizer. That individual has been placed on an international wanted list through Interpol, German authorities confirmed. The actions came through a joint investigation by Ukraine, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Europol , which was also part of the supporting agencies in the probe, said Black Basta is one of the most dangerous cybercrime operations in recent years. Russian-based ransomware network involved in years of cyberattacks According to Ukraine’s investigative unit, Black Basta has been active since at least early 2022. The group is accused of launching ransomware attacks against corporations, hospitals, and public institutions in Western countries it considers “economically viable.” The group supposedly caused damages estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros between 2022 and 2025 on industrial and healthcare organizations in Europe and the United States, and distributed private information to hacking networks. The two Ukrainian suspects had mounted their base in western Ukraine, working with other hackers to breach the security of corporate systems and extract login credentials. After obtaining employee authorization data, they used it to enter internal company systems and expand admin privileges and access to company files. The stolen access was used to disable critical systems, and malicious software was deployed to encrypt data for the attackers to demand ransom in exchange for restoring access. Raids in western Ukraine uncover digital and crypto evidence As reported by the Ukrainian police, authorized searches were carried out at residences in the Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv regions, suspected to have been where the cyber criminals lived. During the raids, officers seized crypto , although they did not disclose the value or type of digital assets seized. The authorities had previously conducted searches at the request of foreign partners in Kharkiv and surrounding areas, which targeted other suspected group members. The German investigations team believes a Russian national founded and led the group, and he was part of another notorious ransomware and cyber-extortion operation. At the request of Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office and Frankfurt prosecutors, Interpol channels were used to issue the wanted notice. “Black Basta as a top-tier cybercrime threat, Law enforcement agencies from multiple countries and a significant threat to global cybersecurity,” Ukraine cyber police wrote in its statement . Concluding its report on the case, the agencies reiterated that no single country could dismantle such networks alone and urged more nations to open doors for sharing intelligence reports. Ukraine and Russia’s crime syndicate extends to Austria Almost two months ago, Austrian police arrested two suspects linked to a fatal crypto robbery, identified as Ukrainian men aged 19 and 45. The victim was a 21-year-old Ukrainian national whose body was discovered burnt shortly after midnight hour mark of November 26. The remains were found inside a burned Mercedes with Ukrainian license plates in the Donaustadt district of Vienna. When emergency responders arrived at the scene, they found the charred vehicle, but forensic police later recovered a melted gasoline canister from the back seat. Per the reports of local news outlets, the crime began earlier that night near the SO/Vienna hotel at an underground parking garage. Security footage showed a confrontation between the victim and two men, with witnesses reporting a loud exchange of words in the garage. A hotel guest contacted the front desk, who then alerted police, but officers got there well after the individuals had already left the scene. The victim was supposedly forced into his own vehicle and driven to the Donaustadt district. He was then assaulted and forced to surrender passwords to two cryptocurrency wallets that were later emptied. Austrian media reported the victim suffered severe injuries during the assault and died before the vehicle was set on fire.

Key Takeaways: Newrez will begin counting certain crypto holdings as qualifying assets for mortgages starting in February. Borrowers will be able to use Bitcoin, Ether and stablecoins without selling them, subject to risk adjustments. The move targets younger buyers and aligns with ongoing US policy discussions on crypto in mortgage underwriting. The change is expected to take effect in February and will apply across the lender’s non-agency products, including home purchases, refinancings and investment properties. Newrez to Count Bitcoin, Ether and Stablecoins as Mortgage Assets Under the new approach, Newrez will allow eligible crypto holdings to be considered alongside traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, removing a long-standing requirement for borrowers to liquidate their digital assets before applying. At launch, the lender said it will recognize Bitcoin, Ether, spot exchange-traded funds backed by those assets, and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. The assets must be held with US-regulated crypto exchanges or fintech platforms, brokerages, or nationally chartered banks. Newrez said crypto valuations used in underwriting may be adjusted to reflect market volatility, while borrowers will still need to cover closing costs and make mortgage payments in US dollars. The lender emphasized that the policy is designed to integrate crypto within existing risk controls rather than overhaul its underwriting standards. Chief commercial officer Leslie Gillin said the decision reflects changing investor behavior, particularly among younger buyers. JUST IN: Major US lender Newrez to recognise crypto for mortgage qualification. Bitcoin is the new collateral pic.twitter.com/1GEyMzHuoT — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 16, 2026 About 45% of Gen Z and Millennial investors hold cryptocurrency, Gillin said, adding that recognizing digital assets could help broaden access to homeownership for groups that have struggled to enter the housing market. Newrez’s move comes as US policymakers continue to debate how cryptocurrencies should factor into mortgage risk assessments. In June 2025, the Federal Housing Finance Agency directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to study how crypto assets could be considered in single-family mortgage underwriting without first being converted into dollars. Shortly afterward, Cynthia Lummis introduced the 21st Century Mortgage Act, which would codify that directive into law. Lummis argued that housing affordability challenges are increasingly affecting younger Americans, many of whom hold a significant share of their savings in digital assets. The bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, where it has yet to advance. Interactive Brokers Enables 24/7 Account Funding With Stablecoins Interactive Brokers has expanded its crypto services by allowing clients to fund brokerage accounts with stablecoins that are automatically converted into US dollars. The new feature enables 24/7 deposits using USDC across multiple blockchain networks through a partnership with zerohash, removing delays tied to traditional wire transfers. Once received, stablecoins are converted into dollars and credited directly to client accounts, letting investors begin trading within minutes. Interactive Brokers said support for Ripple USD and PayPal USD will launch next week, building on USDC funding that was first introduced for retail clients in December. The brokerage said the move addresses a key friction point for global investors, as wire transfers can be slow and costly.

57239725,https://timestabloid.com/?p=95191,1768644056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 Penny Cryptos That Could Lead the 2026 Bull Run,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-penny-cryptos-that-could-lead-the-2026-bull-run/,"The next crypto bull cycle is already taking shape, and attention is shifting toward affordable tokens that combine community power, real utility, and mass adoption potential. Penny cryptos have always been magnets for retail investors because small price movements can create outsized returns. As markets mature, projects that blend hype with infrastructure are positioned to dominate 2026. Among the leading contenders are Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), and the rising newcomer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , whose presale momentum is drawing serious interest from long-term builders and yield-focused users. The project has a total supply of 4 billion tokens and has already generated around $19.80 million across all presale phases combined. The current presale price stands at $0.04 in phase 7, where 180 million tokens are allocated and 7% of this phase has already been sold. More than 18,850 holders are already participating across all phases, showing strong early demand. The token remains at a discounted stage, meaning investors who buy now are positioned better than those who wait for later phases when the price will rise again. For example, someone purchasing at $0.04 in phase 7 will pay less than buyers in phase 8 at $0.045 or phase 9 at $0.05, creating a clear advantage for early entry. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) entered the market as a playful experiment but evolved into one of the largest retail communities in crypto. Millions of holders, constant social activity, and regular ecosystem upgrades keep SHIB relevant even in quiet markets. Its Layer-2 network Shibarium is designed to lower fees and support real applications, which is gradually shifting SHIB from pure meme status toward utility-based relevance. Looking toward 2026, several market analysts expect SHIB to benefit from renewed retail participation during the next bull run. If broader market liquidity returns and Shibarium adoption expands, SHIB is positioned to revisit previous highs and potentially push beyond them. A realistic path suggests SHIB could move toward the $0.00005 to $0.00008 range by 2026, driven by burn mechanisms, transaction growth, and stronger exchange activity. While this would still be a fraction of a cent, the%age gains would be significant for long-term holders. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) stands apart from most penny tokens because it focuses on academic research, scalability, and real-world use cases rather than short-term hype. Its proof-of-stake design makes it energy efficient, and its layered architecture allows continuous upgrades without breaking existing systems. Over the past few years, Cardano (ADA) has expanded into smart contracts, decentralized applications, and defi crypto solutions that attract developers and institutions. By 2026, Cardano (ADA) is expected to be far more mature in terms of adoption. With improvements like Hydra scaling, better interoperability, and deeper DeFi liquidity, ADA could see substantial price growth. Many market projections place ADA in a range between $3 and $6 during a strong bull market, especially if institutional partnerships increase and network usage accelerates. Unlike meme coins, Cardano (ADA) grows through steady development rather than viral trends. This makes it a safer bet for investors who want long-term stability combined with high upside potential. In a mixed portfolio of penny cryptos, ADA represents reliability while still offering strong appreciation potential in the next cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters this landscape with a clear mission: to build a lending and borrowing ecosystem that rewards real participation. Unlike speculative tokens, its value is anchored in utility. The platform is developing its V1 of the protocol on the Sepolia Testnet, which will include a core liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial assets such as ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral use. A key innovation is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending models, which include Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users interact directly with a smart contract liquidity pool, making deposits and withdrawals simple and automated. Interest rates adjust based on supply and demand, ensuring efficiency. In the P2P model, lenders and borrowers connect more directly, allowing customized terms while still using blockchain security for settlement. Together, these systems give users flexibility, transparency, and control. Security has been a major focus for the project. In November 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts underwent a formal audit by Halborn, a respected blockchain security firm. The review identified six issues, including one high-severity finding, all of which were fully resolved before final approval. Halborn confirmed that 100% of the reported findings were remediated, strengthening confidence as the project moves toward its official launch. Growth for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be driven by real usage. Every lending, borrowing, or staking activity will create demand for the token. Users who deposit assets will receive mtTokens representing their share of the pool and earned interest. These mtTokens can also be used as collateral for further borrowing. At the same time, mtToken holders will be able to stake them in special smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards. The platform will also introduce a buy-and-distribute mechanism that supports long-term price growth. A portion of revenue generated from lending and borrowing will be used to repurchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to stakers, creating continuous buy pressure and encouraging loyalty. As activity increases, more revenue flows back into token purchases, reinforcing upward momentum. A beta version of the platform is expected to launch alongside the official release. This early access will allow users to test lending, borrowing, and staking features before full deployment. As more participants interact with the system, confidence and word-of-mouth promotion are expected to rise, which should naturally support price movement shortly after launch. Community Incentives and Daily rewards Community engagement is another pillar of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already built a following of more than 12,000 on Twitter. A $100K giveaway is going on, with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The project dashboard is already live, allowing investors to track holdings and calculate returns in real time. A Top 50 leaderboard rewards the largest investors with bonus tokens, while a new 24-hour leaderboard offers a daily $500 MUTM prize to the top-ranked user who completes at least one transaction before the reset at 00:00 UTC. When comparing the three projects, each serves a different purpose. Shiba Inu (SHIB) offers cultural momentum and retail excitement. Cardano (ADA) delivers technological strength and institutional credibility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines real DeFi utility with community rewards, audited security, and a growing ecosystem that directly ties usage to token demand.

Time Is Running Out,https://timestabloid.com/xrpl-validator-owning-xrp-will-be-a-dream-to-many-time-is-running-out/,"XRP often appears widely distributed on paper. Wallet counts suggest millions of holders. However, a closer look tells a different story. Recent data shared by an XRP Ledger validator, 24HrsCrypto (@24hrscrypto1), challenges mass ownership and shifts attention to where meaningful XRP supply sits. The distinction is important because raw wallet numbers hide concentration. They also shape expectations around future demand. When ownership narrows, market dynamics change. Owning XRP will be a dream to many..and time is running out. When you strip out dust wallets and count meaningful XRP holders (1,000 – 500,000 XRP) you’re left with ONLY 1.2 million accounts. Even if you assume 1 wallet = 1 human (which is generous)… 1,118,000 ÷ 8.2bn =… https://t.co/O7RiWfDMrw pic.twitter.com/a6bAB141Gc — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) January 14, 2026 What the Wallet Data Shows The charts highlight wallet distribution , showing XRP account balances by range. Millions of wallets hold between 0 and 20 XRP. Another large block sits below 1,000 XRP. These wallets add little weight to ownership analysis. They represent dust balances, inactive accounts, or testing wallets. Once those are removed, the picture tightens fast. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 500,000 XRP total roughly 1.2 million accounts. 24HrsCrypto described this group as “meaningful XRP holders.” He went further. “Even if you assume 1 wallet = 1 human,” he wrote, that group equals “0.0135% of humanity.” The math leads to a clear ratio. “That’s 1 out of every 7,395 people.” The commonly cited figure of over 4 million XRP wallets remains technically accurate. It just lacks context. As 24HrsCrypto put it, “The ‘4M XRP holders’ number is inflated by millions of 0 – 1,000 XRP dust wallets.” This makes XRP holders a class among the population . Concentration Changes the Narrative The charts also show where XRP supply concentrates. Wallets holding 10,000 to 100,000 XRP control billions of tokens. Larger tiers above that hold even more, despite far fewer accounts, and these whales are constantly moving billions of tokens within the ecosystem. This structure points to ownership depth rather than breadth. XRP does not trade like a retail-saturated asset. It trades like one still building its holder base. That matters for price behavior. It also matters for liquidity shifts during periods of increased demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Comes Next for XRP? Narrow ownership creates optionality. New participants do not need to replace existing holders. They only need to join a relatively small group. That dynamic favors expansion phases over saturation. As infrastructure matures, access improves. Custodial platforms, institutional rails, and regulatory clarity all lower friction. Each step widens the potential holder pool without diluting existing supply concentration. The charts show XRP supply already positioned. Large balances sit idle across defined tiers. If demand increases, supply does not need to be reshuffled across millions of wallets. It can move through far fewer hands. That structure supports stability during accumulation phases. It also allows sharp upward repricing when conviction builds. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The government and Holocaust memorial institutions have asked social media platforms to stop the spread of fake images, which they claim are distorting and trivializing history. Concerns were expressed by concentration camp memorial sites and documentation centers in a recent letter, criticizing the surge in so-called AI slop or falsified images, around the Nazis’ killing of more than six million Jews in Germany during World War II. These images include emotional illustrations of invented incidents, such as meetings of concentration camp inmates and their liberators or children behind barbed wire fences. Germany wants to halt the spread of false AI holocaust images In the letter sent by the organizations, they noted that AI-generated content distorts history by trivializing serious events that happened a long time ago. They mentioned that such images could help fuel mistrust among users of authentic historical documents. Wolfram Weimer, Germany’s state minister for culture and media, mentioned that he supported the steps and efforts taken by the memorial institutions in this case, revealing that it is the right step to take. Wolfram also mentioned that he supported their decision to have AI-generated imagery of the ancient incidents marked and, in the cases where necessary, removed from social media platforms. He mentioned that it is a matter of respect for millions of people who were killed and persecuted under the Nazi Germany regime of terror. According to the memorial institutions’ letter, they noted that the creators of the imagery appeared to use it to generate attention online and earn money. The organizations also mentioned that the perpetrators also partly intended to dilute facts, shift victim and perpetrator roles, and spread revisionist narratives. The institutions include memorial centers for Belsen, Buchenwald, Dachau, and other concentration camps where Jews, as well as others, including Roma and Sinti people, were killed. They asked social media platforms to move proactively against fake AI imagery around the Holocaust rather than waiting for users to report it. Holocaust organizations want AI-generated images labeled In addition, they asked the platforms to label them clearly, as they believe it will prevent the users who generated the images from being able to monetize them. The spread of low-quality AI slop, which includes fake text, images, or video, has raised alarm among many experts. They believe it would pollute the information landscape and make it hard for users to separate the truth from falsehood. The incident follows the one that AI firms, notably Elon Musk’s xAI, which owns chatbot Grok, are currently grappling with. The company has been under pressure over the last couple of weeks over certain users generating thousands of sexualized deepfake images of women and minors and spreading them across several social media platforms. The menace has seen several leaders of countries call the company to order, with others asking them to develop the appropriate safeguards to tackle the incidents. Countries like Indonesia have also announced a temporary ban on the chatbot till all is resolved. Meanwhile, the platform has confirmed that it will geoblock the ability of Grok and X users to generate deepfakes of people in locations where the actions are branded as illegal. However, it remains to be seen if the new safeguards will apply to its standalone application or its website. It also remains to be seen if the measures will stop users from generating these kinds of images or will push them to look for new ways to access the service.

Most larger-cap alts are sluggish as well, with little to no movement from ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, and ADA. XMR, though, has plunged hard after its recent rally. BTC Calms at $95K The primary cryptocurrency had a quiet previous weekend but went on the offensive on Monday, surging from $90,000 to $92,000 only to be stopped on a couple of occasions. It finally broke through that barrier on Tuesday and kept climbing to a new multi-month peak of $98,000 on Wednesday evening. This meant that it had added $8,000 in just a few days, and roughly $10,000 since the start of the year. Following such an impressive increase, BTC was due for a pullback, which transpired on Thursday and Friday. The culmination took place yesterday when BTC slipped below $94,500 after reports that Kevin Hessett won’t be nominated by Trump to be the next Fed Chair. Nevertheless, bitcoin bounced off and has remained above $95,000 since then. Its market cap has stalled at $1.9 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins stands still at 57.4%. BTCUSD Jan 17.

Ethereum continues to trade sideways around $3,300, while XRP has defended the $2.05 support.

Monero’s token went on the run in the past week or so, surging to a new all-time high of almost $800. However, it was rejected there and now struggles at $620 after another 12% decline in the past day. ICP has also plunged hard daily, losing 9% of value.

Early Saturday morning, a member of program staff, Jeffrey Weichsel, announced on X that xAI is hiring experienced accountants to help train Grok on tax and accounting matters. “Do you want to prepare taxes for the next 3 months, or would you rather do something meaningful with purpose, helping create a truth-seeking AI that roots out corruption, fraud, and waste? Apply now,” he wrote , sharing a Greenhouse website link to the job application. xAI is training Grok on US taxes As seen in the Greenhouse job link, the Elon Musk-led firm xAI said it is searching for an “AI Accounting tutor” who would help improve Grok’s understanding of accounting, financial reporting, and tax-related issues. They would be required to train the chatbot using proprietary software to label and curate high-quality data, while supporting the development of new AI tasks together with xAI’s technical staff. According to the job description, the trainer will select and solve complex accounting problems from real-world corporate environments like consolidations, internal controls, and compliance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Candidates will also refine annotation tools used in AI training and regularly interpret and execute tasks based on instructions, and critique Grok’s responses to mould its accuracy and consistency in accounting scenarios. Applicants must have at least three years of experience at a Big Four accounting firm working on corporate or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clients. Alternatively, they may qualify through senior corporate positions such as controller, assistant controller, or technical accounting manager at enterprises with reporting requirements. Moreover, the company issued educational requirements that included a master’s degree or doctorate in institutional accounting, or equivalent credentials as a licensed Certified Public Accountant. They must also be comfortable handling accounting resources like regulatory filings, financial databases, and enterprise resource planning systems. Teaching experience and published academic work in accounting journals were also listed as desirable attributes. The position is based either in Palo Alto, California, or on a fully remote basis, and the compensation would range from $45 to $100 per hour, depending on experience, education, and location. However, xAI said it cannot hire candidates based in Wyoming or Illinois and does not offer visa sponsorship. xAI training plea grows amid deepfake lawsuits The hiring push comes at a time when xAI is facing lawsuits over Grok’s generation of sexualized and nonconsensual images. Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, filed a lawsuit against xAI in New York on Thursday, blaming the firm for allowing Grok to generate sexually explicit images of her that were shared on X. “X users dug up photos of St Clair fully clothed at 14 years old and requested Grok undress her and put her in a bikini. Grok obliged,” St Clair’s attorneys surmised, adding that the imagery generated was “de facto non-consensual” and Grok’s developers had “explicit knowledge” that consent was absent. xAI has denied responsibility and countersued Ms St Clair, claiming she violated the company’s terms of service. Even with all the drama going on, the firm announced it raised $20 billion in a funding round held last week, surpassing its initial $15 billion target.

His remarks come at a time when the U.S. crypto industry is facing heightened uncertainty over how future regulation will be structured and enforced. Coinbase’s Withdrawal Shakes Legislative Momentum The debate intensified when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the exchange could no longer support the CLARITY Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at clarifying regulatory oversight of digital assets. The announcement came just hours before a scheduled markup by the Senate Banking Committee , disrupting what had appeared to be coordinated industry engagement with lawmakers. Armstrong described the draft legislation as “materially worse than the status quo,” arguing that it introduced new risks rather than resolving existing regulatory ambiguity. His criticism focused on provisions he said would effectively prohibit tokenized equities, impose restrictions on stablecoin incentives, and raise unresolved privacy issues. The decision marked a sharp reversal from Coinbase’s earlier participation in discussions surrounding the bill. Garlinghouse’s Response Garlinghouse weighed in on the issue during a panel discussion at the CfC St. Moritz conference in Switzerland on January 15. The session examined whether crypto-native firms can coexist with traditional public markets, a topic that closely mirrors the broader regulatory debate unfolding in Washington. During the discussion, Garlinghouse acknowledged that Coinbase’s move caught him off guard. He said he was surprised by how forcefully the exchange rejected the legislation so late in the process. Nevertheless, he stopped short of dismissing Armstrong’s objections, suggesting that several of the concerns raised deserved fair consideration. While recognizing the validity of some of Coinbase’s criticisms, disagreement over legislative language should not derail broader efforts to achieve regulatory clarity . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Industry Support Remains Despite Setback Coinbase’s withdrawal does not represent a collapse of industry support. Garlinghouse revealed that several major players, including Ripple, Circle, Kraken, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, remain committed to working with policymakers to improve the legislation rather than abandoning it. The CLARITY Act aims to define the respective roles of the SEC and CFTC, an issue that has long contributed to regulatory uncertainty for crypto firms operating in the U.S. Garlinghouse had previously expressed optimism about the bill’s potential before it stalled following Coinbase’s exit. While the industry has not yet reached a consensus on the path forward, much of the sector continues to advocate for engagement rather than withdrawal from the regulatory process.

The transaction involved a withdrawal from the Kraken exchange, showing 20,000 ETH moved to the firm’s wallet. Based on on-chain data, withdrawals made by whales from exchanges have historically suggested accumulation rather than liquidation. The withdrawal reflects the intent to move funds to a cold storage for long-term holding rather than immediate sale. Bitmine ETH accumulation hits 4.07M ETH Bitmine recently accumulated another 24,068 ETH on Wednesday, valued at approximately $80.57 million. The firm now holds 4.07 million ETH worth approximately $13.37 billion and represents 3.36% of ETH’s total supply. Tom Lee’s firm now ranks as the second-largest crypto treasury, behind Strategy, which holds 687,410 BTC, worth approximately $65.4 billion. It seems that Tom Lee( @fundstrat )'s #Bitmine bought another 20,000 $ETH ($65.4M) from #Kraken 3 hours ago. https://t.co/TQmP08vgjv https://t.co/DPN3ZPwXAk pic.twitter.com/ovs3VUqJu6 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 16, 2026 The Ethereum token has jumped over 6% over the past week following a series of accumulations recorded by the treasury firm. At the time of publication, ETH was down 0.64% to $3,293. The recent moves follow Bitmines’ plans to launch its MAVAN (Made in America Validator Network) staking solution this year, in order to maintain its lead as a global crypto treasury firm. Tom Lee, chairman of Bitmine , pitched the MAVAN solution as a design strategy that moves the treasury firm from accumulation to monetization through validator operations. “We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN). This will be the ‘best-in-class’ solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026.” – Tom Lee , Chairman of Bitmine The launch of the MAVAN solution will help move his firm to become the largest staking provider across the crypto landscape, according to the Chairman. During the recent annual meeting on 15th January, Tom Lee urged Bitmine’s shareholders to vote to increase the authorized shares. He explained that Bitmine’s charter has an unusual feature requiring 50% of all outstanding shares to support a share increase. According to him, the clause limits the authorized share increase; therefore, there is a need to pursue the increment immediately to avoid slowing accumulation. Bitmine’s stock jumps over 4% this week Bitmine’s current total staked ETH stands at 2,155,656, valued at $7 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence data . This represents an increase of more than half a million since last week. So far, the CESR (Composite Ethereum staking rate) is 2.81% according to Quatrefoil data . Tom Lee outlined that if ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners, the firm could realize an annual staking fee of $374 million at a 2.81% CESR. Bitmine’s stock has jumped 0.94% today following the news of accumulation trading at $31.16. The stock has recorded an over 4% increase, with an average volume of $45.39 million over the past five days following a series of accumulations. Meanwhile, Ethereum-focused treasuries hold approximately 13.1 million ETH , including those focused on staking and ETF strategies. Sharplink is the largest competitor to Bitmine, with current accumulation standing at 863.02 K ETH valued at $2.84 billion, followed by The Ether Machine treasury firm. The Ether Machine now holds 496.1K ETH, valued at $1.64 billion. U.S. Ethereum ETFs now hold approximately 6.31 million ETH valued at approximately $20.67 billion. That is roughly 5.2% of the total ETH supply. Based on data delivered by SoSoValue, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted $12.94 billion since its launch, representing more than 50% of the market share across ETH ETFs.

The flagship cryptocurrency reignited debates about the current phase of the market in its latest attempt to reclaim its six-figure valuation. Having surpassed the previously formidable $94,000 technical level, the Bitcoin price seemed set to cross the $100,000 mark again. However, recent on-chain evaluation has brought focus on an ongoing phenomenon among a specific set of investors in the market. Bitcoin Price Action Could Hinge On STH Realized Price In a January 16 post on the X platform, pseudonymous crypto analyst Darkfost revealed that the average realized price of the Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs) is another key level to watch. This price level represents the average price where the most recent (1-3 months) set of BTC investors acquired their coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tailwind: Cathie Wood Sees ‘Reaganomics On Steroids’ Ahead According to data highlighted by Darkfost, this STH realized price currently sits at around $102,000, meaning that the majority of the Bitcoin short-term investors are at a loss. The market pundit noted that this particular evaluation is adjusted to account for the 800,000 BTC recently moved by Coinbase. Darkfost noted that, as the Bitcoin price approached the realized price of the short-term holders, the investors are caught between two primary choices. It is either this group of investors holds and hopes for further upside, or they exit once they break even. Given that they are the most reactive set of investors, the Bitcoin short-term holders have not hesitated in taking short-term profits, as indicated by the latest exchange inflows. Darkfost, however, noted that the STH realized price level will be crucial to watch once all the profit-taking is done. Darkfost said that the Bitcoin price trading below this cost basis historically represents a good accumulation opportunity. Nevertheless, the analyst warned that bear market periods should be excluded, as short-term holders tend to witness prolonged drawdowns and pain during this season. STH Cost Basis Key For Momentum To Re-Accelerate Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish agreed in a recent post on X that the STH average realized price is a key inflection point. According to the market pundit, the Bitcoin price reclaiming this cost basis would signal that recent buyers are back in profit. Beamish stated that reclaiming the STH realized price would be necessary for bullish momentum to re-accelerate, while failure to do so would keep the BTC market in recovery mode. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around at $95,300, reflecting no significant change in the past day.

At the same time, market charts show mixed short-term forecasts for NVDA and renewed focus on the Ethereum–Nvidia ratio as traders assess shifting relative momentum. Jefferies Lifts Nvidia Target to $275 as CES Pipeline Extends to 2028 Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis raised the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $275 from $250 and kept a Buy rating on the stock. He pointed to the company’s rollout of new accelerator builds and the related model roadmap, which he said now stretches through 2028. Curtis framed the update around fresh product signals coming out of CES and the start of the new year. He said the expanded roadmap supports Jefferies’ higher valuation view as Nvidia pushes deeper into next generation data center demand. Nvidia Forecast Signals Near-Term Volatility as Longer Outlook Stays Mixed A price forecast chart for Nvidia shares shows uneven momentum heading into early 2026, with short-term signals pointing higher while longer horizons remain softer. The model projects a five-day price of about $188.82, marking a modest upside from recent levels. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast and Price Prediction 2026 to 2027. Source: CoinCodex However, the tone shifts when extending the view. The one-month and three-month forecasts edge lower, both clustering near $182.60 to $182.70. That divergence suggests near-term resilience followed by cooling momentum as the timeline stretches out. Meanwhile, the longer-range outlook remains gated, with six-month, one-year, and 2030 projections locked. Still, the visible price path shows Nvidia trading in a wide range through late 2025, peaking above $200 before sliding back toward the mid-$180s. As a result, the chart reflects a market balancing strong recent gains against expectations of consolidation in the months ahead. Ethereum–Nvidia Ratio Chart Highlights Fresh Breakout and Retest After Years-Long Downtrend A TradingView chart shared on X tracks the weekly ETHUSD NVDA ratio and marks two prior peaks, labeled “2018 top (January)” and “2021 top (May).” The chart draws a long, descending red trendline from those highs and shows the ratio breaking above that line twice, with a “breakout!” label near the 2020–2021 period and another “breakout!” label near 2025.

During a virtual forum on Thursday, Nadine Chakar stated that DTCC values interoperability and is not in the business of creating a setting where technical constraints prevent digital assets from moving smoothly between blockchains. Chakar said in a statement, “We’re not building walled gardens.” She added, “Interoperability, for me, is being able to move things seamlessly from one chain to another, without risk or extra expenses.” Chakar added that Messaging protocols that facilitate communication within the traditional financial system may one day become a relic of the past. However, they will serve DTCC well as the company moves forward into a world where “every single day, you’ve got somebody launching a new L1,” she added. DTCC expands tokenized securities across multiple blockchains Chakar confirmed that DTCC is dedicated to collaborating with the institutional finance and digital assets sector on interoperability . However , her remarks highlighted the careful approach the incumbent is adopting as it enters a market where North Korea has stolen billions of dollars through sophisticated cyberattacks. To successfully tokenize digital assets, DTCC signaled last month that it will partner with Canton Network, a permissioned blockchain designed specifically for institutions. The firm’s managing director, Brian Steele, explained that the decision to partner with Canton Network was in response to Wall Street’s operational demands by providing after-hours financing and enhancing market makers’ liquidity. According to Steele, each blockchain will likely have distinct features and an environment that make it suitable for its intended use. However, Steele noted that DTCC will use evaluation criteria for future expansions, including security and resilience, while also taking customer demand into account. “DTCC’s partnership with Digital Asset and the Canton Network is a strategic step forward as we collaborate across the industry to build a digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges the traditional and digital financial ecosystems and provides unmatched scalability and safety.” – Frank La Salla , CEO of DTCC. Frank further claimed that the partnership develops a path for bringing real-world, high-value tokenization use cases to market, beginning with U.S. Treasury securities and eventually extending to a wide range of DTC-eligible assets across network providers. However, several crypto-natives criticized the concept. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, a digital asset securities company funded by BlackRock, cast doubt on the tokens’ status as representations of protected assets rather than “native” to the network. In response, DTCC reiterated that its top objective is to allow customers to select from a variety of blockchains, as long as they adhere to strict security and institutional resiliency standards. Apart from Canton , DTCC announced it intends to provide tokenized securities on “AppChain,” an open-source, permissioned network for apps that is compatible with Ethereum . SEC approves DTCC’s expanded ACS Triparty clearing service While DTCC advances its tokenized securities strategy on multiple blockchains, the firm is simultaneously expanding its traditional clearing services. On January 7, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized DTCC to offer the ACS Triparty Service as part of its current Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Agent Clearing Service (ACS) offering. This action marked another phase in the organization’s efforts to optimize both traditional and digital financial infrastructure. The U.S. securities settlement firm revealed that FICC filed a regulation with the SEC to provide the ACS Triparty Service in September 2025. The company said that, with SEC approval, FICC is now able to provide Agent Clearing Members and their Executing Firm Customers with a Triparty Agent Clearing Service. In particular, DTCC stated that FICC’s Agent Clearing Members will be able to submit for clearing eligible triparty repo transactions between their Executing Firm Customers and either the Agent Clearing Member (“done-with”) or another Government Securities Division (GSD) Netting Member. FICC will use BNY’s global collateral infrastructure to provide the ACS Triparty Service in order to facilitate both “done-with” and “done-away” cleared triparty repo trades, according to the U.S. securities settlement firm.

The metal briefly climbed above record highs at $93 earlier in the week before pulling back. That move marked a historic breakout that pushed silver into price discovery. Market participants now focus on whether the $90 level can act as support. Can this zone hold under pressure? Pullback Follows Shift in Risk Sentiment Silver prices have eased inthe last 24 hours as investors rotate toward risk assets. Comments from U.S. President Donald Trump helped calm geopolitical concerns after he signaled a step back from potential military action following assurances of reduced violence abroad. Those remarks softened demand for safe-haven assets across the board. Market confidence also improved after Trump confirmed he has no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . That stance reduced concerns about central bank independence, which had supported precious metals during recent uncertainty. At the same time, the absence of immediate new tariff actions on strategic products helped cool trade tensions. Together, these developments pressured silver in the short term. Macro Forces Still Shape Price Action Despite the pullback, broader macro conditions continue to influence silver trading. Expectations for higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates weigh on non-yielding assets. Recent employment data showed resilience in the U.S. labor market, reinforcing the case for restrictive monetary policy. Elevated bond yields continue to compete with precious metals for capital. Even so, investors remain alert. Federal Reserve communications and geopolitical developments still carry the power to shift sentiment quickly. Short-term profit-taking explains much of the current move, rather than a fundamental change in demand dynamics. Volatility remains part of the story. Investor Demand and Search Interest Surge Silver prices have already climbed about 25% in early 2026 , following a near-150% gain in 2025. That momentum has drawn widespread attention. Online search interest for silver doubled after the $90 breakout, reflecting growing retail and institutional engagement. Why does this matter? Attention often follows capital, and recent data show strong participation. Source: Google Trends Vanda data revealed that retail investors spent $921.8 million on silver-linked ETFs over the past month. The iShares Silver Trust recorded 169 consecutive days of positive inflows, a record streak. Researchers at Vanda described the trend as structural accumulation rather than speculative chasing. They noted that investors now treat silver as a core macro asset, not a short-term trade. Source: Vanda via X Physical Markets Add Another Layer Physical demand also plays a role. Heavy buying in 2025 led to rising stockpiles in U.S. warehouses, which disrupted traditional global silver flows. London, the historic hub for silver trading, faced tighter availability as a result. These shifts followed concerns about potential U.S. tariffs on precious metals, which prompted buyers to secure supply early. Although tariff threats eased this week, inventory patterns continue to influence pricing behavior. Technical Signals Point to Ongoing Correction From a technical perspective, silver shows signs of a corrective phase rather than a trend reversal. Prices approach a descending trendline on shorter timeframes, with resistance near the $91.00 to $90.80 zone. Analysts monitor support around $88.50, with deeper demand zones near $86.00 where prior buying emerged. Price structure remains bearish in the short term, though broader momentum still reflects strength. Source: TradingView via X CoinCodex forecasts suggest a possible price continuation toward $122 by mid-February 2026, after the current short-term corrective phase. Silver recorded green sessions on 83% of days over the last 30 days, alongside elevated volatility. That combination highlights an active, crowded market. As silver consolidates after its $90 breakout, investors continue to watch sentiment, macro signals, and technical levels. The rally captured global attention.

Recently, the suppliers had been working nonstop in anticipation of more than a million orders from China, aiming to meet March delivery targets . This week, however, Chinese customs officials informed agents that shipments of the H200 would not be allowed into the country. Government authorities also warned local technology companies not to acquire the chips unless required, without specifying whether the ban is temporary or permanent. Analysts say China wants to foster local chip development Despite eager Chinese demand for Nvidia H200 chips, analysts suggest Beijing could be considering restrictions to advance local chip development or strengthen its negotiating position with the U.S. Some also claim the government wants to regulate which organizations can obtain top-tier computing resources and for what purposes, particularly in matters of national interest. Earlier, Washington had restricted H200 shipments over fears they might give China an advantage in technology and defense. However, on Tuesday, officials from the Department of Commerce permitted Nvidia to sell its high-end AI chips in China, provided there’s enough supply in the US. Before this, in December, President Trump had said he would only allow Nvidia to supply its H200 processors to designated customers in China and impose a 25% fee , stressing that he intended to protect national security and the nation’s AI dominance. Over the course of 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lobbied U.S. officials to allow sales of Nvidia’s powerful chips to China, arguing that global market participation is key to America’s competitive edge. Thus, the firm on Tuesday welcomed the recent approval, saying it will benefit US manufacturing and jobs. Nonetheless, the green light came with conditions: chips must pass independent testing, sales to Chinese clients are capped relative to U.S. buyers, military use is restricted, and certain amounts must remain for domestic use. Plus, the recent Chinese block on shipments only complicates the matter further. Taiwan-produced H200 chips still have to pass through the US for testing Current events also add another layer to a complex scenario in which the U.S.-designed, Taiwan-manufactured H200 chips can now be exported to China, with the U.S. government reportedly receiving part of the profits. Rather than being shipped straight from Taiwan to China, the U.S. government noted that the chips first go through a U.S. lab for testing, where a 25% tariff is imposed. This also affects AMD’s MI325X processor. Analysts are split over whether selling the H200 to China makes strategic sense. Supporters argue it could slow China’s domestic chip development, while critics highlight its potential use in weapons systems. According to Austin Lyons, a semiconductor analyst, China is concerned about its over-dependence on Nvidia, but local companies are expected to continue pursuing H200 chips until homegrown versions advance. Nvidia, he added, will be glad to gain revenue from China, even with lower margins caused by the U.S. government’s share. Marc Einstein at Counterpoint Research also argued the proposal to take a cut of Nvidia’s sales might set a benchmark for Trump’s negotiations on other tariffs. He remarked, “It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|CNY|Nvidia|TWD|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|RESEARCH|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 10:50:45

The assets will remain held by the government under its strategic reserve plan, the adviser said on social media. White House Advisor Confirms No Sale Reports have disclosed that about 57.55 BTC — roughly $6.3 million at recent prices — moved through addresses that some observers tracked, which sparked claims the coins had been sold. The White House adviser, Patrick Witt, stepped in to clear up the matter, saying the Department of Justice confirmed there was no sale. The coins will be kept in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in line with Executive Order 14233 , signed in March 2025 by US President Donald Trump. That order directs that seized Bitcoin be held rather than auctioned off. UPDATE: we have received confirmation from DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated, per EO 14233. They will remain on the USG balance sheet as part of the SBR. https://t.co/v2GchC3vk8 — Patrick Witt (@patrickjwitt) January 16, 2026 Movement Of Coins Triggered Questions Based on reports from blockchain analysts, a transfer to a Coinbase Prime address led to speculation about a disposal. Market watchers noticed the trail and raised alarms because a sale could have put extra downward pressure on prices. Some traders reacted quickly to the noise. But officials explain that transfers between custody systems do not always mean liquidation. In this case, the DOJ and related agencies say the transfer was an internal custody step and not a sale to private buyers. Background On The Case The legal action against the Samourai Wallet developers centered on charges tied to running an unlicensed money-transmitting service and aiding money laundering through mixer tools. Those charged pleaded guilty. The forfeiture order followed those convictions, and the Bitcoin in question became part of the assets the government controls after the court rulings. How the government manages such holdings has been a fast-moving policy issue since Executive Order 14233 was issued, which set new rules for seized crypto. Policy And Market Effects According to officials, holding seized Bitcoin in a national reserve is meant to avoid sudden market shocks that could follow large government sales. Some critics argue the reserve gives the government a powerful financial tool, while supporters say it prevents volatile swings. The announcement eased some short-term market worries because uncertainty about a possible sale had been cited as a potential pressure point for crypto prices. Reactions From Industry Observers Based on reports and social posts from crypto advocates, opinions remain split. Some welcomed the clarification as stabilizing. Others want more transparency on how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be run and when, if ever, coins might leave it. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle may ask for hearings or written briefings to get clearer answers about custody practices and future plans.

The bill has faced criticism from Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley, who has raised concerns alongside ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) about a section of the crypto bill. According to reports, they claimed that the section of the crypto bill would exempt certain software developers from financial licensing requirements. They also mentioned that the language would limit the ability of law enforcement to go after money laundering and illicit financing in the crypto industry. Their complaints were noted in a private letter addressed to Scott and Senate Banking ranking member Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Tim Scott’s crypto bill encounters a stumbling block In the letter, which was obtained by POLITICO, the pair mentioned that the language in Section 604 of the crypto bill was the type of legislative change that falls within the Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction, adding that the panel was not involved in it before the since-postponed markup. Scott had plans to hold a vote on the crypto market structure legislation this week, but moved the mark-up amid surprise opposition from a leading crypto firm and other uncertainties. The section is similar to the standalone bipartisan legislation known as the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that is led in the House by Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and in the Senate by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). A spokesperson for Scott mentioned that the South Carolina Republican appreciates the engagement from Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Durbin on the issue. “As the parliamentarian has ruled, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act falls squarely within the Banking Committee’s jurisdiction,” said the spokesperson, Jeff Naft. “The Chairman remains committed to protecting software developers while ensuring that law enforcement has the necessary tools to prosecute actual illegal money transmission operations.” In his statement, Grassley mentioned that he appreciates the work done by Chairman Tim Scott and his staff as they work through the important bill. Grassley mentioned that the country needs to protect its national and financial security while ensuring that crypto and other industries play by the same rules as everyone else. He also plans to work with Scott to reach a sound outcome. According to reports, Grassley and Durbin are warning that the provision exempts a dangerously broad category of actors from treatment under the current criminal law. They also say the language would have likely stopped the government from bringing charges against the founder of Tornado Cash . Lawmakers want to review the draft legislation The pair claimed that the co-founder of Tornado Cash, a platform allegedly used to launder stolen funds, was operating as a mixer and was found guilty of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business last year, although crypto proponents and some congressional Republicans have criticized the conviction. They also mentioned that Scott’s draft legislation would create a big enforcement gap for decentralized digital asset platforms. “Such a gap risks attracting illicit actors—like cartels and other sophisticated criminal organizations—to decentralized platforms. Criminals already use tactics to obscure unlawful transactions. This bill would make prosecuting this conduct even more difficult,” the letter said. The concerns were shared by some law enforcement. The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys mentioned that the crypto bill could limit the ability of prosecutors to pursue financial crimes involving the movement of funds outside established regulatory guidelines. The issue also centers around how the market structure bill should treat the sectors of the industry known as decentralized finance or DeFi. That aspect uses software to facilitate trading and lending, cutting out centralized entities like exchanges. Senators have been talking and have raised concerns about DeFi platforms being a hotbed for illicit finance. They have called for changes to the BRCA language and were preparing to amend it during the markup. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Market participants no longer argue only about charts or short-term volatility. Instead, attention has shifted toward infrastructure readiness, regulatory resolution, and the role digital assets may play inside real financial systems. As traditional finance seeks faster and cheaper cross-border settlements, XRP stands at the center of that conversation. That broader perspective shaped a recent commentary from market analyst X Finance Bull, who challenged persistent bearish narratives around XRP. Rather than framing XRP as a speculative token, the pundit positioned it as a liquidity tool waiting for full institutional adoption once regulatory barriers are fully cleared. Ripple’s Institutional Network Is Already Built Ripple has spent more than a decade integrating its payment technology with regulated financial institutions worldwide. Banks, payment service providers, and remittance firms across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America already use Ripple’s infrastructure for messaging and settlement coordination. These integrations involve real compliance checks, internal identifiers, and operational testing, not informal partnerships. Seriously, you’re still bearish on $XRP ?! Ripple has already assigned banking IDs to 500+ banks. These are real institutions! Once regulatory clarity hits, they flip the switch and $XRP becomes the bridge. It’s not if, it’s when. You’re either early or late. So which… pic.twitter.com/bIAYZ8J3kY — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 16, 2026 Crucially, this network exists independently of XRP’s immediate use. Ripple designed its system to allow institutions to adopt the technology first and enable XRP-based liquidity later, when regulatory and risk approvals are in place. That structure permits XRP’s integration into existing payment flows without forcing institutions to rebuild their systems. Regulatory Clarity as the Activation Point X Finance Bull emphasized regulation as the decisive trigger for XRP’s next phase. With Ripple’s U.S. legal battle now fully concluded and appellate proceedings withdrawn, XRP operates under far clearer legal conditions than during the years of uncertainty that previously constrained adoption. This clarity matters because large institutions do not experiment lightly. Compliance teams require explicit regulatory comfort before approving live liquidity solutions. As those barriers fall, institutions that already tested Ripple’s rails can move from prefunded accounts to on-demand liquidity models. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Function as a Bridge Asset XRP’s core utility centers on bridging fragmented global liquidity. Traditional cross-border payments rely on nostro and vostro accounts that lock up capital across jurisdictions. XRP offers an alternative by sourcing liquidity in real time, reducing settlement time and capital inefficiency. This function does not depend on retail adoption or consumer usage. It depends on whether institutions choose efficiency over legacy friction. In that sense, XRP competes less with other cryptocurrencies and more with outdated financial plumbing. Timing, Not Possibility, Defines the Outcome The argument presented by X Finance Bull frames XRP’s future as a question of timing rather than feasibility. The infrastructure already exists. Regulatory clarity has materially improved. Institutional relationships remain active. Once institutions decide, conditions align with their risk frameworks, XRP can move from optional to operational. In that scenario, the market does not witness a gradual shift but a rapid transition. From this viewpoint, investors face a simple choice: position early or react late when the switch finally flips.

According to the South China Morning Post, a debate ensued in the country following two high-profile investigations on a former senior central bank official and an alleged scam network operator accused of leading one of the largest Bitcoin-linked fraud schemes ever uncovered. The extradition of alleged crypto scam billionaire Chen Zhi has dominated chatter on Chinese social media and state media outlets. Chen, the founder of Prince Holding Group, was arrested in Cambodia on January 6 at the request of Chinese authorities. China talks Chen Zhi, arrest makes citizens woeful of crypto Cambodian officials detained three Chinese nationals, including Chen, before transferring them to China, according to the Cambodia China Times. Last year, the United States prosecutors seized about $15 billion in Bitcoin that supposedly belonged to Chen, Cryptopolitan reported . According to Chinese investigators, Chen was part of a large-scale crypto fraud operation, though full details of the charges have not yet been publicly disclosed. Last Wednesday, state broadcaster China Central Television aired a documentary on how authorities tracked down bribes paid in cryptos to Yao Qian. Yao previously headed the People’s Bank of China team responsible for developing the digital yuan, Beijing’s flagship central bank digital currency project. This has led the public to question if blockchain technology is truly anonymous and secure, and how transparent transaction records expose illicit financial activity. On China’s RedNote social media platform, users are having a back-and-forth discussion between strong encryption protecting private keys and the fact that all Bitcoin transactions are visible on public ledgers. Strict bans on the mainland, openness in Hong Kong Digital asset transactions have been banned for years in mainland China, as authorities seek to control capital flows and reduce financial risks. The central bank has consistently warned that virtual currencies lack legal tender status and cannot function as money within China’s markets. In October, the People’s Bank of China reiterated its commitment to cracking down on virtual money, even as some market participants called for the introduction of yuan-denominated stablecoins. A meeting convened by the People’s Bank of China last November brought together 13 government agencies to coordinate enforcement actions against illegal digital currency activities. Foreign-issued stablecoins were flagged as posing risks related to money laundering, fraud, and illegal cross-border fund transfers. But in its special administrative jurisdiction, Hong Kong, crypto businesses have licenses and regulatory clarity to freely operate. Some industry observers say Hong Kong is a “litmus test” for how cryptocurrencies would fare in the mainland, although the sentiment from the government says this won’t come any time soon. Genevieve Donnellon-May, a Vasey Fellow at the Pacific Forum, believes the arrest of Chen is “a successful crackdown on criminal misuse of crypto,” and should not be deemed a flaw in Bitcoin itself. “Such actions may actually help strengthen longer-term confidence by curbing scams and illicit flows that harm the asset’s reputation,” she denoted.

According to ChatGPT’s assessment, the most likely trading range for XRP by that date is between $2.25 and $2.60. This base-case scenario reflects expectations that the token will continue consolidating slightly above current levels, supported by steady market participation but without a decisive breakout. In a more optimistic scenario, ChatGPT sees XRP rising into a $2.60 to $3.10 range. This outlook assumes stronger momentum across the broader crypto market , improved investor sentiment, and positive catalysts such as regulatory progress or renewed strength in major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Under these conditions, XRP could challenge higher resistance levels and briefly trade near or above the $3 mark. XRP downside outlook On the downside, ChatGPT noted that XRP could slip back toward the $1.90 to $2.20 area if momentum weakens. This bearish scenario is linked to potential muted trading volumes or renewed uncertainty that could keep the token locked in its recent consolidation zone. The price ranges are informed by a combination of technical trends, model-based projections, and broader market sentiment. Short-term technical views suggest XRP may hover around the low-to-mid $2 range if resistance levels are gradually tested and broken. This outlook comes as XRP continues to record notable on-chain changes. In particular, the network has recorded its highest level of daily transactions in nearly six months. Data from January 2026 shows that the XRP Ledger is processing about 1.45 million transactions per day, extending a steady rise in network activity that began in late 2025. The increase has been linked to the expansion of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity payment corridors and the integration of stablecoins such as RLUSD, which have boosted transaction flows across payment and decentralized finance use cases. On the other hand, on-chain data indicates that the XRP network has seen a notable drop in the number of new addresses created on the platform in 2026. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.06, having made modest gains of less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the asset is down about 1.5%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At its current price, XRP is sitting just above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.02. This positioning suggests short-term price action is relatively stable, with the 50-day SMA acting as nearby support rather than resistance. However, the much higher 200-day SMA at $2.54 highlights a clear longer-term downtrend, indicating that XRP remains structurally weak and would need a sustained move higher to shift its broader technical outlook. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI stands at roughly 51, firmly in neutral territory. This indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions and signals a lack of strong directional momentum.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stressed the Trump administration’s intensified efforts to attract more foreign investment in a statement dated January 17, informing chip makers based in South Korea and Taiwan to allocate a significant amount of funds to the US for investments or face a massive tariff rate of 100% on their imports to the country. An exception to this tariff rate applies to the company increasing its product in the United States. During a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Micron Technology Inc. facility near Syracuse, New York, the Secretary of Commerce stated that potential tariffs envisioned in a trade deal with Taiwan might also bring about significant effects on South Korean chipmakers. Following this statement, reporters reached out to Lutnick seeking clarity on this move. Responding to this, the industry executive highlighted that “Anyone who wants to manufacture memory has two options: They can either pay a 100% tariff or build their operations in America,” adding that “That’s what we call industrial policy,” without specifically mentioning the firms. His remarks aligned with a warning issued on Thursday, January 15, which offered lower tariff rates on imports for foreign companies that expand manufacturing in the US. Notably, this decision came after the Taiwan trade deal was signed. Still, Lutnick kept insisting that if these companies do not comply with this warning, they will face a 100% tariff on imports to the US. Foreign chip makers express heightened worries about Trump’s tariff decision As of now, US President Donald Trump has delayed the imposition of tariffs on imported semiconductors, primarily from Taiwan and South Korea, as he gives Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative, time to strike a deal with trade partners to reduce US reliance on foreign semiconductors. In the meantime, the White House hinted that Trump will soon announce new tariff rates and an incentive program designed to foster and expand local manufacturing. Notably, Micron rivals the world’s two largest memory chip manufacturers, Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. These companies are considered South Korean giants vying for market leadership in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip market. These chips are key elements for running data center processors, fueling the AI boom. These three global manufacturing firms have recently raised concerns about limited chip supplies amid a surge in AI data center development. Regarding the Trump administration’s recent move, a Commerce Department representative elaborated that “Secretary Lutnick is dedicated to bringing back American manufacturing strength, starting with semiconductors.” However, when reporters requested comments from SK Hynix, Samsung, and Taiwan’s representative office in Washington, D.C., they declined to respond. Trump’s tariff policies spark uncertainties in the market Regarding the US-Taiwan trade agreement made public on Thursday, reports indicated that the deal gives Taiwanese firms establishing a local presence in the US the chance to import up to 2.5 times their current production capacity tariff-free during the construction phase. Interestingly, shipments that exceed this limit will be subject to a reduced tariff rate. Upon the completion of these production facilities, the cap will decline to 1.5 times for their current production capacity In the meantime, under this deal, which imposes a 15% tariff on Taiwan’s imported goods, the Asian tech industry vowed to make significant investments of at least $250 million in the US. Apart from this pledge, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest and most advanced dedicated contract chip manufacturer, made clear its intentions to develop at least four more manufacturing facilities in Arizona, a US state. This project is expected to consume an additional $100 billion in funding, sources close to the situation said, who wished to remain anonymous. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Experts Highlight a New Crypto With 10x Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-xrps-1000-run-experts-highlight-a-new-crypto-with-10x-potential/,"Each crypto cycle makes winners out of those projects that appeared in the right stage of the market development. Ripple XRP was one of the largest surprises to the early holders in the previous cycle. However, 2026 is coming near and many traders are posing the same question: what crypto buy before it is too late that can bring the next asymmetric move. Analysts are pointing to an up-and-comer low-cost altcoin which remains early in its infancy and has not yet been valued by usage or utility. Ripple (XRP) The XRP of Ripple has served to popularize the initial narrative of institutions and international settlements. XRP has become more than a speculative token, and one of the leading names in the best crypto sector in boom times. In the present day, XRP has a significant market cap and has extensive liquidity. Its valuation is only in the tens of billions, and its price movement indicates that maturity. This is the point at which analysts refer to the limitation. Once an asset has attained a large market size, there is slow growth in price. XRP is no longer a small cap capable of making fast percentage returns. The forward growth analysts now project a muted outlook with regard to the XRP. According to some of the projections, XRP can grow only 1.5x by Q4 2026 assuming that the overall crypto market remains bullish. Quite the opposite of the 1000% moves which were observed years ago when it was in its first cycle window. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto asset developing a decentralized lending system that will enable users to lend out and borrow crypto assets in the form of smart contracts when it becomes operational. Suppliers will receive interests and earn mtTokens which are a representation of deposit value and yield. Borrowers will pledge security and access liquidity without selling long term assets. MUTM is said to be in its structured presale phase. The token sells at $0.04 in Phase 7. The actual price of launching will be $0.06. Over $19.7 million has been raised and more than 18,800 holders have taken positions. The total supply of tokens that are distributed is 4 billion, of which more than 825 million were given out. An approximation of 45.5% of that supply is used in presale distribution. Why Analysts Think MUTM May Follow Early XRP Steps To start with, XRP rewarded holders in its pre-institutional phase in which valuation had not priced future adoption. MUTM is also in a comparable early window, prior to the emergence of the usage metrics. After becoming operational, the lending platforms reveal interest streams, collateral amounts, foreclosures and re-payments information. The protocol can then be appreciated in markets by quantifiable activity. Second, XRP experienced a gain of utility instead of sheer hype. Analysts consider MUTM as a utility anchored asset. mtTokens enable deposits to receive yield from borrowers. A buy and distribute mechanic will purchase some protocol revenue on the open market using MUTM, and redistribute this to stakers. This could cause buy pressure based on usage and not sympathy. Third, similar is the timing window. XRP went up before its story had grown. MUTM will enter into its V1 protocol deployment window. The official X account is that V1 will roll out testnet before rolling out mainnet. The assets that are lent out are most likely to reflect the future anticipations before the activation. It is a 10x scenario that some analysts model should usage grow by 2026 and 2027. These models are not guaranteed, but they indicate the ways in which markets price the early-stage lending protocols, when they start operating. Phase Progression and Security Framework Phase 7 of MUTM has been selling faster than others. This is viewed by analysts as tightening behavior of allocations. Higher wallet entries have been reported too. This trend tends to occur towards the end of token distributions which are structured. The roadmap also has involved security preparation. The V1 codebase underwent an audit by Halborn Security . CertiK tokens can award the MUTM token a score of 90 out of 100. There is a bug bounty of $50,000 that operates to detect bugs before the launch. Growth has also been aided by participation infrastructure. A 24 hour leaderboard will be used to give the highest daily contributor $500 in MUTM. The card payments are offered to the users who do not want to undergo complicated wallet-based onboarding. As XRP has entered its mature level of the valuation range, analysts are considering what crypto can provide early stage utility pricing. Mutuum Finance belongs to that category and it still has roadmap milestones in front of it as well as revenue mechanics.

Addresses numbered 10 to 50 control 24.85% more, and the rest, 56.59%, is spread out among millions of smaller wallets. Ripple Labs remains the single largest owner of XRP when all company-linked wallets are added together. When escrow wallets count toward rankings, seven of the top ten XRP wallets belong to Ripple. Ripple Labs Escrow is at the top of the list with 45% of the total supply, which manages predictable releases. The second-largest holder of XRP is Ripple Labs (operational), which holds nearly 1% of the total XRP supply. Max XRP ownership goes to Ripple, institutions, and crypto exchanges Since the launch, XRP supply stands at 100 billion tokens. There is no mining or staking process for the token. Instead, it is distributed through methods including escrow, allocation, and market transactions. Each month, up to 1 billion XRP is unlocked, with unused amounts returned to escrow. Data from on-chain analytics shows that the maximum XRP ownership is held by whales, including institutional buyers, Ripple founders, and others. Japan’s SBI Holdings owns about $10.4 billion in XRP. Just after Ripple Labs, large XRP wallets belong to centralized exchanges that hold XRP on behalf of users instead of as proprietary assets. Binance is the biggest holder with approximately 1.8 billion XRP. South Korea’s Bithumb ties closely with approximately 1.8 billion XRP after increasing its balance by roughly 30% in 2025. Uphold and Upbit also rank among the top custodians. As reported by Cryptopolitan, these numbers reflected that XRP’s trading volumes on Binance, Upbit, and Uphold did well in 2025. XRP did better than Bitcoin and Ethereum on Upbit, making up 28% of the exchange’s 24-hour trading volume rise, which hit $13.39 billion. Uphold’s data also revealed XRP as the most traded asset in 2025, bolstered by yield products tied to the Flare Network. Meanwhile, the Binance XRP/USDT pair, by trade volume, saw a 69% increase as the year began. Meanwhile, the coin is steady with a minor decline of 0.17% now trading at $2.06. In comparison to the other assets, XRP has also seen a decline in the last week as its peers see small gains, which has caused it to be overtaken by Binance after slipping to a market cap of approximately $125 billion Ripple execs take over 4% of the XRP supply Ripple execs are the biggest holders of the individual wallets. Ripple co-founder and executive chairman Chris Larsen publicly linked wallets have an estimated 2.5 to 2.7 billion XRP, which translates to approximately 4-5% of the total supply. Although exact figures fluctuate with market prices, reports suggest that the co-founder has realized over $760 million in profits since 2018. Brad Garlinghouse is also suspected of having one of the largest personal XRP holdings. However, these are not publicly disclosed. Jed McCaleb, another Ripple co-founder, was given 9 billion XRP in 2012. However, he completed the sale of his XRP holdings after leaving the company in 2014 for approximately $3.2 billion. Other large wallets are associated with anonymous addresses. One of them holds approximately 1.2 billion XRP , while another controls more than 700 million XRP. In total, the top 50 XRP addresses control approximately 43% to 50% of the circulating supply. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-investors-we-are-closer-to-major-breakout-heres-the-signal/,"Long-term market structures often become clearer only after extended consolidation. That is the setting Amonyx (@amonyx) points to in his latest XRP analysis. The analyst shared a multi-year XRP chart that maps a repeating cycle, broken into clearly labeled phases. He believes it is closer to a major breakout. The chart covers more than a decade of price action. It presents XRP as a market that moves through expansion, compression, continuation, and then acceleration. Each cycle follows the same sequence. Phase 1 marks the initial impulse. Phase 2 shows a sharp corrective range. Phase 3 compresses price into a consolidation triangle . Phase 4 resolves with a breakout and trend continuation. We’re getting close. As mentioned earlier, patience is key with $XRP now. pic.twitter.com/THrJbsxHL2 — Amonyx (@amonyx) January 15, 2026 How the Current Cycle Compares In the most recent segment, XRP has already exited Phase 3. The digital asset broke upward from a multi-year consolidation pattern in late 2024. That structure mirrors earlier periods on the chart. After the breakout, the digital asset entered Phase 4. Its price then pushed above prior resistance and established a new consolidation zone. At the time of the chart, XRP traded around $2.15. This area sits above the former wedge resistance, now acting as support. The chart shows XRP holding within a rising channel rather than retracing into the prior range. Despite some dips in late 2025 , XRP has held strong. This behavior aligns with previous Phase 4 periods marked on the chart. Volume expansion accompanied the breakout. Momentum indicators beneath the chart also show cyclical resets rather than exhaustion. This analysis suggests that the cycle will continue, and XRP has not completed Phase 4. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Levels Highlighted on the Chart Amonyx marks two major targets. TP 1 stands at the all-time high of $3.65 , which the asset hit in July 2025. He labels this level directly on the chart. The second target appears much higher. TP 2 is marked at the Fib. 6.618 extension level, with a corresponding price of $21.5. These targets are not presented as short-term objectives. The chart context suggests a full cycle continuation similar to past expansions. Earlier Phase 4 moves on the chart led to exponential upside once the price cleared historical resistance. Previous cycles show brief pauses before continuation. Price stability above $2 reinforces the structural breakout already in place. Amonyx’s message backs the view. “We’re getting close” signals progression within the cycle, not completion. He emphasized that “patience is key” for the current cycle, and market participants wait for XRP to complete this phase.

AI Reveals the 3 Things PI Needs for a Rally,https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-pi-networks-price-stuck-ai-reveals-the-3-things-pi-needs-for-a-rally/,"The cryptocurrency markets experienced a wild start to the new year, with BTC surging by almost ten grand to a two-month peak of $98,000 before it was stopped. Many altcoins posted even more impressive gains mid-week but have failed to double down. Pi Network’s native token, though, cannot say the same. It has been stuck in consolidation for several weeks, without any clear indication whether it will be able to break out of the $0.20 and $0.22 range. As such, we decided to ask ChatGPT what is needed for PI to finally move out of this rather dull trading zone. What’s Holding You Down, PI? The Core Team behind the controversial project already released its first major update for the year, which promises to slash the needed time for PI payment integrations under ten minutes. However, it failed to impact the underlying asset. ChatGPT believes there’s reason to this (lack of) madness. First, it said supply overhang is crushing the momentum. Unlike most other liquid altcoins, PI is dealing with heavy unlock pressure. As more tokens become transferable, any upside attempt quickly runs into selling from early participants who had waited a long time for their assets. Data from PiScanUnlock shows that over 4.5 million tokens on average will be freed in the next 30 days, which is expected to intensify the immediate selling pressure. ChatGPT also said there are no external capital inflows. Most altcoin rallies have been fueled by new capital rotating out of BTC, but PI remains largely isolated. Lastly, the AI noted that the ecosystem growth hasn’t translated to price gains. So, What Do You Need, PI? The AI solution believes PI will “require one or more major catalysts, not just routine updates” to break out of the $0.20-$0.22 range. It listed a clear, unavoidable use case that creates real demand, such as at least one of the following: Large-scale merchant adoption using PI as payment A widely used PI-native application that requires the token to function Network mechanics that reduce circulating supply (burns, locks, staking) Second, ChatGPT outlined liquidity expansion beyond the Core Community. This doesn’t necessarily mean a listing from a big exchange, such as Binance or Coinbase, but it requires capital from outside the PI ecosystem. Lastly, the AI solution said PI needs a supply narrative shift as markets respond to strong changes in such dynamics. If the Core Team introduces slower unlock schedules, long-term lock incentives, or deflationary mechanics, then even modest demand can suddenly have a much larger price impact.

According to authorities, the scammers now see them as the prime age bracket, noting that they were targeted because of their age and limited knowledge of how cryptocurrencies worked. According to reports, the elderly population is always enticed with the opportunity to make profits, which the scammers always present in easy ways. The scammers then take advantage of their desperation and gullibility to extract funds from them until they can no longer come up with the payments. In most cases, the elderly victim realizes they have been scammed after the fraudsters cut communication and take the application where they monitor their earnings offline. Indian fraudsters target elderly victims in fake crypto trading schemes According to the Indian police, one of its first cases this year involved a 64-year-old retired banker from Secunderabad. The retired banker claimed that he lost more than Rs. 1.25 crore ($137,000) to fraudsters who operated a bogus crypto trading scheme using a trading platform called “Capstone.” Authorities claimed that the fraud was carried out between December 29 and January 12, and was only discovered after the scammers went offline with the victim’s funds. According to the retired Indian elder, he received an invitation to join a group called ‘Team B Club Internship Group 39’ on WhatsApp . In the group, members shared several screenshots showing purported gains from their investments on the platform. Some claimed it was from trading crypto, others said it was from institutional IPO trades. The retired banker claimed he was asked to download the Capstone app using a link shared from a United States phone number. After downloading the app and setting it up, the Indian police claimed that the elderly victim made about 15 transfers from three personal accounts to about 11 bank accounts provided by the scammer. He claimed that the payments were made to enable him to make more profits from his investments. The in-app dashboard showed his balance rose to Rs. 1.9 crore, but at every attempt to withdraw, he was blocked. He claimed the fraudsters asked him to pay another Rs. 58.58 lakh as clearing charges. The Indian police said that after protracted negotiations with the scammers to help him withdraw his funds, he realized he had been scammed and reported the case to the police. Police said they registered the case on January 14, highlighting that by the next day, the Hyderabad and Cyberabad Cyber Crime Police station claimed that they had received more than three similar complaints involving a combined loss of more than Rs. 1.2 crore. Police urge citizens to seek help from professionals In another similar case, the Indian police claimed that a 68-year-old retired employee from Manikonda alleged that scammers posing as analysts of a stock brokerage company scammed him of over Rs. 50.8 lakh. He claimed that they lured him into a WhatsApp investment group, and he was asked to register on a platform. The victim also downloaded an application where he tracked his earnings, but by the time he wanted to withdraw, the scammers ran with his funds. In the third case, police mentioned that a 76-year-old retired employee from Secunderabad claimed to have lost Rs. 46.25 lakh to fraudsters posing as stock market trading experts. He said they advised him to invest in IPO trades between December and January. After several investments, the scammers stole the funds. Another case saw a 45-year-old retired employee lose Rs. 32.1 lakh to fraudsters who claimed he could invest in US stocks using their applications. All four incidents have been formally registered, the Indian police claimed. They have also warned the elderly populace to desist from investing in opportunities that are too good to be true. They urged them to involve someone younger with practical experience in the crypto industry if they chose to invest in the assets. The police have also urged the populace to seek professional help when entering the crypto industry, as it would guard them against falling into the wrong hands. Don’t just read crypto news.

57241864,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262460,1768650011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ethereum Staking Queue Surges to Staggering 2.5-Year High, Signaling Unwavering Network Confidence",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-staking-queue-record-high-2/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Staking Queue Surges to Staggering 2.5-Year High, Signaling Unwavering Network Confidence In a powerful demonstration of sustained confidence, the Ethereum staking queue has swelled to a monumental 2.5-year peak, holding nearly 2.6 million ETH as validators rush to secure the world’s leading smart contract platform. This significant milestone, reported on April 10, 2025, by crypto analyst Ted Pillows citing validatorqueue data, far surpasses the previous record and presents a complex, bullish signal for the network’s future. The current validator wait time now extends to approximately 45 days, while the unstaking queue remains conspicuously empty, painting a picture of a deeply committed participant base. Ethereum Staking Queue Reaches Unprecedented Levels The Ethereum staking ecosystem is experiencing a historic influx. According to the latest on-chain metrics, the entry queue now contains approximately 2,597,838 ETH. Consequently, this figure marks the highest point since the pivotal Shanghai upgrade enabled withdrawals in April 2023. For context, this volume drastically exceeds the previous record of 1.759 million ETH observed on January 10 of this year. The data reveals a clear and sustained upward trend in network participation. This swelling queue directly impacts new validators. Currently, the wait time to activate a new validator stands at about 45 days and two hours. This delay is a direct function of the protocol’s churn limit, which carefully controls how many validators can join or leave the network per epoch to ensure stability. Meanwhile, the contrasting emptiness of the unstaking queue provides a critical counterpoint. It strongly suggests that existing stakers are choosing to remain locked in, likely anticipating future rewards or network upgrades. Understanding the Staking Mechanism and Queue Dynamics Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) fundamentally reshaped its security model. Instead of energy-intensive mining, participants, known as validators, stake a minimum of 32 ETH to propose and attest to new blocks. The protocol intentionally regulates validator set changes through a mechanism called the churn limit. This limit caps the number of validators that can enter or exit the activation queue within a given period, preventing sudden, destabilizing shifts in network consensus. The current queue dynamics tell a compelling story: Record Inflow: The queue size represents over $8 billion worth of ETH (at current prices) awaiting activation, showcasing massive capital commitment. Extended Wait Time: A 45-day delay indicates exceptionally high demand to participate in network security. Zero Unstaking Demand: The lack of an exit queue highlights strong holder conviction and a long-term outlook among current stakers. These mechanics ensure network security scales with value. As more ETH is staked, attacking the network becomes exponentially more expensive, creating a powerful economic safeguard. Expert Analysis on Market and Network Implications Industry analysts point to several interconnected factors driving this trend. First, the broader recovery in cryptocurrency markets throughout 2024 and into 2025 has renewed institutional and retail interest in core blockchain assets like Ethereum. Second, the upcoming network upgrades, often referred to as “The Surge” and “The Scourge,” which aim to further scale transaction throughput and mitigate MEV, are creating positive forward-looking sentiment. Furthermore, the growth of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) has lowered the technical and capital barriers to entry. Investors can stake any amount of ETH through these protocols and receive a tradable token representing their stake, maintaining liquidity while earning rewards. This innovation has undoubtedly contributed to the rising total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s consensus layer. The data suggests a strategic accumulation phase, where stakeholders are positioning themselves ahead of anticipated network improvements and potential appreciation. Historical Context and Comparative Data To fully appreciate the current milestone, a review of staking history is essential. The launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020 initiated Ethereum’s staking journey, but assets remained locked until the Shanghai/Capella upgrade. That upgrade, completed in April 2023, was a watershed moment that removed the final perceived risk—illiquidity—for many potential stakers. The following table illustrates key queue milestones post-Shanghai: Date Queue Size (ETH) Significance May 2023 ~800,000 Initial post-upgrade surge Jan 2024 ~1.2 million Steady growth phase Jan 10, 2025 1.759 million Previous record high April 10, 2025 2.597 million Current 2.5-year record This trajectory shows not just recovery but accelerated adoption. The network now has over 30% of its total ETH supply staked, a ratio that continues to climb and aligns with other mature Proof-of-Stake networks. This trend reinforces Ethereum’s security and decentralization over time. Potential Impacts on Ethereum’s Economics and Security The record staking queue carries significant implications. Primarily, it leads to a continuous increase in the total amount of ETH taken out of circulating supply and committed to long-term security. This reduction in readily available sell pressure can influence market dynamics, although analysts caution against oversimplifying this relationship. The more direct impact is on network security. A larger, more distributed validator set makes a 51% attack astronomically costly and logistically near-impossible. However, the growing queue also presents challenges. The extended activation delay could be perceived as a barrier for new, smaller participants, though liquid staking providers offer an immediate alternative. Additionally, as the staking yield (APR) adjusts based on the total amount staked, an increasing validator count will gradually lower the rewards for all participants, a built-in economic incentive designed to balance participation over the long term. The system self-regulates through these economic signals. Conclusion The Ethereum staking queue reaching a 2.5-year high is a multifaceted development with profound implications. It reflects robust confidence in the network’s long-term roadmap, underscores the success of its Proof-of-Stake model, and significantly enhances its economic security. While the 45-day validator wait time indicates high demand, the empty unstaking queue simultaneously signals strong holder conviction. This milestone is a key indicator of Ethereum’s maturation from a speculative asset into a foundational, yield-generating infrastructure layer for the decentralized internet. The Ethereum staking ecosystem’s health remains a critical metric for observers gauging the network’s stability and future trajectory. FAQs Q1: What is the Ethereum staking queue? The staking queue is a waiting list for new validators wanting to join the network. Because the protocol limits how many validators can activate per day (the churn limit), excess demand forms this queue. Q2: Why is the unstaking queue empty? An empty unstaking queue means very few existing validators are currently requesting to withdraw their staked ETH. This typically indicates strong long-term confidence in the network and an unwillingness to forfeit ongoing staking rewards. Q3: How does a longer queue affect Ethereum’s security? A longer queue directly increases security. It represents more ETH being committed to the network, making it exponentially more expensive for any bad actor to attempt an attack on the chain’s consensus. Q4: Will the staking reward rate decrease because of this? Yes, gradually. Ethereum’s staking APR is designed to adjust downward as the total amount of staked ETH increases. This is a built-in economic mechanism to balance participation and rewards over time. Q5: Can I avoid the 45-day wait to stake my ETH? Yes. By using a liquid staking service or a staking pool, you can delegate your ETH to an existing validator and begin earning rewards immediately, bypassing the activation queue entirely.

The pullback comes amid broader market consolidation and follows a strong weekly rally, suggesting profit-taking rather than a decisive trend reversal. Outset PR delivers this content, merging crypto-native communication with data-driven intelligence. ETH Sees Profit-Taking After Strong Weekly Gains ETH slipped around 1% on January 16th, trading near $3,310 as overall market momentum cooled. The move follows a 7% weekly gain, during which short-term momentum became increasingly stretched. This is reflected in the 7-day Relative Strength Index, which reached 68, approaching overbought territory. As RSI climbed, traders began locking in profits, increasing near-term selling pressure. Rejection at $3,370 Signals Short-Term Exhaustion Ethereum has now been rejected twice this week near the $3,370 resistance level. Multiple failures at the same price area typically indicate short-term exhaustion, especially after a sharp upside move. This rejection has reinforced $3,350–$3,370 as a key resistance zone. A daily close above $3,350 would be required to invalidate the current pullback narrative and reassert bullish control. Momentum Remains Constructive Despite Pullback Despite the dip, broader momentum indicators remain supportive. The MACD histogram is still firmly positive at 25.53, suggesting that the underlying trend remains bullish. This setup implies the pullback may be corrective rather than the start of a deeper decline, provided key support levels hold. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. ETH Support Levels to Monitor The first level to watch on the downside is $3,250. Holding above this area would support the case for consolidation before another upside attempt. Below that, the 30-day simple moving average near $3,056 stands out as a critical structural floor. A sustained move toward this level would signal a deeper reset in momentum, while a bounce above it would preserve the broader bullish structure. ETH Price Outlook Ethereum’s rejection at $3,379 has triggered short-term profit-taking, but momentum indicators suggest the broader trend remains intact. As long as ETH holds above $3,250 and the 30-day SMA, the pullback is likely temporary. Bulls will need a decisive daily close above $3,350 to regain momentum and reopen the path toward higher resistance levels. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Impressed by some of the driverless systems demonstrated ahead of a meeting on the matter, the leader of the Kremlin urged Russian authorities to speed up their implementation. Russia must move from trials to rollout of autonomous solutions, says Putin The Russian Federation should rapidly transition from testing autonomous systems to their large-scale introduction, its president insisted. Speaking at a meeting devoted to their development, Vladimir Putin stated: “I would like to draw the attention of participants and all the colleagues in the government: there is a need to move quicker from experiments to mass use of autonomous solutions.” The Russian head of state added that the executive power in both Moscow and the Russian regions should not only control but lead efforts in this direction. Putin admitted that, despite taking some important steps, his country is still far behind other nations who “have reached full sovereignty” in this sphere and are already producing all the components needed for autonomous equipment. “For example, robotic taxis are engaged and carry passengers in certain cities of the world, not as part of individual experiments but in mass numbers,” he remarked. Nevertheless, the Russian leader acknowledged he was impressed by some of the prototypes demonstrated before the discussion. Putin was acquainted with a whole range of products and a wide variety of implementations – from agriculture and construction to security. “It should be said it is impressive! The boldness and variety of designers’ proposals, and how technologies created by them dramatically change life around us, forming the real economy of autonomous systems,” Putin commented, adding that the accelerated development of this industry is on the agenda. Moscow to boost driverless truck production to thousands of units by 2030 Russian companies are gradually increasing the number of autonomous vehicles built domestically. 95 self-driving trucks have been manufactured to date, TASS informed in a separate report . They are currently engaged in commercial transportation on the Central Ring Road in and around Moscow and the M-11 Neva highway, which links the capital with Russia’s second-largest city, St. Petersburg. The current plan is to grow the fleet to 920 units by the end of 2028, according to materials distributed at the exhibition, which took place on the sidelines of the meeting presided by Putin. The goal set in the presentation is to bump production from a few hundred driverless trucks in 2026 – 2027 to thousands of units by 2030. Putin is convinced Russia will be able to find its place in the global market for such systems, once it scales up exports, which will help it to create a strong and cost-efficient industry. He elaborated: “It is very large, this international market. We are awaited there, I assure you. I simply know that. All our friends, our partners told us that.” “Customs and other procedures should be made as comfortable as possible for national companies, so that they can withstand tough competition with foreign manufacturers,” he stressed. As for Russia itself, the president expects self-driving solutions to substitute low-skilled labor and increase productivity and quality of life, fostering an economy with higher wages. Putin has repeatedly urged Russian officials to focus efforts on facilitating the development of advanced technologies in their country. In December, he praised the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) while warning of the perils as well, commenting that not using AI “would mean losing everything we care about,” but warned that “if we use it thoughtlessly, it will also end up in the loss of everything we value.” In November, the head of the Kremlin visited an exhibition showcasing Russian achievements in the AI-powered robot race, where he had a short interaction with a humanoid, designed and built by engineers at the banking giant Sber. While his meeting with the smart machine called Green went relatively well, the premiere of Russia’s “first” AI robot, named Aidol, turned into an embarrassment for its creators when it stumbled and fell on its face at an event in Moscow a few days earlier.

Additionally, the trader maintains a 10x leveraged long position in Solana (SOL) showing a $7.09 million gain from an average entry price of $130. These positions collectively represent one of the most significant concentrated bets currently visible on public blockchain ledgers. Market analysts note that such substantial leveraged positions create both opportunity and systemic risk. Consequently, the whale’s trading activity can influence market sentiment and liquidity conditions. The use of 5x and 10x leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses dramatically, representing a high-risk approach that few institutional investors would typically undertake. Technical Analysis of Position Management Professional traders examining the whale’s entry points note strategic timing across different assets. The Bitcoin position entered near what technical analysts identify as a key support level in late 2024. Meanwhile, the Ethereum accumulation began during a period of network upgrade optimism. The Solana position coincides with renewed developer activity on the network. Each entry demonstrates possible fundamental analysis rather than purely speculative momentum trading. Historical Context: The October Forced Liquidation Event The address first attracted significant attention in October 2024 during what market participants describe as the largest forced liquidation event in cryptocurrency derivatives history. During that volatile period, approximately $2.1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated across major exchanges within 24 hours. The cascade began with unexpected volatility in Bitcoin markets that triggered margin calls across connected positions in Ethereum, Solana, and other major altcoins. Blockchain forensic firms subsequently identified several addresses, including 0xb317, that established substantial short positions immediately before the liquidation cascade. These positions reportedly generated profits exceeding $15 million during the market downturn. Trading patterns showed these addresses increasing their short exposure during the 72 hours preceding the volatility spike, timing that market surveillance experts described as statistically anomalous. The event prompted investigations from multiple regulatory bodies and intensified debates about market manipulation in cryptocurrency markets. Exchange operators implemented additional safeguards, including increased margin requirements for large positions and enhanced monitoring of coordinated trading activity. Despite these measures, the recent profitable long positions by the same address have reignited concerns about sophisticated actors potentially exploiting market mechanisms. Identity Speculation and the BitForex Connection Several cryptocurrency investigators and community members have publicly speculated that the address may belong to Garrett Jin, former CEO of the now-defunct BitForex exchange. Jin led the Singapore-based exchange from 2018 until its sudden collapse in early 2024, when users reported inability to withdraw funds totaling approximately $500 million. The exchange officially ceased operations amid regulatory pressure and liquidity issues. Blockchain analysis shows that several addresses associated with BitForex’s operational wallets interacted with the 0xb317 address between 2022 and 2023. These transactions involved moderate transfers of Ethereum and various ERC-20 tokens. However, no definitive on-chain evidence conclusively proves identity ownership, as cryptocurrency addresses are pseudonymous by design. Jin has not publicly commented on these allegations, and his current whereabouts and activities remain unconfirmed by independent sources. The speculation highlights broader concerns about former exchange operators potentially leveraging insider knowledge of market mechanics. Former executives possess detailed understanding of liquidation engines, liquidity distribution, and trader behavior patterns that could theoretically inform sophisticated trading strategies. Regulatory frameworks in traditional finance typically impose strict trading restrictions on exchange insiders, but such rules remain inconsistently applied across global cryptocurrency jurisdictions. Market Impact of Large Whale Positions The whale’s current $40 million paper profit represents more than just personal gain. Such substantial positions affect overall market dynamics in measurable ways. First, the positions consume significant available liquidity on Hyperliquid’s order books, potentially increasing slippage for other traders. Second, the knowledge of such large leveraged positions can influence market sentiment, with some traders potentially following the whale’s direction while others prepare for possible liquidation cascades if markets move against the positions. Exchange risk managers monitor large concentrated positions closely because their liquidation could trigger secondary effects. A forced closure of 1,000 Bitcoin at 5x leverage would require the exchange to sell approximately $90 million worth of Bitcoin into the market, potentially creating temporary price dislocations. Similarly, the Ethereum and Solana positions represent substantial market exposure that requires careful risk management by both the trader and the exchange. Regulatory Implications and Compliance Challenges The situation presents multiple regulatory considerations for authorities worldwide. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has increasingly focused on cryptocurrency market manipulation cases, with several high-profile settlements announced in 2024. European regulators under MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) framework are developing specific provisions for market abuse monitoring in digital asset markets. Asian financial authorities, particularly in Singapore and Japan, have strengthened exchange oversight following several collapses. Key regulatory challenges include: Jurisdictional complexity : The pseudonymous nature of blockchain addresses complicates identity verification across borders Definitional issues : Legal frameworks differ on whether certain cryptocurrency trading activities constitute traditional insider trading Evidence standards : Blockchain analysis provides circumstantial evidence but rarely meets traditional financial investigation standards Enforcement mechanisms : Regulatory bodies struggle to apply sanctions to pseudonymous entities operating across decentralized platforms Despite these challenges, regulatory momentum is building toward greater oversight. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has pushed for stricter implementation of travel rule requirements for virtual asset service providers. Major jurisdictions are increasingly requiring exchanges to implement sophisticated market surveillance tools similar to those used in traditional equity markets. These developments suggest that the regulatory environment for large cryptocurrency traders will likely become more constrained in coming years. Technical Analysis of Hyperliquid’s Risk Management Hyperliquid, as the hosting exchange for these positions, employs specific risk management protocols for large leveraged positions. The platform uses a mark price mechanism derived from multiple external price feeds to prevent manipulation. Additionally, the exchange implements incremental liquidation processes that gradually reduce positions as maintenance margin requirements approach, rather than executing full liquidations at once. The exchange’s insurance fund, currently valued at approximately $45 million, provides protection against undercollateralized liquidations. This fund would cover losses if a large position’s liquidation cannot be executed at or above the bankruptcy price. The whale’s positions represent a significant but manageable portion of this fund, according to risk metrics published by the exchange. Hyperliquid’s transparent approach to publishing these metrics represents an industry advancement toward greater risk disclosure. Other exchanges have adopted similar transparency initiatives following the 2024 liquidation events. By publicly displaying large position concentrations and insurance fund status, platforms aim to reduce uncertainty during volatile periods. This transparency theoretically allows traders to make more informed decisions about their exposure to platform risk and potential liquidation cascades. Broader Market Implications and Trader Sentiment The whale’s substantial long positions coincide with generally bullish sentiment across cryptocurrency markets in early 2025. Several fundamental factors support this optimism, including increased institutional adoption through spot Bitcoin ETFs, ongoing development of Ethereum’s scalability solutions, and growing real-world asset tokenization projects. However, the presence of such large leveraged positions introduces additional volatility risk to the current market structure. Professional trading desks typically monitor whale activity as one of multiple indicators. While some view large leveraged positions as confidence signals, others interpret them as potential volatility triggers. The current situation presents a paradox: the whale’s successful navigation of previous volatility suggests sophisticated market understanding, but the scale of leverage creates vulnerability to unexpected market movements. Market participants should consider several key factors: Liquidity conditions : Current market depth supports orderly liquidation if needed Correlation risks : The positions span multiple correlated assets Regulatory developments : Ongoing investigations could affect market psychology Technical indicators : Market structure shows both strength and overextension signals Conclusion The crypto whale holding $40 million in unrealized profits from leveraged positions on Hyperliquid represents a multifaceted story of opportunity, risk, and regulatory evolution. While the substantial gains demonstrate potential rewards from sophisticated cryptocurrency trading, the lingering insider trading allegations highlight ongoing market integrity challenges. As regulatory frameworks develop and exchange surveillance improves, market participants can expect increased scrutiny of large position accumulation and timing. The situation ultimately underscores cryptocurrency markets’ continued maturation, where substantial profits attract both admiration and investigation in equal measure. The crypto whale’s journey will likely influence both trading strategies and regulatory approaches throughout 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What is a crypto whale in cryptocurrency markets? A crypto whale refers to an individual or entity that holds large enough amounts of a cryptocurrency to potentially influence market prices through their trading activities. These entities typically control addresses containing millions or tens of millions of dollars worth of digital assets. Q2: How does leverage work in cryptocurrency trading? Leverage allows traders to control positions larger than their initial capital by borrowing funds from the exchange. For example, 5x leverage means controlling $5 worth of assets for every $1 of collateral. While this amplifies potential profits, it also magnifies losses and increases liquidation risk if prices move against the position. Q3: What was the October 2024 forced liquidation event? In October 2024, cryptocurrency markets experienced extreme volatility that triggered approximately $2.1 billion in liquidated leveraged positions across major exchanges within 24 hours. The cascade began with unexpected Bitcoin price movements that created margin calls across connected positions in Ethereum, Solana, and other major cryptocurrencies. Q4: What are insider trading allegations in cryptocurrency markets? Insider trading allegations suggest that traders may have used non-public information to execute profitable trades. In cryptocurrency contexts, this could include knowledge of upcoming exchange listings, protocol changes, or large impending transactions that could affect market prices before such information becomes publicly available. Q5: How do exchanges manage risk from large leveraged positions? Exchanges employ multiple risk management strategies including maintenance margin requirements, incremental liquidation processes, insurance funds, and position size limits. Many platforms also use mark prices derived from multiple external sources to prevent price manipulation and ensure fair liquidations during volatile periods.

Musk’s decision to abandon the ICO and later exit from the AI startup set the company on its current path, combining a controlling nonprofit with a public benefit corporation (PBC). OpenAI’s President, Greg Brockman, said he and Musk agreed back in 2017 that a for-profit structure would be the AI startup’s next phase. However, negotiations hit a snag when the AI startup blatantly refused to give Musk full control of the for-profit arm. The ChatGPT maker also rejected Musk’s proposal to merge the AI startup with his Tesla, opting for alternative means to jointly achieve the objective. In response, Musk stormed out of the AI startup and gave the company a 0% chance of success if it failed to raise billions of dollars. Today, the company’s structure includes a controlling nonprofit that owns equity in the PBC, currently valued at over $130 billion. Musk sues OpenAI for breach of charitable trust In his latest court filing, Musk is suing the AI firm for breach of charitable trust and constructive fraud. However, the AI company seeks to deny Musk any remedy for the alleged misconduct on technical grounds. It asserts that the Tesla boss lacks standing to sue because he made most of his contributions indirectly through personal donor-advised funds (DAFs). The AI company also pointed out that Musk made additional donations through the fiscal sponsor YC.org, which it had designated to receive contributions on its behalf. Meanwhile, Musk calls OpenAI’s arguments “meritless,” emphasizing that the court had already ruled he has standing to sue as a “settlor” of a trust. He added that he is the settlor of his contributions to the ChatGPT maker, whether directly or indirectly. Musk contributed about $38 million to the AI startup’s initial funding, which accounted for roughly 60% of the total funding. He also claimed he made countless non-monetary contributions, such as recruiting top talent, including the AI firm’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, also acknowledged in his deposition that Musk’s initial contributions to the AI startup were crucial. He does not think the AI company would exist without Musk. Brockman says Musk is just harassing the AI startup According to Brockman, Musk’s latest lawsuit is his fourth attempt to make these claims, and part of his broader strategy to delay the ChatGPT maker’s progress through harassment. He believes Musk is using underhanded tactics to gain an advantage for his xAI firm. Brockman also claimed that Musk is grossly misrepresenting facts on record to further his harassment. He noted that Musk had deliberately cherry-picked and shared snippets from written records to tell a different story. “Elon did not think that OpenAI needed to remain solely a non-profit. As the context shows, he agreed that OpenAI needed both a non-profit and a for-profit entity—the exact structure OpenAI has today, and that Elon is now suing OpenAI over.” – Greg Brockman , President of OpenAI Brockman also clarified that it was Ilya, not Musk, who suggested that the nonprofit should continue to exist in some form and remain connected to the AI firm’s mission. Musk actually created an OpenAI PBC (B-Corp) shortly after these discussions. Brockman further noted that Musk’s court filings glossed over the details of these negotiations, and they were intense and deeply personal. Brockman also pointed out that one of the people who had worked closely with Musk described him as someone who tends to vilify people who quit his companies. The former Musk colleague also noted Musk’s Mars ambition, which started as a philanthropic project and grew into a commercial business. Meanwhile, Brockman believes that Musk never truly treated OpenAI as an independent nonprofit. He explained that Musk seemed intent on starting a competitor, which is why ChatGPT maker had secretly considered removing him from its board. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This has raised the possibility that the foremost meme coin could repeat its parabolic rally in the 2021 bull cycle. Dogecoin Eyes Parabolic Rally As RSI Enters Oversold Levels Crypto analyst Cryptollica has indicated that the Dogecoin price could record another parabolic rally as the RSI enters oversold levels. In an X post, the analyst noted that this is the fourth time in 12 years that the DOGE RSI has been this oversold, and that every time this has happened, it has been life-changing. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is Following This Bullish Signal With A Major Target Cryptollica further remarked that the drop in Dogecoin’s RSI to this low has always been an “epic buying opportunity” and that those who loaded up made insane gains. In line with this, the analyst remarked that this is another massive opportunity. Meanwhile, Cryptollica alluded to previous times when the RSI dropped this low, including during the last cycle bottom, when DOGE dropped to $0.5. Dogecoin rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.74 after bottoming at $0.05, recording massive gains in the process. Cryptollica noted that these setups don’t come often and urged market participants not to miss this one. His accompanying chart suggested that DOGE could rally to the psychological $1 level this time around, marking a new ATH for the foremost meme coin. DOGE Mirroring Past Accumulation Pattern In another X post, Cryptollica highlighted a similar DOGE/BTC pattern between the 2014-2017 and 2021-2026 accumulations. The analyst stated that the structure is identical and assured that the bleed against Bitcoin is not “death” but the necessary energy compression before the rotation. Cryptollica added that when the green line breaks, risk appetite changes instantly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Meanwhile, Cryptollica declared that the fractal was loading, with Dogecoin set to be the heartbeat of the altcoin cycle. The analyst claimed that this is the final stage of a multi-year compression against Bitcoin. This historically leads to a specific volatility squeeze that precedes a massive capital rotation from BTC to altcoins. Crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus raised the possibility of a Dogecoin rally to $0.70, which could be near. This came as the analyst noted that DOGE has been moving in a nice way up throughout this entire bull cycle. This is said to be evident in the mini cycles, with the foremost meme coin tapping the dotted line, followed by a slow retrace. Based on this pattern, Bitcoinensus noted that DOGE could soon target the $0.70 range if the strong momentum in the crypto market returns. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.137, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Information moves instantly across platforms, yet money still travels through fragmented systems burdened by intermediaries, delays, and high costs. As cross-border commerce expands, the demand for a seamless payment layer has intensified, placing digital settlement infrastructure at the center of financial modernization. This evolving discussion gained clarity through a recent perspective shared by market commentator Jake Claver, who reframed XRP’s purpose within the financial system. His analysis shifted attention away from speculative narratives and toward XRP’s structural role in enabling interoperability across financial systems. Think of XRP like the protocol layer for payments kind of how email made it easy to send messages across platforms. XRP lets banks and financial apps talk to each other instantly, with almost no cost or friction. That’s what makes it such a strong candidate to serve as the… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 16, 2026 The Fragmentation Problem in Global Payments Banks and payment providers operate on isolated ledgers governed by local regulations and legacy technology. When funds move across borders, they pass through multiple institutions that each impose fees and processing delays. Messaging networks improved coordination but failed to eliminate settlement friction. Financial institutions now recognize that efficiency requires a shared settlement layer that can connect these silos. Without such a layer, even the most advanced financial applications remain constrained by outdated infrastructure. XRP’s Architecture Enables Interoperability Jake Claver emphasized that XRP was designed to function as connective tissue rather than a standalone payment product. XRP settles transactions within seconds, supports high throughput, and operates with minimal transaction costs. These characteristics make XRP suitable for large institutional payments that require fast and predictable transactions. XRP also maintains neutrality. It does not favor any currency, jurisdiction, or financial institution. Instead, it allows value to move between different systems without forcing participants to adopt a single ledger or abandon existing processes. This structure closely resembles how Internet protocols enable communication across diverse platforms. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Institutional Framework Supports Adoption Ripple has built enterprise-grade infrastructure around this interoperability model. Banks, payment firms, and remittance providers across multiple regions already use Ripple’s technology for cross-border coordination. These integrations involve regulatory compliance, operational testing, and real-world transaction flows. Within this framework, XRP serves as an optional liquidity layer. Institutions can activate it once internal risk assessments and regulatory approvals align. This approach reduces adoption friction and enables XRP usage to scale rapidly when conditions permit. A Protocol Layer for the Internet of Value Viewing XRP as a protocol layer reframes its relevance within global finance. Protocols succeed by enabling connectivity, reliability, and standardization. Email transformed communication because it worked across providers without requiring central control. XRP aims to perform a similar function for value transfer . Its success depends less on retail enthusiasm and more on institutional demand for faster settlement, lower costs, and real-time liquidity. From this perspective, XRP’s role in global payments hinges on adoption timing rather than technical capability. As financial institutions continue to modernize, the need for a neutral settlement protocol becomes increasingly difficult to ignore.

The damage claim was outlined in a court document file d Fr iday by Musk’s attorney, coming one day after a federal judge denied OpenAI and Microsoft’s last attempt to prevent a jury trial scheduled for late April in Oakland, California. Expert calculates damages based on startup contribution According to the filing, financial economist C. Paul Wazzan calculated that Musk deserves a portion of OpenAI’s present $500 billion value because he was allegedly cheated out of the $38 million in startup funds he gave when he helped establish the company in 2015. “Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor’s initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned – and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much larger than Mr. Musk’s initial contributions,” wrote Steven Molo, Musk’s attorney. Musk departed from OpenAI’s board in 2018 and started his own artificial intelligence venture in 2023. He initiated legal proceedings in 2024 against Sam Altman regarding the OpenAI co-founder and chief executive’s intentions to transform the organization into a for-profit entity. Both OpenAI and Microsoft have rejected his accusations. OpenAI calls lawsuit baseless harassment “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,” OpenAI stated. “This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign.” OpenAI has cautioned investors to anticipate Musk making headline-grabbing statements as the case moves toward trial. Microsoft chose not to provide a statement. The company behind ChatGPT revealed its reorganization in October, stating it had granted a 27% ownership share to its long-term supporter Microsoft in a change that would maintain the nonprofit division’s oversight of for-profit activities. Altman has criticized Musk’s legal challenge to OpenAI’s reorganization as misusing the court system to hinder a business rival. The expert witness Wazzan determined the damage amount by adding together Musk’s financial contributions and other non-monetary inputs, such as technical and business guidance, to OpenAI. His calculations show the alleged improper gains amount to $65.50 billion to $109.43 billion for OpenAI and $13.30 billion to $25.06 billion for Microsoft.

The move has triggered algorithmic selling and stop-loss cascades, increasing the risk of a deeper correction if nearby support fails. Powered by Outset PR, this analysis reflects the agency’s commitment to strategic, data-backed communication for the crypto industry. Outset PR helps visionary Web3 founders amplify their narrative and convert momentum into measurable outcomes. This analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , demonstrating the agency's dedication to providing strategic, data-backed communication for the crypto industry. ADA Loses Key Moving Averages ADA has broken below both its 7-day simple moving average at $0.398 and its 30-day SMA at $0.378. Losing these short- and medium-term trend indicators signals weakening market control by buyers and reinforces the bearish shift in structure. The breakdown followed a rejection at the $0.41 Fibonacci level, where upside attempts stalled and selling pressure intensified. This rejection confirmed that bulls lacked the momentum needed to sustain a recovery. Momentum Weakens as Selling Accelerates Momentum indicators reflect the deterioration in price structure. The 7-day Relative Strength Index has slipped to 48.37, indicating fading bullish momentum without yet reaching oversold territory. The loss of multiple technical levels in quick succession triggered algorithmic selling and stop-loss cascades, accelerating the move lower as automated strategies reacted to the breakdown. ADA is now testing the $0.387–$0.382 support zone. This area represents the last near-term buffer before a more pronounced downside move. Failure to hold this range would likely accelerate losses toward the $0.35 level, which stands out as the next major support on the chart. A move toward that area would confirm continuation of the bearish trend rather than a temporary shakeout. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Cardano Price Prediction: Bearish Setup is Formed For the downside scenario to weaken, ADA would need to reclaim lost ground decisively. A daily close back above $0.398 would invalidate the current bearish structure and suggest that the breakdown was a false move rather than the start of a sustained decline. Until that happens, rallies are likely to face selling pressure. Cardano’s break below key moving averages has shifted short-term momentum to the downside, with stop-loss cascades amplifying selling pressure. As ADA tests the $0.387–$0.382 zone, the market faces a clear inflection point. Holding support could stabilize price action, but a breakdown would likely open the path toward $0.35 unless bulls regain control above $0.398.
