SOL was trading for $5 before its huge rally in 2021. Currently, MUTM is in phase 7 of presale for $0.04, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking asymmetrical gains. MUTM is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, creating real on-chain demand for investors. If MUTM were to tap the DeFi market in the same way that SOL did, it could reach multiples similar to what Solana achieved in 2021, positioning itself as the best crypto to invest in. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana has recently stabilized above long-term support following a trend of lower highs, which means that it might be overcoming some of the downward pressure that it was facing. Currently, it’s testing downward resistance lines, which will define its future trend. Although SOL is a strong long-term investment, it’s no longer an asymmetrical investment opportunity, unlike projects that are still in their earlier cycles, for example, MUTM, which many analysts now consider the next crypto to explode. MUTM Presale Growth The Mutuum Finance presale has been effective in incentivizing early investors while also promoting a smooth process of token distribution. From a price of $0.01, the token has appreciated to $0.04 in Phase 7, a tremendous 300% increase for the initial investors. Phase 8 is set at $0.045, while trading will commence at $0.06. Early investors get a head start, as seen below, where a $5,000 investment made today will increase to $6,250 at the opening of Phase 8, realizing a $1,250 profit long before the token listing on exchanges. With more than 18,800 participants and close to $19.8 million raised, MUTM appears to be gaining significant adoption momentum, making it a highly notable rising star of 2026 and the best crypto to invest in during the presale stage. Dual Lending System: Real Utility & Real Returns Mutuum Finance provides a two-way lending system to achieve the highest possible flexibility and returns. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools enable lenders to contribute liquid funds such as ETH and USDC, earning variable interest rates depending on the pool’s usage ratio. An investor could for instance deposit 20,000 USDC in a P2C lending pool, earning 10-15% APY. This could see their initial investment grow into up to $23,000 by the end of the first year. Further compounding over the years could mean reaching as high as $100,000. In contrast, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending option is designed for riskier and less liquid tokens, such as meme coins, where the terms of the loan can be customized and agreed upon by the borrower and the lender. A borrower, for instance, can acquire a 30-day loan of $20,000 in USDC collateralized with a total of $25,000 in PEPE at an interest rate of 15% APR, making MUTM a flexible tool for those searching for the next crypto to explode with real utility. Risk Management Risk management practices are a top priority at Mutuum Finance, with Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation levels determined according to the volatility of each asset. For instance, ETH and USDT support up to 75% Loan-to-Value with an 80% liquidation level, enabling an investor with $8,000 of ETH to take a loan of up to $6,000 of USDT without selling their holdings. More volatile assets support lower Loan-to-Value levels, ensuring that both lenders and the system are safe. Automated liquidation of positions maintains a stable system and inspires trust among users that their assets and returns are safe and secure, which is why analysts consider MUTM the best crypto to invest in for high-potential gains. Prior to deploying on mainnet, Mutuum Finance will roll out Version 1 of its lending/borrowing solution on the Sepolia Testnet . Users will be able to engage with ETH, USDT liquidity pools, mtTokens, which are tokens of deposits, debt tokens issued as a result of taking loans, as well as the automated liquidator bot. In this way, test users will be able to see, hands-on, how interest rates work, how collaterals are handled, among other aspects of the platform. Upside Post-Launch Looking forward from the presale, market analysts believe that as MUTM implements layer-2 scaling, multi-chain expansion, and the launch of interest-bearing pools, adoption-driven market demand may drive token prices substantially upwards. Phase 7 presale token investments of $0.04 may potentially break through several times to mirror Solana’s growth. This solidifies Mutuum Finance’s status as the best crypto to invest in this year.

Monero is built around private, censorship-resistant transactions, using cryptography to obscure wallet balances and transfer details on-chain. That privacy-first design has kept XMR in its own category for years, often moving independently from large-cap altcoins when narrative-driven momentum returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Hits Level Seen Only 7 Times In 6 Years – A Rare Historical Signal Since the beginning of the year, XMR has surged from roughly $410 to nearly $799, a near-vertical move that reflects both aggressive demand and a rapid shift in trader attention toward the privacy coin sector. The breakout comes after similar sharp rallies in names like Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH), which also experienced explosive upside followed by fast pullbacks. Zcash climbed to around $750 before reversing toward the $400 zone, while Dash ran to roughly $120 and later dropped to near $35. Those moves set the tone for a volatile privacy coin rotation, where price action tends to accelerate quickly once momentum enters the sector. Now, with Monero leading the pack, the market is watching whether this rally can establish higher support levels, or if it becomes another short-lived spike driven by crowded positioning and thin liquidity. Retail Hype Signal Flashes As Monero Extends Its Breakout Monero’s surge is now starting to show the same “retail frenzy” footprint that appeared earlier in other privacy coins, raising questions about how sustainable this move really is. A trading frequency signal—often associated with crowded participation and late-stage chasing—previously lit up in Zcash and Dash near their local tops, before both coins reversed sharply. In Zcash, the retail-heavy activity spike aligned with a push to roughly $698, and the price has since slid back to around $442, a drawdown of about 37%. Dash followed a similar pattern. The trigger appeared near $120, before the market cooled off aggressively and dragged the price down to the $57 zone. A decline of roughly 52%. Now, the same signal is flashing for Monero. The retail-frequency threshold appeared around $714 as XMR traded deep into its parabolic advance. That matters because these setups often reflect emotional participation, where buyers enter late, liquidity thins, and volatility increases sharply. This doesn’t guarantee an immediate top, but history suggests a clear risk: once retail demand becomes dominant, the rally can become fragile. The bigger question is whether Monero can absorb profit-taking without breaking structure—or if it repeats the same post-spike unwind seen in ZEC and DASH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $97K As Long-Term Holders Supply Stays Locked XMR Surges Into Parabolic Territory Monero is showing one of the strongest price trends in the market. The weekly chart is now moving into a clear parabolic expansion phase. After spending much of 2024 in a slow accumulation range, XMR gradually built a base and repeatedly defended higher lows. This has set the stage for the subsequent breakout. Once Monero reclaimed the $200 area, momentum accelerated sharply, and buyers began to absorb sell pressure without allowing deep pullbacks. The chart shows a clear bullish structure. With price holding above rising moving averages and using them as dynamic support during each consolidation phase. This type of price behavior usually reflects sustained demand rather than a single short-lived spike. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Take Control: Futures Positioning Turns Bullish for First Time Since October However, the most notable development is the latest impulse candle. We saw the price surge into the $700 zone with almost no overhead resistance. These kinds of vertical advances often signal aggressive market participation and can lead to a volatility expansion event. Price either continues trending higher or enters a sharp correction after exhaustion. From a market structure perspective, the key is whether Monero can hold above previous breakout zones near $500–$600. If buyers defend those areas, the uptrend remains intact. If not, a deeper retracement could unfold quickly.

Ripple CEO Highlights Crypto Impact On CPI Data In an X post , the Ripple CEO noted that the latest CPI data shows a 3.5% reduction in financial services costs for consumers. He then raised the possibility that this decline could be partly due to the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies . The administration has created a regulatory environment for the crypto industry that may have made financial services more accessible, reducing their cost. Notably, the CPI data came in line with expectations, which was a positive for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . The CPI came in at 2.7% year-over-year (YoY), in line with expectations. The core CPI came in at 2.6% YoY, lower than expectations of 2.7%, signaling that inflation in the country has remained steady. Following the release of the CPI data, Bitcoin broke $92,000 and since surged to a new yearly high above $97,000. Major altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple-linked XRP , Solana, and Dogecoin have also recorded significant gains. The inflation data is bullish for the market as it could, in the long run, influence the Fed to make more rate cuts if inflation holds steady rather than trends upwards. Polymarket data show an increase in the number of rate cuts the Fed could make following the release of the CPI data. There is now a 27% chance of three rate cuts this year, while a 21% chance of two. Previously, crypto traders were betting on only two rate cuts this year. Trump is also expected to nominate a rate-cut advocate as the next Fed chair , which would be positive for lower interest rates. Ripple CEO Also Comments On Crypto Legislation The Ripple CEO also commented on the CLARITY Act’s markup , just before its postponement. He noted that the markup was long overdue, but that it is a massive step forward in providing workable frameworks for crypto while continuing to protect consumers. Garlinghouse further remarked that he and his company know firsthand that clarity beats chaos and that the bill’s success is crypto’s success. The Ripple CEO also mentioned that they will continue to move forward with a fair debate and remain optimistic that issues can be resolved through the markup process. The Senate Banking Committee has since postponed the markup after Coinbase withdrew its support for the bill due to concerns about DeFi and stablecoin yield provisions. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse has yet to comment on the postponement, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes that progress with the bill hasn’t stalled despite the setback.",Ripple|altcoins|bitcoin|Brian Armstrong|CLARITY Act|coinbase|DeFi|dogecoin|Donald Trump|Ethereum|Polymarket|ripple|solana|stablecoin|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-16 22:00:46

As this focus on tangible applications grows, investors are seeking out new ecosystems that offer similar utility. This trend has put a spotlight on GeeFi, a decentralized wallet platform that has already raised over $2.6 million in its presale by delivering a user-centric experience and a clear product roadmap. Building a Comprehensive Financial Ecosystem GeeFi is developing a suite of financial tools designed to offer real-world utility, mirroring Avalanche’s focus on payments and rewards. The project’s roadmap includes the upcoming launch of a proprietary Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and specialized Cryptocards. The DEX will provide a seamless environment for trading digital assets directly within its decentralized wallet. At the same time, the Cryptocards will connect users’ digital holdings to everyday commerce, making it easy to spend crypto for goods and services. These features are designed to create sustained demand for the $GEE token. Substantial ROI Potential for Early Backers The investment metrics for GeeFi’s presale are compelling. The $GEE token is currently priced at $0.10 , a significant discount from its confirmed exchange listing price of $0.40 . This provides an immediate 300% ROI for presale participants at the time of listing. Market analysts further project that the token’s value could rise to $3.00 as the platform’s full feature set is rolled out. A $1,500 investment at the current price could potentially grow to $45,000 , representing a 2900% return . Direct Presale Access Fuels User Growth Ease of use is a critical factor in driving adoption, and GeeFi has made participating in its presale remarkably simple. The team recently integrated the $GEE token presale directly into the GeeFi Wallet application. This strategic move eliminates the complexities often associated with early-stage investing, allowing users to purchase tokens instantly with Ethereum (ETH), USDT, or a standard bank card. This seamless experience has significantly boosted participation, pushing Phase 3 of the presale to 90% sold out . With only 3 million tokens remaining at the $0.10 price, the opportunity for entry is quickly diminishing. Rewarding Community and Long-Term Holding GeeFi has implemented a multi-faceted rewards system to foster a strong and engaged community. The platform offers a staking feature that allows token holders to earn a passive yield on their assets, which encourages long-term holding and helps stabilize the token’s economy. In addition, a 5% referral commission rewards users for bringing new participants into the ecosystem. These incentives, alongside a bonus system for early presale investors, create multiple avenues for maximizing returns. A Strong Commitment to Security and Privacy As institutional products like tokenized credit come on-chain, security becomes more important than ever. GeeFi is addressing this by fortifying its wallet with advanced security and privacy features. The latest update includes enhanced encryption and robust backend protocols designed to protect user assets and data from digital threats. This commitment to building a secure and trustworthy platform provides users with the confidence needed to manage their digital finances, establishing GeeFi as a reliable hub in the decentralized economy. Conclusion GeeFi is proving that a focus on utility, security, and accessibility is a winning strategy. As the broader market matures, with platforms like Avalanche leading the charge in institutional adoption, GeeFi stands out as a high-potential project for investors seeking real value. The window to join the presale at the current price is closing.

57225236,https://cryptonews.com/?p=475515,1768602600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57225236.jpeg,"New ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, PEPE and Ethereum By the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/new-chatgpt-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-pepe-and-ethereum-by-the-end-of-2026/,"OpenAI’s world famous AI , ChatGPT, predicts veritably explosive price scenarios for XRP, Pepe and Ethereum, offering a clear warning to investors with FOMO this year. The AI suggests that a sustained bull market, potentially reinforced by clearer and more supportive U.S. regulation, could propel these cryptocurrencies to fresh all-time highs (ATHs) in the next major cycle. Below is how ChatGPT expects these leading cryptocurrencies to perform during a projected 2026 bull market. XRP ($XRP): ChatGPT Sees XRP Reaching $12 by 2027 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) started the year on solid footing, gaining 19% in the opening week alone. Over the past fortnight, it grew 9% to trade at $2.06. According to ChatGPT, sustained bullish momentum could see XRP climb to $12 by 2027. Source: ChatGPT XRP was one of the strongest-performing large-cap cryptocurrencies throughout much of last year. In July, it notched its first new ATH in seven years, hitting $3.65 after Ripple achieved a landmark legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That court decision significantly reduced regulatory ambiguity around XRP and eased concerns that the SEC could classify similar altcoins as securities. Since New Year’s Day, XRP has risen roughly 12.5%, while its Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 58, indicating the token’s current price is strong with plenty of headroom for a weekend rally. Reaching ChatGPT’s bullish target would require substantial upside, however, as XRP needs to gain approximately 483% from current levels to hit $12. The recent launch of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., is channeling institutional capital into XRP, similar to the strong consistent multibillion dollar inflows seen following Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. Pepe ($PEPE): ChatGPT Predicts a 2,000% Price Explosion Pepe ($PEPE) , which debuted in April 2023, has become the largest meme coin not based on a doge avatar, boasting a market cap of about $2.5 billion. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comics, PEPE’s immediately recognisable face and ongoing cultural relevance have given it a strong presence across crypto-focused social platforms. Despite intense competition within the meme coin space, PEPE’s loyal community keep it pumping near the top of the sector. Periodic cryptic posts from Elon Musk on X have also fueled speculation that PEPE could rank alongside his widely known DOGE and BTC interests. PEPE is currently trading near $0.0000059, placing it roughly 79% below its December 2024 ATH of $0.00002803. In ChatGPT’s most bullish scenario, PEPE could surge as much as 1,934% to around $0.00012, a move that would take it well beyond its previous record high. Ethereum ($ETH): ChatGPT Models a Potential Rally Toward $15,000 Ethereum ($ETH) , the world leading blockchain for smart contracts, decentralized applications, and DeFi, remains the leading platform driving Web3 innovation. With a market capitalization approaching $400 billion and $75 billion in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols, Ethereum is crypto’s primary hub for on-chain commercial activity. Ethereum’s track record for security, dependable settlement, and its early dominance in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization make it a prime candidate for deeper institutional adoption, particularly if U.S. lawmakers advance clearer, comprehensive crypto legislation. ETH is currently trading around $3,308, with strong resistance expected near $5,000. It set its all-time high of $4,946.05 back in August. If ChatGPT’s bullish thesis plays out, a decisive break above the $5,000 level could open the door to multiple new ATHs this year in the $7,000 to $15,000 range. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Play With Explosive Upside Potential Beyond ChatGPT’s forecasts, the crypto presale market continues to attract investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as one of January’s most discussed presales, raising around $4.5 million ahead of its expected exchange launch. The project puts an louche, muscle-bound twist on Dogecoin. Brash, over-the-top, and intentionally absurd, Maxi Doge channels the raw meme energy that originally fueled meme coin culture. After years of watching his cousin DOGE dominate the spotlight, Maxi Doge is rallying a his own degen army driven by meme loyalty, aggressive trading strategies, and an unapologetic embrace of volatility. MAXI is an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a considerably lower environmental footprint than Dogecoin’s proof-of-work design. The current presale phase offers staking rewards of up to 69% APY, although returns decrease as more users join the staking pool. MAXI is priced at $0.0002785 in the latest round, with automatic price increases scheduled for future stages. Tokens can be purchased using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Maxi is sending Dogecoin back to the kennel with his tail between his legs! Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The attack was detected around 14:01 UTC, and CyversAlerts, a web3 security platform, posted it shortly after at 14:34 UTC, making it one of the first reported cases of address poisoning in the new year. How the $500K address poisoning scam happened According to the alert posted by CyversAlerts, the victim had initially sent a small test transaction of 5,000 USDT to what they thought was the intended recipient address, which ended in D3E6F. However, this was a poisoned fake address being monitored by the scammer. The scammer’s address ended in f3e6F, only differing subtly in the middle characters, which is usually abbreviated with dots for aesthetic purposes, something that these scams exploit . Two minutes after the victim sent the $5,000, he followed up with a bulk transfer of 509,000 USDT to the same incorrect address, bringing the total loss to a whopping $514,000. According to the attack flow timeline shared by CyversAlerts, the scammer put a lot of preparation into the effort, sending multiple small transactions from various similar addresses to poison the victim’s transaction history. In this way, they were able to fool the victim into thinking the fake address was legitimate when they copied it from their history. Unfortunately, once confirmed onchain, funds lost to such scams are rarely recoverable. They prey on human error and “copy pasta” habits. Victim lost $50M in December 2025 Last year, address poisoning scams contributed significantly to the millions of dollars lost to crypto scams. One of the biggest known losses was recorded in December. That attack saw a seasoned trader fall victim, losing a shocking $50 million in a single transaction after they copied a fraudulent wallet address from their transaction history. The victim transferred 49,999,950 USDT to the attacker-controlled address because it also closely mimicked their intended destination, with the first three and last four characters matching. The scammer quickly converted the stolen funds to ETH and distributed them across multiple wallets. Then they partially funneled it through the Tornado Cash mixer. According to reports, the victim’s wallet had been active for approximately two years and was primarily used for USDT transfers, with the stolen funds withdrawn from Binance shortly before the poisoned transfer occurred. Like the person who lost $500K today, the victim from last year also sent a test transaction, but theirs actually went to the correct address. This made them not doublecheck when they pasted the address again from their transaction history to send the bulk of the funds. It was one of the largest onchain scam losses in recent times. The victim followed up with an onchain message demanding a return of 98% of the stolen funds within 48 hours and backed it up with threats to involve law enforcement and legal entities, even offering the attacker a $1 million white hat bounty if they returned the funds in full. “This is your final opportunity to resolve this matter peacefully,” the message read. “If you fail to comply: we will escalate the matter through legal international law enforcement channels.” However, as of the time of this writing, no response has come from the scammer, and there is no proof the funds were recovered.Since it was laundered via Tornado Cash, the trail quickly went cold and recovery is unlikely.

Central to this is whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delivers Project Crypto quickly, a proposal aimed at updating federal securities laws to provide digital asset firms with long-overdue regulatory clarity. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market dominance has been sliding since summer , which indicates people are ditching it for altcoins. All of these factors ferment the high upside potential of XRP, Shiba Inu and Bonk in the next major bull cycle. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Eyes New Q1 Breakout With a market cap exceeding $125 billion, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) remains the largest cryptocurrency purpose-built for cross-border payments, offering rapid settlement times and very low transaction fees. Ripple designed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) primarily for banks and financial institutions, positioning itself as a faster and more cost-efficient alternative to SWIFT, which can be slow and expensive. Ripple’s underlying technology has also come up on the radars of organizations such as the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House, underscoring its increasing relevance. XRP surged to an all-time high of $3.65 in mid-2025 after Ripple resolved its long-running legal battle with the SEC. Since then, the token has declined roughly 43% amid a broader crypto downturn and is now trading near $2.06 after gaining 9% in the last fortnight. One recent game changer was the debut of multiple spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), giving traditional investors a regulated pathway into the asset. Additional ETF approvals, alongside a more favorable macro backdrop, could drive XRP toward $5 by Q2. A move toward $10 later in the year is possible if supported by regulatory progress, positive macro signals, and continued expansion of the Ripple ecosystem. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Origins to a High Utility Network Introduced in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has grown into the second-largest meme coin, with a market capitalization around $5 billion. Supported by a vast community and an expanding range of products, SHIB is increasingly viewed as a blue-chip altcoin contender rather than a purely-for-entertainment meme coin. At the time of writing, it trades around $0.0000084. Breaking above the sticky $0.000022 resistance level could set the stage for a move toward $0.00003 by March. In a sustained bullish scenario, SHIB could even finish the quarter near $0.00005. Shiba Inu’s utility is more than just a sales pitch. Shibarium, its Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution, reduces fees and enhances scalability. Additional privacy features and upcoming upgrades further reinforce SHIB’s transition from meme culture to a broader blockchain ecosystem. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin on the Rise Bonk ($BONK) , a dog-themed meme coin native to Solana, launched on December 25, 2022, triggering a holiday surge that pushed Solana ($SOL) up 34% in just two days and firmly established BONK as a key player within the ecosystem. Now trading at $0.00001077 with a market cap near $1 billion, it is one of the largest meme coins on Solana and is close to flipping the Official Trump ($TRUMP) token as the network’s flagship meme coin. Beyond speculation, BONK is actively used across Solana DeFi for tipping, micropayments, and NFT collateral. A falling wedge formation between late November and mid-March anticipated BONK’s July rally, during which it peaked at $0.00003906 before retracing alongside the broader meme coin market. Although still roughly 80% below its November 2024 all-time high of $0.00005825, renewed market momentum could see it set a new ATH by spring. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): It Looks Like a Meme Coin; It’s Really a High-Performance Bitcoin Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer-2 initiative that pairs playful visuals with serious technical ambitions, delivering faster transactions, lower fees, and advanced smart contract functionality on Bitcoin. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper incorporates decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables seamless cross-chain transfers involving Bitcoin. The project’s presale has already raised approximately $30.7 million, and market watchers anticipate 10x to 100x upside once the token lists on exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit reported no critical vulnerabilities in the smart contract. The HYPER token plays multiple roles within the ecosystem, including payment of transaction fees, governance voting, and staking rewards. Early presale participants can currently earn staking yields of up to 38% APY, although returns are expected to decline as the staking pool expands. With a full rollout planned for 2026, Bitcoin Hyper is an onramp for both long-term Bitcoin maxis and newcomers alike into the next evolution of the Bitcoin network.

Patrick Witt posted an update on X regarding the sale of 57.55 BTC forfeited by Samourai Wallet developers Keonne Rodriguez and Will Lonergan Hill. Did the SDNY violate Presidential orders? Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month that the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had sold approximately $6.3 million worth of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin was handed over by Samourai Wallet developers Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill as part of a guilty plea. On November 3 last year, on-chain data recorded a transfer of the seized 57.55353033 BTC from a government-controlled address (bc1q4pntkz06z7xxvdcers09cyjqz5gf8ut4pua22r) to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. The Coinbase address soon showed a zero balance, causing many analysts to believe that the assets had been sold for cash, directly violating Executive Order 14233, signed by President Trump in March 2025. The order specifically mandates that any “Government BTC” acquired through criminal or civil forfeiture “shall not be sold” and must instead be held in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). Patrick Witt, the Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the situation. “We have received confirmation from (the) DOJ that the digital assets forfeited by Samourai Wallet have not been liquidated and will not be liquidated, per EO 14233. They will remain on the USG balance sheet as part of the SBR,” he said . Will the SDNY continue to defy the White House? Despite Todd Blanche’s memo from May 2025 that instructed the DOJ to only go after cases where there’s evidence of “knowing and willful” criminal intent by the developers themselves, the SDNY went ahead to successfully secure convictions for Roman Storm, a co-founder of Tornado Cash. In August 2025, a jury found him guilty of conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The SDNY also sentenced Rodriguez and Hill in November 2025 to five and four years in prison, respectively. President Trump told reporters in December last year that he is “looking into” a pardon for Rodriguez . Tim Scott, the Senate Banking Committee Chair, was forced to postpone a high-profile hearing for the CLARITY Act after Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, announced on social media that he would no longer be supporting the current draft. Armstrong said he is concerned that the bill gives too much authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over stablecoins and DeFi protocols. And without the backing of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, the bipartisan consensus led by Senator Cynthia Lummis has begun to fracture. Despite this, she has so far stated that lawmakers are “closer than ever” to a final deal. The current draft of the CLARITY Act includes rules that ban platforms like Coinbase from offering interests or rewards on stablecoins. The ban is a major win for traditional banking platforms, which claim that high stablecoin returns were taking away trillions of dollars from their sector. If these issues aren’t resolved, the bill could fail to pass before the 2026 election cycle starts and freeze all legislative processes. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

But even with the short-term dip, ETH is still up 7% this week and 13% over the past month, holding strong while setting the stage for a bigger breakout. Fueling this bullish momentum is a major announcement from BitMine , the largest Ethereum treasury in the market, which just invested $200 million into Beast Industries , the media company founded by YouTube icon MrBeast . This move signals confidence in Ethereum as the foundation for the next wave of digital platforms, content economies, and Web3 media. Ethereum remains the largest and most battle-tested layer-one network, and with institutional capital flowing in, the long-term Ethereum price prediction continues to look increasingly bullish. Ethereum Price Prediction: MrBeast Just Got a $200M Backing From One of ETH’s Biggest Whales – What Happens Next? As explained in the accompanying press release , BitMine – which currently holds just over 200,000 ETH (c. $13.7 billion) – has announced a $200 million equity investment into Beast Industries, with Beast CEO Jeff Housenbold indicating that there may also be collaboration between the two firms at some point. 2/ For those not familiar, @MrBeast is the number #1 content creator in the world and central to the lives of GenZ, GenAlpha and even Millennials – BitMine has targeted 5% of its balance sheet for ""moonshots"" and this is strategically sound move pic.twitter.com/iMLaJeNHWu — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) January 15, 2026 “Their support is a strong validation of our vision, strategy, and growth trajectory and it provides additional capital to achieve our goal to become the most impactful entertainment brand in the world,” he said. “We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.” This is bullish for both BitMine and MrBeast, and (by extension) it’s also bullish for the Ethereum price, although the latter hasn’t reacted all that positively to this news. As we see from its chart below, it continues to ride some significant momentum, despite the slight correction of the past 24 hours. It recently broke out of a bullish pennant, while its two main indicators – the relative strength index (yellow) and the MACD (orange, blue) – are still in the ascendancy, having been subdued for several months previously. Source: TradingView It therefore remains a very opportune time to buy Ethereum, which still remains 33% down from its ATH of $4,946, which it set in August. And fundamentally, Ethereum is one of the most bankable cryptos in the market. Its TVL accounts for 58% of the entire crypto ecosystem , and that’s not including Ethereum-based L2s, while Ethereum ETFs and digital funds currently sit on assets worth $25.26 billion . The future is therefore very bright for the token, with the Ethereum price likely to reach $4,000 by the end of Q1, and then $5,000 by H2. SUBBD Is Preparing to Launch An AI-Powered Content Creation Platform: Next 100x Alt? While Ethereum is one of the safer altcoins to invest in, traders looking for bigger, quicker gains may also want to diversify into smaller cap tokens. This may include allocating a percentage to presale coins, which in building up momentum during their sales can then go on to rally strongly when they list on exchanges. One token generating some early momentum right now is SUBBD ($SUBBD), a new Ethereum-based project that’s preparing to launching an adult content creation platform. Earn up to $500 per day with your own AI Creator Start here: https://t.co/9jJM0SyyiQ https://t.co/v7oruRW0ag — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) December 28, 2025 SUBBD launched its presale a couple of months ago, and has so far raised more than $1.4 million, a signal of just how much interest it’s attracting. Much of this interest comes from how it’s planning to combine AI and crypto in order to give its content creation platform an edge over pre-existing rivals. Its platform will offer a suite of AI tools that will make it easier for content creators to produce engaging content, including tools that help with ideas, that produce media and videos, and that also produce AI agents/performers. These promise to make users much more efficient, while the use of crypto means that payouts will be transparent and immediate. Together, this combination promises to make SUBBD one of the most advanced content platforms on the Web, and given that the SUBBD token will be necessary to pay subscriptions, it could experience substantial demand. Investors can buy it now by going to the SUBBD website , where the token is currently selling for $0.057475.

57227040,658018,1768604407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57227040.jpeg,"Bitcoin Smart Money Buys, While Retail Dumps: Why The Latest Rally Looks Well-Founded",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rally-looks-well-founded/,"A few days ago, the price of Bitcoin experienced a bounce after weeks of trading below the $91,000 mark. However, this renewed momentum appears to be gradually fading as the crypto market slowly shifts toward a bearish state, with large and retail BTC investors moving in a distinct direction. What’s Happening Behind The Bitcoin’s Rise Bitcoin may have slightly pulled back from its most recent bounce, but the price is still holding strong above the $95,000 level. Meanwhile, the latest jump has attracted significant attention in the broader cryptocurrency market, with the move being increasingly viewed as well-justified rather than speculative. Currently, on-chain and market data are showing a clear divergence in who is driving the ongoing move. Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain data analytics platform, disclosed that itcoin’s surge to a high of $97,800 on Wednesday seemed more than warranted due to the behavior of large and retail investors. Institutions, long-term investors, and big wallets, together referred to as smart money, have been discreetly accumulating while retail traders have been gradually lowering their exposure and selling into strength. With the rotation of supply from weaker hands to more conviction-driven investors reducing selling pressure , the rally’s foundation is being strengthened. When whales are buying more BTC, and retail investors are dumping, it reflects a very bullish market outlook. Since January 10, whales and sharks, particularly wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have been amassing BTC, collectively scooping up more than 32,693 BTC. This massive purchase represents a +0.24% rise to their collective holdings. On the other hand, retail or shrimp holders, those holding less than 0.01 BTC, have collectively offloaded over 149 BTC since January 10. Data shows that the dump represents a 30% decline in their holdings altogether. Santiment highlighted that the key signal underneath the action is that smart money is finally buying consistently, while micro money bows out. Furthermore, it is considered an ideal setup for a bull run. However, how long retail doubts the formed tiny rally will determine how long it lasts, and the “Very Bullish” green zone is still in place for the time being. Ongoing FUD In The Market Set To Propel BTC’s Price Even with the recent recovery, Bitcoin is seeing negative interactions from crypto enthusiasts and analysts on social media platforms. This behavior implies that the crowd is not entirely confident in the BTC rally that occurred on Wednesday. Although the development may seem present itself as negative, it is actually a good sign that the rally might extend . Social data reveals that commentary toward BTC across social media platforms has sharply leaned to a bearish outlook as prices have bounced this week. With markets often moving in the opposite direction of retail sentiment, Santiment noted that the most FUD in 10 days is likely to propel BTC to its first return above the $100,000 mark, which was last seen on November 13, 2025.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Retailers|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|fud|Santiment,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-16 23:00:07

After weeks of uneven price action, the ETH/USD chart on the 3-day timeframe is now printing a MACD bullish crossover, a signal that has preceded some of Ethereum’s rallies in the past. The setup is notable because it proposes a situation where Ethereum is laying the groundwork for another sustained rally that plays throughout the entirety of 2026. Bullish MACD Crossover For Ethereum The latest analysis shared by Javon Marks points to Ethereum climbing steadily following another MACD bullish crossover in December 2025. This bullish crossover is visible on the 3-day chart, where the MACD line crossed above the signal line from below. Related Reading: Ethereum Chart Turns Bullish: New Cycle Energy Points To $5,000 This is a change that shows downside momentum has faded and bullish pressure is starting to rebuild among Ethereum traders. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around the $3,300 region, about 33% below its August 2025 peak, but holding above swing lows in November 2025. According to Javon Marks, this recent price action is potentially the early stages of a much larger bull wave. This projection is based on the fact that the current crossover looks like an earlier crossover that occurred before Ethereum transitioned into an extended upside move in early 2025. Back in April 2025, the 3-day MACD also recorded a bullish crossover after an extended period of consolidation and pullbacks that lasted for a few months. That signal was the start of a multi-month rally that steadily pushed Ethereum higher, eventually culminating in a new all-time high in August 2025. Price action following that April crossover did not explode immediately. Ethereum first stabilized for a few days, then began forming higher lows above $1,500. Once resistance at $2,000 gave way, the rally gained much momentum and carried Ethereum from the mid-$2,000 range all the way above $4,800, broke above its old record of $4,878 that had stood since Nov. 2021, before finally peaking at $4,946 in late August. Price Targets To Look Forward To The final message of this technical analysis is that Ethereum is about to embark on a comparable rally and break out to new all-time highs. According to the updated outlook by Javon Marks, the first major level that defines this potential continuation is $4,811.71. This price acted as an important resistance level during the previous rally in 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Overbought Levels With Weekend Pump, Why A Crash Could Be Coming A decisive break and sustained hold above $4,811.71 would confirm that Ethereum has exited its corrective phase and re-entered into a broader expansion move. If that breakout unfolds as expected, the measured move projected from the chart points to $8,557.68 as a target to look forward to. This target is based on the magnitude of Ethereum’s last MACD-driven advance and would translate to a 160% increase from current price levels.

It marks the formal end of a two-and-a-half-year investigation into the Zcash Foundation into whether its altcoin offering complies with anti-money laundering (AML) and economic sanctions requirements. We are pleased to announce that the SEC has concluded its review and informed us that it does not intend to recommend any enforcement action or other changes against Zcash Foundation regarding this matter. https://t.co/zjxfh3mmst — Zcash Foundation (@ZcashFoundation) January 14, 2026 Until now, the privacy coin narrative has functioned in a regulatory dark spot, keeping meaningful adoption and capital largely sidelined. Much-needed input, as privacy coins find new relevance in this institution-led market cycle. Institutional use-cases need rails that offer privacy, yet are compliant with regulations and selective disclosure. The initial announcement triggered a 9% daily surge. With regulatory uncertainty lifted, Zcash could unlock sidelined capital and explore more mainstream use cases over the longer term. Still, near-term focus remains on internal conflict. The exodus of the core Electric Coin Company (ECC) development team raises doubts about the Zcash ecosystem’s integrity. Zcash Price Prediction: Could Regulatory Clarity Rekindle the Bull Run? Regulatory clarity may have been the catalyst Zcash needed to ease near-term pressure and refocus attention on a two-month bull flag continuation pattern that has been quietly developing. Momentum indicators hint at the potential return of bullish momentum as the structure nears its apex. ZEC USDT 1-day chart, bull flag pattern nears apex. Source: TradingView . The RSI appears to be carving out a higher low after rejection at the 50 neutral line. While not yet strong enough to confirm a bullish flip, underlying strength is building. The MACD reads much the same, closing in on a potential golden cross above the signal line and hinting that the early stages of a new uptrend may be taking shape. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout is all-time highs around $760. This interim resistance stands as the key proving grounds for a push into new price discovery. Fully realised, the bull flag pattern sets a potential $5,000 target , a 1,150% gain . That scenario, however, likely hinges on sustained institutional adoption and the emergence of a clear, mainstream use case for Zcash. Bitcoin Hyper: A Key Bitcoin Upgrade Most Traders are Missing Those who bet on narratives like Privacy coins over the leading cryptocurrency may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Bitcoin could soon gain deeper exposure in mainstream narratives like DeFi and RWAs. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale , and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

This prediction hinges not on speculative trading, but on a fundamental shift: Ethereum is rapidly becoming core financial infrastructure for major Wall Street institutions. According to analysis from Etherealize co-founders Vivek Raman and Danny Ryan, recent U.S. regulatory clarity has unlocked a wave of institutional adoption that could revalue the entire network. Ethereum Price Prediction Anchored in Regulatory Clarity The pathway to a $15,000 ETH valuation by 2027 is fundamentally linked to recent legislative developments. Specifically, the passage of definitive U.S. stablecoin legislation has provided the legal certainty large financial entities required. Consequently, firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan are now actively building on the Ethereum blockchain. This institutional adoption represents a critical phase change for the network, moving it beyond regulatory uncertainty. Moreover, this trend signals a broader acceptance of blockchain technology within traditional finance. Vivek Raman of Etherealize provided a clear rationale for this optimistic Ethereum price prediction. He stated that growth in two key sectors could propel Ethereum’s market capitalization into the trillions. First, the stablecoin market, which largely operates on Ethereum, is poised for exponential expansion. Second, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) like treasury bonds and real estate is gaining immense traction. Stablecoin Growth: Legislation has effectively legalized and structured the stablecoin market, encouraging traditional finance to participate. RWA Tokenization: Converting physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain creates efficiency and new financial products. Network Effect: As more institutions build, Ethereum becomes more valuable and secure for all participants. The Engine of Institutional Adoption on Ethereum Institutional interest in Ethereum is not a new phenomenon, but it has recently accelerated at a remarkable pace. Major asset managers are launching Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), providing a regulated gateway for traditional investors. Simultaneously, investment banks are exploring Ethereum for settling complex transactions and creating digital bonds. This institutional embrace provides a powerful validation of the network’s security and scalability post its transition to proof-of-stake. The following table contrasts the drivers of Ethereum’s value in previous cycles versus the current institutional cycle: Previous Cycle Drivers (Pre-2023) Current Institutional Cycle Drivers (2024+) Retail speculation and DeFi yield farming Stablecoin issuance for global payments NFT and digital collectible mania Tokenization of treasury bonds and real-world assets Layer-2 scaling promises Actual deployment of institutional-grade Layer-2 networks General smart contract potential Specific, regulated financial applications Expert Analysis: From Niche Technology to Financial Plumbing Danny Ryan, an Ethereum core developer and Etherealize co-founder, emphasizes the technological readiness. He notes that Ethereum’s development roadmap, including proto-danksharding, is directly aimed at supporting high-volume, low-cost transactions necessary for finance. This technical evolution, combined with regulatory progress, creates a unique convergence. Financial institutions are no longer just experimenting; they are deploying production systems. Therefore, the $15,000 price prediction by 2027 reflects a belief that Ethereum will capture a significant portion of the future digital asset economy’s value. Quantifying the Trillion-Dollar Revaluation Thesis The core of the $15K forecast rests on a quantifiable market expansion thesis. Raman suggests that if both the stablecoin and RWA markets grow fivefold from current levels, the fee demand and value secured on Ethereum would skyrocket. Currently, hundreds of billions in stablecoin value exist on Ethereum. A fivefold increase would place this figure in the multi-trillion dollar range, all requiring ETH to pay for transaction security. Similarly, tokenizing just a fraction of the global real-world asset market would represent an enormous value transfer onto the blockchain. This revaluation would be driven by several concrete factors. First, increased transaction fee revenue would make the network more valuable. Second, ETH would be staked by institutions to secure these high-value applications, reducing circulating supply. Finally, ETH would function as the primary collateral and settlement asset within this new financial system. As a result, its utility would expand far beyond its current uses. Conclusion The Ethereum price prediction of $15,000 by 2027 represents a fundamental analysis based on institutional adoption and regulatory maturation. The convergence of clear U.S. stablecoin laws, active development from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, and Ethereum’s own technical upgrades creates a compelling growth narrative. While price forecasts are inherently uncertain, the shift of Ethereum into the core infrastructure of Wall Street is a tangible, ongoing trend with profound implications for the network’s long-term value and the broader digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason behind the $15,000 Ethereum price prediction for 2027? The primary driver is institutional adoption accelerated by new U.S. stablecoin legislation, which is encouraging major financial firms like BlackRock and JPMorgan to build on Ethereum for stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization. Q2: How does stablecoin growth affect Ethereum’s price? Stablecoins are predominantly issued on Ethereum. Their growth increases network usage and transaction fees, which requires ETH to pay for gas. It also demonstrates Ethereum’s utility as core financial infrastructure, boosting its perceived value. Q3: What are Real-World Assets (RWAs) and why do they matter for ETH? RWAs are traditional financial assets like bonds, real estate, or commodities that are represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. Tokenizing them on Ethereum brings immense value onto the network, increasing demand for ETH to secure and transact these assets. Q4: Is this prediction just speculation? The prediction cited is based on observed trends: enacted legislation, public announcements from financial institutions, and the growing market size of Ethereum-based financial applications. It is an analytical forecast, not market speculation. Q5: What are the biggest risks to this Ethereum price prediction? Key risks include potential new regulatory hurdles, the rise of competing blockchain platforms for institutional use, unforeseen technical challenges, or a broader macroeconomic downturn that slows financial innovation.

This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as it indicates that Wall Street is quietly accumulating the token. Data from SoSoValue shows that XRP ETFs have only experienced one day of negative net inflows since the first of these products was launched in the U.S. As a result, the total assets held by these funds have skyrocketed to $1.51 billion in just two months, surpassing Solana’s ETF assets by more than $300 million. In the past 7 days, XRP has booked a 2% drop, although its year-to-date gains currently sit at 12% due to a spike in the price during the first few days of the year. This streak of positive net inflows indicates that both institutional and retail investors are steadily increasing their holdings, creating a strong floor for the token in case this pullback accelerates. XRP Price Prediction: Move to $3 Likely If XRP Breaks Out of Descending Triangle Again The 4-hour chart shows that XRP has formed a descending triangle once again. The last time this happened, the token broke out of this setup and delivered strong gains in the near term. Now that its bearish structure has been invalidated on higher time frames, another breakout could result in a much more explosive move that pushes XRP back to $3 at least. Source: TradingView The price has now crossed above the 200-period EMA in this lower time frame, favoring a bullish outlook. If the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rises past the mid-line and makes a bullish crossover above the 14-day moving average, that would confirm a buy signal for this altcoin. As altcoins seem ready to make a loud comeback, top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could benefit from a market-wide recovery. This project leverages Solana’s speed and low transaction costs to kickstart a new era for Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Will Transform BTC’s DeFi Via Solana’s High Speed and Low Fees Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a fast-moving presale that connects Solana’s high-speed blockchain with the Bitcoin network, giving investors a brand-new way to earn passive income on BTC. With the Hyper Layer 2 , users can stake, lend, and earn yield on their Bitcoin while enjoying low fees and faster transactions that help maximize gains instead of losing them to costs. In just a few months, the project has raised over $30 million. Its ambitious roadmap is what has investors all excited, as developers will now be able to launch highly efficient Bitcoin-native applications that BTC holders will love. As top wallets and exchanges increasingly adopt the Hyper L2, demand for its native token, $HYPER, will likely explode.

Crypto YouTuber Mason Versluis has cautioned investors against expecting XRP to surge to $1,000 in the foreseeable future, describing such forecasts as detached from economic and structural realities. Versluis shared his position on X, where he emphasized the need for more grounded expectations among XRP holders. While acknowledging the asset’s long-term potential, he made it clear that a $1,000 valuation is not something he anticipates in the near or medium term, including the period leading up to 2026. Why a Four-Figure XRP Price Is Unlikely According to Versluis, the global financial system is not currently positioned to sustain an XRP valuation anywhere near $1,000. He argued that regulatory frameworks, liquidity depth, and overall market maturity would all need to undergo substantial changes before such pricing could be justified. In his view, expectations have outpaced the actual pace of adoption and infrastructure development. Rather than focusing on extreme long-term targets, Versluis believes market participants should assess XRP’s progress based on measurable growth and realistic benchmarks tied to broader market behavior. More Achievable Price Levels Before 2026 Although Versluis is dismissive of the $1,000 narrative , he remains positive about XRP’s performance over the next few years. He outlined several price levels he considers more reasonable, suggesting that movements toward $5 or $10 would be consistent with current adoption trends. He also noted that a rise toward $20, while ambitious, is not entirely out of reach if market conditions remain favorable. These projections reflect ongoing discussions within the XRP community, where enthusiasm about long-term utility often contrasts with near-term price constraints. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Position and Growth Requirements At the time of writing, XRP is trading at approximately $2.04 , reflecting a modest weekly loss of 3.38%. A move to $5 would require a little more than a doubling of its current price, while reaching $10 would imply a fivefold increase. A $20 valuation, however, would necessitate a significantly larger expansion, pushing XRP’s market capitalization beyond $1 trillion. Versluis believes that such growth could occur before the end of 2026, though he acknowledges it would depend heavily on broader market momentum and capital inflows. Long-Term Outlook: The Case for $30 Versluis has previously outlined why a $30 XRP price could be plausible over the long term. His argument centers on market structure rather than short-term speculation, noting that XRP would need roughly a twelvefold increase from current levels to reach that price. He linked this possibility to Bitcoin’s long-term expansion. If Bitcoin’s market capitalization were to grow substantially, capital rotation into major altcoins could support higher valuations across the sector, potentially placing XRP near a $2 trillion market cap. However, Versluis stopped short of assigning a timeline, emphasizing that such outcomes depend on evolving market cycles rather than fixed dates.

Consequently, senior Judiciary Committee leaders have declared a proposed liability shield for software developers inappropriate for inclusion in a major market structure bill. This development, reported by CoinDesk, highlights a fundamental tension in regulating the nascent industry. Crypto Developer Protection Clause Faces Bipartisan Opposition Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the ranking member and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee respectively, have taken a firm stance. They argue the provision, which aims to exempt cryptocurrency software developers from criminal liability if their code is misused by third parties, does not belong in financial market structure legislation. Their primary concern centers on the potential weakening of federal laws targeting unlicensed money transmitters. Specifically, they cite platforms like Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixing service sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. This opposition creates a significant procedural hurdle. The provision has become a major point of contention within the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the market structure bill. Indeed, disagreements over this clause are directly cited as a reason for the recent delay in the bill’s deliberation timeline. The debate forces a critical examination of how to foster innovation while preventing illicit finance. The Core Legal Debate: Innovation vs. Enforcement Proponents of the developer protection clause often draw parallels to other technologies. They argue that developers of neutral, general-purpose software tools should not be held criminally liable for actions of end-users, similar to how telecom companies are not liable for illegal phone calls. This perspective emphasizes the open-source nature of much crypto code and the need for clear legal boundaries to encourage U.S.-based development. Opponents, however, see a dangerous loophole. Their analysis focuses on the unique financial capabilities of certain decentralized protocols. The clause, they warn, could inadvertently protect entities that build and launch software explicitly designed to obscure financial transactions, potentially crippling enforcement against money laundering and sanctions evasion. The case of Tornado Cash looms large here; its developers face charges, setting a contentious legal precedent. Expert Analysis on the Legislative Impasse Legal scholars note this debate reflects a broader struggle to apply existing legal frameworks to decentralized technology. “The Senate is grappling with a classic ‘code is law’ dilemma,” explains a former CFTC counsel specializing in digital assets. “They must decide if writing financial software is an act of speech and creation, or an act of operating a financial service. The Judiciary Committee’s intervention signals concern that the Banking Committee’s approach may undermine other critical statutes.” This inter-committee dynamic adds complexity, as the Judiciary Committee oversees criminal law. The timeline is also crucial. This delay comes amid increased global regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency. The European Union has implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, while other jurisdictions are advancing their own rules. Observers suggest the U.S. legislative process risks falling behind, creating uncertainty for businesses. The table below outlines key positions: Position Key Argument Potential Impact Pro-Protection Clause Shields innovators from downstream misuse, fostering U.S. tech leadership. Could limit developer prosecution but may attract regulatory scrutiny. Anti-Protection Clause (Judiciary) Preserves DOJ/FinCEN power to combat illicit finance via software. May chill open-source development; upholds current enforcement. Banking Committee Goal Create clear market rules to protect consumers and define asset status. Bill stalled without compromise on this ancillary issue. Broader Implications for the Crypto Market Structure The market structure bill itself aims to answer foundational questions. It seeks to clarify which digital assets are commodities or securities, assign regulatory roles between the SEC and CFTC, and establish rules for trading platforms. The developer clause, while seemingly niche, touches the heart of a key question: what constitutes a regulated entity in a decentralized ecosystem? Resolving this is essential for the bill’s success. Industry reaction has been mixed. Some advocacy groups express deep disappointment, arguing the clause is essential for legal certainty. Conversely, compliance-focused firms and traditional finance entrants often prioritize strong anti-money laundering (AML) provisions. This internal industry split mirrors the divide in the Senate. The path forward likely requires a narrowly tailored solution that distinguishes between different types of software development and intent. Conclusion The Senate debate over the crypto developer protection clause represents a critical inflection point for U.S. digital asset policy. The opposition from Judiciary Committee leaders Grassley and Durbin underscores the serious law enforcement concerns intertwined with technological innovation. As deliberations continue, the outcome will significantly influence whether the comprehensive market structure bill can advance. Ultimately, this conflict will shape the legal landscape for software developers and define the boundaries of liability in the decentralized financial world for years to come. FAQs Q1: What is the crypto developer protection clause? It is a proposed legislative provision aiming to shield software developers from criminal liability if their decentralized code is misused by others for illegal activities, such as money laundering. Q2: Why are Senators Grassley and Durbin opposed to it? They argue its inclusion in a financial market structure bill could weaken existing federal laws against unlicensed money transmission, hindering enforcement against services like Tornado Cash. Q3: How does this affect the broader crypto market structure bill? The disagreement over this clause is a primary reason for the bill’s recent delay, creating a major obstacle to passing comprehensive digital asset regulation in the U.S. Senate. Q4: What is Tornado Cash, and why is it relevant? Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency “mixer” or privacy tool sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. Its developers face criminal charges, making it a central case study in the debate over developer liability. Q5: What happens next with this legislation? The Senate Banking Committee must either revise the clause to address Judiciary concerns, remove it entirely, or face continued stalemate, potentially pushing final action into the future.

This dramatic escalation follows an earlier investigation announcement and represents one of the most significant regulatory actions against generative AI technology to date. xAI Cease-and-Desist Order Targets Grok’s ‘Spicy’ Mode The California Department of Justice formally demanded that xAI stop all creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Attorney General Bonta emphasized California’s zero-tolerance policy toward such content in his public statement. The agency specifically cited Grok’s ‘spicy’ mode feature as a primary concern, noting its explicit content generation capabilities. Consequently, the AG’s office gave xAI just five days to demonstrate concrete steps addressing these serious issues. This rapid timeline underscores the urgency regulators now attach to AI safety concerns. Furthermore, the investigation revealed disturbing patterns of misuse. The AG’s office claimed xAI appeared to facilitate large-scale production of nonconsensual nudes used to harass women and girls online. This troubling development mirrors broader industry challenges with generative AI tools. Meanwhile, X’s safety account previously condemned such user activity, warning that prompters of illegal content would face consequences. However, regulatory authorities clearly seek more proactive platform responsibility. Global Regulatory Response to AI-Generated Content The controversy extends far beyond California’s borders. Multiple nations have launched their own investigations into Grok’s operations. Japan, Canada, and Britain have all opened formal probes examining the platform’s content generation features. Additionally, Malaysia and Indonesia have taken more drastic measures, temporarily blocking access to the platform entirely. This international coordination signals growing global consensus on AI regulation needs. Simultaneously, United States lawmakers have intensified their scrutiny. On Thursday, Congressional representatives sent letters to executives at several major technology companies including X, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Alphabet, and Meta. These letters specifically inquired about plans to combat sexualized deepfake proliferation. The coordinated timing suggests a deliberate regulatory strategy unfolding across multiple government levels. The Technical and Ethical Challenge of Content Moderation Generative AI platforms face fundamental technical challenges in content moderation. Unlike traditional social media where users upload existing content, AI systems generate entirely new material based on prompts. This creates novel moderation complexities. xAI implemented some restrictions on image-editing features late Wednesday, but regulators deemed these measures insufficient. The core difficulty lies in balancing creative freedom with harm prevention—a challenge affecting the entire AI industry. Industry experts note several critical considerations: Prompt filtering effectiveness: Current systems struggle to interpret nuanced user intent Real-time generation monitoring: AI can produce harmful content faster than human review Cross-platform coordination: Bad actors often use multiple services simultaneously Age verification systems: Preventing minor access remains technically challenging Historical context reveals this isn’t entirely new territory. Previous technologies from photocopiers to Photoshop prompted similar regulatory discussions. However, generative AI’s scale and accessibility represent a qualitative difference. The advent of free, powerful AI tools has indeed led to a disturbing increase in nonconsensual sexual material across multiple platforms. Legal Precedents and Future Implications California’s action establishes important legal precedents for AI regulation. The state has positioned itself as a leader in technology governance through previous legislation like the California Consumer Privacy Act. This cease-and-desist order represents a natural extension of that regulatory philosophy into artificial intelligence. Legal experts anticipate this case could influence pending federal legislation and international standards. The following table outlines key regulatory developments in AI content moderation: Jurisdiction Action Taken Timeline California Cease-and-desist order to xAI June 2025 United Kingdom Online Safety Act implementation Ongoing since 2023 European Union AI Act enforcement Phased from 2024 Japan Grok investigation launched June 2025 Industry response has been notably cautious. When Bitcoin World contacted xAI for comment, they received an automated email response stating ‘Legacy Media Lies.’ This suggests potential tension between the company and media outlets covering the story. Meanwhile, traditional technology companies face parallel pressures as lawmakers demand clearer content moderation strategies. Conclusion The California Attorney General’s cease-and-desist order against xAI represents a watershed moment for artificial intelligence regulation. This action highlights growing governmental impatience with self-regulation approaches to AI safety. As generative AI tools become increasingly powerful and accessible, regulatory frameworks must evolve correspondingly. The xAI case will likely influence how platforms worldwide approach content moderation, user safety, and ethical AI development. Ultimately, this incident underscores the urgent need for balanced approaches that foster innovation while preventing tangible harm. FAQs Q1: What specifically did the California AG order xAI to do? The cease-and-desist order demands xAI immediately stop creating and distributing deepfake nonconsensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material through its Grok chatbot. The company must demonstrate compliance within five days. Q2: Which feature of Grok is causing the most concern? Regulators have focused particularly on Grok’s ‘spicy’ mode, which xAI designed specifically to generate explicit content. This feature appears central to the nonconsensual imagery creation problem. Q3: Are other countries taking similar action? Yes, Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, while Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform entirely. This indicates a coordinated international regulatory response. Q4: How has xAI responded to these allegations? xAI implemented some restrictions on image-editing features recently, but the California AG deemed these insufficient. The company’s automated response to media inquiries has been ‘Legacy Media Lies,’ suggesting a contentious relationship with press coverage. Q5: What broader implications does this case have for AI regulation? This action establishes important precedents for holding AI companies accountable for content generated through their platforms. It will likely influence pending legislation and industry standards worldwide, particularly regarding content moderation responsibilities.

57226959,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=262386,1768607711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Silver Market Cap Skyrockets $3.9 Trillion, Stunningly Outperforming Stocks and Crypto",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/silver-market-cap-surge-outperforms/,"BitcoinWorld Silver Market Cap Skyrockets $3.9 Trillion, Stunningly Outperforming Stocks and Crypto Global financial markets witnessed a historic shift over the past year, as the silver market cap exploded by a staggering $3.9 trillion, decisively outperforming traditional stocks, volatile cryptocurrencies, and even its peer gold. According to data from CryptoBriefing, this monumental rally has propelled silver’s total valuation past the $5 trillion threshold, cementing its position as the world’s second-largest tangible asset class. The price of silver itself reached an unprecedented high near $93 per ounce before stabilizing, marking a period of exceptional performance that has reshaped investment portfolios and analyst forecasts worldwide. Silver Market Cap Achieves Historic Trillion-Dollar Growth The scale of silver’s ascent is unprecedented in modern financial history. Over a concise 12-month period, the asset’s total market valuation swelled by over $3.9 trillion. This growth trajectory far exceeded gains in every other major asset class. Consequently, silver now commands a market capitalization exceeding $5 trillion. This figure places it firmly behind only gold, which maintains an approximate $32 trillion valuation. The sheer velocity of this expansion has captured the attention of institutional investors and central banks alike. Several interconnected factors drove this explosive growth. First, sustained industrial demand from the renewable energy and electronics sectors created a solid demand floor. Second, macroeconomic uncertainty prompted a significant flight to tangible assets. Finally, constrained mining supply and strategic national stockpiling exacerbated the supply-demand imbalance. These elements combined to create a powerful bullish catalyst for the white metal. Comparative Asset Performance Analysis When placed in direct comparison, silver’s performance highlights a dramatic divergence from broader market trends. The following table illustrates the stark contrast in returns across major asset classes during the same 12-month window: Asset Approximate Performance Silver Market Cap +$3.9T / Price to All-Time High Gold ~ +70% S&P 500 Index ~ +17% Nasdaq Composite ~ +21% Bitcoin (BTC) ~ -4% This comparative data reveals a clear narrative. While traditional equity markets posted modest, positive gains, and Bitcoin experienced a slight contraction, precious metals soared. Gold’s strong 70% advance was impressive, yet it was ultimately overshadowed by silver’s parabolic move. This outperformance is partly due to silver’s higher volatility and its dual role as both a monetary and industrial metal. Investors seeking a hedge against inflation and currency debasement flooded into the sector, with silver offering greater potential leverage than gold. Expert Insight on the Structural Shift Market analysts point to a fundamental repricing of risk as the core driver. “The movement into silver represents more than a simple commodity trade,” explains a veteran commodities strategist cited in financial reports. “It is a strategic reallocation reflecting deep concerns over sovereign debt levels, geopolitical fragmentation, and the long-term store-of-value proposition of digital versus physical assets.” This sentiment echoes across trading desks, where silver is increasingly viewed not just as an industrial input but as a critical strategic reserve. The price surge to approximately $93 per ounce, followed by a consolidation around $89, demonstrates robust underlying support and healthy profit-taking activity rather than speculative froth. The Driving Forces Behind the Rally The rally’s foundations are built on verifiable macroeconomic and sector-specific trends. Firstly, global initiatives for green energy infrastructure have massively increased photovoltaic (PV) panel production. Silver is a critical component in solar cells, and demand from this sector has grown exponentially. Secondly, ongoing geopolitical tensions have accelerated central bank purchasing of precious metals for diversification. Nations are actively bolstering their tangible asset reserves. Key industrial demand drivers include: Solar Energy Expansion: Record installations of solar farms worldwide. Electronics Manufacturing: Continued use in conductors, contacts, and solders. Automotive Electrification: Increased use in electric vehicle components and charging infrastructure. Simultaneously, supply has struggled to keep pace. Major mining outputs have faced headwinds from rising operational costs, regulatory challenges, and long lead times for new project development. This persistent deficit between annual mine supply and total demand has systematically drained above-ground inventories, creating a tight physical market that amplifies price moves. Implications for Investors and the Global Economy The recalibration of the global asset hierarchy carries significant implications. For portfolio managers, the dramatic rise of the silver market cap necessitates a review of traditional 60/40 stock-bond allocations. Many are now advocating for a permanent strategic weighting in physical commodities, with precious metals forming its core. Furthermore, silver’s outperformance challenges the dominance of purely digital stores of value, prompting a broader debate about asset resilience in different economic climates. On a macroeconomic level, soaring commodity prices can act as a leading indicator for broader inflationary pressures. Central banks now monitor these markets not just for investment flows but for signals about future consumer price trends. The strength in silver also reflects a potential weakening of confidence in fiat currency systems, driving a renewed interest in asset-backed monetary history. This shift could influence future monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding reserve asset management. Conclusion The data presents a clear and compelling story: the silver market cap has undergone a transformation, surging by $3.9 trillion to surpass $5 trillion and outperform every other major asset class. This was not an isolated event but the result of converging industrial demand, investment safe-haven flows, and constrained supply. While gold remains the larger asset, silver’s explosive growth highlights its unique position at the intersection of industry and finance. As markets continue to evolve, the performance of silver will remain a critical barometer for global economic health, investor sentiment, and the ongoing dialogue between tangible and digital value. This historic rally redefines silver’s role in the modern financial ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly does ‘market cap’ mean for a commodity like silver? The market capitalization for silver is an estimate of the total value of all investable silver above ground. It is calculated by multiplying the current spot price by the total estimated volume of refined silver held in bars, coins, ETFs, and other liquid forms, representing its total financial footprint. Q2: Why did silver outperform gold during this period? Silver typically exhibits higher price volatility than gold. Its smaller market size means investment flows impact its price more dramatically. Additionally, strong industrial demand, particularly from the solar sector, provided a fundamental demand boost that pure monetary metals like gold do not experience to the same degree. Q3: Does this price surge indicate a bubble in the silver market? While the rapid price increase warrants caution, analysts note the move is supported by documented supply deficits and sustained industrial demand. The consolidation from the $93 high to the $89 range is seen as healthy. A bubble is typically characterized by purely speculative buying, whereas current demand appears structurally driven. Q4: How can an average investor gain exposure to silver? Investors can access silver through physical bullion (bars/coins), shares of silver mining companies, publicly traded silver streaming and royalty companies, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold physical silver. Each method carries different risk profiles concerning liquidity, storage, and direct price correlation. Q5: What are the main risks to silver’s price going forward? Key risks include a sharp global economic downturn reducing industrial demand, a significant strengthening of the US dollar, a sudden resolution of geopolitical tensions reducing safe-haven buying, or technological substitution in key applications like photovoltaics. Increased mining output from new projects could also ease the supply deficit over time.

On-chain activity and the real-world tokenization of assets point to a network that is becoming increasingly useful and more deeply embedded in financial infrastructure. The price action movement shows that ETH is stuck in a range where it is struggling to attract sustained momentum. Why Fundamentals And Price Are Diverging Ethereum is stuck in the middle, with the price hovering around $3,300, which is slightly up from earlier this month, but it remains compressed within the same triangle that has been forming since November. An investor known as Pepeisfriend mentioned on X that this kind of price action usually means pressure is building and a move is coming. However, the direction hasn’t been specified. Related Reading: Ethereum Outlook Has Improved, And It Could Outperform Bitcoin – Here’s What To Know As a result of this move, big money doesn’t seem very excited. ETH whales have been slowly reducing their exposure since mid-December, with no panic selling, just lightening positions. This kind of behavior signals a lower willingness from large investors to carry risk at these levels. The ETF flows have shown that there have been a few days of positive inflows, but the overall net flows are still negative, showing institutions haven’t truly rotated back into ETH the way they did during the previous hype phase. Meanwhile, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) activity looks weaker, and total value locked (TVL) has dropped noticeably, suggesting that on-chain capital is either leaving or just sitting on the sidelines. When DeFi isn’t active, ETH struggles to generate sustained upside momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Balance at Support—But the Next Move Matters Investor Pepeisfriend concluded that ETH isn’t bearish, but also not inspiring confidence for a breakout. This is a clear “wait for confirmation” phase that must be held, but probably still too early to go all-in or expect an immediate breakout. The Moment That Will Look Obvious In Hindsight While the market is obsessed with layer-1 competition, Ethereum is transitioning from a speculative asset into a yield-bearing, productive asset. Analyst Senior pointed out that on January 15, 2026, Sharplink Gaming deployed $170 million worth of ETH into a combined staking and restaking strategy on Linea. This move shows that institutional treasuries have moved beyond simple accumulation to active yield generation. At the same time, Visa is piloting stablecoin payouts directly on-chain, and EIP-7702 infrastructure is finally going live to eliminate biometric authentication seed phrases via Face ID. The user experience gap that once held ETH back has officially closed. This is the moment ETH is positioning itself as the most secure and liquid on-chain neobank financial platform in the world, and why the $3,500 breakout attempt will feel obvious.

57227043,658045,1768608020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57227043.jpeg,Ethereum Exchange Outflows Signal Supply Is Stepping Back,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-exchange-outflows-signal-supply-step-back/,"Ethereum is struggling to push above critical supply levels after a brief surge above $3,300, as the market attempts to stabilize following weeks of sustained selling pressure. While the rebound has sparked renewed optimism, price action remains fragile, with bulls still needing clear confirmation before a broader recovery can take hold. Still, the fact that ETH is holding near key levels has led some analysts to start calling for higher prices, arguing that the market may be entering a new phase after the recent downtrend. Supporting this view, a CryptoQuant analyst highlighted Ethereum Exchange Netflow spot data showing persistent ETH outflows from spot exchanges during price pullbacks, while inflows during upward moves remain relatively limited. This pattern suggests a more disciplined supply environment, where holders are reluctant to sell into weakness and are not aggressively distributing during rallies. In other words, sell-side pressure appears to be easing, even as Ethereum remains capped below major resistance. If demand returns, this type of netflow structure can support sharper upside moves, as fewer coins are available on exchanges to meet new buying interest. For now, Ethereum is caught between fading fear and unfinished recovery, with the next breakout attempt likely to define the short-term trend. ETH Supply Tightens As Exchange Outflows Persist Ethereum’s recent Exchange Netflow behavior suggests that the latest pullbacks have been met with holding and accumulation rather than broad-based distribution. Instead of rushing to send ETH onto exchanges during weakness, many participants appear willing to sit through volatility, reducing the immediate sell pressure that typically accelerates downtrends. This supports the idea that supply is gradually stepping back, even as price remains capped below key resistance zones and market sentiment stays cautious. However, Exchange Netflow alone is not enough to define direction. A favorable supply structure can still fail if demand remains weak, or if macro conditions deteriorate and force investors back into risk-off positioning. In that scenario, downside continuation cannot be ruled out, even if exchange balances remain constrained. That said, in the absence of major systemic stress, the current netflow profile offers a constructive backdrop for upside. The lack of supply expansion during drawdowns and the restrained profit-taking during rebounds imply that sellers are not in control. If demand rotates back into Ethereum, price could respond more efficiently because there is less readily available liquidity sitting on exchanges. In this sense, the on-chain data is not signaling an immediate breakout. Instead, it highlights a market structure that appears increasingly prepared for upward price action once broader conditions align and buyers regain conviction. Ethereum Bulls Fight Structural Resistance Ethereum is attempting to stabilize above the $3,300 zone after a sharp rebound from the December lows, but the chart shows bulls are still battling heavy overhead supply. Price recently pushed into the $3,300–$3,400 band, a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot point during this downtrend. While momentum has improved, ETH is still trading below key moving averages, reinforcing the idea that this move may be more of a recovery leg than a confirmed reversal. The blue moving average overhead continues to slope downward and sits above current price, highlighting that the broader structure remains pressured. At the same time, the green moving average is flattening near the $3,300 area, adding to the resistance cluster and making this zone difficult to reclaim cleanly. From a market structure perspective, ETH has shifted from a clear downtrend into a tighter consolidation, with buyers stepping in on dips and building higher lows since early January. However, volume remains relatively muted compared to the October and November selloffs, suggesting that conviction is still developing.

While the asset has managed to stay above the psychologically important $2 level, technical analysis suggests that a deeper correction could still unfold under unfavorable conditions. According to recent market assessments, XRP has already declined significantly from its prior cycle peak. Despite this pullback, analysts emphasize that the current phase does not necessarily indicate a breakdown of the long-term bullish trend. Instead, the focus has shifted to understanding how severe a downside move could become if bearish pressure intensifies. Analyst Outlines Worst-Case Price Range Crypto market analyst EGRAG Crypto addressed this scenario in a recent commentary where he deliberately approached XRP’s outlook from a defensive perspective. His analysis was designed to examine potential downside risk rather than predict an imminent reversal of the broader trend. #XRP – The Nightmare Scenario vs. Conviction : Today I’m wearing the #Bears hat briefly Not because I’m #Bearish , but to assess the worst-case scenario objectively. Long term, nothing is bearish in #XRP ’s fundamentals or structure. Only HATERS stays negative, not… pic.twitter.com/4Nd0pGIFqY — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 15, 2026 While maintaining confidence in XRP’s long-term fundamentals, he acknowledged that short-term volatility could still drive prices lower. Under this framework, EGRAG identified a possible decline of between 31% and 47% from current levels as the most severe outcome within the existing market cycle. Should such a move materialize, XRP could temporarily trade within a price band ranging from approximately $1.20 to $1.40. He described this range as a stress scenario rather than a base expectation, stressing that it would represent an extreme test of market confidence rather than a structural failure. Recent Performance and Market Positioning XRP’s current position reflects mixed momentum. After reaching a cycle high of $3.66 in July 2025, the asset has since retraced by roughly 43.7%. The latter part of 2025 proved particularly challenging, with XRP closing the year down 11.54% following a weak fourth quarter. Although a modest recovery of about 12.54% has occurred in early 2026, the price remains well below its previous peak. This uneven performance highlights XRP’s vulnerability to broader market sentiment, even as long-term adoption narratives continue to support optimistic projections. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Drawdowns Provide Context EGRAG’s downside estimates draw heavily from XRP’s historical behavior during previous market cycles. In earlier periods, XRP experienced corrections of similar magnitude before resuming upward movement. For example, following the 2018 market peak, XRP declined by roughly 31% before eventually rebounding in the subsequent bull phase. A later cycle saw an even steeper drop of about 47%, coinciding with widespread market stress during 2022. These historical precedents form the basis of the analyst’s view that a comparable retracement, while uncomfortable, would not be unprecedented. He noted that such outcomes would only be relevant if XRP’s current structure closely mirrors those earlier cycles, a theory that some market observers have already suggested. Outlook Remains Constructive Despite Risks Despite acknowledging the possibility of further declines, EGRAG reaffirmed his belief that XRP remains within a broader bullish cycle. He argued that macro-level indicators still support higher valuations over time, potentially reaching double-digit price levels once the current phase of consolidation resolves. He also clarified that any decision to increase exposure during a downturn reflects his personal investment strategy and should not be interpreted as financial guidance. Investors, he cautioned, should base their decisions on independent analysis and risk tolerance rather than analyst conviction alone. While near-term uncertainty persists, the prevailing view among bullish analysts is that XRP’s longer-term trajectory remains positive, even if the path forward includes additional volatility.

The platform has around 320 million active users and an average of 143 million active users on mobile as of January 2026, according to Forbes, citing Similarweb data. In December 2025, more than 30 million new users signed up for Threads. The platform keeps growing quickly as Elon Musk’s X has trouble holding onto its position with several policy changes and Elon Musk’s controversial streak since he shelled out $44 billion to buy the platform. The report also claims that Brands are moving toward Threads’ more advertiser-friendly environment as X faces user and ad revenue declines amid leadership and moderation concerns. Zuckerberg’s Threads is riding the hot hand On January 3, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Threads now has 320 million active users, surpassing X. He emphasized that the platform’s growth was purely organic with no aggressive marketing campaigns. Also, the integration with Instagram makes it easy to onboard existing Instagram users. Following the acquisition by Elon Musk, X has been losing daily active users . Estimates suggest that X has seen a decline of about 11.9% year-over-year as daily active users in January, while Threads has increased its active user count by about 38%. One of the major reasons for the growth of Threads is that it provides a more advertiser-friendly platform compared to X. Meta also continues to refine Threads’ features by addressing user feedback and directly competing with X’s functionality. Analysts project that Threads could generate about $11.3 billion in revenue. Brands are moving away from X due to the growing discomfort around Musk’s leadership, along with concerns around content moderation. About 68% of X’s revenue is generated from ads and in 2024, it generated $2.5 billion in revenue from ads, which represents a 13.7% decline year-over-year. X isn’t the only platform in decline. Bluesky, which came out as a direct competitor to X has been shedding users. Bluesky grew from a user base of about 10 million to about 40 million in late 2025. However, Bluesky’s daily active users are down to about 3.6 million, representing a 44.4% year-over-year decline. Zuckerberg and Musk’s competition plays out on the social media landscape Zuckerberg and Musk have a rivalry that has played out publicly at times. It even escalated to the point of a cage match in 2023. However, their real rivalry has been in the tech domain, where they often find themselves sponsoring competing causes. Threads’ growth challenges X’s historical dominance in real-time conversation and news distribution. Both the US and international user counts have been declining since 2024, even though there are spikes in usage during major news events. However, for all its problems, X still has more daily active users on mobile in the United States, with 21.2 million compared to Threads’ 19.5 million. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This pivotal reading, reported by data analytics firm Alternative, indicates a market sentiment squarely in neutral territory, a condition often associated with periods of consolidation and deliberation among investors. The index’s movement provides a crucial snapshot of collective psychology, a key driver of price action in the volatile digital asset space. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Methodology The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a daily barometer for market emotion. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” A score of 50, therefore, marks the exact midpoint, suggesting a balanced and arguably rational market environment. The calculation is not arbitrary; it synthesizes data from six distinct market dimensions to form a composite view. Specifically, the index weights its components as follows: Volatility (25%): Measures current price swings against historical averages. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading volume and momentum. Sustained high volume can indicate greed-driven buying or fear-driven selling. Social Media (15%): Tracks sentiment and buzz across platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from periodic polls of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can signal a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Gauges retail interest through search volume for key terms like “Bitcoin” or “crypto crash.” This multi-factor approach aims to mitigate the bias of any single metric, providing a more robust gauge of the market’s emotional temperature. The Significance of a Neutral Reading in 2025 A score of 50 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index carries substantial weight for analysts and traders. Historically, prolonged periods in the “Neutral” zone (typically 45-55) have often preceded significant directional moves. For instance, the index hovered near neutrality in late 2020 before the massive bull run of early 2021, and again in mid-2023 before a sustained rally. This neutrality suggests a market at a crossroads, where bullish and bearish forces are in relative balance. Market veterans interpret this equilibrium in several ways. Some view it as a cooling-off period after emotional extremes, allowing fundamentals to reassert their influence. Others see it as a consolidation phase where assets build a base for their next major trend. Crucially, a neutral reading often indicates reduced panic selling and diminished FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying, potentially leading to healthier, more technically-driven price action. Expert Analysis on Current Market Dynamics Financial analysts point to several concurrent factors supporting this neutral sentiment. Firstly, Bitcoin’s price has demonstrated relative stability around key psychological levels, reducing volatility. Secondly, trading volume, while healthy, lacks the frenetic pace associated with market tops or bottoms. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in major economies like the EU and partial frameworks in the US have provided a more predictable, if cautious, environment. “A neutral Fear & Greed Index is arguably one of the most interesting signals,” notes a veteran market strategist from a leading blockchain analytics firm. “It tells us the market is digesting information rationally. Investors are neither capitulating in fear nor chasing prices in euphoria. This is often when savvy accumulation or distribution occurs quietly.” This perspective underscores that major institutional moves frequently happen when retail sentiment is calm, not when it is at an extreme. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis To appreciate the current reading, one must examine historical extremes. The index plunged to single digits—indicating “Extreme Fear”—during major sell-offs like the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 and the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in May 2022. Conversely, it soared above 90—into “Extreme Greed”—during the peak of the 2021 bull market and the NFT frenzy. The journey from these extremes back to neutrality often marks a transition in market cycles. The table below illustrates recent key readings and their market context: Index Score Sentiment Approximate Period Market Context 10 Extreme Fear May 2022 Terra-Luna collapse, Celsius issues 85 Extreme Greed November 2021 Bitcoin ATH near $69,000 25 Fear December 2022 FTX bankruptcy aftermath 50 Neutral Current (2025) Post-ETF adoption, regulatory digestion This historical comparison reveals that the market has navigated through profound fear and greed to reach its current balanced state, suggesting a maturation in investor behavior and market structure. Practical Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For individual and institutional investors, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading serves as a strategic tool, not a direct trading signal. It primarily advises on market psychology. In “Extreme Fear” zones, contrarian investors might see a potential buying opportunity, albeit with high risk. In “Extreme Greed” zones, it can act as a caution flag for overexposure. At 50, the index suggests a market where neither contrarian extreme is present. Consequently, investment decisions in a neutral sentiment environment should rely more heavily on other analyses. These include fundamental research on blockchain adoption, technical analysis of price charts, and macro-economic factors like interest rates and inflation. The neutral sentiment effectively removes extreme emotion as a primary market driver, allowing other factors to take precedence. This period is often ideal for portfolio rebalancing, disciplined dollar-cost averaging, and thorough research without the noise of market mania or panic. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 50 represents a significant moment of equilibrium for digital asset markets. This neutral reading reflects a collective pause, where neither overwhelming fear nor unchecked greed dominates investor psychology. By synthesizing data from volatility, volume, social media, and search trends, the index provides a validated, multi-dimensional view of market sentiment. For observers and participants, understanding this tool’s methodology and historical context is essential. While the index does not predict the future, a score of 50 highlights a market in balance—a condition that often sets the stage for the next major phase based on fundamentals and macro developments, rather than emotion alone. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 50 mean? A score of 50 indicates the market is in “Neutral” sentiment. It sits exactly midway between “Extreme Fear” (0) and “Extreme Greed” (100), suggesting a balanced emotional state among investors with no overwhelming bias toward panic or euphoria. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is compiled and published daily by the data provider Alternative. They use an automated system to gather and weight data from its six core components, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment. Q3: Is a neutral Fear & Greed Index a good time to buy cryptocurrency? The index measures sentiment, not value. A neutral reading suggests the market is not driven by extreme emotion, which can be a healthier environment for making rational decisions. However, it is not a standalone buy or sell signal. Investment decisions should combine this data with fundamental and technical analysis. Q4: How accurate has the Fear & Greed Index been at predicting market turns? The index is a descriptive tool, not a predictive one. It reflects current sentiment. Historically, prolonged periods at extreme readings (below 20 or above 80) have often preceded market reversals, as they indicate unsustainable emotional states. Neutral readings often indicate consolidation. Q5: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market dominance is a 10% component, the other metrics—like volatility, volume, and social media—encompass the broader cryptocurrency market. Therefore, it is widely regarded as a sentiment indicator for the crypto asset class as a whole, with Bitcoin as its most significant single influence.

This pivotal policy shift represents one of the most significant integrations of digital assets into traditional American finance to date, potentially opening homeownership doors for millions of crypto investors who have previously faced barriers when applying for conventional mortgages. Crypto Mortgage Policy Details and Implementation Newrez’s new crypto mortgage program specifically recognizes several categories of digital assets during the underwriting process. According to official documentation reviewed by financial analysts, the company will accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. This comprehensive approach covers both direct cryptocurrency ownership and regulated investment vehicles that track crypto prices. However, the implementation includes crucial safeguards and requirements. Applicants must hold their digital assets at regulated U.S. exchanges or financial institutions, ensuring proper custody and verification protocols. Furthermore, Newrez applies specific volatility adjustments during asset evaluation, recognizing the price fluctuations inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Despite accepting crypto for qualification, all loan repayments and associated fees must still be made in U.S. dollars, maintaining traditional currency requirements for the actual mortgage servicing. Technical Framework and Risk Assessment Financial technology experts note that Newrez’s approach incorporates sophisticated risk assessment models. The company reportedly uses a combination of historical volatility data, stress testing scenarios, and conservative valuation methods when evaluating cryptocurrency holdings. For instance, the lender might apply a significant discount to the current market value of crypto assets or use a multi-month average price rather than spot prices to account for market fluctuations. This technical framework represents a substantial advancement from earlier, more tentative approaches to crypto-backed lending. Previously, most financial institutions either completely rejected cryptocurrency holdings or required their conversion to traditional currency before consideration. Newrez’s methodology acknowledges crypto as a legitimate asset class while implementing appropriate risk management protocols. Demographic Drivers and Market Context Newrez explicitly cited demographic trends as a primary motivation for this policy innovation. Company representatives noted that approximately 45% of Generation Z and Millennial investors own cryptocurrency, according to recent surveys from financial research firms. This substantial ownership rate among younger Americans creates both a market opportunity and a potential solution to declining homeownership rates in these age groups. The timing coincides with broader financial industry developments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, creating regulated investment vehicles that have attracted billions in institutional and retail investment. These ETFs provide a bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets, making digital assets more accessible to conventional financial institutions. Additionally, cryptocurrency adoption has reached significant milestones. Recent data from the Federal Reserve indicates that approximately 15% of American adults now own some form of cryptocurrency, with ownership rates highest among younger, college-educated demographics. This growing adoption has created pressure on traditional financial institutions to accommodate digital assets in their service offerings. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Mortgage Requirements To understand the significance of Newrez’s policy, consider traditional mortgage qualification requirements: Asset Type Traditional Mortgage Treatment Newrez Crypto Mortgage Treatment Cash/Savings Full value considered Full value considered Stocks/ETFs Market value with moderate adjustments Market value with moderate adjustments Retirement Accounts Partial value considered Partial value considered Cryptocurrency (Pre-2025) Generally excluded or must be sold Adjusted value considered without selling This comparison highlights how Newrez’s policy creates parity between cryptocurrency and other investment assets in the mortgage qualification process. The approach recognizes that for many younger applicants, cryptocurrency represents a substantial portion of their investment portfolio and net worth. Industry Precedents and Regulatory Landscape While Newrez represents the largest traditional mortgage lender to adopt such a comprehensive crypto policy, several precedents exist in the financial industry. Some smaller lenders and specialized fintech companies have offered crypto-backed loans in various forms since the early 2020s. However, these typically involved using cryptocurrency as collateral for cash loans rather than integrating digital assets into conventional mortgage underwriting. The regulatory environment has evolved significantly in recent years. Key developments include: 2023 Banking Guidance: Federal banking regulators issued clarified guidance on cryptocurrency custody and valuation for financial institutions 2024 ETF Approvals: SEC approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs created regulated investment vehicles State-Level Initiatives: Several states have passed legislation recognizing digital assets in various financial contexts Tax Clarifications: IRS guidance on cryptocurrency taxation provided clearer frameworks for asset valuation These regulatory developments have reduced uncertainty for traditional financial institutions considering cryptocurrency integration. Newrez’s policy appears designed to operate within existing regulatory frameworks while pushing boundaries in product innovation. Potential Impacts on Homeownership Rates Housing economists have begun analyzing the potential effects of crypto-inclusive mortgage policies on broader homeownership trends. Early models suggest that such policies could modestly increase qualification rates among younger applicants, particularly in the 25-40 age range where cryptocurrency ownership is highest relative to traditional assets. However, experts caution that cryptocurrency volatility remains a significant consideration. The substantial price fluctuations characteristic of digital assets could create qualification volatility for applicants whose net worth is heavily concentrated in cryptocurrency. Newrez’s adjusted valuation approach attempts to mitigate this risk, but the long-term stability of such models remains untested through full market cycles. Technical Implementation and Operational Challenges Implementing cryptocurrency valuation in mortgage underwriting presents several technical challenges that Newrez has addressed through its policy framework. Key implementation aspects include: Verification Protocols: The requirement for assets held at regulated U.S. institutions enables proper verification and anti-money laundering compliance Valuation Methodology: Using adjusted values rather than spot prices accounts for market volatility Documentation Standards: Creating standardized documentation requirements for cryptocurrency holdings Staff Training: Educating loan officers and underwriters on cryptocurrency fundamentals and valuation These implementation details demonstrate that Newrez has developed a comprehensive operational framework rather than simply announcing a policy change. The company reportedly began developing this capability in 2023, working with cryptocurrency exchanges, regulatory experts, and financial technology partners to create a robust system. Broader Implications for Financial Inclusion Beyond immediate homeownership impacts, Newrez’s policy has implications for financial inclusion and asset recognition. For years, cryptocurrency advocates have argued that digital assets represent a form of wealth creation outside traditional financial systems, particularly for younger generations and underserved communities. By recognizing cryptocurrency in mortgage underwriting, Newrez validates this perspective within mainstream finance. This recognition could have cascading effects across other financial products and services. If cryptocurrency proves viable in mortgage underwriting, other credit products might follow suit, potentially including auto loans, personal loans, and business financing. Such developments would further integrate digital assets into the broader financial ecosystem. Risk Considerations and Consumer Protection While innovative, Newrez’s crypto mortgage policy includes several risk considerations that potential applicants should understand. The volatility adjustments applied to cryptocurrency valuations mean that applicants cannot necessarily qualify based on peak prices during market rallies. Additionally, the requirement to hold assets at regulated institutions excludes decentralized wallets and some international platforms. Consumer protection advocates have raised questions about how well applicants understand these nuances. There are concerns that some crypto investors might overestimate their qualification potential or misunderstand the valuation adjustments. Newrez has addressed these concerns through enhanced disclosure requirements and applicant education materials that clearly explain the valuation methodology. Furthermore, the policy creates potential complications during market downturns. If cryptocurrency values decline significantly during the loan application process or shortly after approval, applicants might face qualification challenges or need to provide additional assets. These scenarios require careful management through the underwriting and closing processes. Conclusion Newrez’s decision to accept cryptocurrency for mortgage applications represents a significant milestone in the integration of digital assets into traditional finance. This crypto mortgage policy acknowledges the substantial cryptocurrency holdings among younger generations while implementing appropriate safeguards for volatility and verification. The approach could expand homeownership access for crypto investors who have previously faced barriers in traditional mortgage markets. As financial institutions continue adapting to digital asset adoption, Newrez’s initiative may establish precedents for how cryptocurrency integrates with conventional lending practices, potentially influencing broader industry standards for crypto mortgage programs in the coming years. FAQs Q1: What specific cryptocurrencies does Newrez accept for mortgage qualification? Newrez accepts Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, and spot cryptocurrency ETFs that trade on regulated exchanges. The policy does not currently extend to other cryptocurrencies or tokens. Q2: How does Newrez account for cryptocurrency price volatility in mortgage underwriting? The company applies volatility adjustments during asset evaluation, potentially using discounted values, multi-month averages, or stress-tested valuations rather than current spot prices. This conservative approach helps mitigate risk from price fluctuations. Q3: Can I make mortgage payments using cryptocurrency instead of U.S. dollars? No, all loan repayments and associated fees must be paid in U.S. dollars. The policy only allows cryptocurrency holdings to be considered as qualifying assets during the application process, not as payment currency. Q4: Where must I hold my cryptocurrency for it to qualify with Newrez? Cryptocurrency must be held at regulated U.S. exchanges or financial institutions. This requirement ensures proper custody, verification, and compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Q5: How might this policy affect homeownership rates among younger generations? By recognizing cryptocurrency as qualifying assets, the policy could help younger applicants who have substantial crypto holdings but limited traditional assets qualify for mortgages. However, the actual impact depends on adoption rates, cryptocurrency values, and how many lenders follow similar approaches.

This stunning financial milestone, confirmed by founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh in an exclusive interview, traces its origins not to Silicon Valley boardrooms, but to a simple Reddit post and a basement cryptocurrency mining hobby. The company’s journey from a side project to a major player in the competitive AI infrastructure space offers a compelling blueprint for bootstrapped success. Runpod’s Unconventional Path from Basement to Boardroom The genesis of Runpod is a story of adaptation and developer frustration. In late 2021, corporate developers Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh faced a common domestic dilemma. They had invested approximately $50,000 in specialized GPU rigs for Ethereum mining in their New Jersey basements. However, the venture proved financially lackluster and, critically, was facing obsolescence due to the impending Ethereum “Merge” upgrade. More importantly, the founders found the process simply boring after a few months. Simultaneously, their professional work exposed them to the burgeoning field of machine learning, revealing a significant problem: the software stack for managing GPUs was, in Lu’s words, “hot garbage.” This intersection of personal necessity and professional insight became their catalyst. Consequently, they made a pivotal decision to repurpose their mining hardware into AI servers. This move preceded the public explosion of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E 2. As they converted their rigs, they intimately experienced the pain points developers faced when working with GPU infrastructure. They identified a clear market gap for a platform that prioritized developer experience, speed, and easy configuration. Therefore, Runpod was born not from a grand venture capital pitch, but from a practical need to solve a tangible problem they themselves encountered. The Reddit Launch That Sparked Traction By early 2022, Lu and Singh had a basic platform ready. It focused on hosting AI applications with an emphasis on developer tools like APIs and command-line interfaces. However, as first-time founders with no marketing experience or network, they faced the classic chicken-and-egg problem of attracting users. Their solution was ingeniously simple and low-cost. Lu recalled, “I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.” They posted in AI-focused subreddits, offering free access to their servers in exchange for feedback. This direct, community-driven approach worked brilliantly. It provided immediate, authentic user testing and gradually converted those beta testers into paying customers. Astonishingly, within nine months, this Reddit-driven growth enabled them to quit their corporate jobs at Comcast after reaching $1 million in revenue. Navigating Growth and the Shift to Enterprise Initial success brought a new, unexpected challenge. Within six months, business users began requesting to run production workloads on the platform. As Lu recounted, these users explicitly stated they could not rely on servers located in personal basements. This feedback forced a strategic evolution. Initially averse to venture capital, the founders pursued creative, bootstrapped solutions. They formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to rapidly scale capacity without taking on debt or diluting equity. This period was intensely stressful, requiring them to constantly forecast demand and secure hardware in a market where GPU shortages were becoming common. Singh emphasized the pressure, noting that if capacity lagged, user sentiment would shift and customers would migrate to competitors. Meanwhile, their organic community on Reddit and Discord continued to swell, especially following the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT, which ignited global demand for AI compute. This visibility serendipitously caught the eye of venture capitalists scouting for investments. Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, discovered Runpod through Reddit and initiated contact. This first VC interaction was educational for Lu, who admits he didn’t know how to pitch. Malik provided crucial guidance on the venture capital mindset, setting the stage for a future relationship while the company continued its disciplined, revenue-focused growth for nearly two more years without external funding. Strategic Funding and Market Positioning The company’s fortunes accelerated dramatically by May 2024. The AI application boom was in full swing, and Runpod’s early bet on developer-centric AI hosting was yielding massive returns. The platform had grown to serve 100,000 developers. This traction enabled them to secure a $20 million seed round, a significant event co-led by the venture arms of industry giants Dell and Intel. The round also included participation from notable angel investors like Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond—who had discovered the product as a user and reached out via support chat—and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. This funding validated their bootstrap-to-scale model and provided capital for aggressive expansion. Today, Runpod serves an impressive 500,000 developers. Its customer base ranges from individual hobbyists to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multi-million-dollar annual contracts. The platform’s cloud infrastructure now spans 31 global regions and boasts high-profile clients including Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow. The founders are now planning a Series A funding round, entering negotiations from a position of remarkable strength with a proven, high-growth business model. The Competitive Landscape and Runpod’s Developer-Centric Vision Runpod operates in an intensely competitive arena. Developers can choose from hyperscale clouds like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as specialized GPU providers like CoreWeave and Core Scientific. This landscape requires clear differentiation. Runpod’s founders position their platform not merely as infrastructure, but as a foundational tool for the next generation of software development. They argue that while the nature of coding will evolve, it will not disappear. Instead, programmers will increasingly become creators and operators of AI agents. Runpod’s key differentiators include: Developer-First Design: Built by developers for developers, focusing on API simplicity and integration. Serverless GPU Option: Automates configuration to reduce devops overhead. Bootstrapped Discipline: A focus on profitability and avoiding unsustainable free tiers. Community Roots: Maintains a strong connection to its open, community-driven origins. “Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu stated, outlining a vision where Runpod becomes the default platform for building and deploying AI-powered applications. This long-term, product-centric view, forged in the constraints of a New Jersey basement, continues to guide their strategy against well-funded incumbents. Conclusion The Runpod narrative is a powerful case study in modern startup development. It underscores that profound success can originate from solving genuine, personal pain points and engaging directly with a community. The company’s achievement of a $120 million annual revenue run rate, starting from a Reddit post and repurposed mining rigs, challenges conventional startup wisdom. It highlights the value of bootstrapping, product-led growth, and strategic patience. As the AI infrastructure war intensifies, Runpod’s unique origin story and steadfast developer focus position it as a formidable and authentic contender in shaping the future of how AI applications are built and scaled globally. FAQs Q1: What is Runpod’s core business? Runpod is a cloud platform specifically designed for hosting and scaling AI applications. It provides developers with easy access to GPU-powered servers, developer tools, and a serverless option to build and run AI models. Q2: How did Runpod initially attract its first users? The founders, lacking a marketing budget, posted offers on AI-related subreddits in early 2022. They provided free access to their GPU servers in exchange for user feedback, which successfully built an initial community of beta testers who later became paying customers. Q3: Why did Runpod’s founders switch from crypto mining to AI? Their Ethereum mining hobby was becoming unprofitable ahead of “The Merge” network upgrade and was personally unfulfilling. Their professional experience in machine learning revealed a major gap in developer-friendly GPU management software, prompting them to repurpose their hardware. Q4: Who are Runpod’s main competitors? Runpod competes with major public clouds (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) and specialized GPU cloud providers like CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, and Crusoe Cloud. It differentiates through a strong focus on developer experience and tools. Q5: What is Runpod’s current scale and customer base? As of 2025, Runpod serves approximately 500,000 developers. Its infrastructure spans 31 global regions, and its customers range from individual developers to large enterprises like OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow.

This crucial metric, a barometer for alternative cryptocurrency performance, now sits at its highest level in recent weeks, prompting traders and analysts to scrutinize underlying blockchain activity and capital flow patterns with renewed intensity. The movement, though incremental, occurs within a complex macroeconomic landscape characterized by evolving regulatory frameworks and institutional adoption trends, making its implications far-reaching for portfolio strategies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Rise to 27 CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a primary gauge for market sentiment cycles. Fundamentally, the index algorithmically measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have outperformed Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. The calculation deliberately excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus purely on speculative and utility-driven assets. Consequently, a score approaching 100 strongly suggests a broad-based ‘altcoin season,’ where capital rotates from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets seeking higher returns. Conversely, a low score indicates a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where the pioneer cryptocurrency dominates market momentum and risk appetite. The recent ascent to 27, therefore, represents a measurable shift. While still far from the threshold indicating a full altcoin season, the upward trajectory suggests a growing number of altcoins are beginning to outpace Bitcoin’s price action over the medium-term horizon. This movement often correlates with increased on-chain activity for networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, as developers and users engage with decentralized applications. Market data from the past week shows notable volume increases for several major altcoins, potentially foreshadowing the index’s climb. Index Value Market Interpretation Typical Investor Action 0-25 Strong Bitcoin Dominance Capital preservation, focus on BTC 26-50 Early Rotation Signs Research and selective altcoin accumulation 51-75 Developing Altcoin Momentum Diversification into high-conviction alts 76-100 Full Altcoin Season Heightened risk-taking, profit-taking from BTC Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Understanding the current index position of 27 requires examining historical precedents. Previous crypto market cycles have demonstrated that transitions between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance are rarely abrupt. Instead, they typically unfold through phases of accumulation, recognition, and mania. For instance, in the lead-up to the 2021 altcoin season, the index hovered in the 20-40 range for several weeks before a decisive breakout. Analysts often monitor supporting indicators like Bitcoin’s dominance chart, which measures BTC’s share of the total crypto market cap, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. Currently, Bitcoin dominance has shown slight weakness, retreating from recent highs. This minor pullback often provides the necessary liquidity and psychological space for altcoins to rally. Furthermore, the broader financial environment plays a critical role. Rising or falling interest rates, inflation data, and traditional equity market performance directly influence risk asset appetite, including cryptocurrencies. The present increase to 27 may reflect a market cautiously testing the waters for altcoin exposure after a period of consolidation, rather than committing to a full-scale rotation. Expert Insights on Metric Interpretation Seasoned market analysts emphasize that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator, confirming trends already in motion rather than predicting them. ‘A move to 27 is noteworthy, but it’s the sustained direction and velocity that matter,’ notes a report from a major blockchain analytics firm. ‘Investors should cross-reference this with on-chain data, such as exchange net flows and network growth for specific altcoins, to validate the trend.’ The firm’s data indicates that smart money wallets have begun making small, incremental purchases of select altcoins over the past month, a pattern that sometimes precedes larger market moves. Additionally, the structure of the index itself warrants consideration. By focusing on the top 100 assets, it captures established projects with significant communities and development activity. This means a rising index often reflects strength in large-cap altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Polkadot (DOT) first, before potentially trickling down to mid and small-cap tokens. Therefore, the current reading suggests these major alternative networks are starting to demonstrate relative strength, which could build a foundation for a broader rally if sustained. Potential Impacts and Strategic Considerations The rise of the index to 27 carries several immediate and longer-term implications for different market participants. For retail investors, it acts as a signal to review and potentially rebalance portfolios. For institutional entities, it may influence the weighting of crypto assets within a diversified fund. Moreover, project developers often see increased engagement and funding interest when altcoins enter a period of outperformance. Key areas to watch include: Layer-1 Blockchain Activity: Transaction counts and fees on networks like Solana and Avalanche. DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL): An increase often accompanies altcoin strength. Funding Rates: Positive funding rates in perpetual swap markets can indicate bullish sentiment. Regulatory Developments: Clear guidelines can remove uncertainty and boost altcoin investment. Strategically, a prudent approach involves monitoring whether the index can hold above 25 and challenge the 30-35 zone in the coming weeks. A failure to do so might see it revert, reaffirming Bitcoin’s short-term dominance. However, a successful breach could accelerate momentum, drawing more capital into the altcoin space. This dynamic creates a critical observation period for traders, where confirmation from other metrics is essential before making significant allocation changes. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s climb to 27 marks a perceptible, though early, shift in cryptocurrency market dynamics. This movement away from extreme Bitcoin dominance suggests a budding investor appetite for the differentiated risk-return profiles offered by alternative digital assets. While the index remains firmly outside ‘season’ territory, its upward trajectory provides a crucial data point for navigating the complex 2025 market landscape. Ultimately, sustained movement will depend on a confluence of technological innovation, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory clarity. Observers and participants should now watch closely for follow-through in both the index and complementary on-chain datasets to gauge the durability of this emerging trend. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 27 mean? An index value of 27 indicates that a modest, but growing, number of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) are outperforming Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. It suggests early signs of market rotation but does not confirm a full altcoin season has begun. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates the index by tracking the percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (by market cap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have yielded a higher return than Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. The score reflects that percentage. Q3: What is the difference between a Bitcoin season and an altcoin season? A Bitcoin season is characterized by Bitcoin significantly outperforming most other cryptocurrencies, often during periods of market uncertainty or mainstream adoption focus. An altcoin season occurs when the majority of altcoins outperform Bitcoin, typically during phases of high risk appetite and niche narrative speculation. Q4: Should I immediately buy altcoins when this index rises? Not necessarily. The index is a lagging indicator. Prudent investors use it as one tool among many, combining it with fundamental research, technical analysis, and on-chain data before making investment decisions. A rising index suggests a good time for research and due diligence. Q5: Has the Altcoin Season Index been a reliable indicator in the past? Historically, the index has been effective at identifying confirmed trends and market cycle phases. However, like all market indicators, it is not infallible and should not be used in isolation. It works best when confirming trends suggested by other data sources like trading volume, developer activity, and macroeconomic factors.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2029 expects the token to reach a peak price of $12.20. By 2032, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $19.21. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2026? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.13 Market Cap $2.26B Trading Volume $256.16M Circulating Supply 547.24M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.23 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-h High $4.65 24-h Low $4.09 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 9.67% (High) 14-Day RSI 67.91 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $3.37 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $4.44 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is consolidating after a strong breakout, not reversing. Daily momentum is still bullish, but upside is capped for now. Short-term weakness appears if $4.05 fails. ICP 1-day price analysis On the 1-day timeframe for January 17, ICP is trading around $4.14 after a sharp impulse from the $3.10–$3.20 base, with price now stalling just below the upper Bollinger Band near $4.36. The strong bullish candle that pushed the price vertically has been followed by smaller-bodied candles, signaling momentum exhaustion rather than outright reversal. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI has cooled from near-70 to the mid-60s, which reflects healthy consolidation rather than weakness, while MACD remains positive with expanding histogram bars, suggesting bullish momentum is still present but slowing. As long as ICP holds above the $3.85–$3.90 region and the mid-band around $3.38, the daily structure remains bullish, with $4.35–$4.60 acting as the next upside test. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4H chart, price is compressing between the Alligator averages, hovering near $4.13–$4.17, which highlights indecision after repeated rejections from the $4.45–$4.60 zone. OBV has flattened and CMF has slipped slightly negative, pointing to fading demand and mild distribution during this range. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The inability to reclaim and hold above the green Alligator line near $4.22 keeps short-term pressure tilted sideways-to-bearish, with a loss of $4.05 likely opening a retrace toward $3.80–$3.90, where prior demand and dynamic support converge. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $3.94 BUY SMA 5 $3.59 BUY SMA 10 $3.35 BUY SMA 21 $3.20 BUY SMA 50 $3.37 BUY SMA 100 $3.86 BUY SMA 200 $4.44 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 3.38 BUY EMA 5 $ 3.31 BUY EMA 10 $ 3.21 BUY EMA 21 $ 3.19 BUY EMA 50 $ 3.48 BUY EMA 100 $ 3.87 BUY EMA 200 $ 4.47 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is likely to remain range-bound in the short term, but as long as $3.85 holds, the broader bias favors continuation toward $4.60 rather than a full breakdown. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 after 2032. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Though the current internet computer sentiment is sideways, future price movements and market cap are expected to be positive. Will ICP reach $1000?

The company has claimed the money will help them grow and expand their services before share offerings begin publicly. Based in New York, the company provides custody and security services for digital assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Its subsidiary, Anchorage Digital Bank, made history as the first federally chartered digital-asset bank in the United States, giving it official regulatory recognition. Sources have said the company’s valuation has yet to be finalized. A spokesperson for Anchorage Digital declined to comment on fundraising efforts or IPO plans, citing their private nature. Anchorage to launch its own stablecoins Anchorage Digital Bank NA’s federal license allows it to issue stablecoins in the US under the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law in July. In September, the firm announced plans to partner with El Salvador-based Tether Holdings SA, the world’s biggest stablecoin issuer, to launch the USAT token for the US. Thus, stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar and are backed by real money or other assets held by the bank. As a result, stablecoins have gained popularity as consumers and businesses can use digital currency without the worries of sudden price changes. Anchorage announced a major partnership with Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin company, in September. The partnership has culminated in a new stablecoin, USAT Stablecoin for the U.S. Market. Nathan McCauley, the company’s chief executive, said Anchorage aims to expand its stablecoin team substantially over the next year. As digital dollars gain momentum and new regulations open up opportunities to develop innovative banking services. Anchorage’s stablecoins are secure, reliable, and in compliance with all existing laws and regulations, and the company plans to hire experts in technology, finance, and compliance to conduct that work. Anchorage’s foray into stablecoins is also part of a larger trend in the cryptocurrency world. In this context, real cryptocurrencies offer both the comfort and stability traditional currencies do — thus, financial institutions and investors are progressively looking to digital assets backed by real money. Anchorage expands despite market challenges According to Anchorage Digital, the year 2025 has been a year of growth for the company. That growth was achieved partly through acquisitions, new partnerships, and the launch of new services, including stablecoin issuance. Those moves aim to keep the company at the forefront of digital money for large investors and institutions. “2025 was our year of scale. We made a series of acquisitions, inked major partnerships, and launched new business lines like stablecoin issuance to solidify our lead in institutional crypto,” an Anchorage spokesperson said in a statement. The firm secured $350 million in funding from major investors, including KKR, Goldman Sachs, GIC, and Apollo, in late 2021. At that time, the company was valued at more than $3 billion. Even though cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin, dropped later in October, Anchorage is moving forward with fundraising. Many crypto companies are going public, and some, like Tether, are raising record amounts of money.

Priced at $0.04 during Phase 7 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising new crypto investment alternatives to ADA. MUTM is in the early stages of establishing a decentralized lending and borrowing service with interest-yielding assets and liquidity pools. Already, its presale has attracted close to $20 million in investment from more than 18,800 individuals. Cardano Price Analysis ADA is observed to have support points around $0.404-$0.406, with a modestly bullish trend, but has yet to break past the resistance points at $0.408-$0.410. Its bullish trend is rather limited, with possible price movements likely to remain within the range of $0.415-$0.418. For those who are looking for more significant asymmetric gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the newly developing crypto project, is becoming increasingly popular with the presale model, utility approach, as well as the impending launch of the protocol. This further cements its standing as the top crypto for those who are seeking gains beyond conventional assets. MUTM Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance offers rewards to early investors through the sale of tokens at a discount price prior to the initial public offer. From $0.01 at the start of the presale to the current price of $0.04 during Phase 7, this represents a 300% increase. For those who have missed this move, phase 7’s price is the cheapest the token will ever cost. An investor who puts $3,000 into MUTM at $0.04 will see the investment rise to $4,500 when it reaches $0.06 at launch, realizing a profit of $1,500. After the launch, MUTM is expected to rise to $1, thereby growing $3,000 to $75,000 with a 25x ROI. Such investment opportunities make MUTM the top crypto for early-stage investors. Market Interest & High-Profile Participants The presale event is witnessing the participation of both retail and whale investors, along with institutional investors. Some investors who had success stories in the past in projects such as Cardano have also invested substantial amounts in this presale event, with one whale investing over $75,000. This also shows that the roadmap of this new project is appreciated, thus making MUTM the new cryptocurrency being noticed in the DeFi market. Scarcity Creates FOMO The tokenomics of Mutuum Finance are also an added feature that makes it attractive. The total supply of the tokens is fixed at 4 billion, with no minting of more tokens. This ensures that there is no dilution of the existing tokens. Out of the total of 4 billion tokens, 1.82 billion tokens are allocated for the presale stage of the project, with more than 850 million tokens already claimed. This momentum speaks to the project’s FOMO. Real-time Infrastructure Analysis If DeFi is to succeed, proper pricing and risk management are necessary, and in MUTM, Chainlink oracles are utilized in the verification of the price of assets like USD, ETH, and AVAX. In the scenario where a user locks in 10 ETH at a price of $3,000, the user would have a collateral value of $30,000, and at a Loan-to-Value ratio of 70%, the user would get a loan of $21,000. Chainlink then continuously updates the price of ETH as market conditions change, ensuring the protocol always has an accurate view of the collateral’s real-time value. More Adoption Indicates Future Successes Now that the presale is in place and the factor of scarcity is added to the list of strengths of the project on the chain, MUTM is slowly gaining popularity as an alternative to Cardano and other altcoins. As the project offers investment in the early stages of development and the potential for growth post-launch, Mutuum Finance is slowly becoming the top crypto to buy and hold for asymmetrical gains in the coming months.

Their balance sheets grew sharply, and their actions left a clear mark on supply and markets. The numbers tell a story of heavy buying, pause, and then corporate moves to protect share value. Related Reading: Crypto Money Floods US Politics As $21 Million Backs Trump PAC Large Treasury Buying Spree Reports have disclosed that these treasury firms deployed close to $50 billion into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens during 2025. At the start of the year, treasuries held more than $56 billion in crypto. By January one, 2026, that figure had risen to $134 billion — a gain of 137%. This buying helped push institutional ownership higher, with treasuries holding more than 5% of both Bitcoin and Ethereum supply by year-end. Public companies alone raised their Bitcoin reserves from about 598,714 coins to more than 1 million, an increase near 500,000 BTC. Market Drop Came Late In The Year The broader market did not keep its earlier momentum. Total crypto value fell almost 8% in 2025 and finished the year near $3 trillion. Most of the damage came late. 2025 Annual Crypto Industry Report is now LIVE 📊 Last year marked crypto’s first down year since 2022, featuring a brief $4.4T peak in Q4 before a historic $19B liquidation ended the year at $3.0T. Here are 7 key highlights you shouldn’t miss 👇 pic.twitter.com/HLbI5BrzwN — CoinGecko (@coingecko) January 15, 2026 The market shed almost a quarter of its value in the last three months, and a liquidation wave near $19 billion in October sped the decline after total market value briefly hit about $4.4 trillion. Bitcoin slipped roughly 1.4% to near $95,300 at one point as investors weighed policy moves in the US and shifting rate expectations. Supply Now Held By Treasuries By the start of 2026, treasuries were holding more than 1 million Bitcoin and 6 million ETH. That concentration matters because assets put on corporate books are less likely to be traded frequently. When large shares of supply are locked up, price swings can be smaller in calm times, but the effect can flip if selling is forced.

The move was traditional: protect investors’ equity value rather than add more tokens into a weakening market.

This bullish prediction comes after the cryptocurrency has seen years of strong performance, climbing past $126,000 and setting a new all-time high in 2025. With ETFs driving demand, whales accumulating , and global adoption steadily rising, a surge to $200,000 seems inevitable for the crypto founder. Binance Founder Predicts Bitcoin Price Could Hit $200,000 Bitcoin spent the past few years in a major uptrend, reaching multiple ATHs after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Following this, adoption and demand for the cryptocurrency skyrocketed , and for months, its price continued to appreciate with minimal pullbacks. In 2025, Bitcoin hit a peak above $126,000 . While many anticipated this achievement, some raised doubts , especially critics like Peter Schiff. Against this backdrop, the recent statement by CZ foresees another significant milestone for BTC that some analysts still believe won’t happen , at least not for another couple of years. Although Bitcoin has since shed a significant portion of its gains since its peak, the Binance founder has boldly stated that BTC reaching $200,000 is “the most obvious thing in the world.” He emphasized that it was only a matter of time before the Bitcoin price rises to this level, representing almost double its current ATH. While CZ acknowledged that the exact timing of the projected rally remains uncertain, his confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains unwavering. Notably, CZ’s bullish prediction for Bitcoin comes as the US regulatory landscape continues to evolve, aiming to create a safer, potentially bullish environment for digital assets. With bills like the CLARITY Act under consideration , the crypto market could benefit from clearer guidelines, increased institutional adoption, and greater investor confidence. Although the bill was initially scheduled for a vote by the US Senate Banking Committee on January 15, the decision was ultimately delayed , leaving the timeline for regulatory clarity uncertain. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market In addition to his bullish Bitcoin forecast, CZ has also predicted that a crypto “ Super Cycle ” could be approaching. The Binance founder pointed to recent developments involving the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a key factor behind his optimism. He highlighted a report on X, revealing that the SEC had officially removed crypto from its 2026 priority risk list, a move that could provide the industry with greater regulatory relief and create more room for future bullish growth. Analyst Forecasts $200,000 BTC In 2026 Sharing a similar outlook to CZ, a popular crypto analyst, Rekt Fencer, who has over 336,000 followers on X, has also predicted that Bitcoin could surge to $200,000. Despite the broader crypto market still recovering from a prolonged bear market, the analyst remains confident in BTC’s near-term prospects, noting that the cryptocurrency could replicate its explosive growth seen during the 2020 bull cycle . Unlike CZ, who has not provided a specific timeline for his $200,000 forecast, Rekt Fencer believes that BTC could hit this level before the end of 2026.

The tech giant adopted this decision at a time when individuals showed heightened interest in faster internet, driven by surging demand for AI technology and other data-intensive applications. Google seeks to stay competitive in the tech ecosystem This new firm is set to feature Google Fiber’s fiber-optic Internet service, GFiber, as well as Radiate’s business, also known as Astound. Stonepeak is believed to own the largest share of this company. At the same time, Google is expected to retain a smaller stake, said sources familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous, as the talks were private. To verify this claim, these sources cited an earlier statement from Stonepeak noting its plan to allocate approximately $1 billion in preferred equity. This situation prompted reports to reach out to Stonepeak, Google, and Radiate for clarification; however, they did not respond. Notably, talks are still ongoing; therefore, the deal is more likely to undergo amendments. On the other hand, reports from reliable sources reveal that the American technology company has been evaluating options to separate its fiber business. According to a 2024 report, sources familiar with the situation alleged that Alphabet is open to investments from GFiber’s outside investors to back its global adoption. Meanwhile, apart from this fiber project, Google claimed to have made significant investments totaling tens of billions of dollars in AI to strengthen its global position in AI data centers. Towards the end of last year, the tech giant invested about $15 billion in India and $9 billion in South Carolina. This move backs the tech firm’s long-standing goal of becoming a leader in the tech industry. To further illustrate its commitment to achieving this goal, the CEO of Google Cloud, Thomas Kurian, released a statement disclosing that Google intends to allocate around $15 billion over the coming half-decade to build a new AI-driven data center in southern India. With this initiative in place, the tech company seeks to establish a global network of its AI data centers. During an event in New Delhi, Kurian commented that, “This will be the largest AI hub we’re building outside of the United States,” adding that, “it is part of a worldwide network of AI centers across 12 different countries.” Google seeks to explore the tech industry with significant AI innovations Following Google’s focus on AI expansion, sources highlighted that the new AI data center hub, anticipated to begin operations in July 2028, will feature improved AI infrastructure, enhanced fiber-optic networks, and significant energy reserves across three regional sites. Moreover, the company noted that the facility will be geographically located in Visakhapatnam, a major port city and industrial hub in Andhra Pradesh, India. It is set to start with an initial capacity of 1 gigawatt and later increase to several gigawatts. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, weighed in on this development, calling the India-based AI hub a “landmark development that will introduce Google’s AI innovations to the country’s vast population”.

One of the most recent moves making waves in the space is the investment to support LMAX and strengthen market infrastructure. LMAX Gains Major Boost With Ripple Investment A recent report discloses that Ripple has taken yet another significant step in its institutional expansion by investing to support LMAX’s worldwide business strategy. With the aim of reinforcing its commitment to building a robust, enterprise-grade market infrastructure, the firm has invested over $150 million to support this strategy. Ripple’s move underscores its focus on strengthening the railroads that link digital assets with traditional finance, expanding access to regulated trading platforms, and deepening liquidity. Such a move marks the persistent efforts of the company in transforming global trading models. According to market expert and trader Pumpius on X, this is a far bigger move than a simple strategic investment from the payment firm. Instead, it is a strategic integration move aimed at hardwiring the adjacency of XRP to institutional price discovery and execution infrastructure. The expert highlighted that LMAX operates high-performance, low-latency venues for FX, metals, and digital assets, which are being used by banks, funds, and professional liquidity providers. This creates a period where size is traded under stringent regulatory standards , and risk is controlled. By supporting LMAX’s global expansion, Pumpius stated that Ripple is making sure XRP is positioned within venues that institutions already trust for hedging funds, market making, and balance sheet management. This seems to be a better move in comparison to relying on fragmented retail liquidity. Interestingly, this bolsters Ripple’s end-to-end stack across settlement, liquidity provisioning, custody, and execution. While it may seem complex, this is vital since tokenized deposits, compliant stablecoins , and on-chain settlement are shifting into production. However, Pumpius added that the outcome is deeper liquidity, tighter spreads, and routine XRP usage within regulated market infrastructure, long before the wider market notices the underlying shift. XRP Charting Path To New All-Time High? XRP is regaining bullish traction as market structure points to a historical trend that preceded a massive wave up to previous highs. From a weekly timeframe chart shared by ChartNerd, XRP is forming a pivotal Golden Cross pattern, which could shape its next trajectory. It is worth noting that the last time this pattern appeared on the weekly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the altcoin rallied to new all-time highs. With the same structure unfolding, a similar price trend is expected to occur. Currently, the MACD is in oversold territory, and the Golden Cross formation is expected to form in the upcoming weeks. Given that the market structure is protecting a 400-day defense zone, expansion seems likely.",XRP|ChartNerd|FX|Golden Cross Formation|LMAX|MACD|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|ripple|Stablecoins|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 02:00:07

Although the meme coin has since slipped back into negative territory, a crypto analyst believes another bullish reversal may be approaching soon. According to the analyst, a key technical pattern has recently emerged on the chart, suggesting that PEPE has formed a bottom and could be on its way to a massive 3,000% price rally. PEPE Price Prepares For Massive 3,000% Rally In a post shared on X this Thursday, market analyst CryptoLinx outlined a bullish outlook for PEPE, pointing to a key shift on the weekly chart that he believes could trigger a 3,000% rally in the meme coin’s price. He stated that PEPE has just printed a bullish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) cross on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $57,000: The Bullish Path That Could End In Tears The analyst’s chart shows the weekly MACD lines crossing upward with momentum shifting from red to green. This move comes after an extended downtrend and coincides with price stabilizing and starting to curl higher, a pattern often associated with a rounded bottom. In his post, CryptoLinx emphasized that most traders and investors do not fully understand just how powerful the weekly MACD can be when it crosses at a true market bottom. Such moments often mark the market’s transition from an accumulation phase to a sustained uptrend. In previous cycles, similar setups have led to substantial price appreciation in PEPE. Moves of 200% to 300% were recorded in the PEPE price as momentum shifted in favor of buyers. CryptoLinx has suggested that if PEPE has indeed found its true bottom, its potential price rally could be significantly more explosive than past cycles. Based on the analyst’s predictions, the bullish MACD cross would not fuel a simple price recovery for PEPE, but an explosive surge that could completely flip its ongoing downtrend and mark a new ATH. The analysis points to a potential upside of 1,500% to 3,000% for PEPE this year. Such a rally could see the meme coin jump from its current levels around $0.00000585 to $0.0000928 and $0.000179, respectively. An Update On PEPE Price Action In 2025, the Pepe price spent several months in a sustained downtrend, closing the year in the red and extending its losses into the first few days of 2026. However, as meme coins saw a sudden market revival at the beginning of the year, PEPE jumped by more than 30%, briefly rallying before shedding some of its gains. Related Reading: Next XRP Wave Shows Where Price Is Headed Next, But There’s A Catch According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the PEPE price remains down over 68% Year-to-Date (YTD). Despite this broader decline, the meme coin has shown signs of recovery, climbing more than 44% over the past month. At the time of writing, PEPE is down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours and about 4.5% in the past week.

According to a detailed report from DL News, the potential for a so-called ‘Erdoğanization’ of the Fed under a Trump administration presents a structural shift with profound implications for the U.S. dollar and alternative assets like Bitcoin. This analysis draws direct parallels to recent international monetary crises, providing a sobering framework for understanding potential 2025 market dynamics. Federal Reserve Independence Faces a Critical Test The concept of central bank independence remains a cornerstone of modern economic stability. For decades, the Federal Reserve has operated with a mandate to control inflation and maximize employment, theoretically free from direct political interference. However, recent political discourse has placed this long-held principle under intense scrutiny. Analysts now actively debate the resilience of this institutional firewall. André Dragosch, Head of Research for Europe at the asset manager Bitwise, coined the term ‘Erdoğanization’ to describe this risk. He directly references the economic trajectory of Turkey, where government intervention eroded central bank autonomy. Consequently, this led to severe currency devaluation and hyperinflation. Dragosch’s analysis posits a clear causal chain for the United States. Political pressure to artificially lower interest rates could compromise the Fed’s ability to combat inflation effectively. This situation, in turn, would likely devalue the U.S. dollar over the medium to long term. Financial markets historically react negatively to uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. Therefore, investors systematically seek assets perceived as hedges against currency weakness and institutional fragility. Historical Precedent: The Turkish Lira and Bitcoin Demand Understanding the potential ‘Erdoğanization’ thesis requires examining the recent Turkish economic experiment. Beginning around 2018, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly pressured the Turkish Central Bank (TCMB) to slash interest rates despite soaring inflation. He famously described high interest rates as the ‘mother and father of all evil.’ The TCMB eventually capitulated, sacrificing its operational independence. The results were severe and predictable. Currency Collapse: The Turkish lira (TRY) lost over 80% of its value against the U.S. dollar between 2018 and 2023. Hyperinflation: Official inflation rates soared above 85%, devastating savings and purchasing power. Capital Flight: Both domestic and international investors fled lira-denominated assets. In this environment, Turkish citizens and investors turned to alternative stores of value. Gold demand surged, but notably, Bitcoin adoption accelerated dramatically. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volumes in Turkey consistently ranked among the highest globally. Citizens used the cryptocurrency not for speculation, but primarily for wealth preservation. This real-world case study provides a tangible model. It demonstrates how a loss of faith in centralized monetary authority can directly increase demand for decentralized, non-sovereign assets like Bitcoin. André Dragosch’s Structural Analysis for 2025 Dragosch applies this framework to the potential U.S. situation with analytical precision. He avoids speculative price predictions, focusing instead on structural relationships. ‘A weakening of Fed independence structurally implies higher inflation and a weaker dollar,’ Dragosch stated in the DL News report. He views this macroeconomic outcome as fundamentally positive for Bitcoin’s value proposition. His reasoning hinges on Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature. Unlike fiat currencies, no political actor can increase Bitcoin’s supply or mandate its monetary policy. This makes it a pure hedge against currency debasement. The analysis further suggests that the mere perception of compromised Fed independence could trigger market movements. If a Fed Chair were replaced explicitly for not acquiescing to political demands, or if public statements clearly undermined the institution’s autonomy, investor confidence could erode rapidly. In such a climate, Bitcoin could emerge not merely as a speculative tech asset, but as a prominent, legitimate alternative within diversified portfolios. This re-categorization would represent a significant evolution in Bitcoin’s market role. The Mechanics of Dollar Weakness and Crypto Correlations A structurally weaker U.S. dollar creates multiple pathways for Bitcoin appreciation. Firstly, since Bitcoin is globally priced in dollars, a falling dollar makes each bitcoin cheaper for holders of other, stronger currencies. This can increase international buying pressure. Secondly, and more importantly, investors globally hold U.S. dollar-denominated assets as a primary reserve. Perceived dollar weakness prompts a search for non-correlated or inversely correlated assets. Potential Impact Channels of Fed Politicization Channel Mechanism Potential Bitcoin Impact Inflation Expectations Political pressure prevents rate hikes, leading to sustained high inflation. Increased demand for Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Currency Devaluation Weaker dollar reduces purchasing power of dollar reserves. Bitcoin gains appeal as a global, neutral reserve asset. Loss of Institutional Credibility Markets lose trust in the primary anchor of the global financial system. Capital flows toward decentralized systems outside traditional finance. Geopolitical Realignment Other nations reduce dollar reliance, exploring alternative settlement layers. Bitcoin’s network could benefit as a cross-border settlement option. Furthermore, the U.S. Treasury and bond markets deeply interconnect with Fed policy. Any doubt about the Fed’s commitment to price stability could increase yields on long-term Treasuries, reflecting higher inflation risk premiums. This volatility in traditional safe-haven assets could push some institutional capital toward digital assets with different risk-return profiles. It is crucial to note that this relationship is not guaranteed to be immediate or linear. Short-term market reactions can be chaotic. However, the structural argument posits a strengthening long-term correlation between perceptions of fiat currency fragility and Bitcoin’s valuation. Broader Context: The Global Search for Monetary Alternatives The discussion about Fed independence and Bitcoin does not occur in a vacuum. It aligns with a broader, global trend of exploring monetary alternatives. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are in development worldwide, often raising concerns about financial privacy and state control. Simultaneously, several nations continue to diversify their foreign exchange reserves away from the U.S. dollar. Gold purchases by central banks have reached multi-decade highs. This macro backdrop is essential for a complete analysis. Bitcoin exists within this ecosystem as a unique, apolitical, and software-based competitor. Its potential rise in a scenario of Fed politicization would be part of a larger narrative of de-dollarization and financial fragmentation. Other cryptocurrencies might also benefit, but Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, robust security, and clear narrative as ‘digital gold’ position it uniquely to capture this specific type of hedge demand. The 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced new supply issuance, further tightens its economic model just as these macroeconomic questions intensify. Conclusion The analysis highlighting the risk to Federal Reserve independence presents a significant, experience-driven hypothesis for 2025 financial markets. Drawing from the tangible precedent of Turkey, experts like André Dragosch outline a scenario where political pressure leads to dollar weakness, thereby boosting Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative, non-sovereign asset. While the future path of U.S. monetary policy remains uncertain, the structural relationship between institutional credibility, currency strength, and demand for decentralized assets is becoming increasingly clear. Investors and policymakers alike must now consider how the delicate balance of Federal Reserve independence could fundamentally alter the landscape for traditional and digital assets in the coming year. FAQs Q1: What does ‘Erdoğanization of the Fed’ mean? It is an analytical term comparing potential political pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to the documented erosion of central bank independence in Turkey under President Erdoğan, which led to high inflation and currency collapse. Q2: How could a weaker U.S. dollar specifically benefit Bitcoin? A weaker dollar makes Bitcoin cheaper for international buyers using stronger currencies and increases demand for assets perceived as hedges against currency devaluation and inflation, a role Bitcoin is increasingly adopted for. Q3: Is central bank independence legally protected in the United States? While the Federal Reserve was designed to be independent within the government, its board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, creating a potential channel for political influence over time. Q4: Did Bitcoin actually help people in Turkey during the lira crisis? Yes, data shows Turkish Bitcoin trading volumes surged as citizens used it to preserve savings, make international transactions, and hedge against the lira’s rapid devaluation and capital controls. Q5: Are other assets besides Bitcoin considered hedges in this scenario? Yes, traditional hedges include gold, commodities, and real estate. However, Bitcoin offers a digital, borderless, and fixed-supply alternative that appeals particularly to a younger, tech-oriented demographic and for cross-border capital preservation.

USDC, CRCL’s flagship stablecoin, posted 66% YoY revenue growth to $740 million and 57% adjusted EBITDA margin, underscoring strong profitability. Management guides for 40% CAGR in USDC circulation, but acknowledges growth headwinds from lower interest rates and competitive pressures. While not 'dirt cheap,' CRCL’s GARP profile and secular stablecoin adoption thesis support expectations for double-digit returns over the long term. Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) has not escaped the volatility that hit high-growth stocks late last year. That volatility has coincided with lower interest rates and potentially slower USDC growth, which might have contributed to the downward pressure. Yet I still see a clear case for increasing stablecoin adoption long term, with USDC looking positioned to benefit courtesy of its various partnerships. Despite the dampened growth outlook, I reiterate my buy rating as the valuation is looking as reasonable as ever. CRCL Stock Price I last covered CRCL in September , where I initiated coverage as a high-risk, high reward play. The stock has plunged - without hyperbole - since. Data by YCharts The air has left the balloon. In the above report, I had written that “I find the stock buyable at these levels but expect significant volatility as investors may be uneasy about the high valuations given potentially low conviction in the consistency of forward growth rates.” The 40% slide has thoroughly addressed any such reservations. CRCL Stock Key Metrics CRCL is the owner of the stablecoin network ( USDC-USD ). USDC is the second largest stablecoin in the world, behind Tether ( USDT-USD ). Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that do not fluctuate in value due to being backed by reserves of cash and short-term US Treasury bills (or at least this is the case for USDC). Stablecoins are a new frontier, and CRCL is racing to grow its network. 2025 Q3 Presentation CRCL has been working with financial industry leaders to increase adoption and discover new use cases. 2025 Q3 Presentation In my eyes, the overarching thesis behind USDC and stablecoins in general is the lightning fast and secure transaction speeds that they allow for. The potential opportunity may then be viewed as corporations around the world replacing their “checking account cash” (working capital) with USDC. This is cash that corporations otherwise are not expecting to earn significant interest from in the first place. USDC has grown rapidly, helping to offset headwinds from declining short term US Treasury rates. 2025 Q3 Presentation This culminated in revenues growing 66% YoY to $740 million. 2025 Q3 Presentation The company was also significantly profitable, with adjusted EBITDA jumping 57% YoY to $166 million, representing a 57% margin. 2025 Q3 Presentation I note that the company is solidly profitable on a GAAP basis as well, with GAAP operating income coming in at 27.8% of gross profits even after subtracting out “other income.” 2025 Q3 Presentation Management continues to guide for around 40% CAGR in USDC circulation over the medium term. 2025 Q3 Presentation On the conference call , management noted their conviction in taking market share, noting that overall “stablecoin transaction volumes have grown approximately 130% year-over-year with USDC share expanding to 40% in Q3.” Management did note that they are “not focused on monetizing the network” but instead “want the network to grow so that it's creating value for all participants.” Management noted that “over time” there may be “many opportunities for very small fees,” as this is a “winner-take-most market structure.” I may be reading too much into the tea leaves, but I suspect that management may be trying to prepare investors for the potential for profit margins to decline in the near term. Is CRCL Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold? CRCL stock has struggled as of late. I see two primary reasons. First, interest rates continue to move lower as the market makes progress on inflation. Second, the company has seen some struggles to USDC growth in recent months . At recent prices, CRCL traded at just around 5.5x forward revenues. Seeking Alpha At this point, the optimism has let itself out. There are valid concerns with the bullish thesis. Revenues will face pressure if interest rates keep going lower, and that appears to be the current trend. It is possible, if not likely, that management’s guidance for 40% USDC circulation growth proves optimistic, as it is not immediately clear how they came to that target. It is, however, important to remember that USDC is still just around $75 billion. This is lower in comparison to the $700 billion in “trapped working capital” estimated by JP Morgan in 2024 . Of course, one must note that USDT already stands at nearly $200 billion, so a lot of the growth runway indeed has been played out. But that is to be expected at this stage in the bull market. I won’t make the claim that the stock is “dirt cheap.” I continue to assume that the company can achieve at least 15% net margins (implying around 50% margins based on gross profits). That places the valuation at around 37x long term earnings. The company might need to sustain around 15% to 20% growth to justify that valuation, which looks achievable long term, as at this point I view the move from checking account cash to stablecoin as being similar to e-commerce or video streaming. I was clearly early in my previous buy rating, and my growth outlook has dampened since, as I did not expect USDC growth to slow down on a sequential basis so quickly. Even so, the lower stock price has adequately priced-in the slight deterioration in fundamentals, and thus the stock looks like it’s priced for double-digit returns from here. I can see the company delivering around 20% growth at the very least over multi-year periods, as it benefits from its partnership with leading cryptocurrency firm Coinbase ( COIN ). Even after the fall, I do not see an immediate case for multiple expansion, which heightens the potential volatility, but this looks like a “GARP” kind of stock from here. CRCL Stock Risks If short term interest rates continue to decline, then CRCL may eventually see revenue growth compress. I would focus more on the growth of the USDC network, but it is also possible that USDC growth proves volatile or falls far short of management’s guidance. It is possible that USDT or others will win the market. It is possible that governments outlaw the use of stablecoins, preventing further growth. CRCL Stock Conclusion I must reiterate that CRCL is not that cheap here. It’s significantly less expensive than it was just a handful of months ago, but the company may see some volatility as it laps tough comparables and grapples with declining interest rates. That said, I like the GAAP profitability and long-term secular thesis, as stablecoins do appear to offer significant advantages over the slower and more expensive traditional financial system. I do not see “100-bagger” kind of upside potential here, as the real addressable market might be focused on checking account cash instead of all cash, but the valuation looks right given the strong momentum the company is seeing in rising USDC circulation.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-17 02:30:00

57230662,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=896613,1768618009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57230662.jpeg,"JustLend DAO Completes Second JST Buyback and Burn, Removing Nearly 11% of Total Supply",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/justlend-dao-completes-second-jst-buyback-and-burn-removing-nearly-11-of-total-supply/,"Singapore January 16, 2026 — JustLend DAO , TRON’s premier decentralized lending platform, announced the completion of a second buyback and burn of its JST token, permanently removing 525 million tokens, representing an estimated $21 million USD in value, from circulation. The burn represents approximately 5.3% of the total supply, and brings the cumulative reduction to roughly 1.08 billion JST, or 10.96% of total supply, achieved in less than three months. The successful buyback and burn reflect JustLend DAO’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a deflationary token supply. The latest burn was supported by continued growth in activity across the JustLend DAO ecosystem. Total value locked surpassed $7.08 billion, consistently placing the protocol among the three largest decentralized lending markets. Activity in the SBM market reached a new cycle high, and the reserves used for the buyback came from SBM USDT balances created during the first burn, supporting a self-sustaining model for ongoing supply reduction. JustLend DAO continues to expand and diversify its product suite: sTRX Staking : Supports on-chain participation while preserving liquidity for broader DeFi use cases, with more than 9.3 billion TRX staked to date. Energy Rental : Reduced base fees from 15% to 8% in September 2025, contributing to increased on-chain usage. GasFree Smart Wallet : Enables users to pay transaction fees directly from transferred assets such as USDT, supported by a gas subsidy that has lowered costs to approximately 1 USDT per transfer. The wallet has processed $46 billion in transaction volume, delivering meaningful fee savings for users. Additional buyback capacity has been supported by growth within the USDD multi-chain ecosystem. USDD has expanded across major networks including Ethereum and BNB Chain, with total value locked exceeding $1 billion as of January 14, more than doubling in less than two months. The expansion strengthens the linkage between stablecoin adoption, protocol activity, and ongoing JST supply reduction, reinforcing a closed-loop model that supports ecosystem participation and liquidity over time. The reduction in JST supply has transformed the token’s structure by more closely linking its value to protocol activity while increasing overall scarcity. With fewer tokens outstanding, each remaining JST carries greater governance weight, expanding holder influence over protocol parameters, treasury decisions, and future product development. Market data reflected heightened activity following the burns, with CoinMarketCap showing JST’s market capitalization surpassed $400 million for the first time on January 8. On the same day, 24-hour trading volume rose 21.92% to $31.49 million, while the token’s price increased 10.82% over the past month and 3.1% in a single day. The continuation of quarterly buyback-and-burn cycles sets a clear and measurable path for reducing JST supply over time. As the ecosystem continues to grow, the supply of JST is expected to decline in a predictable way, increasing scarcity. The latest burn marks an early stage of this process, with future reductions expected to build over time alongside ongoing product development and broader ecosystem participation.

His comments highlight the complex regulatory landscape confronting digital assets as financial institutions increasingly engage with tokenization and blockchain technologies. This development comes amid growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency markets and increasing pressure for regulatory clarity from traditional finance sectors. Goldman Sachs CEO Details Crypto Bill Challenges David Solomon specifically addressed the Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act, commonly known as the CLARITY Act. He emphasized that Goldman Sachs monitors this legislation carefully due to its potential impact on financial innovation. The bill aims to establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including clear definitions and jurisdictional boundaries. Solomon noted that recent developments suggest considerable time will pass before meaningful progress occurs. His assessment reflects broader institutional concerns about regulatory uncertainty in cryptocurrency markets. Financial analysts immediately recognized the significance of Solomon’s comments. They indicate that major financial institutions remain cautious about expanding cryptocurrency services without clearer regulatory guidelines. The delayed legislation affects planning for tokenized asset platforms and digital custody solutions. Market observers note that regulatory uncertainty may temporarily advantage jurisdictions with more established digital asset frameworks. Consequently, U.S. financial innovation could face competitive pressures from global markets. Legislative Timeline and Recent Setbacks The CLARITY Act experienced a significant setback when the Senate Banking Committee postponed its planned markup session. This delay followed Coinbase’s withdrawal of support for the current draft legislation. The cryptocurrency exchange cited concerns about specific provisions that might hinder innovation. Committee members subsequently requested additional time for revisions and stakeholder consultations. Legislative analysts now predict the bill may not reach committee vote until late 2025 at the earliest. Several factors contribute to the legislative complexity. First, lawmakers must balance consumer protection with innovation facilitation. Second, jurisdictional questions between regulatory agencies require careful resolution. Third, technological developments continuously outpace legislative processes. The table below illustrates key stakeholders and their positions: Stakeholder Position on CLARITY Act Primary Concerns Traditional Banks Generally Supportive Clear regulatory boundaries, compliance frameworks Crypto Exchanges Mixed Support Innovation restrictions, operational requirements Consumer Groups Cautiously Optimistic Investor protection, transparency mandates Regulatory Agencies Seeking Clarification Jurisdictional authority, enforcement mechanisms Historical context reveals that comprehensive financial legislation typically requires multiple congressional sessions. The Dodd-Frank Act, for instance, underwent extensive revisions over several years. Similarly, cryptocurrency regulation involves novel technological considerations that complicate traditional legislative approaches. Committee staff members continue working on technical amendments while maintaining dialogue with industry representatives. Institutional Impact on Tokenization and Stablecoins Solomon specifically highlighted the legislation’s potential effects on tokenization and stablecoin markets. Tokenization refers to representing real-world assets as digital tokens on blockchain networks. Financial institutions increasingly explore this technology for various applications: Asset Fractionalization: Dividing high-value assets into smaller investment units Settlement Efficiency: Accelerating transaction settlement through smart contracts Regulatory Compliance: Embedding compliance requirements directly into token protocols Market Accessibility: Expanding investment opportunities to broader participant groups Stablecoin regulation represents another critical component. These digital assets maintain stable values by pegging to traditional currencies or other reserves. The CLARITY Act proposes specific frameworks for stablecoin issuance and operation. Regulatory clarity would enable traditional financial institutions to engage more confidently with stablecoin technologies. Currently, uncertainty limits institutional participation despite growing market demand for dollar-pegged digital assets. Goldman Sachs has publicly explored tokenization initiatives through various pilot programs. The firm recognizes blockchain technology’s potential to transform traditional financial services. However, regulatory ambiguity creates implementation challenges. Solomon’s comments reflect this practical reality for institutional adoption. Other major banks echo similar concerns about navigating uncertain regulatory environments while pursuing technological innovation. Comparative Global Regulatory Approaches While U.S. legislation faces delays, other jurisdictions advance their cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. The European Union implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in 2024. This comprehensive framework establishes clear rules for cryptocurrency service providers and token issuers. Asian financial centers including Singapore and Hong Kong also developed progressive regulatory regimes. These jurisdictions aim to attract cryptocurrency businesses through regulatory certainty. The United Kingdom recently announced its own cryptocurrency regulatory package. British authorities emphasize innovation-friendly approaches while maintaining robust consumer protections. This global regulatory patchwork creates complex compliance requirements for international financial institutions. Many firms establish operations in multiple jurisdictions to navigate varying regulatory environments. The delayed U.S. legislation may temporarily disadvantage American financial innovation relative to global competitors. International regulatory cooperation continues through organizations like the Financial Stability Board and International Organization of Securities Commissions. These bodies develop global standards for cryptocurrency regulation. However, national implementation varies significantly across jurisdictions. The delayed CLARITY Act complicates U.S. participation in these international coordination efforts. Regulatory divergence could eventually create market fragmentation and compliance challenges for global financial institutions. Expert Analysis and Market Implications Financial regulation experts analyze the delayed legislation’s potential consequences. Dr. Eleanor Vance, former SEC senior counsel and current Georgetown University professor, explains the situation. “Comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation involves unprecedented technical complexity,” she notes. “Lawmakers must understand blockchain fundamentals while addressing legitimate regulatory concerns. This educational process naturally extends legislative timelines.” Market participants already adjust strategies based on regulatory expectations. Institutional cryptocurrency adoption continues through existing regulatory frameworks. However, ambitious projects requiring novel regulatory approvals face implementation delays. Venture capital investment in cryptocurrency infrastructure remains strong despite legislative uncertainty. Investors recognize that regulatory clarity will eventually emerge, creating substantial opportunities for compliant solutions. The delayed legislation affects various market segments differently. Established cryptocurrency exchanges continue operating under existing regulatory interpretations. New financial products involving tokenization await clearer guidelines before full-scale launch. Traditional financial institutions proceed cautiously with blockchain initiatives while monitoring legislative developments. This cautious approach may temporarily slow innovation but potentially reduces regulatory risk exposure. Conclusion Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon’s assessment highlights significant challenges facing U.S. cryptocurrency legislation. The CLARITY Act requires additional time for legislative refinement and stakeholder consensus. This delayed timeline affects institutional planning for tokenization and stablecoin initiatives. While regulatory uncertainty persists, financial institutions continue exploring blockchain applications within existing frameworks. The eventual establishment of comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation will likely accelerate institutional adoption and innovation. Market participants should monitor legislative developments while maintaining flexible implementation strategies for digital asset initiatives. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act represents proposed U.S. legislation establishing comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets. It addresses market structure, consumer protection, and jurisdictional questions for cryptocurrency markets. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the current draft? Coinbase expressed concerns that specific provisions might unnecessarily restrict innovation. The exchange continues advocating for balanced regulation that protects consumers while enabling technological advancement in cryptocurrency markets. Q3: How does delayed legislation affect tokenization? Regulatory uncertainty creates implementation challenges for tokenization projects. Financial institutions hesitate to launch comprehensive tokenization platforms without clearer regulatory guidelines, potentially slowing innovation in this emerging sector. Q4: What are stablecoins and why do they need regulation? Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain stable values, typically pegged to traditional currencies. Regulation establishes standards for reserve management, issuance transparency, and operational reliability to protect users and maintain financial stability. Q5: How does U.S. cryptocurrency regulation compare globally? The United States currently lags behind jurisdictions like the European Union in establishing comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. This regulatory divergence creates compliance complexities for international financial institutions operating across multiple jurisdictions.

This strategic move, first reported by Cointelegraph in May 2025, positions the regulated crypto bank for a significant expansion phase, directly coinciding with a transformative period of regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. The funding round underscores growing investor confidence in compliant crypto infrastructure ahead of a speculated 2026 IPO timeline. Anchorage Digital Funding Strategy and IPO Pathway Anchorage Digital’s pursuit of new capital represents a calculated step in its corporate evolution. The company, which secured a coveted national trust charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in 2021, is now building its war chest. This capital infusion will primarily fuel two parallel objectives: scaling its core institutional services and aggressively expanding into the burgeoning stablecoin sector. Consequently, the firm plans to double the size of its dedicated stablecoin team within the year, a direct response to recent legislative developments. Industry analysts view this pre-IPO round as a bid to solidify market position and achieve a stronger valuation before entering the public markets, a common strategy for late-stage fintech startups. The reported valuation for this round remains undisclosed, but previous funding provides context. Anchorage Digital last raised $350 million in a Series D round in late 2021, achieving a valuation exceeding $3 billion. The current effort suggests the company aims to build upon that foundation significantly. Furthermore, the 2026 IPO window aligns with broader market expectations for a maturation cycle in crypto-focused public listings, following the earlier waves of exchange-based offerings. The Catalytic Impact of U.S. Stablecoin Legislation The timing of Anchorage Digital’s expansion is not coincidental; it is deeply intertwined with regulatory progress. The passage of the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act in early 2025 provided the first comprehensive federal framework for issuers and custodians. This legislation effectively removed a primary source of operational uncertainty for regulated entities like Anchorage Digital. The law establishes clear requirements for reserve composition, redemption policies, and oversight, creating a legitimate playing field for compliant operators. For Anchorage Digital, this regulatory green light transforms its stablecoin ambitions from a speculative venture into a core business line with predictable rules. The company’s existing infrastructure for institutional custody and trading seamlessly integrates with stablecoin services, offering clients a unified platform. This legislative catalyst is prompting a sector-wide shift, as evidenced by the following comparative moves by competitors: Coinbase Custody: Enhanced its stablecoin management tools and regulatory reporting features. Fidelity Digital Assets: Announced research into offering stablecoin yield products for institutional clients. Traditional Banks (e.g., BNY Mellon): Accelerated pilot programs for digital asset custody, including stablecoins. This competitive landscape underscores why Anchorage Digital is moving decisively to capture market share early in the new regulatory era. Expert Analysis on Institutional Crypto Adoption Financial technology experts point to this funding round as a bellwether for the broader institutional adoption of digital assets. “Anchorage Digital’s move is a clear signal that sophisticated capital sees long-term value in regulated crypto banking rails,” notes Dr. Elena Vargas, a fintech professor at Stanford University. “The focus on stablecoins is particularly telling. It indicates that the near-term growth vector is in tokenized real-world assets and payment systems, not just speculative crypto trading.” This perspective is supported by data from PwC’s 2024 Global Crypto Report, which projected that institutional investment in crypto infrastructure would grow by over 150% between 2023 and 2026, with custody and compliance services being the largest segment. The potential IPO also carries symbolic weight for the industry. A successful public listing for a chartered crypto bank would demonstrate to traditional finance that compliant digital asset business models can achieve mainstream capital market success. It would provide a tangible benchmark for profitability and governance, aspects that have historically concerned institutional investors. Core Business Lines: Custody, Trading, and Staking To understand the significance of the funding, one must examine Anchorage Digital’s established business model. The company operates as a full-service platform for institutions like hedge funds, venture capital firms, and corporations. Its three pillars are: Digital Asset Custody: Provides secure, insured storage for cryptocurrencies using a combination of hardware security modules and multi-party computation (MPC) technology. This eliminates single points of failure for private keys. Institutional Trading: Offers a liquid marketplace for large-volume trades, connecting clients with a network of counterparties while ensuring settlement finality. Staking Services: Allows institutions to earn yield on their proof-of-stake assets (like Ethereum) through a non-custodial, slashing-insured service, which maintains compliance. The new capital will likely be deployed to enhance these core offerings through technological upgrades, geographic expansion, and increased sales and compliance personnel. The goal is to create an unrivaled, holistic platform that serves as the primary gateway for any traditional institution entering the digital asset space. Conclusion Anchorage Digital’s reported pursuit of a $200 million to $400 million funding round is a pivotal event at the intersection of finance, technology, and regulation. It highlights a strategic push to dominate the institutional crypto custody and emerging stablecoin market, empowered by new U.S. legislation. This pre-IPO maneuver sets the stage for a potential 2026 public listing that could serve as a landmark moment, validating the maturity and viability of regulated cryptocurrency banking. The success of this Anchorage Digital funding effort will be closely watched as a key indicator of institutional capital’s enduring commitment to the digital asset ecosystem’s infrastructure layer. FAQs Q1: What is Anchorage Digital? Anchorage Digital is a federally chartered digital asset bank and platform that provides custody, trading, staking, and financing services exclusively to institutional clients like asset managers and corporations. Q2: Why is Anchorage Digital raising new funds now? The company is raising capital to expand its business, particularly its stablecoin operations following new U.S. laws, and to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of a potential Initial Public Offering (IPO) targeted for 2026. Q3: How does recent stablecoin legislation affect Anchorage Digital? The 2025 Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act created a federal regulatory framework, giving compliant firms like Anchorage Digital clear rules to operate stablecoin services, which the company is now prioritizing for growth. Q4: What makes Anchorage Digital different from a regular crypto exchange? Unlike consumer exchanges, Anchorage Digital holds a national trust charter, allowing it to operate as a regulated bank. It focuses solely on institutional clients, offering higher security standards, insurance, and services tailored to large-scale investors. Q5: What would an Anchorage Digital IPO mean for the crypto industry? A successful IPO would be a major milestone, demonstrating that regulated crypto-native financial institutions can achieve public market success, potentially attracting more traditional investors and legitimizing the sector further.

57230775,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=876191,1768618817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/57230775.jpeg,"XRP Breakout Possible Before The Weekend, Expert Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-breakout-possible-before-weekend/,"XRP could be approaching an inflection point as a closely watched chart pattern tightens into its apex and broader “risk-on” signals in equities flash green, according to XRPL developer Bird (@Bird_XRPL). In a series of posts on X, Bird, the developer behind XRPL meme coin DROP, pointed to XRP’s hourly structure as setting up for a decisive move “before the end of the week,” arguing that a technical breakout could accelerate quickly toward a nearby upside objective. “Take a look at XRP on the hourly. A move is about to happen before the end of the week,” Bird wrote alongside a chart showing a contracting triangle with price compressing into the tip. “A measured move if we send upwards could push us straight to that $2.69 mark which finally gets us into ‘bull run’ mode.” Russell 2000 Breakout Puts XRP on Alert Beyond the short-term pattern, Bird anchored his thesis to US small caps, arguing that the Russell 2000’s behavior has historically mattered for XRP and the broader altcoin complex. Related Reading: XRP In A ‘Super Cycle’? SuperTrend Suggests Another Story “The Russell 2000 is about to close its highest weekly close in history. That matters ALOT for XRP,” Bird said. “Historically, XRP and altcoins have always tracked the Russell 2000 extremely closely. It’s the true risk on index for mid caps (not mega caps like the S&P or MAG7 where most capital has been parked).” Bird’s argument is that XRP still trades more like a mid-cap risk asset than a mega-cap “store of value” proxy, making the Russell’s breakout a useful macro tell for when speculative capital rotates back into higher beta exposures. He described the current backdrop as “capital rotating” and “risk … back on,” suggesting that the market may be entering a window where positioning can change quickly if narratives align. In a longer follow-up thread, Bird described XRP’s extended consolidation as increasingly out of sync with what he views as constructive macro conditions across risk assets. “We’re at a genuinely clinical moment for XRP. We’ve gone sideways for over a year, yet the Russell 2000 is now in full price discovery, other stock markets have been at all time highs for a long time, metals are elevated, and Bitcoin dominance is chopping at levels that historically dumps at,” he wrote. Related Reading: Ripple Builds XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’: Developer Claims ‘Billions Incoming’ Bird also pointed to a prior episode as a reference point: “In November ’24, the Russell turned green and XRP went parabolic roughly 10 days later,” he said, arguing that this time the Russell has gone further by reclaiming highs and holding strength across timeframes. In his view, the remaining constraint is rotation, not necessarily a sharp drawdown in metals or other assets, but simply a pause that allows risk appetite to re-price. On XRP and Ripple specific context, Bird said “acquisitions done, partnerships rolling out, NDAs lifting, legal clarity forming,” and argued that the market is nearing a point where “a single narrative, catalyst, or push can ignite XRP fast.” The key near-term test is whether the tightening technical structure resolves upward as Bird expects and whether cross-asset risk appetite continues to support alt beta. If both align, Bird’s framework suggests traders will be watching for a momentum break that could carry XRP toward the $2.69 objective and, in his view, potentially open the door to a faster path toward fresh cycle highs. At press time, XRP traded at $2.06.

57232019,658071,1768618822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57232019.jpeg,A New Bitcoin Market Regime: Spot Absorption Offsets Futures Noise,https://bitcoinist.com/new-bitcoin-market-spot-absorption-offsets-futures/,"Bitcoin is facing a critical test as bulls try to push price above a key resistance zone, hoping to confirm that the recent rebound has real traction. After weeks of choppy trading and repeated rejections, the market is again pressing into levels that could decide whether BTC transitions back into recovery mode or slips into another leg of consolidation. While momentum has improved in recent sessions, the broader structure still reflects uncertainty, with investors split between breakout expectations and caution after the latest correction. A report from XWIN Research Japan suggests Bitcoin is not currently in a strong directional trend, but instead remains trapped in a consolidation phase defined by range-bound price action and ongoing structural rebuilding. In this environment, the market is attempting to reset positioning after heavy volatility, while supply and demand continue to balance out near major technical levels. According to the analysis, the bias remains conditionally bullish, meaning upside continuation is still possible if Bitcoin can secure acceptance above resistance and hold it as support. However, the report also warns that short-term overheating risks persist, especially if leverage builds too quickly or price surges without sustained spot demand behind it. With Bitcoin approaching a pivotal inflection point, the next move could be decisive for broader market sentiment. Whales Take Control as Retail Activity Stays Muted The report adds that one of the most important shifts in Bitcoin’s current structure is the change in participant quality. CryptoQuant data suggests retail involvement in both spot and futures markets remains muted, while “Big Whale Orders” continue to appear across spot exchanges and derivatives venues. This points to a market that is being driven less by impulsive speculation and more by larger players gradually positioning through size and patience, shaping liquidity conditions around key price levels. This trend is reinforced by the 90-day Spot Taker CVD, which has flipped back into Taker Buy Dominant territory. In simple terms, aggressive market buying is increasing again, yet price has not accelerated sharply. That combination often implies that sell-side pressure is being absorbed, and available supply is being quietly taken off the table at lower levels. Rather than signaling euphoric demand, the behavior aligns more with structural accumulation and controlled risk-taking. At the same time, futures markets are heating up. Rising volumes and taker buying in derivatives suggest a more speculative layer is returning, raising the risk of short-term volatility if leverage becomes overcrowded. Still, spot flows indicate whales are absorbing supply, meaning futures-driven shakeouts can occur while underlying accumulation continues. The base case remains retail fading as whales take control, unless leverage distorts the structure again. Bitcoin Faces Heavy Moving Average Resistance Bitcoin is holding near $95,500 after a sharp recovery rally that began from the late-November lows. The chart shows BTC rebounding aggressively from the $85,000–$88,000 area, forming a clean sequence of higher lows and higher highs into mid-January. This move suggests that buyers have regained short-term control, but the market is now entering a key resistance zone where rallies have repeatedly stalled since the breakdown in November. The most immediate level to watch is the cluster between $95,000 and $98,000, where price is now pressing into overhead supply. BTC is also approaching the declining medium-term moving averages, which are acting as dynamic resistance and signaling that the broader trend is still recovering, not fully reversed. A clean daily close above this zone would strengthen the case for continuation toward the $100,000 psychological level and potentially a retest of the $105,000 area. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above $94,000–$95,000, the breakout risks turning into another liquidity sweep followed by consolidation. In that scenario, support sits near $92,000, with a deeper pullback targeting the $88,000–$90,000 range where buyers previously stepped in. For now, the trend is improving, but confirmation depends on reclaiming resistance with sustained volume.

He warned that proposed changes to a Senate market structure bill could slow economic growth by stifling innovation, limiting certain cryptocurrencies, and preventing Americans from earning interest on their stablecoins. During an in-depth interview with Fox Business under the host of Maria Bartiromo on Mornings With Maria, Armstrong highlighted that the most recent version of the Senate Banking Committee’s proposed legislation serves the interest of banks, therefore, cautioned that this could result in over-regulation, ending up harming recent bipartisan moves concerning crypto policy. Consequently, the industry executive stated that Coinbase carefully reviewed the Senate Banking Committee draft over the last 48 hours and concluded that it cannot support the bill in its current form. To further explain this decision, the CEO indicated that specific parts of the bill would come close to prohibiting tokenized securities, implement comprehensive regulatory constraints on the DeFi sector, weaken the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and eliminate rewards for stablecoins. Armstrong identifies several risks associated with the recently shared Senate Banking draft Armstrong expressed gratitude for the Senate’s collective efforts, particularly those of Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis. However, the industry executive sparked concern after alleging that the draft shared recently posed serious threats that would be difficult to address upon reaching a final vote on the Senate floor. According to him, the primary issue concerns the rewards associated with stablecoins. Regarding this problem, Armstrong asserted that recently enacted crypto regulations, such as the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act), which Trump signed into law, permitted stablecoin issuers to offer interest. He perceived this as crucial for enabling Americans to acquire returns on their investments. “The banks are really trying to undermine the president’s crypto plans,” Armstrong stated. “They want to protect their profits by taking money from hardworking Americans and putting it into the hands of big banks that are making record profits.” Afterwards, Coinbase’s CEO contrasted stablecoins that the GENIUS Act requires to be fully backed by short-term US Treasuries with traditional fractional-reserve banking, arguing that cryptocurrencies pose minimal risk to the financial system. To further elaborate on this point, he stated that these stablecoins do not rely on fractional reserves; therefore, they should not be regulated similarly to banks. Following his remarks, host Bartiromo asked Armstrong whether crypto platforms should be subject to regulations similar to those of banks. Examples of these regulations include deposit insurance and safeguard measures for investors. Responding to this question, he noted that these regulations primarily aim to manage risks associated with fractional-reserve lending, and that FDIC insurance covers deposits up to $250,000 per depositor. “If customers choose to lend out their funds, they can do so,” he said. “You don’t need a bank license for that. A bank license is necessary when you lend someone else’s money without their permission.” Armstrong expressed disapproval of the proposed change regarding the CFTC and the SEC Some analysts raised concerns that stablecoins pose a serious risk to community banks. Nonetheless, Armstrong called this claim false, describing it as a calculated distraction employed by major financial institutions. Based on his argument, assertions that stablecoins are draining community bank deposits lack substantiated evidence, and he noted that the consolidation driven by major banks poses a far greater risk since the Dodd-Frank era. Moreover, the industry executive condemned the Senate proposal that would make the CFTC subordinate to the SEC. In this approach, digital assets must pass through SEC oversight before potentially falling under CFTC control. “I can’t understand why the Senate Ag Committee would make the CFTC a subsidiary of the SEC,” he said, citing the CLARITY Act , which the House passed.

This signals significant concerns about the bill’s alignment with the interests of cryptocurrency firms compared to traditional banking institutions, not only for the exchange but also for broader market participants. Coinbase CEO’s Concerns Over Fair Competition On Friday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong elaborated on the rationale behind the exchange’s withdrawal in an appearance on FOX Business, expressing his frustration with the notion that banks could use regulatory means to stifle competition in their favor. “It just felt deeply unfair to me that one industry [banks] would come in and get to do regulatory capture to ban their competition,” Armstrong stated. He also underscored the importance of a level playing field, asserting that competition should thrive without undue interference from powerful financial entities. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bill Draft Criticized For Allowing Continued Developer Prosecution Coinbase CEO emphasized that his concerns resonate with “much of the industry,” highlighting his obligation to advocate for customers who he believes are being shortchanged by the provisions of the proposed market legislation. “I declined to opine on the exact—whether the hearing, the markup should happen or not… But I did feel like I had to speak up on behalf of our customers and all Americans here,” he articulated. Debate Heats Over CLARITY Act Central to the ongoing debate surrounding the CLARITY Act is a critical disagreement between banks and crypto firms regarding the fate of stablecoin holders and whether they should be entitled to receive reward payments. Armstrong has previously raised alarms that the bill might prohibit tokenized equities, impose restrictions on decentralized finance (DeFi), and expand governmental access to financial data, thereby compromising individual privacy. Furthermore, he warned that the legislation could shift regulatory authority away from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and towards the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), sidelining competition within the crypto space. Armstrong Critiques Banking Lobbying Tactics Armstrong noted the irony in the current situation, pointing out that while banks are indeed leveraging the advantages of cryptocurrency, their lobbying efforts seem aimed at restricting competing firms. “Many of these banks are actually very smart,” he acknowledged, referencing the commercial side of banking that is increasingly engaging with crypto. “They’re actually doing deals with Coinbase. We’re powering a lot of crypto and stablecoin infrastructure for them on the commercial side.” Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto ETFs Set To Attract $130 Billion-Plus Inflows This Year, JPMorgan Predicts Despite his criticisms of the banking sector’s lobbying tactics, Armstrong expressed optimism that legislators could ultimately resolve the outstanding issues within the crypto market structure bill: And then their lobbying arm comes to D.C. and thinks of it as very zero-sum and is trying to kill the competition. So, I suspect, like many things, if we get the principles in the room, we can actually get this figured out and make a good deal.

57232022,658044,1768622448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57232022.jpeg,XRP Burn Rate: Here’s How Many Coins Are Gone Forever,https://bitcoinist.com/how-many-xrp-are-gone-forever/,"XRP’s huge circulating supply is always a point of discussion among many market participants. This discussion is always around how it can realistically trade at huge price levels in the double and triple digits with such a huge total supply. However, discussion around its burn rate has resurfaced due to current figures showing a steady reduction in the cryptocurrency’s total supply. According to data shared by an expert on X, XRP’s supply has declined by more than 2 million tokens over the past two years, with comments about how the burn mechanism works, what it actually means for long-term supply, and how it fits into discussions about its valuation and use in large-scale payments. XRP Burns: Millions Are Gone Forever XRP does not rely on a discretionary burn program or periodic token destruction events. Instead, the XRP Ledger permanently destroys a small amount of the token every time a transaction is processed. This fee is not paid to validators or any network participant. Once it is consumed by the protocol, it is removed from circulation permanently. According to numbers shared on X by 24HRSCRYPTO, the total supply stood at 99,988,313,728 about 806 days ago. Today, that number is closer to 99,985,726,061. The difference is 2,587,667 XRP that no longer exist, meaning a little over 3,200 of the altcoin is destroyed per day. That number may not look dramatic compared to its nearly 100 billion maximum supply. However, it shows consistent on-ledger usage leading to a steady reduction in supply. This has led to the cumulative amount of the token burned slowly moving higher over the full lifetime of the Ledger. Pre-Mined, How Institutions Fit Into The Design The post by 24HRSCRYPTO also revisits a long-standing aspect of XRP’s structure. The token’s entire supply of 100 billion tokens was created at inception, although not all were released at launch. Furthermore, its supply has always been fixed, and burns will continue to reduce the total number of the token in existence. This is in contrast to networks like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana that see their total circulating supply increase over time. Furthermore, Ripple, which developed the Ledger, has consistently framed the altcoin from a payments and financial infrastructure perspective. This trend is also unlike most other cryptocurrencies, which are built to work in parallel against traditional finance. 24HRSCRYPTO notes that this design reflects an institutional mindset, noting that supply certainty is something banks and large financial players tend to prefer. When trillions start to flow into the altcoin, the circulating supply will continue to decrease. According to the analyst, $100 per XRP is inevitable in this case. This viewpoint is based on the fact that higher price targets for the token are not speculations but a functional requirement for global-scale usage.",XRP|24HRSCRYPTO|dogecoin|Ethereum|ripple|solana|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 04:00:48
