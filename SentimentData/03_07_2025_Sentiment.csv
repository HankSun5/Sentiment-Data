This massive lead positions Algorand far ahead of competitors, with XRP Ledger holding just $55.4 million, Gnosis at $14.3 million, Ethereum at $6.6 million, and Arbitrum at $3.9 million in tokenized assets.

Source: Messari USDC dominated this growth, increasing 150% to $133 million and accounting for 98% of Algorand’s total stablecoin supply by quarter-end. Algorand’s technical infrastructure upgrades have also strengthened its position. The platform activated staking rewards in January through the Algorand 4.0 upgrade, replacing governance payouts and giving validators direct income streams. Over 2 billion ALGO tokens are now staked across various platforms, creating natural supply constraints. RWA Shift Positions Algorand as Institutional Infrastructure Algorand’s overwhelming dominance in the $24.31 billion RWA market stems from its technical architecture, specifically designed for institutional-grade asset tokenization. The platform’s Pure Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism provides the security and regulatory compliance necessary for traditional financial institutions to enter blockchain markets. Major corporations, such as Lavazza Coffee, have chosen Algorand for their mission-essential applications. Lavazza Coffee has recorded over 26 tons of coffee on the Algorand blockchain in 2025, costing $0.005 in fees. This is in addition to the approx. 135 tons of coffee recorded all-time on Algorand by Lavazza.

The tokenized RWA market’s projected growth to $30 trillion by 2030 positions Algorand advantageously, given its current 70% market share. Interestingly, Robinhood’s 42-page SEC proposal for RWA regulatory frameworks could accelerate institutional adoption, benefiting platforms with established infrastructure, such as Algorand. Staking Surge and Network Effects Drive Supply Dynamics Algorand’s staking shift has fundamentally altered token economics, with over 2 billion ALGO now locked across various platforms following January’s reward activation. This represents approximately 25% of the circulating supply, creating deflationary pressure that could support price appreciation toward the $0.20 target. The transition from quarterly governance to continuous staking rewards eliminates the cyclical supply dumps that previously characterized ALGO price action. Source: Messari The community-held stake surged 121% to 1.02 billion ALGO, while the Foundation stake decreased 38% to 497 million. This particularly shows a progressive decentralization and reduced selling pressure. Major platforms, like Folks Finance and Kiln Finance , have integrated staking rewards comprehensively. This infrastructure expansion broadens staking accessibility across user segments. Similarly, Robinhood Europe and Nubank’s ALGO listings expand retail access in seven EU jurisdictions and Latin America, respectively. These integrations, combined with reduced Foundation selling pressure, create favorable supply-demand dynamics that could support sustained price appreciation beyond current $0.18 levels.

Additionally, the weekly Elliott Wave analysis suggests ALGO may be completing Wave 2 of a larger degree sequence, with projections indicating potential targets exceeding $7.00 if Wave 3 develops as anticipated. Source: @TimeFreedomROB on X The current RSI of 44.74 indicates oversold conditions, often associated with major wave completions preceding explosive upward movements. However, bearish technical indicators persist with descending trendlines acting as dynamic resistance, and zones around $0.25-0.27 would present major hurdles. Volume patterns don’t strongly support reversal scenarios, suggesting cautious optimism despite fundamental strength from RWA dominance. The key $0.16-0.17 support level must hold to prevent deeper corrections toward $0.12-0.14. A successful defense, combined with RWA market expansion, could trigger algorithmic buying toward the $0.20-0.25 resistance zones, while a failure might extend the correction before finding substantial support at lower levels.

The move indicates Ripple’s intention to bring its dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, under federal supervision and expand its crypto-related financial services in the United States. Ripple Seeks OCC Charter in Bid to Become a Federally Regulated Stablecoin Issuer The filing was made on Wednesday and, if approved, would place Ripple under dual regulatory oversight, both at the state level through the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and now federally through the OCC. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the application in a post on X, calling it a continuation of the company’s “long-standing compliance roots.” “If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight,” Garlinghouse wrote. “A new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.” True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC.

Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 The national charter would give Ripple the ability to streamline settlements by removing the need for intermediary banks. It would also allow the firm to offer additional crypto-related financial services under a regulatory structure long associated with traditional banks. Ripple is also seeking a Federal Reserve master account. That account would give the firm direct access to the Fed’s payment rails and allow it to hold stablecoin reserves at the central bank. RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin, was launched in December 2024 and currently has a market capitalization of around $470 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Though far smaller than market leaders Tether and Circle’s USDC, RLUSD is among the larger stablecoins in circulation. The timing of Ripple’s application comes just days after Circle Internet Group, the issuer of USDC, filed for its own national banking license . Circle is looking to launch a federally regulated entity named First National Digital Currency Bank, which would allow it to offer digital asset custody and other services. That application followed Circle’s public listing earlier this year , which valued the firm at nearly $18 billion. The rush comes as lawmakers in Washington are advancing a legal framework for stablecoins. Earlier this month, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act , which would require issuers to maintain full dollar reserves and publish monthly disclosures. The bill is awaiting a vote in the House, with support from President Trump. The U.S. Senate has passed the GENIUS Act in a 68–30 vote, marking the first major digital asset legislation and drawing praise from industry leaders. #regulation #stablecoins https://t.co/OSjotzTnUa — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 18, 2025 A report from Grayscale noted that the bill could give stablecoins a clearer path to mainstream acceptance. “The GENIUS Act will likely support stablecoin adoption in the U.S. while incorporating sensible safeguards for consumer protection and financial stability,” Grayscale’s research team wrote. For Ripple, gaining OCC approval would mark a major shift in how stablecoins are supervised in the U.S., potentially making RLUSD one of the most regulated stablecoins on the market. While the outcome of the application is still pending, Ripple’s pursuit of a national charter reflects a growing trend among crypto firms seeking legitimacy and longevity within the U.S. financial system. Ripple’s Legal Setback Clouds Stablecoin Ambitions as Tech Upgrades Forge Ahead As Ripple seeks a U.S. banking license and works to expand its RLUSD stablecoin, the company faces renewed regulatory friction that could complicate its path forward. On June 26, Judge Analisa Torres rejected a proposed $50 million settlement between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which would have dissolved the standing injunction on institutional XRP sales. Judge Torres rejects Ripple's $50 million SEC settlement, maintaining permanent injunction blocking $XRP institutional sales despite both parties agreeing to penalty reduction. #Ripple #SEC #XRP https://t.co/KChkLc5Mdw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 Despite both sides agreeing to reduce the original $125 million penalty by 60%, the court found no “exceptional circumstances” to justify altering a final judgment. The decision leaves Ripple restricted from offering XRP to institutional clients, though retail trading remains unaffected. The legal standoff stems from the SEC’s 2020 lawsuit, which alleged Ripple raised $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. Following the ruling, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the company would drop its cross-appeal, adding that the SEC is also expected to withdraw its appeal. XRP rallied on Friday after Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the company is dropping its cross-appeal against the SEC. #XRP #SEC https://t.co/fXl2YbYWrt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 28, 2025 With litigation winding down, Ripple is turning its attention back to development. RippleX, the company’s tech arm, recently released XRP Ledger v2.5.0 , introducing upgrades designed for institutional use, including support for escrowed stablecoins (XLS-85) and complex transaction bundling (XLS-56). Daily active addresses on the network have surged from 35,000 to over 295,000 . Meanwhile, Ripple integrated Wormhole to connect its ecosystem with more than 35 blockchains, enhancing interoperability ahead of RLUSD’s debut.

OpenAI took to X to warn users that “these ‘OpenAI tokens’ are not OpenAI equity,” stressing that the firm had no role in the rollout, no partnership with Robinhood, and does not back the tokenized shares. Your “equity” is fake — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 2, 2025 The statement went on to note that any genuine transfer of OpenAI stock would need the company’s direct sign-off, something it did not grant, and urged investors to “please be careful.” Shortly after OpenAI’s warning, Elon Musk replied on X to the company’s post, writing, “Your ‘equity’ is fake,” further fueling debate over the legitimacy of tokenized shares. Robinhood unveiled the tokenized shares on Monday in Cannes, France, as part of a broader showcase of its plans in digital assets. The product launch, which also covered staking services and new blockchain infrastructure, helped lift Robinhood’s share price past the $100 mark, setting a fresh record. Robinhood defends tokenized shares as “indirect exposure” In a reply to OpenAI’s notice, a Robinhood spokesperson explained that the tokens offer “indirect exposure to private markets” for retail clients. They added that this access is made possible by “Robinhood’s ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle”. Under the new scheme, eligible users in the European Union who register to trade these tokenized equities by July 7 receive €5 worth of OpenAI and SpaceX tokens. These digital assets fall under Europe’s more flexible investor rules and trade on Robinhood’s crypto platform. Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of crypto at Robinhood, said the aim was to expand access and bring more people into private markets through tokenization. The incident underscores a clash between crypto platforms trying to make investing easier and the companies whose names and shares they’re turning into tokens. Investors in the United States remain barred from buying these tokens because of stricter domestic regulations. To date, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not given the green light for such products. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The trading platform has indicated that it is still on track to debut on the KOSDAQ exchange in the first half of 2026. However, South Korean market insiders are reportedly wary about lingering ownership questions ahead of the potential launch. Meanwhile, more domestic banks are joining a stablecoin alliance with a view to co-launching KRW-pegged tokens. Bithumb Spinoff Gets Green Light The South Korean media outlet News Tomato reported that Bithumb’s IPO process has now begun in earnest following a Supreme Court ruling that absolved the former Bithumb Holdings Chairman Lee Jung-hoon of fraud charges in March this year. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko) After the ruling, Bithumb asked the regulatory Financial Services Commission (FSC) to approve its spinoff plans in April. The FSC was not fully satisfied with the initial application, but Bithumb has since amended its application twice. At the end of June, the FSC finally gave its approval for a plan that will see Bithumb continue operating its existing exchange platform under its current name. New Firm Will Act as Holding Company The newly established corporation, tentatively named Bithumb A, will act as a holding company. It will also spearhead new Bithumb-related business investments. Bithumb has chosen Samsung Securities as its lead manager for the KOSDAQ listing. The company is currently completing due diligence protocols. South Korean lawmakers quiz Financial Services Commission (FSC) officials at a session in the National Assembly late last month. (Source: MBC/Screenshot) Bithumb explained that its “restructuring” would help optimize growth strategies for each of its business arms “by separating their functions.” The move will help Bithumb “secure agility in new business avenues,” the exchange claimed. However, the media outlet said that the market is “still cautious” about an “opaque governance structure” that “could undermine investor confidence.” Currently, Bithumb is owned by Bithumb Holdings, with the firms DAA, Vidente, and BTHMB all owning sizeable stakes. Other shareholders hold a 25.1% stake in the firm. However, the media outlet wrote that the “actual control structure” between these parties “has not been clearly revealed.” An unnamed domestic securities industry insider said that a “complex and opaque governance structure cannot help but promote anxiety among investors.” The insider said that if it wants to attract capital from external investors, Bithumb will need to demonstrate a “high level of transparency and social responsibility.” Busan Bank Joins Stablecoin Union Meanwhile, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that BNK Busan Bank announced on June 2 that it has officially joined the Stablecoin Division at the Open Blockchain/DID Association (OBDIA). The bank added that it has also begun conducting broad joint research projects focusing on stablecoins. OBDIA launched as a blockchain-focused non-profit organization in 2018. However, in April this year, the group experienced a new lease of life when it added a stablecoin subgroup. A slew of major banks have joined the division, including the high street heavyweights Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, Nonghyup, and IBK Industrial Bank. One of the nation's largest umbrella labor groups, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, said Wednesday it will stage a two-day, large-scale strike later this month to demand the government again push for a pro-labor act. https://t.co/U5CFKhuK2y — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) July 2, 2025 The neobank K Bank has also joined OBDIA, with its online rival Toss Bank also reportedly keen on becoming a member . Yonhap reported that Busan Bank plans to build a “digital currency model” that can be used on the South Korean market. The bank says that its experience of operating the blockchain-powered local stablecoin Dongbaekjeon will prove of great importance. A Busan Bank spokesperson explained: “Since stablecoin-related regulations are still in progress, we need to develop capabilities that let us respond to various scenarios with flexibility. We want to play a meaningful role [once the government] institutionalizes [stablecoins].” Lawmakers are pressing ahead with work on a bill that seeks to lay the groundwork for the issuance of private-sector stablecoins. The move will partially reverse a ban on all forms of token issuance that has been in place since 2019.

According to a crypto analyst, just 36 days of meaningful gains have defined this cycle, while the rest have been a relentless grind. Still, despite the clear market fatigue and repeated new lows, the analyst insists that the cycle isn’t over yet. Bitcoin Cycle Sees Only 36 Days Of Real Gains The current Bitcoin market cycle is being closely examined, as a new analysis by expert analyst Crypto Con delves deep into the cryptocurrency’s past movements, revealing two full years of sideways price action with only brief periods of upward momentum. The analyst’s chart, titled “Cycle 4 Ranges and Expansions,” highlights a pattern of prolonged range-bound activity interrupted by short bursts of expansion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move As of now, Crypto Con notes that Bitcoin has been consolidating for 195 consecutive days since December 18, 2024, without setting a new local high. The chart analysis shows that the total time spent in actual upward expansion in the entire cycle is just 5.76 months. Even more interesting is the fact that when isolating the days in which Bitcoin recorded new local highs, the number shrinks to just 36 days. According to the market expert, these expansion bursts are responsible for all of Bitcoin’s significant price increases during its current cycle. Every expansion phase has also occurred within extremely narrow windows—typically just two to five days long. The rest of the cycle after this has been characterized by a consistent sluggish grind and long stretches of price consolidation, where momentum fades and the market struggles to advance. Flattened Price Action Hides Cycles’ Underlying Strength A closer look at the bottom section of Crypto Con’s chart, which removes the expansion bursts, shows how Bitcoin’s price has essentially remained flat or trended lower throughout the cycle. Major sideways phases in 2023 and 2024 lasted 192 days and 238 days, respectively, offering minimum sustained upside. The current 2025 range has now extended close to 200 days, continuing the trend of market inactivity. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Despite the drawn-out stagnation, Crypto Con maintains that this cycle is not over yet. He implies that Bitcoin’s prolonged accumulation and consolidation could be building pressure for a significant breakout. The chart also shows Bitcoin’s next potential upside target between $165,000 and $180,000. Currently the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $106,990, meaning a jump anywhere between these targets would represent price increase of over 54%. If previous patterns hold, BTC’s next major move may arrive swiftly, as past expansions have delivered their impact in just a few trading sessions. Until that moment arrives, Bitcoin remains locked in what is shaping up to be the slowest and possibly the most patient-testing cycle to date.

Solana (SOL) , Ripple (XRP) , and Dogecoin (DOGE) are all trading within tight technical ranges, suggesting a major move could be imminent. Yet while these large-cap assets await catalysts, market capital is already shifting toward earlier-stage opportunities. One project now drawing accelerated attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE —an altcoin in its early fundraising phase that appears to be capturing investor interest with speed and scale. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Early-Stage Appeal Amid ETF Distractions While XRP headlines highlight ETF developments, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly tapping into a very different source of momentum. Built around political energy and viral market narratives, this token is not trying to compete on technology—it’s built for culture-first positioning and speculative community upside. With a fixed token supply, no VC allocation, and rapid sell-outs in earlier allocation rounds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a go-to option for traders seeking 20x to 30x return potential. Bonus incentives during the presale have further incentivized early participation, driving strong wallet activity and capital inflows. Analysts watching altcoin rotations note that this cycle may favor projects with grassroots appeal, simple tokenomics, and timing advantage. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that profile—offering retail traders a chance to enter before listings or staking features take effect. Solana Holds Ground Ahead of Potential Breakout Solana remains in a holding pattern, compressing beneath key resistance zones. Despite consistent on-chain growth—including news of Nasdaq ambitions via Sol Strategies—price action has yet to confirm a breakout. Long-term metrics like validator income, application usage, and developer participation remain positive. But short-term traders are waiting for technical validation. Until then, some are reallocating capital to opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE , where the upside window appears more immediate. XRP Pressured by Profit-Taking Despite Legal Optimism XRP is maintaining strength above its $2.10 support zone , buoyed by improved regulatory sentiment and new developments such as Canada’s launch of the first XRP spot ETF. Yet price action remains range-bound, constrained by overhead resistance caused by recent profit-taking. While long-term sentiment is bullish—especially with ETF discussions gaining steam—traders say the next major catalyst must arrive before any significant price movement occurs. For now, attention is drifting toward smaller-cap tokens with cleaner breakout setups. DOGE Coils Inside Symmetrical Triangle Formation Dogecoin is showing signs of energy buildup, currently trading within a symmetrical triangle—typically a precursor to a high-volatility move. Technical analysts predict a 60% swing in either direction once the pattern resolves. Accumulation is occurring at lower levels, but with few major headlines and broader macro uncertainties, some DOGE holders are exploring newer assets offering faster ROI potential. In this environment, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting crossover interest from meme traders. Final Take: Where Capital is Flowing Ahead of Q3 While Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin each remain relevant for long-term positioning, their current stagnation has created room for other assets to step into the spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the few early-phase tokens gaining serious traction with clear upside structures and strong momentum.

Just recently, an intriguing event unfolded: an anonymous crypto whale, identified by the address starting with 0x859e, executed a substantial deposit of 35 million H tokens, valued at an impressive $2.7 million, into various exchanges. This significant movement occurred roughly 12 hours ago, coinciding with an extraordinary 78% price surge for the H token over the past 24 hours, as reported by Lookonchain on X. What does this mean for the H token’s future, and what can we learn from such a powerful display of market influence? H Token’s Meteoric Rise: What’s Driving the Momentum? The recent price action of the H token has been nothing short of spectacular. A 78% surge in just 24 hours is a rare feat, even in the volatile crypto markets. This dramatic increase immediately draws attention to the asset and prompts questions about its underlying drivers. While the anonymous whale’s deposit to exchanges might suggest a selling intention, the coinciding price surge paints a more complex picture. Could this be a strategic move to capitalize on the rally, or perhaps an attempt to inject liquidity into the market? Understanding the dynamics of such a rapid ascent is crucial for anyone watching this space. It highlights the often-unpredictable nature of digital assets, where a single large transaction can send ripples throughout the ecosystem. Unpacking the Mystery of the Anonymous Whale The term ‘ anonymous whale ‘ conjures images of powerful, unseen entities shaping market tides, and for good reason. These are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing prices with their large transactions. The address 0x859e, with its $2.7 million deposit of H tokens, perfectly fits this description. But why would an anonymous whale move such a significant sum to exchanges, especially during a price surge? Common reasons include: Profit-Taking: Cashing out a portion of their holdings after a significant price increase. Liquidity Provision: Making tokens available for trading, potentially to facilitate market activity. Strategic Rebalancing: Adjusting their portfolio composition. Signaling: Unintentionally (or intentionally) signaling market sentiment, which others might interpret as a bullish or bearish sign. The sheer size of this deposit demands attention, as it has the potential to either absorb buy pressure or trigger a sell-off, depending on the whale’s ultimate intentions. Such movements are closely watched by traders and analysts seeking an edge in predicting future price action. Understanding Broader Crypto Whale Activity and Its Market Impact This incident isn’t isolated; crypto whale activity is a constant factor in the digital asset landscape. Large transactions, whether deposits to exchanges, withdrawals to cold storage, or transfers between wallets, often precede significant market shifts. When whales deposit tokens to exchanges, it’s typically interpreted as a bearish signal, as it suggests an intent to sell. However, in the case of H token, the concurrent price surge adds a layer of intrigue. Could this be a ‘sell the news’ event in the making, or is the market strong enough to absorb such a large influx of tokens without a significant correction? The impact of whale movements extends beyond immediate price changes; they can influence market sentiment, liquidity, and even the perceived stability of a token. Tracking these powerful players provides valuable insights into potential market trends and risks. Navigating the Volatile Token Price Surge: What Comes Next? The 78% token price surge for H token is undoubtedly exciting for holders, but it also raises important questions about sustainability. Rapid price increases often lead to corrections as early investors take profits. While the whale deposit might be a factor in this, other elements could also contribute to such a dramatic rise, including: Positive News or Developments: Underlying project updates, partnerships, or roadmap milestones. Increased Retail Interest: Growing hype and speculative buying from smaller investors. Technical Breakouts: Surpassing key resistance levels that trigger further buying. For investors considering H token, understanding the potential for volatility is key. While the surge is impressive, a significant deposit from a whale, especially amid such gains, can also signal a potential inflection point. Monitoring subsequent price action and market sentiment will be crucial to discern if this surge is sustainable or if a retracement is on the horizon. The Strategic Role of Jump Trading Crypto in the Ecosystem Adding another layer to this unfolding story is the mention of Jump Trading crypto . As a strategic investor and market maker for H token, Jump Trading’s involvement is significant. Market makers play a crucial role in providing liquidity and ensuring orderly trading conditions. They buy and sell assets to facilitate transactions, often profiting from the bid-ask spread. Lookonchain noted that Jump Trading had previously received 25 million H tokens at launch and later transferred 8 million tokens to exchanges. This historical context suggests that Jump Trading, like the anonymous whale, is active in managing its H token holdings on exchanges. Their presence as a market maker could influence how the market absorbs large deposits, potentially mitigating extreme volatility by providing counter-liquidity. Their past actions and current role make them a key player to watch in the H token saga. Actionable Insights for H Token Holders and Crypto Enthusiasts In a market as dynamic as cryptocurrency, understanding these large movements is paramount. For those holding H tokens or considering an investment, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue monitoring on-chain data and news sources like Lookonchain for further whale movements or project updates. Assess Risk: Recognize that a rapid price surge, especially one coinciding with large whale deposits, can increase volatility and the potential for corrections. Diversify: Avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly volatile asset. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on whale movements. Investigate the H token project’s fundamentals, team, technology, and community strength. The crypto market is a continuous learning curve, and observing the interplay between whales, market makers, and price action offers invaluable lessons. A Final Thought: Riding the Waves of Crypto Volatility The anonymous whale’s $2.7 million deposit of H tokens into exchanges, against the backdrop of a staggering 78% price surge, underscores the thrilling and often perplexing nature of the cryptocurrency market. It’s a reminder that large players hold significant sway, and their moves can dramatically influence market sentiment and price. While the immediate implications of this specific deposit remain to be fully seen, it undoubtedly adds another chapter to the compelling narrative of H token. As always, vigilance, informed decision-making, and a keen eye on market dynamics are your best allies in navigating these exciting but unpredictable waters.

Market participants are closely monitoring developments as analysts suggest that regulatory clarity could open the door for broader adoption and significant price gains. Legal Milestone Nears Completion Ripple recently announced it will no longer pursue a cross-appeal in its legal dispute with the SEC, opting instead to accept the $125 million penalty originally imposed. This development is seen by many as an attempt by Ripple to finalize the matter and redirect its efforts toward expansion. Industry observers now expect the SEC to follow suit and drop its remaining appeal. Further fueling expectations of an imminent resolution is a closed SEC meeting scheduled for July 3 , which some believe may signal the end of the case. Although XRP itself was declared not to be a security in a 2023 ruling, the legal process has continued to cast uncertainty over Ripple and its associated ecosystem. A complete settlement could eliminate remaining concerns and support renewed interest, particularly from U.S.-based institutions that have so far remained cautious. Institutional Engagement Hinges on Regulatory Clarity The anticipation surrounding the case’s conclusion has revived conversations about XRP’s long-term prospects. Financial analysts argue that an end to the legal proceedings could encourage institutional players to engage with Ripple and its products more openly. For instance, Nasdaq contributor Trevor Jennewine speculated earlier this year that the conclusion of the SEC lawsuit could create favourable conditions for asset managers considering XRP-based investment products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While there has been speculation around firms such as BlackRock potentially entering the space, no such move has been confirmed. However, analysts suggest that legal certainty would be a key factor in unlocking this type of institutional participation. Projected Price Growth Post-Litigation To explore possible outcomes for XRP’s valuation following a favourable legal resolution, a price projection was generated using ChatGPT. At the time of the analysis, XRP was trading at approximately $2.21. Assuming significant institutional adoption and increased usage of Ripple’s payment solutions, the AI model estimated that XRP could reach between $8 and $15 within one year of a final legal settlement. The projection was based on the premise that regulatory clarity could lead not only to investor confidence but also to practical use cases for XRP, such as cross-border payments and institutional settlements. This anticipated increase in demand could contribute to a meaningful appreciation in price. The AI model also highlighted that XRP has previously approached $3 during major bull runs in 2017 and 2021, even without legal or institutional backing. With these elements potentially in place after the case concludes, a higher price range supported by real-world adoption appears more plausible.

A recent update from South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit , has caught the attention of many, particularly those holding Hippo Protocol (HP) tokens. This isn’t just a routine notice; it’s a critical heads-up for anyone involved with HP, indicating a temporary halt in services that impacts the flow of assets. Why is Upbit Suspending HP Deposits and Withdrawals? Upbit , one of Asia’s leading cryptocurrency trading platforms, officially announced a temporary suspension of both deposits and withdrawals for Hippo Protocol (HP). This measure is set to begin on July 14, 2024, at 06:00 UTC . The reason behind this significant operational change is a planned network upgrade for the Hippo Protocol blockchain. Such upgrades are a common, yet vital, part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, designed to enhance the underlying technology of a digital asset. Key details to note regarding this suspension include: Asset Affected: Hippo Protocol (HP) Service Impacted: Deposits and Withdrawals Start Date and Time: July 14, 2024, 06:00 UTC Reason: Hippo Protocol network upgrade Trading Status: Trading of HP on Upbit is expected to continue as usual during this period, but users will not be able to move HP in or out of the exchange. It’s important for users to understand that while this may cause a temporary inconvenience, it is a standard procedure undertaken by exchanges to ensure the security and stability of assets during significant blockchain developments. The exchange emphasizes that users should monitor their official announcements for updates on when these services will resume. Understanding the Hippo Protocol Network Upgrade For those unfamiliar, Hippo Protocol aims to provide decentralized financial solutions, often focusing on specific use cases within the blockchain space. Like any evolving technology, blockchain networks require periodic maintenance and enhancements. A network upgrade typically involves implementing new features, improving scalability, patching security vulnerabilities, or optimizing performance. These upgrades are crucial for the long-term health and competitiveness of any blockchain project. When a blockchain undergoes an upgrade, it often requires a temporary halt in transactions or specific services from supporting platforms like crypto exchanges. This ensures that all data is correctly migrated, and the new network operates smoothly without any discrepancies or loss of funds. For Hippo Protocol, this upgrade signifies a commitment to improving its infrastructure, which could lead to better efficiency, lower transaction costs, or enhanced functionalities for its users in the future. What This Means for Upbit Users and the Crypto Exchange Landscape For Upbit users holding HP, the primary implication is the inability to initiate HP deposits or withdrawals during the specified timeframe. This means if you planned to move HP from an external wallet to Upbit, or vice-versa, you will need to complete these transactions before July 14, 06:00 UTC, or wait until the suspension is lifted. While trading activities are generally unaffected during such suspensions, the lack of deposit/withdrawal options can impact liquidity for some users who rely on external transfers. From a broader perspective, this incident highlights a common operational practice within the crypto exchange industry. Exchanges frequently suspend services for specific tokens during network forks, upgrades, or critical maintenance events. This proactive approach helps prevent potential issues like transaction failures, loss of funds, or discrepancies in account balances that could arise from interacting with a network in transition. It underscores the responsibility exchanges bear in safeguarding user assets and maintaining the integrity of their platforms. Actionable Insights for HP Holders If you are an HP holder, here are some actionable insights to consider: Plan Ahead: If you need to make any HP deposits or withdrawals to or from Upbit, ensure you complete them well before the July 14, 06:00 UTC deadline. Monitor Upbit Announcements: Keep a close eye on Upbit’s official website or announcement channels. They will provide updates on the progress of the network upgrade and when deposit and withdrawal services for HP will resume. Understand Trading vs. Transfers: Remember that the suspension typically only affects transfers (deposits and withdrawals), not necessarily trading. You may still be able to buy or sell HP on Upbit’s spot market during this period, but verify this on their platform. No Need to Panic: Temporary suspensions for network upgrades are routine and do not imply any issues with the security of your funds on the exchange. Your HP assets held within Upbit are safe. By taking these steps, you can minimize any potential disruption to your cryptocurrency management strategy and ensure a smooth experience during this necessary upgrade period. Conclusion The temporary suspension of Hippo Protocol (HP) deposits and withdrawals by Upbit on July 14 is a proactive measure taken in response to a critical network upgrade . This highlights the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the continuous efforts required to maintain and enhance its underlying infrastructure. For users, understanding these announcements and planning accordingly is key to navigating the crypto landscape effectively. While it may cause a brief pause in certain activities, it ultimately contributes to the long-term stability and improved functionality of the Hippo Protocol and the broader crypto exchange ecosystem.

His opinion contrasts with Russia’s push to implement the digital ruble , with the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) mandating that banks offer digital ruble payment options by September 1, 2026. Gref struggles to see how digital currencies benefit Russia On Wednesday, German Gref, CEO of Russia’s dominant lender Sberbank , stated that he was having trouble seeing any potential benefits to Russia developing the digital ruble, except for cross-border settlements. According to the central bank last week, Russian banks will have to offer customers the means to make payments with digital rubles from September 1, 2026, postponing the project’s planned launch by over a year. Russia’s interest in the digital ruble comes at a time when over 130 countries are exploring digital versions of their currencies as the world’s financial authorities grapple with declining cash usage and the very real threat to their money-printing powers from new developments like Bitcoin. Moscow will be banking on the digital ruble to simplify foreign trade payments that have been complicated by Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine. However Gref is having trouble getting onboard. “I don’t see its advantages,” he told reporters at the financial forum in St. Petersburg. “As an individual, I don’t understand why digital rubles are needed. As a bank… I don’t yet understand it very well either.” Gref highlighted how Russian banks already have strong digital finance capacities, including cashless settlements, before reiterating that he could see no future in which the digital ruble meaningfully transforms Russia’s economy. No digital currency has become dominant within any country, he pointed out, but there could be a future in cross-border settlements. “Domestically, I don’t see it yet,” he said. Other countries are exploring digital currencies As things stand, over one hundred countries and currency unions are seriously considering CBDCs as an answer to various factors, including declining cash use and diversion to cryptocurrencies. Countries like the Bahamas and Jamaica already have their own CBDCs, while others like China, Brazil, India, and Hong Kong have launched CBDC pilot programs. China leads with the largest CBDC pilot, with 260 million people across multiple cities since 2020. Today, its CBDC is used in over 200 retail scenarios and is being pushed for cross-border payments to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Russia’s digital ruble launched its pilot in August 2023 with 15 banks and 9,000 participants as of October 2024. Even though Gref finds it hard to see why Russia needs a digital ruble, there is no doubt it will come in handy where cross-border payments are concerned, especially under sanctions, to bypass systems like SWIFT. In the US, the Federal Reserve has been researching CBDCs, with a focus on improving the domestic payment system. Unfortunately, the chances of the US creating a retail CBDC is almost nonexistent thanks to a May 2024 House bill which prohibits direct issuance as well as President Trump’s executive order banning CBDCs. Instead, the United States is in different stages of passing stablecoin legislation, including the CLARITY, GENIUS and STABLE Acts.

The market expects this to be yet another highly anticipated IPO for 2025, after a failed acquisition by Adobe a few years ago. Cloud-Based Platform With Plans To Go Public Founded in 2012 by a computer scientist and graphics designer, the San Francisco-based company has filed for a public offering with the ticker “FIG”. The idea behind the project was for anyone to “be creative by making free, simple & imaginative tools in a browser”. It seems that it quickly caught on, as just the following year, they secured $3.8 million in seed funding from Index Ventures and Terrence Rohan. From December 2015 to May 2021, the company raised an additional $129 million through A, B, C, and D-series funding, and its total valuation skyrocketed to $10 billion. A series E funding of $200 million was raised in June 2021. Their revenue over the years has not been any less impressive, with the S-1 form stating $749M by the end of 2024, which was a 48% YoY (year-over-year) increase compared to 2023. Some of the names they work with include ServiceNow, Netflix, Airbnb, Stripe, Mercado Libre, AWS, HP, etc. However, they are not exclusive to big businesses, as the services they offer cater to freelancers, solo founders, creative studios, and other small businesses. A Leap Forward After a Step Back The success of Figma was noticed by a big name in the design space – Adobe. In fact, they were so interested, they proposed a deal in September 2022 to buy them for $20 billion. “Adobe’s greatness has been rooted in our ability to create new categories and deliver cutting-edge technologies through organic innovation and inorganic acquisitions,” said Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen. “The combination of Adobe and Figma is transformational and will accelerate our vision for collaborative creativity.” However, this deal was not widely accepted, as some viewed it as overvalued and potentially anticompetitive, given that the site was in direct competition with Adobe’s product, Adobe XD. In February 2023, it was announced that the European Commission would review the deal under the European Union merger laws. Later that same year, Adobe and Figma announced that the merger would be disbanded , as there was “no clear path to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the EU Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority.” A $1 billion reverse breakup fee was paid by Adobe to Figma, which was part of their initial agreement. Fast forward to today, the company is still thriving, as evident in the numbers it has presented over the years, and its intention to go public on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bitcoin Treasury Trend Continues Figma is another in a now lengthy line of establishments that have announced they hold BTC. As CryptoPotato reported , interest from corporations in the asset shows no signs of slowing down. For a third consecutive quarter, companies have outpaced the purchases of Bitcoin from exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 141 public and 42 private companies now collectively hold 5.7% of the total circulating supply, while ETFs and other funds hold approximately 7%, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. This direction has been reinforced by the regulatory changes that have brought ease to the crypto world, as CNBC noted , under the Trump administration.

The latest buzz comes from Binance Alpha, a specialized platform within the broader Binance ecosystem, which recently announced the addition of ECHO. This development signals a fascinating opportunity for those interested in the very first steps of promising digital assets. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does It Matter? Binance Alpha serves as an innovative launchpad for early-stage crypto projects, offering them visibility within the vast Binance Wallet ecosystem. It’s not just a directory; it’s a curated space designed to showcase tokens that have already demonstrated significant community engagement and are aligned with emerging market trends. Think of it as a preliminary stage, a proving ground where nascent projects can gain initial exposure and gather momentum without the immediate pressure of a full exchange listing. The primary goal of Binance Alpha is to connect the Binance community with innovative projects at their earliest stages. This provides a unique advantage for users who are keen to explore and potentially support the next big thing in crypto. For the projects themselves, inclusion on Alpha means access to a massive user base and valuable feedback, even if it doesn’t guarantee a future on the main exchange. The Significance of ECHO Crypto ‘s Inclusion The recent announcement via New Listings Feed that ECHO crypto has joined the ranks of projects featured on Binance Alpha is certainly noteworthy. While specific details about the ECHO project itself were not provided in the initial news, its selection by Binance Alpha indicates it has met certain criteria, particularly in terms of community interest and alignment with current market narratives. For any ECHO crypto enthusiast, this inclusion represents a significant milestone, offering a degree of validation and increased visibility within the broader crypto landscape. This early exposure can be a game-changer for projects like ECHO, allowing them to build a stronger community, refine their offerings, and potentially attract further investment. It’s a testament to the project’s foundational strength and its ability to resonate with a segment of the crypto audience. Navigating Early-Stage Crypto Projects : Opportunities and Risks Investing in early-stage crypto projects comes with a unique blend of excitement and inherent risk. On one hand, the potential for exponential returns can be immense. Getting in early on a project that eventually achieves widespread adoption can yield life-changing gains. These projects often represent cutting-edge innovation, solving real-world problems or introducing novel blockchain applications. However, the landscape of early-stage crypto projects is also fraught with challenges. Many projects fail due to technical issues, lack of adoption, market volatility, or even outright scams. Liquidity can be low, making it difficult to buy or sell significant amounts without impacting the price. Therefore, thorough due diligence is not just recommended; it’s absolutely essential. Investors should research the team, technology, use case, tokenomics, and community support before committing any capital. How Does Binance Wallet Play a Role in This Ecosystem? The integration of Binance Alpha within the Binance Wallet is a strategic move that streamlines access for users. For millions of crypto users worldwide, Binance Wallet is a primary gateway to managing their digital assets. By housing Binance Alpha directly within this familiar environment, Binance makes it incredibly easy for users to discover and interact with these promising early-stage projects. This seamless integration lowers the barrier to entry for exploration, allowing users to move from discovering a project to potentially interacting with its token without leaving the Binance ecosystem. This accessibility provided by Binance Wallet is crucial for fostering growth in the nascent stages of a project’s lifecycle. It provides a direct channel for projects to reach a highly engaged audience, fostering community growth and potential early adoption, which are vital for long-term success. Understanding Crypto Listings : Alpha vs. Main Exchange It is crucial for the crypto community to understand the distinction between inclusion on Binance Alpha and a full-fledged listing on the main Binance exchange. While being featured on Alpha is a positive step for any project, it explicitly does not guarantee a future listing on the larger exchange. The criteria for main crypto listings are far more stringent, typically involving higher liquidity requirements, proven market demand, robust security audits, and a well-established user base. Binance Alpha acts more as a discovery platform, a place where projects can prove their mettle and build their case for potential future consideration. A main exchange listing opens the floodgates to significantly larger trading volumes, broader institutional interest, and deeper liquidity. For projects like ECHO, a successful stint on Binance Alpha could pave the way, but it’s a journey that requires continued development, community growth, and adherence to evolving market standards. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Crypto Enthusiast Research Deeply: Don’t just follow the hype. Understand what ECHO (or any early-stage project) aims to achieve, its technology, its team, and its tokenomics.

Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) remain two of the most recognized altcoins in the ecosystem, but both face short-term hurdles that are causing traders to explore fresh opportunities. One such opportunity now gaining traction is MAGACOIN FINANCE —an early-stage project showing signs of breakout interest as the rotation toward ROI-driven plays intensifies. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Ground With a Structured Growth Approach With many high-cap tokens trading sideways, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a strategic target for investors looking to position early before major market expansion. The project’s disciplined rollout and scarcity-based token structure have already made it a favorite among presale-stage trackers. Earlier funding rounds sold out quickly, reflecting a high level of concentrated interest from informed traders who see momentum before the masses. The project’s milestones are structured to drive continued engagement, and analysts are closely watching how its community and capital traction evolve during this accumulation phase. XRP Stalls as Legal Developments Enter Holding Phase Ripple’s legal drama with the U.S. SEC once served as a price driver, but the current legal schedule has slowed to procedural updates. While the agreement on a $50 million reduced settlement and lifted restrictions on institutional XRP sales are positive developments, final approval is still pending. Meanwhile, Canada’s Purpose XRP ETF has given the asset new credibility in traditional finance. However, technical analysis shows XRP locked in a narrow price band, lacking the momentum needed for significant upside. Many investors who expected rapid returns following legal progress are beginning to redirect their capital into more agile, fast-moving tokens. Ethereum’s Fundamentals Are Strong, But Price Action Remains Flat Ethereum’s upcoming Fusaka upgrade , designed to enhance scalability and efficiency, is moving toward late-stage testing. Institutional ETH staking and ETF inflows continue to rise, further validating Ethereum as a long-term asset. Still, price action has yet to reflect these developments. Ethereum is holding its range, and despite the ongoing protocol advancements, many short-term traders are moving into lower-cap assets that offer more immediate performance. In short, ETH remains a foundational holding—but for those looking to maximize Q3 ROI, it’s no longer the primary focus. Final Thought: Capital Is Seeking Acceleration XRP and Ethereum continue to serve as pillars in the altcoin market, but their paths to growth appear slow and steady at best in the current cycle. For traders seeking sharper upside in shorter windows, attention is turning elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting from that shift. With its presale allocations selling out, narrative-driven appeal, and community enthusiasm, it’s becoming one of the few new projects positioned to take advantage of this capital rotation.

For years, the crypto space has been characterized by rapid innovation, but also by periods of uncertainty and volatility, often exacerbated by a lack of consistent rules. Now, a new chapter is unfolding, particularly in Europe, where the landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation is setting a new global standard. This isn’t just about compliance; it’s about legitimizing the industry, fostering trust, and opening doors for mainstream adoption. In a truly groundbreaking move, two of the industry’s titans, Bybit and OKX, are seizing this opportunity, strategically launching fully compliant, regulated crypto exchanges under the EU’s comprehensive MiCA framework. This isn’t merely an expansion; it’s a profound declaration of confidence in a regulated future for the European crypto market . Understanding the Power of MiCA Regulation : What Does It Mean for Crypto? Before diving into the specifics of Bybit and OKX’s strategic maneuvers, it’s crucial to grasp the monumental significance of the MiCA Regulation itself. Approved by the European Parliament in April 2023 and gradually coming into full effect by the end of 2024, MiCA is a first-of-its-kind comprehensive regulatory framework designed specifically for crypto-assets. Its primary goals are multifaceted: Harmonization: To create a unified set of rules across all 27 EU member states, eliminating the fragmented regulatory landscape that previously existed. This means that a crypto-asset service provider (CASP) licensed in one EU country can “passport” its services across the entire European Economic Area (EEA). Consumer Protection: To safeguard investors by requiring crypto-asset issuers and service providers to meet stringent transparency, disclosure, and operational resilience standards. This includes rules around market manipulation, insider trading, and clear communication with users. Market Integrity: To ensure stable and orderly markets by imposing requirements on stablecoins and other asset-referenced tokens, demanding sufficient reserves and robust governance. Innovation with Oversight: To foster innovation within the crypto space while mitigating risks, striking a balance between promoting new technologies and protecting financial stability. For the first time, crypto companies operating within the EU will have a clear rulebook, providing the legal certainty that has long been absent. This clarity is a game-changer, not just for the companies themselves, but for institutional investors and traditional financial players who have been hesitant to enter the crypto space due to regulatory ambiguity. The introduction of MiCA Regulation is a clear signal that Europe is serious about integrating digital assets into its financial system, but on its own terms: with robust oversight and consumer safety at its core. Why Bybit EU and OKX France are Leading the Charge in Europe The strategic decisions by Bybit and OKX to establish regulated operations within the EU under MiCA are highly calculated and indicative of a forward-looking approach. These aren’t random choices; they reflect a deep understanding of the regulatory landscape and the immense potential of the unified European market. Bybit’s Move into Austria: Bybit has secured a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license in Austria, positioning itself to serve the broader EU market from a strategically central location. Austria, while perhaps not the first country that comes to mind for crypto, offers a stable regulatory environment and serves as an excellent gateway. This move allows Bybit to leverage the MiCA passporting rights, enabling it to offer its services legally across the entire European Economic Area (EEA) once MiCA is fully implemented. This isn’t just about gaining a license; it’s about building a foundation of trust and compliance that resonates with both retail and institutional clients. OKX’s Launch in France: Meanwhile, OKX has chosen France as its regulated platform base. France has been particularly proactive in establishing its own crypto regulatory framework, even before MiCA’s full implementation, signaling a welcoming environment for compliant crypto businesses. This proactive stance, coupled with France’s significant economic influence within the EU, makes it an attractive hub for OKX. By securing a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) registration with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), OKX demonstrates its commitment to adhering to the highest standards of regulation, paving the way for its MiCA compliance. These moves are driven by several key motivations: Market Access: The EU represents a massive, affluent market with over 450 million consumers. Being able to operate seamlessly across this bloc is a significant competitive advantage. Building Trust: Operating under a recognized regulatory framework like MiCA significantly enhances an exchange’s credibility and trustworthiness in the eyes of users, partners, and financial institutions. Competitive Edge: As the regulatory landscape matures, exchanges that embrace compliance early will be better positioned to attract new users and institutional capital, leaving less compliant players at a disadvantage. Long-Term Vision: Bybit and OKX are clearly playing the long game, recognizing that a regulated future is the only sustainable path for major crypto entities. The establishment of Bybit EU and OKX France platforms are not just operational milestones; they are strategic declarations of intent to dominate a future where regulatory adherence is paramount. The Rise of Regulated Crypto Exchanges : A New Era of Trust? The launches by Bybit and OKX are symptomatic of a larger, undeniable trend: the maturation of the crypto industry through regulation. For years, the crypto market was often dubbed the “Wild West,” characterized by decentralization, innovation, but also by a lack of oversight that led to significant risks for investors. The collapse of major platforms like FTX and Terra/Luna underscored the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks. The emergence of regulated crypto exchanges signals a new era – one built on trust, transparency, and accountability. But what does this mean in practical terms? Feature Unregulated Exchanges (Past/Some Current) Regulated Exchanges (Under MiCA) User Protection Minimal or non-existent; high risk of fraud, hacks, and platform insolvency. Robust consumer protection, clear complaint mechanisms, segregation of client funds, capital requirements. Market Integrity Prone to manipulation, insider trading, and lack of transparent pricing. Strict rules against market abuse, transparent trading practices, clear disclosure requirements for issuers. Operational Standards Vary widely; often opaque, lacking clear security protocols or financial audits. Mandatory robust IT security, operational resilience, regular audits, fit and proper requirements for management. Legal Recourse Limited or non-existent across borders. Clear legal frameworks for disputes, access to regulatory authorities for complaints. Institutional Adoption Extremely low due to perceived risk and lack of compliance. Significantly higher interest from traditional finance due to reduced risk and clear legal standing. While some argue that regulation stifles innovation, the consensus among industry leaders is that sensible regulation is essential for long-term growth and mainstream acceptance. It provides the necessary guardrails for the industry to mature, attract more sophisticated investors, and ultimately offer safer and more reliable services to a broader audience. The move towards regulated crypto exchanges is not just a trend; it’s an evolutionary step that promises to redefine the landscape of digital assets. Navigating the European Crypto Market : Opportunities and Challenges Ahead With MiCA firmly in place and major players like Bybit and OKX setting up shop, the European crypto market is poised for unprecedented growth and transformation. The opportunities are vast, but so are the challenges. Opportunities: Unleashed Innovation: While regulation brings structure, it also provides a clear sandbox for innovation. Projects and companies now know the rules of engagement, allowing them to build and launch with greater confidence. This could lead to a surge in new compliant products and services. Mainstream Adoption: With enhanced consumer protection and regulatory clarity, more traditional financial institutions, corporations, and retail investors who were previously wary will likely enter the market. This influx of capital and participation can significantly expand the market size. Global Leadership: Europe has positioned itself as a global leader in crypto regulation. This proactive stance could attract top talent and businesses, making the EU a premier hub for crypto innovation and investment. Interoperability: A harmonized framework fosters greater interoperability between different crypto services and traditional financial systems within the EU, streamlining processes and reducing friction. Challenges: Compliance Burden: While beneficial, achieving and maintaining MiCA compliance is a significant undertaking. It requires substantial investment in legal, technical, and operational infrastructure, which can be particularly challenging for smaller players. Interpretation and Enforcement: While MiCA provides a unified framework, there will inevitably be nuances in its interpretation and enforcement across different national competent authorities within the EU. Companies will need to navigate these subtle differences. Keeping Pace with Technology: The crypto space evolves at breakneck speed. Regulators will face the ongoing challenge of adapting MiCA to new innovations like DeFi protocols, NFTs, and evolving tokenomics, which may not fit neatly into existing definitions. Competition: The clear regulatory environment will attract more players, intensifying competition among crypto exchanges and service providers for market share. Despite these challenges, the net effect of MiCA on the European crypto market is overwhelmingly positive. It’s setting the stage for a more mature, stable, and globally competitive digital asset ecosystem. What’s Next for Crypto in Europe? Actionable Insights The entry of Bybit and OKX into the regulated European market under MiCA is more than just news; it’s a blueprint for the future. For various stakeholders, there are clear takeaways and actionable insights: For Crypto Users: This is excellent news for your safety and confidence. Prioritize using exchanges that are MiCA-compliant or have clear pathways to compliance. These platforms offer greater protection against fraud, hacks, and insolvency. Always verify an exchange’s regulatory status before depositing funds. For Crypto Projects and Startups: Embrace compliance from day one. Building your project with MiCA requirements in mind will give you a significant advantage when seeking funding or aiming for market entry in Europe. Seek legal counsel early to understand how your token or service fits within the MiCA framework. For Traditional Financial Institutions: The reduced regulatory risk under MiCA makes the European crypto market a much more attractive proposition for investment and integration. Explore partnerships with compliant crypto exchanges and service providers to tap into this rapidly growing asset class. For Regulators Globally: Europe has set a precedent. Other major jurisdictions, including the US and Asia, are closely watching MiCA’s implementation. It is highly probable that elements of MiCA will serve as a model for future global crypto regulations, pushing for a more harmonized international approach. The journey towards a fully regulated and globally integrated crypto market is ongoing, but Europe, with MiCA as its guiding star, is leading the charge. The strategic moves by Bybit and OKX are not just about their individual growth; they are symbolic of the industry’s collective pivot towards a future where trust, transparency, and robust regulatory oversight are the pillars of success. In conclusion, the launches of MiCA-compliant platforms by Bybit and OKX are pivotal moments for the cryptocurrency industry. They signify a definitive shift towards a more regulated, secure, and mature digital asset landscape in Europe. As the European crypto market continues to evolve under the clear guidance of MiCA Regulation, we can anticipate increased institutional adoption, enhanced consumer confidence, and a new wave of innovation built on solid regulatory foundations. This is not merely an adaptation to new rules; it is a strategic embrace of a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the global financial ecosystem, promising stability and sustained growth for all participants.

Some investors aim to generate long-term wealth through consistent contributions, hoping to retire earlier than traditional financial paths would allow. One such strategy is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) , which involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This approach is popular among those who prioritize long-term growth over short-term volatility. But how effective would this strategy have been if applied to XRP over the past decade? Evaluating a Long-Term DCA Strategy in XRP To assess this, we analyzed what the outcome would be if an investor had contributed $100 each week to XRP starting from May 2015 through June 2025. The total capital invested during these ten years would amount to $53,600. According to data from Uphold’s DCA calculator, the value of this investment as of June 2025 would be approximately $3,588,980. This represents a return of about 6,595%. Such growth places XRP among the assets that, despite periods of uncertainty, have provided significant long-term returns to disciplined investors. While the outcome is impressive, the question remains: would this be sufficient to retire? According to a 2019 report , Americans spent around $1,497 per month on non-essential expenses like coffee, entertainment, apps, and subscription boxes, roughly $374.25 each week. Had an individual allocated just $100 of that weekly spending toward XRP beginning in 2015, the outcome could have been significantly different. Retirement Viability The ability to retire with a $3.58 million portfolio depends on various elements, including age, cost of living, lifestyle expectations, and location. A study published in April 2025 found that the average American adult believes $1.26 million is an adequate retirement fund. By that standard, the return from a consistent XRP DCA strategy would have far exceeded the perceived requirement for retirement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 That said, financial readiness for retirement is not solely based on investment returns. Health care needs, housing costs, inflation, and family responsibilities can all affect retirement viability. Still, in purely financial terms, a $100-per-week investment in XRP over the last decade would have positioned an investor well above average benchmarks. Too Late to Start? Although past returns have been substantial, some investors may believe they missed their opportunity. However, many analysts maintain that XRP remains undervalued in 2025, citing its ongoing utility in payment solutions and potential regulatory clarity. If these factors lead to increased adoption and demand, there could still be long-term upside for those beginning a DCA strategy today. While the results of a decade-long DCA approach to XRP are striking, such outcomes are rare and depend heavily on market dynamics and investor discipline. Still, for those exploring long-term crypto investment strategies, XRP has demonstrated the potential to offer meaningful returns, especially when approached with patience and consistency.

According to Bloomberg, Worthington has set a price target of $80 for Circle, about 56% below the current price. The JPMorgan analyst reportedly says the biggest threat that Circle, which went public on June 5th, faces is competition as more firms prepare to issue stablecoins. Worthington says, “We are witnessing the launch of tokenized deposit accounts, digital money market funds, and a host of new entrants looking to enter into the digital dollar market. The risk is that a few will succeed in taking enough share to reach critical mass in a business with low switching costs, allowing them to leverage the network built by Circle.” Among the companies that are reportedly harboring plans to issue stablecoins are giant retailers Amazon and Walmart. CRCL is trading at $182 at time of writing, up by about 487% from the initial public offering price of $31 but down by around 39% from the all-time high of about $299 reached on June 23rd. The stablecoin issuer currently has a market capitalization of a little over $40 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 234. In contrast with JPMorgan, British multinational bank Barclays is reportedly bullish on Circle. Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal has set a price target of $215 on CRCL on the basis that stablecoins pegged to the US dollar are primed to keep growing as traditional finance (TradFi) embraces them.

The initiative, which spans cities including Cannes, Nice, Antibes, and Monaco, marks one of the most expansive real-world deployments of crypto payments in a European luxury destination to date. JUST IN: Binance Pay partners with French fintech Lyzi to bring crypto payments to the French Riviera-over 80 businesses in Cannes, Nice, Antibes & Monaco now accept digital assets. — Roundtable Network (@RTB_io) July 2, 2025 Binance and Lyzi Bring Crypto Checkout to the French Riviera According to the announcement, the rollout spans a wide range of businesses, from luxury hotels and beach clubs to opticians, gyms, and high-end retail stores. More than 100 cryptocurrencies are supported through Binance Pay, including euro and dollar-pegged stablecoins. All transactions are settled instantly in euros for merchants, eliminating exposure to crypto market volatility and streamlining the checkout experience. The initiative follows a push by Cannes city officials to promote digital asset adoption among local businesses. With support from both municipal leaders and the private sector, the region is positioning itself as a real-world testing ground for crypto integration in tourism and retail. “This adoption of crypto payments in a world-class destination like the French Riviera shows that digital assets are becoming part of everyday life,” said David Princay, CEO of Binance France. He described the effort as a public-private collaboration intended to make the region more innovative and appealing to global crypto users. Major establishments already accepting crypto include the JW Marriott and Hotel Gray d’Albion in Cannes, Restaurant Le César in Antibes, Gina in Nice, and a number of luxury boutiques in Monaco. While the move appeals to high-net-worth crypto holders, it also clearly benefits small businesses. The partnership promises lower transaction fees, instant settlement, and enhanced security features such as encryption and two-factor authentication. Lyzi CEO Damien Patureaux also emphasized merchant enthusiasm for the move. “We’ve seen exceptional enthusiasm from merchants,” he said. “They’re excited to be leading the way for crypto payments acceptance in France.” To incentivize adoption and reward early users, Binance Pay launched a promotional campaign running from June 28 to July 6. Customers who spend at least €20 (or the crypto equivalent) at participating locations will receive 5 EURI, which is a regulated, euro-backed stablecoin issued by a European financial institution. Spend stablecoins & crypto in Cannes & share 9,999 EURI in rewards! Pay with #Binance Pay & enjoy seamless, instant & gas-free crypto payments. Details https://t.co/vuT5dj5Jaf pic.twitter.com/rwAjSeCwvt — Binance (@binance) July 2, 2025 The reward is limited to the first 1,999 eligible users and will be distributed to their Binance wallets within 30 days after the promotion ends. MiCA Regulation Drives Binance Pay Expansion as Europe Embraces Crypto Integration The expansion of crypto payments across the French Riviera is just the latest sign of how Europe’s regulatory clarity is powering real-world adoption. Central to this progress is the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation , which officially came into force last year after four years of legislative work. MiCA establishes a harmonized framework for crypto regulation across the 30 European Economic Area (EEA) countries, setting rules on token issuance, exchange operations, consumer protection, and market abuse. This regulatory certainty has attracted major global exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Bybit, to secure licenses under MiCA. With a “pan-European passport,” once licensed in one EU jurisdiction, these platforms can now offer services across the entire EEA, encouraging healthy competition and a more stable market.

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has just dropped a bombshell prediction that could redefine the trajectory of Spot ETH ETF performance. His latest insights suggest a monumental shift is on the horizon for Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds, with a staggering $10 billion in inflows projected for the second half of 2025 alone. This isn’t just a bold guess; it’s a projection rooted in the evolving narrative around Ethereum’s utility and its increasing appeal to traditional investors. What’s Driving the Optimism for Spot ETH ETF Inflows? Matt Hougan’s optimism isn’t baseless. He points to a critical development that makes Ethereum uniquely compelling for institutional capital: the seamless integration of stablecoins and equities on the Ethereum blockchain. This technical prowess transforms Ethereum from merely a speculative asset into a foundational layer for future finance, presenting a narrative that resonates deeply with traditional investors accustomed to established financial instruments. Stablecoin Integration: Ethereum is the dominant platform for stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which are increasingly used for global transactions and remittances. This utility provides a practical, real-world application for the network, making it more appealing than pure speculative assets. Equities on Blockchain: While still nascent, the concept of tokenized equities on public blockchains like Ethereum offers a glimpse into a future where traditional assets are managed with blockchain’s efficiency and transparency. This potential excites forward-thinking institutional players. Evolving Investor Perception: As the market matures, the perception of Ethereum is shifting from a volatile crypto asset to a vital piece of decentralized infrastructure, akin to a digital utility. This reclassification helps bridge the gap for conservative portfolios. The numbers already speak volumes. June saw a healthy $1.17 billion in inflows into ETH ETFs, signaling robust initial interest. Hougan believes this is just the beginning, a prelude to the much larger wave expected as traditional finance fully grasps Ethereum’s transformative potential. The Power of Ethereum: Why Ethereum ETF Excites? The excitement surrounding an Ethereum ETF goes beyond just its price action; it’s about the underlying technology and its vast ecosystem. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a decentralized global computer, powering a multitude of applications across various sectors. Its robust network, smart contract capabilities, and vibrant developer community make it a cornerstone of the decentralized web (Web3). Key Aspects That Make Ethereum a Compelling Investment: Benefits for Investors: Diversification: An Ethereum ETF offers investors exposure to the crypto market beyond Bitcoin, providing diversification within the digital asset space. Accessibility: ETFs simplify crypto investment, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure through regulated brokerage accounts without directly managing private keys or navigating complex exchanges. Growth Potential: Ethereum’s continuous development, including scalability upgrades (like sharding in the future) and increasing adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions, points to significant long-term growth potential. Yield Opportunities: While not directly available through ETFs, the underlying Ethereum network offers staking rewards, which can be a long-term draw for the asset itself, influencing institutional interest. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: While progress has been made, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and ETFs remains fluid and can impact market sentiment. Market Volatility: Despite institutional adoption, crypto markets are inherently volatile, and investors should be prepared for price fluctuations. Competition: While Ethereum holds a strong position, other smart contract platforms are emerging, posing potential competition. Decoding Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s Vision: A Deeper Dive Matt Hougan, as the Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, holds a significant position in the crypto investment world. Bitwise is known for its rigorous research and pioneering efforts in bringing crypto investment products to market, including the first spot Bitcoin ETF. Hougan’s projections are often based on extensive market analysis, investor sentiment, and an understanding of how traditional finance integrates new asset classes. His projection of $10 billion in ETH inflows by H2 2025 isn’t pulled from thin air. It likely considers several factors: Factor Impact on ETH Inflows Regulatory Clarity Increased clarity from regulators often precedes significant institutional adoption, as it reduces perceived risk. Market Education As more traditional financial advisors and their clients understand Ethereum’s utility, demand for ETH ETFs will naturally grow. Product Availability The recent approval and launch of spot ETH ETFs provide the necessary investment vehicles for this capital. Macroeconomic Environment A favorable macroeconomic climate, potentially with lower interest rates, could encourage greater allocation to alternative assets like crypto. Ethereum Network Upgrades Successful implementation of future upgrades (e.g., sharding) will enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs, making the network even more attractive. Hougan’s vision underscores a belief that Ethereum’s fundamental utility, combined with the accessibility of ETF products, will unlock a floodgate of capital from institutions and retail investors alike. Navigating the Future: Potential for Massive ETH Inflows The potential for massive ETH inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs is a topic of intense discussion within financial circles. This isn’t just about the ‘new shiny thing’; it’s about the maturation of an asset class and the growing comfort of institutional players with digital assets. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has set a precedent, demonstrating significant demand and the operational viability of these products. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on regulatory developments, especially from the SEC, as their stance significantly influences market dynamics. Understand Ethereum’s Ecosystem: Beyond just the ETF, educate yourself on Ethereum’s role in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain to grasp its long-term value proposition. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Given potential volatility, a strategy of regular, smaller investments into ETH ETFs can mitigate risk. Consult a Financial Advisor: For those new to crypto ETFs, seeking advice from a financial professional familiar with digital assets is always recommended. The narrative of Ethereum as a programmable money layer and a global settlement network is gaining traction, positioning it as a core holding for diversified portfolios looking for exposure to the digital economy. Beyond the Hype: Understanding the Crypto Investment Landscape The advent of spot ETH ETFs marks a significant milestone in the broader crypto investment landscape. It signifies a growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance, moving beyond Bitcoin to embrace other foundational cryptocurrencies. This trend is likely to pave the way for more diverse crypto-backed investment products in the future. Comparing the potential for ETH ETF inflows to Bitcoin ETF performance provides valuable context. Bitcoin ETFs saw substantial initial inflows, validating the demand for accessible crypto investment vehicles. While Ethereum’s market capitalization is smaller than Bitcoin’s, its utility-driven narrative and broader ecosystem could attract a different segment of investors, potentially leading to sustained growth over time. This shift represents a crucial step towards mainstream adoption, offering a regulated and familiar pathway for institutions, wealth managers, and retail investors to participate in the burgeoning digital economy. It underscores the belief that cryptocurrencies, particularly those with strong fundamental use cases like Ethereum, are here to stay and will increasingly integrate into the global financial system. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s projection of $10 billion in spot ETH ETF inflows by the second half of 2025 paints a vivid picture of Ethereum’s future in the institutional investment arena. Driven by its compelling utility in stablecoins and tokenized equities, Ethereum is poised to attract significant capital from traditional investors seeking exposure to the next frontier of digital finance. While challenges remain, the clear benefits of diversification, accessibility, and long-term growth potential position ETH ETFs as a powerful vehicle for participating in the evolving crypto market. This anticipated influx of capital could not only solidify Ethereum’s standing but also signal a broader embrace of digital assets by the global financial system, ushering in an exciting new era for crypto investment.

Recently, Cipher Mining , a Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin (BTC) miner, captured significant attention with its June operational report. This update offers a compelling look into the company’s robust Bitcoin production and strategic financial maneuvers, providing valuable insights for investors and enthusiasts alike. Cipher Mining’s Impressive Production Milestones June proved to be another productive month for Cipher Mining, solidifying its position as a key player in the Bitcoin mining industry. According to their official press release via GlobeNewswire, the company successfully mined a total of 160 BTC during the month. This consistent output underscores the efficiency and scale of Cipher Mining’s operations, especially in a fluctuating market environment. For any dedicated BTC miner , achieving consistent production is a testament to optimized infrastructure, stable energy sourcing, and effective operational management. Cipher Mining’s ability to maintain such a steady pace of Bitcoin generation speaks volumes about their technical prowess and strategic planning in navigating the complexities of the mining landscape. This level of output contributes directly to the overall Bitcoin supply and the miner’s own treasury, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. Strategic Digital Asset Management: Why Sell BTC? While producing a significant amount of Bitcoin is commendable, a crucial aspect of a public mining company’s financial health lies in its digital asset strategy . Cipher Mining didn’t just produce BTC; they also made strategic decisions regarding their holdings. In June, the company sold 58 BTC, a move that might seem counterintuitive to some, but is often a standard practice for managing operational costs and ensuring liquidity. Publicly traded Bitcoin miners frequently sell a portion of their mined BTC to cover operational expenses such as electricity, facility maintenance, and employee salaries. This allows them to maintain a healthy balance sheet without solely relying on external financing. By selling 58 BTC, Cipher Mining likely ensured it had sufficient fiat currency to cover its immediate financial obligations, while still retaining a substantial portion of its newly mined assets. As of the end of June, Cipher Mining proudly held 1,063 BTC in its treasury. This robust holding signifies a strong belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin and provides the company with significant strategic flexibility. It also acts as a tangible asset base that can appreciate in value, further strengthening the company’s financial standing for its shareholders. The Broader Landscape of Crypto Mining Operations The operational success of companies like Cipher Mining provides a valuable lens through which to view the broader crypto mining sector. The industry is highly competitive and capital-intensive, requiring significant upfront investment in specialized hardware, energy infrastructure, and cooling systems. Furthermore, miners must contend with ever-increasing network difficulty, which requires more computational power to mine new blocks, and volatile energy prices. Key factors influencing a miner’s profitability and production include: Energy Costs: Access to cheap, reliable power is perhaps the single most critical factor. Many miners strategically locate their operations in regions with abundant renewable energy or favorable electricity rates. Hardware Efficiency: Utilizing the latest generation of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners ensures maximum hash rate per unit of energy consumed. Network Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty adjusts upwards, meaning each miner gets a smaller share of the block reward unless they increase their hash rate. Bitcoin Price: The market price of Bitcoin directly impacts the revenue generated from mining, influencing the profitability of operations and the decision to hold or sell mined BTC. Cipher Mining’s consistent Bitcoin production despite these challenges highlights its operational resilience and effective management. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Production? Looking ahead, Cipher Mining’s recent performance sets a positive precedent for its future endeavors. The company’s ability to consistently produce and strategically manage its Bitcoin holdings positions it well for continued growth. As the global adoption of digital assets expands, the demand for secure and efficient mining operations will only increase. For investors, reports like these from a leading BTC miner offer crucial transparency into the health and operational capacity of the company. It allows them to assess not only the raw production numbers but also the underlying financial strategy that supports long-term value creation. The strategic accumulation of over 1,000 BTC in its treasury demonstrates a strong commitment to capitalizing on Bitcoin’s potential future appreciation. In conclusion, Cipher Mining’s June report is more than just a set of numbers; it’s a testament to effective operational management and a shrewd digital asset strategy in the competitive world of Bitcoin mining. Producing 160 BTC and strategically selling 58 BTC while building a substantial treasury of 1,063 BTC showcases a balanced approach to growth and financial stability. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, companies like Cipher Mining, with their transparent reporting and robust operations, will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance.

Ripple (XRP) , Cardano (ADA) , and Ethereum (ETH) are showing signs of potential breakouts, supported by improved market structure, ETF developments, and rising institutional engagement. Yet while these leading assets continue to dominate headlines, traders chasing sharper upside are starting to focus elsewhere—specifically on MAGACOIN FINANCE , a political meme coin gaining serious early momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises as a High-Conviction Early Entry Amid the renewed attention on large-cap assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a unique position as one of the most watched presale tokens of the cycle. With a capped supply of 170 billion tokens , no venture capital ownership, and a smart contract audit completed by HashEx, the token is earning credibility among speculative and fundamentals-driven traders alike. Buyers are flocking to the project for its clean structure and early-stage multiplier potential. Repeat wallet activity and social engagement suggest that interest is growing quickly—and this could set the foundation for sustained momentum once exchange listings begin. With no inflationary mechanics and clear tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a frontrunner in the high-reward category. XRP Forecasts Reach As High As $100 Bullish sentiment around XRP is gaining steam, with analysts outlining breakout projections well beyond current levels. Forecasts from Crypto Beast suggest a move to $9 by 2025 , while other forecasters—including Javon Marks—believe XRP could reach $100+ , citing historical cycles and long-term accumulation patterns. Popular analysts like Egrag Crypto and XForce are watching Elliott Wave structures , projecting near-term levels around $4–$5 , with long-term targets between $13 and $27 . The favorable resolution of Ripple’s regulatory battle has significantly improved sentiment, especially as ETF discussions continue to evolve. ADA Gains ETF Buzz and Long-Term Targets Cardano (ADA) is once again under analyst focus, particularly as speculation about an ADA ETF circulates. Its strategic push into real-world asset tokenization and consistent ecosystem development are attracting bullish projections. According to InvestingHaven, ADA could range from $0.66 to $2.36 in 2025. Bitpanda goes even further, projecting a top-tier target of $5.66 , citing rising institutional interest and DeFi expansion. While price action remains modest for now, ADA is widely viewed as one of the most undervalued Layer-1 tokens on the market. Ethereum’s Technical Setup and ETF Timeline Inspire Optimism Ethereum is consolidating after a solid recovery phase, with analysts pointing to a tightening Bollinger Band setup and a potential breakout above its 20-day SMA . Target ranges of $2,750 to $2,900 are in focus, with extended forecasts going as high as $10,000 by late 2025. The long-anticipated Fusaka upgrade is nearing testnet stages, and ETF-related options trading in October 2025 is expected to inject fresh liquidity. With rising institutional adoption and new enterprise use cases emerging, Ethereum remains a pillar of long-term crypto infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Wildcard With Accelerated Potential While XRP, ADA, and ETH offer reliable upside, their established positions also mean slower growth curves. MAGACOIN FINANCE , in contrast, is fresh, fast-moving, and still priced for outsized gains. Its political branding, fixed-supply model, and growing buyer activity suggest that it could be one of the breakout altcoins of 2025. With a 100% bonus still active for early buyers, and exchange speculation growing louder, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured the attention of investors ready to move before the broader market catches on.

This strategic decision not only reinforces their pioneering vision but also highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations embracing cryptocurrencies. If you’ve been watching the evolving landscape of corporate finance, this development is a clear indicator of where the smart money is heading. Genius Group’s Ambitious BTC Treasury Strategy: A Game Changer? On July 1, 2025, Genius Group announced a substantial 20% increase in its BTC treasury , bringing their total Bitcoin (BTC) stash to an impressive 120 BTC. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s part of a much larger, ambitious plan. According to a press release from GlobeNewswire, the company has set its sights on an even more audacious goal: expanding its holdings to a staggering 1,000 BTC within the next six months. Imagine the dedication and conviction required to pursue such a target in the volatile crypto market! But what exactly does it mean to be an ‘AI-powered, Bitcoin-first education company’? It suggests a deep integration of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence into their core business model. This isn’t just about holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset; it implies a philosophical alignment with decentralization, digital sovereignty, and the future of finance, all while leveraging cutting-edge AI for educational delivery. Their treasury strategy likely mirrors their belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role in a future economy. Why Are More Companies Embracing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The move by Genius Group isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a broader, accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . Companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional fiat currencies and conventional assets for their treasury management. But what’s driving this shift? Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is often seen as a robust hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its capped supply of 21 million coins makes it a deflationary asset. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury provides diversification away from traditional financial instruments, which may be correlated with other market risks. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically offered significant returns, attracting companies willing to take calculated risks for substantial upside potential. Technological Alignment: For tech-forward companies like Genius Group , holding Bitcoin aligns with their innovative ethos and positions them at the forefront of digital transformation. Attracting Talent & Investment: A strong stance on digital assets can appeal to a new generation of employees and investors who are increasingly crypto-savvy. What Does ‘Bitcoin-First’ Mean for a Crypto Education Company? The term ‘Bitcoin-first’ is crucial here. For a crypto education company , it’s not just a buzzword; it’s a foundational principle. It suggests that Bitcoin is central to their curriculum, their operational philosophy, and their financial strategy. This could manifest in several ways: Curriculum Focus: Their educational programs likely emphasize Bitcoin’s history, technology, economic principles, and its role in the global financial system. Acceptance of BTC: They might accept Bitcoin for tuition fees or other services, providing practical utility for the asset. Leading by Example: By holding significant Bitcoin holdings , they demonstrate confidence in the very asset they educate others about, lending credibility to their mission. Innovation Hub: They could be exploring new ways to integrate Bitcoin’s lightning network or other layers into their educational platforms, perhaps for micro-payments or decentralized identity. The synergy between AI and this Bitcoin-first approach is also fascinating. Imagine AI tutors guiding students through complex Bitcoin concepts or AI-powered platforms personalizing learning paths based on an individual’s understanding of blockchain technology. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Considerations for a Robust BTC Treasury While the benefits of holding Bitcoin are compelling, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges. Managing a substantial BTC treasury comes with its own set of complexities: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be dramatic. Companies must have a clear strategy for managing these fluctuations and a long-term outlook to ride out short-term dips. Security and Custody: Safeguarding significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures, including cold storage solutions, multi-signature wallets, and professional custody providers. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies need to stay abreast of changes in tax laws, reporting requirements, and compliance. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for Bitcoin can be complex, as it’s often treated as an intangible asset. Clear internal policies and expert advice are crucial. Public Perception: While institutional Bitcoin adoption is growing, some traditional investors and stakeholders might still view crypto as risky. Transparent communication is key. Genius Group’s decision to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin suggests they have carefully weighed these factors and developed a robust strategy to mitigate potential risks while maximizing the benefits. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Finance and Education? The bold move by Genius Group serves as a powerful testament to the growing conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate treasury asset. It underscores a fundamental shift in how corporations view and manage their capital. For the education sector, it signals a move towards integrating cutting-edge financial technologies directly into business models, not just curricula. As more companies follow suit, we can expect increased liquidity in the Bitcoin market, potentially leading to greater stability over time. Furthermore, the commitment of a crypto education company like Genius Group to a ‘Bitcoin-first’ philosophy will likely inspire other educational institutions to explore blockchain and cryptocurrency in their offerings, preparing the next generation for a decentralized future. The journey to 1,000 BTC for Genius Group will be closely watched by analysts and enthusiasts alike. It’s not just a financial play; it’s a statement about the future of money, education, and corporate innovation.

The recent announcement that Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has acquired Liquifi, a sophisticated token management platform, is one such transformative development. This marks Coinbase’s fourth acquisition in 2025, according to Fortune Crypto, underscoring a clear strategic intent to bolster its institutional offerings and streamline complex operations within the digital asset space. But what exactly does this Coinbase Acquisition mean for the broader crypto ecosystem, and how will it impact firms navigating the intricate world of digital assets? The Strategic Imperative Behind Coinbase’s Acquisition Spree Coinbase’s consistent pursuit of strategic acquisitions, with Liquifi being the latest, highlights a deliberate effort to expand its service offerings beyond traditional exchange functionalities. In an increasingly competitive and regulated environment, simply providing a trading platform is no longer enough. Crypto firms, from nascent startups to established institutions, are grappling with a myriad of operational challenges, including managing diverse token portfolios, ensuring accurate distributions, and adhering to stringent tax regulations. By integrating Liquifi’s robust tools, Coinbase is not just buying technology; it’s investing in a comprehensive solution that addresses critical pain points for its clients. This move is a testament to Coinbase’s vision of becoming a full-suite provider for the institutional crypto economy, offering end-to-end solutions that encompass trading, custody, and now, advanced token management. This acquisition is particularly timely, given the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. As more traditional financial entities venture into digital assets, the demand for enterprise-grade tools that simplify complex processes, enhance transparency, and ensure regulatory compliance becomes paramount. Coinbase, through its Coinbase Acquisition of Liquifi, is positioning itself at the forefront of meeting these sophisticated demands, reinforcing its commitment to fostering a more mature and accessible crypto market. Revolutionizing Token Management for Crypto Firms At its core, Liquifi specializes in Token Management , providing essential tools that enable crypto firms to efficiently track token ownership, manage complex distribution schedules, and automate various administrative tasks. Imagine a firm that has raised capital through a token sale, distributed tokens to hundreds or thousands of investors, and now needs to manage vesting schedules, airdrops, or ongoing tokenomics. Without specialized tools, this can quickly become an administrative nightmare, prone to errors and significant time consumption. Liquifi steps in to solve these exact problems. Automated Tracking: Liquifi offers comprehensive dashboards for real-time tracking of token holdings across various wallets and exchanges, providing a single source of truth for all digital assets. Streamlined Distributions: From investor payouts to employee equity, the platform simplifies the often-complex process of distributing tokens, ensuring accuracy and auditability. Vesting Schedule Management: For projects with intricate vesting schedules for founders, team members, or early investors, Liquifi automates the release of tokens, reducing manual oversight. Audit Trails & Reporting: The platform generates detailed reports and maintains immutable audit trails, crucial for internal governance and external compliance checks. The integration of these capabilities into Coinbase’s ecosystem means that institutional clients will have access to a seamless, integrated suite of services, allowing them to manage their digital assets with unprecedented efficiency and precision. This is a game-changer for any entity dealing with a significant volume or variety of tokens. Navigating the Complexities of Crypto Compliance with Ease Perhaps one of the most significant benefits of the Liquifi acquisition for Coinbase’s clients lies in its robust capabilities for Crypto Compliance , particularly concerning tax obligations. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with governments worldwide striving to establish clear guidelines for taxation, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. For crypto firms, staying compliant is not just a legal necessity but a critical factor for long-term viability and reputation. Liquifi’s platform provides tools specifically designed to simplify tax reporting for crypto firms. This includes: Transaction Aggregation: Consolidating data from various sources to provide a holistic view of all taxable events. Cost Basis Tracking: Accurately calculating the cost basis for various digital assets, essential for determining capital gains or losses. Automated Report Generation: Producing tax-ready reports that align with different jurisdictional requirements, reducing the burden on finance teams. Audit Support: Providing detailed records that can withstand regulatory scrutiny. In an era where regulatory bodies are increasingly scrutinizing digital asset transactions, having a reliable system for Crypto Compliance is non-negotiable. This acquisition empowers Coinbase to offer its clients a powerful solution to navigate these complexities, minimizing risks and ensuring operational integrity. It positions Coinbase not just as a trading venue but as a trusted partner in the journey towards regulatory adherence. Empowering Comprehensive Digital Asset Management The term Digital Asset Management encompasses more than just cryptocurrencies; it includes a wide array of tokenized assets, from NFTs to stablecoins and even tokenized real-world assets. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, firms require comprehensive solutions that can handle this growing diversity with the same level of sophistication and security as traditional financial assets. The integration of Liquifi’s capabilities significantly enhances Coinbase’s ability to provide holistic digital asset management services. Consider the implications for: Institutional Investors: Who need robust systems to manage large portfolios of diverse digital assets, track performance, and ensure secure custody. Web3 Projects: That issue their own tokens and need tools to manage their treasury, allocate tokens to stakeholders, and track their usage. Corporations: Exploring blockchain for various use cases, from supply chain management to intellectual property, requiring structured ways to manage their tokenized representations. By offering advanced Digital Asset Management tools, Coinbase is broadening its appeal to a wider range of clients, cementing its position as a go-to platform for all things digital assets. This move aligns with the broader trend of institutionalization within the crypto space, where the demand for professional-grade infrastructure is skyrocketing. The Broader Trend: Consolidation in the Blockchain Industry Coinbase’s acquisition of Liquifi is not an isolated event; it’s a clear indicator of a significant trend: consolidation within the Blockchain Industry . As the market matures, smaller, specialized firms are being absorbed by larger players seeking to expand their offerings, gain market share, and achieve economies of scale. This trend is driven by several factors: Maturity of the Market: The initial boom-and-bust cycles are giving way to a more stable, albeit still volatile, market, where established players are looking to build sustainable businesses. Regulatory Clarity: As regulations become clearer, firms need to invest heavily in compliance infrastructure, making acquisitions of specialized compliance tech attractive. Competition: The crypto market is intensely competitive, forcing exchanges and service providers to differentiate themselves through enhanced features and integrated solutions. Demand for Integrated Solutions: Clients, especially institutions, prefer single platforms that offer a suite of services rather than juggling multiple vendors for different needs. This consolidation is a sign of the Blockchain Industry moving beyond its nascent stages and entering a phase of professionalization. It suggests a future where fewer, but more comprehensive and robust, platforms dominate the landscape, offering a wider array of services to a more diverse client base. While financial terms of the Liquifi acquisition were not disclosed, its strategic value for Coinbase in this consolidating market is undeniable. Benefits and Challenges Ahead While the benefits of this acquisition are clear, like any major integration, there will be challenges. Key Benefits: Enhanced Institutional Offerings: A more comprehensive suite of tools for institutional clients, attracting new business. Streamlined Operations: Reduced manual work and potential for error in token management and distributions. Improved Compliance: Simplified tax reporting and regulatory adherence for clients, mitigating risks. Competitive Advantage: Differentiating Coinbase from rivals by offering a unique, integrated solution. Data Synergy: Combining Liquifi’s data with Coinbase’s extensive market insights for better service development. Potential Challenges: Integration Complexities: Merging Liquifi’s technology and team seamlessly into Coinbase’s existing infrastructure. Cultural Fit: Ensuring the teams from both companies align on vision and operational practices. Client Adoption: Encouraging existing and new clients to fully utilize the new integrated features. Market Reception: Ensuring the market perceives the acquisition positively and understands its long-term value. Actionable Insights for Crypto Firms What can other crypto firms learn from Coinbase’s strategic move? Prioritize Infrastructure: Invest in robust internal systems for managing digital assets, compliance, and reporting. Manual processes are unsustainable as the market grows. Embrace Automation: Leverage technology to automate complex tasks like token distributions and tax calculations to reduce errors and save time. Stay Ahead of Regulation: Proactively implement solutions that simplify compliance, as regulatory scrutiny will only increase. Consider Strategic Partnerships: If building in-house is not feasible, look for partnerships or integrations with specialized service providers. A Compelling Future for Digital Asset Management Coinbase’s acquisition of Liquifi is more than just a corporate transaction; it’s a strategic declaration of intent. It signals a future where digital asset management is professionalized, compliant, and seamlessly integrated into the broader financial ecosystem. By bringing Liquifi’s specialized capabilities under its wing, Coinbase is not only enhancing its immediate offerings but also laying crucial groundwork for the continued institutionalization and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. This move solidifies Coinbase’s position as a forward-thinking leader, committed to building the infrastructure necessary for a robust and regulated digital economy. The crypto world is constantly evolving, and with acquisitions like this, Coinbase is clearly aiming to shape that evolution.

47307274,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=174275,1751503814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/47307274.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Bolstered: H100’s Bold Move in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/h100-bitcoin-treasury-boost/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Bolstered: H100’s Bold Move in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption In a significant move that underscores the increasing trend of corporate engagement with digital assets, Swedish healthtech firm H100 has announced a substantial addition to its Bitcoin treasury . This latest acquisition not only bolsters their existing holdings but also sends a clear signal about the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. What does this mean for H100, and what does it signify for the broader landscape of corporate finance? H100’s Growing Bitcoin Treasury : A Strategic Insight The news broke on X (formerly Twitter), where H100 confirmed the purchase of an additional 47.33 Bitcoin (BTC). This latest acquisition brings their total Bitcoin treasury holdings to an impressive 247.54 BTC. For a healthtech company, this might seem like an unconventional strategy, yet it aligns with a burgeoning movement among forward-thinking corporations looking to diversify their balance sheets beyond traditional fiat currencies and conventional assets. This strategic accumulation reflects a proactive approach to managing corporate reserves in an evolving global economic climate. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption : Why Companies are Stacking Sats H100’s decision isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger, discernible pattern of corporate Bitcoin adoption . Companies worldwide, ranging from software giants to manufacturing firms, are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential. Why are more and more corporations choosing to allocate a portion of their treasury to this volatile yet potentially lucrative digital asset? Several factors contribute to this trend: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins offers a compelling alternative to fiat currencies, which can be devalued by unlimited printing. Store of Value: Often dubbed “digital gold,” Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a robust store of value, offering a hedge against economic instability and geopolitical risks. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury portfolio provides diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk by including an asset with a low correlation to traditional markets. Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets can be seen as a forward-looking move, positioning companies at the forefront of financial innovation and the digital economy. Transparency and Accessibility: The transparent nature of the Bitcoin blockchain and its global accessibility make it an attractive asset for companies operating across borders. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, have demonstrated the long-term commitment some companies are making, often inspiring others to follow suit. While corporate Bitcoin adoption comes with its share of risks, the perceived benefits are clearly outweighing them for a growing number of firms. Understanding H100 Bitcoin Holdings : What Does it Mean? With 247.54 BTC, H100’s H100 Bitcoin Holdings place it among a select group of companies with significant exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This move by a healthtech company is particularly noteworthy. It suggests that even in sectors not traditionally associated with finance or technology, the appeal of Bitcoin as a treasury asset is gaining traction. It implies that H100’s leadership believes in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin, seeing it as more than just a speculative asset but a legitimate component of their financial strategy. For shareholders and potential investors, this transparency about H100 Bitcoin holdings provides insight into the company’s financial philosophy. It could attract a new class of investors who are keen on companies with exposure to the digital asset space, potentially broadening H100’s investor base. Beyond the Numbers: The Significance of BTC Accumulation The act of BTC accumulation by a publicly announced entity like H100 goes beyond just the numerical value of the added Bitcoin. It signifies a deeper acceptance and legitimization of cryptocurrency within mainstream corporate finance. Each new corporate treasury adopting Bitcoin contributes to its institutionalization, paving the way for broader adoption and infrastructure development. This trend can have several ripple effects: Increased Liquidity: As more companies hold BTC, it contributes to the overall liquidity and stability of the Bitcoin market. Regulatory Clarity: Growing corporate interest often spurs regulators to provide clearer guidelines, which benefits the entire ecosystem. Investor Confidence: When reputable firms like H100 put their capital into Bitcoin, it can boost confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. Innovation in Treasury Management: It encourages financial departments to explore new tools and strategies for managing digital assets, fostering innovation in the treasury space. The ongoing BTC accumulation by various entities suggests a long-term conviction that Bitcoin is here to stay and will play an increasingly important role in global finance. Crafting a Robust Digital Asset Strategy for the Future H100’s move highlights the importance of having a well-defined digital asset strategy . For companies considering following suit, it’s not simply about buying Bitcoin; it involves a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects: Risk Assessment: Understanding Bitcoin’s volatility and developing strategies to mitigate potential downturns. Custody Solutions: Implementing secure and robust solutions for holding digital assets, whether through self-custody or trusted third-party custodians. Accounting and Reporting: Navigating the complexities of accounting for Bitcoin on balance sheets and complying with tax regulations. Regulatory Compliance: Staying abreast of evolving cryptocurrency regulations in different jurisdictions. Stakeholder Communication: Clearly communicating the rationale and risks of a digital asset strategy to shareholders, employees, and the public. Companies like H100 are demonstrating that with careful planning and a strategic mindset, integrating digital assets into a corporate treasury is not just feasible but can be a powerful move for future growth and resilience. Their journey offers a valuable case study for others exploring their own digital asset strategy in a rapidly digitizing world. Conclusion: A Landmark for Corporate Finance H100’s latest addition of 47.33 BTC to its treasury is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to the ongoing paradigm shift in corporate finance. As corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to gain momentum, we are witnessing a fundamental re-evaluation of traditional treasury management. H100, a healthtech firm, stands as a prime example of how diverse industries are beginning to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic asset. This move reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate and increasingly attractive option for companies looking to secure their future in an uncertain economic landscape. The journey of BTC accumulation by corporations is far from over, and each step, like H100’s, builds a stronger foundation for the digital economy of tomorrow.

Then buckle up, because a significant shift in the traditional financial landscape could be on the horizon. Recent predictions from UBS, a leading global financial services company, suggest that the US dollar forecast points towards likely losses in the second half of 2025. This isn’t just about currency exchange rates; it has profound implications for every asset class, including, crucially, the crypto market. Understanding this potential dollar weakness is key to navigating the financial waters ahead. Decoding the Anticipated US Dollar Weakness: What’s Driving It? The U.S. dollar, often seen as a safe haven and the world’s reserve currency, doesn’t typically face predictions of sustained decline without substantial underlying reasons. UBS’s outlook isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a meticulously calculated projection based on a confluence of macroeconomic factors. So, what exactly is expected to fuel this anticipated dollar weakness ? Several key drivers are typically cited when economists discuss currency depreciation. For the U.S. dollar, these often include: Monetary Policy Divergence: The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions play a pivotal role. If other major central banks (like the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan) begin to hike rates more aggressively or maintain higher rates for longer than the Fed, it can make their respective currencies more attractive to investors, leading to capital outflows from the U.S. and weakening the dollar. Conversely, if the Fed cuts rates faster or deeper than its peers, the dollar’s yield advantage diminishes. Inflation Outlook: Persistent or higher-than-expected inflation in the U.S. could erode the purchasing power of the dollar, making it less appealing. While central banks aim to control inflation, an inability to do so effectively can undermine currency strength. Economic Growth Differentials: If economic growth outside the U.S. accelerates significantly relative to U.S. growth, it can attract investment to those regions, again diverting capital away from dollar-denominated assets. A robust global recovery, particularly in Europe or Asia, could shift the balance. Trade Deficits: A large and persistent U.S. trade deficit means the country is importing more goods and services than it exports. This implies a continuous outflow of dollars to pay for these imports, which can put downward pressure on the currency’s value. Geopolitical Factors and Global Risk Appetite: While the dollar often strengthens during times of global uncertainty (as a safe haven), prolonged periods of stability or a shift in geopolitical power dynamics could reduce the need for dollar-denominated assets, leading to a reallocation of global reserves and investments. What Does the UBS Economic Outlook Reveal for H2 2025? UBS, known for its in-depth market analysis, is not alone in predicting shifts in global currencies, but its specific timing and conviction regarding the US dollar forecast for H2 2025 warrants attention. Their UBS economic outlook typically considers a broad spectrum of indicators, including: Interest Rate Trajectories: UBS likely anticipates the Federal Reserve reaching a point where it will either pause its rate hikes or begin cutting rates by H2 2025, potentially at a faster pace than other major central banks. This would diminish the dollar’s yield appeal. Inflation Normalization: A projected return to more normalized inflation levels in the U.S. could reduce the urgency for a hawkish Fed, allowing for more accommodative monetary policy, which tends to weaken a currency. Global Growth Rebalancing: The bank may foresee a rebalancing of global economic growth, with other major economies (like the Eurozone or China) potentially catching up or even outpacing U.S. growth by mid-2025, making their assets more attractive. Fiscal Policy and Debt Concerns: While less direct, ongoing debates about U.S. fiscal policy, national debt, and potential government shutdowns can add layers of uncertainty, contributing to a cautious outlook on the dollar. It’s important to remember that these are forecasts, subject to change based on evolving economic data and unforeseen global events. However, a major institution like UBS making such a call suggests a high degree of confidence in these underlying trends. How Might Global Currency Trends Shift with a Weaker Dollar? A significant weakening of the U.S. dollar doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it inevitably impacts global currency trends . The dollar’s decline would likely lead to a strengthening of other major currencies. Here’s a look at some potential beneficiaries: Euro (EUR): As the second-largest reserve currency, the Euro often moves inversely to the dollar. If the ECB maintains a relatively tighter monetary policy or the Eurozone economy shows resilience, the EUR/USD pair could see substantial gains. Japanese Yen (JPY): The Yen, traditionally a safe-haven currency, has been weak due to the Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy. A shift in the BoJ’s stance, coupled with dollar weakness, could lead to a significant appreciation of the Yen. British Pound (GBP): The Pound’s performance often hinges on the Bank of England’s policy and the UK’s economic health. A broadly weaker dollar could provide tailwinds for the GBP, especially if the UK manages to avoid a deep recession. Commodity Currencies (CAD, AUD, NZD): Currencies of commodity-exporting nations like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand often strengthen when the dollar weakens and commodity prices (like oil and metals, which are priced in USD) rise. Emerging Market Currencies: A weaker dollar typically eases financial conditions for emerging markets, as it makes dollar-denominated debt cheaper to service and can attract capital flows. This could lead to a broad strengthening across various emerging market currencies. This rebalancing of power among major currencies could create new opportunities and challenges for international trade and investment. Crypto Market Implications: An Unforeseen Opportunity or Continued Volatility? For those invested in digital assets, the potential US dollar forecast of weakness is particularly intriguing. Historically, there’s often been an inverse correlation between the strength of the U.S. dollar and the performance of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. When the dollar weakens, alternative assets can become more attractive. Here’s why a weaker dollar could have significant crypto market implications : Store of Value Narrative: A declining dollar could bolster the ‘digital gold’ narrative for Bitcoin. As traditional fiat currencies face inflationary pressures or lose purchasing power, investors might seek refuge in decentralized, supply-capped assets like Bitcoin. Increased Liquidity: A weaker dollar might prompt investors to reallocate funds from dollar-denominated traditional assets into higher-growth, higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This influx of capital could boost crypto prices. Reduced Pressure on Global Markets: Many international transactions in crypto are still dollar-denominated. A weaker dollar makes it easier for international investors to enter the crypto market, potentially increasing demand. Monetary Policy Response: If the Fed is indeed cutting rates or maintaining a dovish stance, it often signals a period of ‘easy money’ – a scenario that has historically been bullish for risk assets like crypto. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that the crypto market is also influenced by its own unique dynamics, including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While a weaker dollar can provide a macro tailwind, it doesn’t guarantee a bull run. Volatility remains a constant companion in the crypto space. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors Given UBS’s US dollar forecast for H2 2025, how can investors, especially those with a keen interest in the crypto space, prepare? Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: While a weaker dollar might benefit crypto, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying across different asset classes, including a mix of traditional assets (like international equities or gold) and digital assets. Monitor Macroeconomic Data: Keep a close eye on key economic indicators such as inflation rates, interest rate decisions from major central banks (Fed, ECB, BoJ), GDP growth figures, and trade balances. These will provide real-time insights into whether the anticipated dollar weakness is materializing as predicted. Understand Correlation vs. Causation: While historical correlations exist between the dollar and crypto, they are not always direct causation. Evaluate individual crypto projects based on their fundamentals, technology, and adoption rates, not just macro trends. Consider Stablecoin Strategies: If you’re holding significant dollar-pegged stablecoins, be aware that their purchasing power could be affected by dollar depreciation. Explore options for holding other fiat-pegged stablecoins or converting to crypto assets if your outlook aligns with dollar weakness. Risk Management is Key: Volatility is inherent in the crypto market. Employ robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, taking profits at predefined levels, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: For many crypto investors, the long-term vision of decentralized finance and blockchain technology outweighs short-term currency fluctuations. However, macro trends can offer strategic entry or exit points. Conclusion: Preparing for a Shifting Financial Landscape The US dollar forecast from UBS, predicting likely losses in H2 2025, signals a potentially significant shift in the global financial landscape. This anticipated dollar weakness is not just a technical currency movement; it reflects deeper macroeconomic trends, including monetary policy divergence, inflation dynamics, and rebalancing global currency trends . For the crypto market, these shifts could present both opportunities and challenges, potentially strengthening the ‘digital gold’ narrative for assets like Bitcoin while also reminding investors of the inherent volatility. As we approach 2025, staying informed about the evolving UBS economic outlook and its broader implications will be paramount. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the crypto space, understanding these macro currents can help you make more informed decisions and navigate the exciting, yet complex, world of digital assets.

All eyes are on the potential resurgence of retail buying—a force known to reshape market hierarchies in weeks. SHIBA INU (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are building pressure near resistance levels, while XRP and Solana (SOL) remain reliant on institutional flows and ETF developments. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE , a rising meme-themed altcoin, is gaining traction as a speculative play primed to ride the next meme wave. It’s still early in its cycle, but its metrics are flashing green just as sentiment begins to stir again. Let’s break down how these assets compare as the next leg of the market cycle unfolds. SHIBA INU: Quiet Accumulation, Strong Foundation Despite subdued price movement, SHIBA INU is seeing notable accumulation. In June, wallets holding SHIB for 1–12 months added nearly 30 trillion tokens , reflecting long-term conviction. That accumulation is now valued at over $2.2 billion , indicating belief in a breakout scenario. The project also continues its aggressive burn mechanism. In just 24 hours, over 12 million SHIB were removed from circulation, reducing future supply. If retail demand returns, SHIBA INU’s scarcity model could amplify price action quickly. DOGE: Coiling Up for a Volatile Break DOGE remains one of the most liquid and community-driven coins in the market. Its current symmetrical triangle pattern points to a breakout probability nearing 50–60%. Should price breach resistance, analysts suggest a move toward $0.30 is possible. Additionally, wrapped DOGE is now available on Coinbase’s Base Layer-2 , opening up access to new DeFi applications. With strong on-chain data and renewed functionality, DOGE could be positioned for rapid growth—especially if social media sentiment surges mid-July. XRP and Solana: Fundamentally Strong, But Slower Movers? While SHIB and DOGE are loaded with high-velocity potential, XRP and Solana are anchored in institutional strength. XRP’s trajectory is still largely tied to ETF approvals and ongoing legal clarity. Though whale wallets are accumulating and confidence is building, price movement remains modest and reactive to regulatory news. Solana is flourishing behind the scenes, with over $13 billion in stablecoins , $7.65 billion in TVL , and record DEX trading volumes . Yet despite this growth, short-term rallies may be limited by the asset’s mature positioning and broader market saturation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Fresh Contender With Early Traction MAGACOIN FINANCE stands apart as a high-risk, high-reward option. Its presale has already drawn in millions in early capital , and with a fixed 170 billion token supply , staking features on the way, and a completed HashEx audit , it’s earning credibility. With meme coin energy rising and few fresh contenders in the space, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be uniquely positioned to capitalize on retail excitement. Its branding, scarcity model, and early momentum place it firmly on trader watchlists. July Momentum Matrix Asset Retail Appeal Breakout Potential Risk Level Q3 Catalyst SHIBA INU High Moderate–High Medium Accumulation + token burns DOGE Very High High Medium–High Social sentiment + Layer-2 use case XRP Medium Moderate Low ETF news + legal updates Solana Medium Moderate Medium DeFi expansion + ETF speculation MAGACOIN Very High Very High High Viral presale + staking rewards Final Verdict If retail buying returns in full force this July, SHIBA INU and DOGE could lead the rally in terms of percentage gains. XRP and Solana will likely remain long-term winners—but their short-term upside may be capped by their current valuation and regulatory dependence.

Related Reading: Insane Or Insightful? VC Firm Says XRP Could Reach Nearly $9,000 In Just 5 Years Vice President J.D. Vance provided the tie‑breaking vote that sealed the deal for the $4.5 trillion package. The package contains major tax reductions, deeper border security funding, and substantial cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP. No crypto‑specific language was included, but lawmakers attempted to insert a tax benefit for digital currencies during last minute wrangling. Bitcoin Dips Before Quick Rebound Based on reports from crypto exchanges, Bitcoin slid to about $106,344 just before the vote as traders held off on big bets. Once the Senate approved the bill, BTC jumped back above $107,800. That’s a swing of roughly $1,400 in a single session, or about 1.3%. Some traders said they sold into the dip and bought back in once the outcome was clear. Others just shook their heads and waited for the next news headline. Altcoins And Liquidations Take A Hit Ethereum barely moved, dipping 0.3%, while XRP fell about 0.7% on the day. Solana saw the biggest wobble, dropping as much as 6% during trading. In total, more than $219 million in liquidations hit the broader crypto market. Bitcoin alone accounted for roughly $60 million of that, as leveraged positions got squeezed when prices spiked back up. Crypto Stocks See Gains Stocks tied to digital assets also rallied on the bill’s passage. MicroStrategy (now Strategy) shares climbed around 3.2%, and Coinbase jumped 2.3% in early trading on Tuesday. Those moves outpaced the Nasdaq’s modest gains.

The traders will be watching closely for the next inflation reading and for any signals from the Federal Reserve. If a rise in prices drives the Fed to more increases, crypto markets may come under new strain. However, others view the Senate vote as another reminder that Bitcoin and its cousins can move on significant political news—sometimes in ways not necessarily expected.

The wait is over. Valour, a prominent issuer of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and a subsidiary of DeFi Technologies, has just made a significant move, launching eight new SEK-denominated crypto ETPs on the Spotlight Stock Market in Sweden. This expansion is set to redefine how Swedish investors access a diverse range of digital assets, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative crypto economy. Valour’s Strategic Leap: Revolutionizing Crypto ETPs in Sweden Valour’s latest launch marks a pivotal moment for investors in Sweden. These eight new ETPs are designed to offer exposure to a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), LEO Token (LEO), OKB (OKB), Polygon (POL), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), Arbitrum (ARB), and Stacks (STX). Each of these products carries a competitive 1.9% management fee, making them an attractive option for those seeking managed exposure to the crypto market without the complexities of direct asset ownership. For those new to the concept, an ETP is a type of security that tracks an underlying asset, index, or financial instrument. In this case, Valour’s crypto ETPs allow investors to gain exposure to specific cryptocurrencies through a regulated financial product traded on a traditional stock exchange. This means easier access, enhanced security, and the convenience of trading through existing brokerage accounts, removing the need for crypto wallets or complex exchange registrations. Why Sweden Crypto Investors Are Taking Notice Sweden has long been at the forefront of technological adoption and financial innovation. The launch of these new Sweden crypto ETPs on the Spotlight Stock Market reflects a growing demand from investors in the Nordic region for regulated and transparent ways to participate in the digital asset boom. As more institutional and retail investors seek exposure to cryptocurrencies, the availability of such products on a recognized stock market becomes crucial. This development is not just about convenience; it’s about legitimizing cryptocurrency as a viable asset class within established financial frameworks. It provides a familiar and secure environment for investors who might be hesitant to venture directly into crypto exchanges, offering them peace of mind through regulated channels. Unlocking New Opportunities with Diverse Digital Assets The selection of digital assets included in these new ETPs is particularly noteworthy. Beyond the mainstream Bitcoin and Ethereum, Valour is offering exposure to a range of promising altcoins, each with its unique value proposition: Bitcoin Cash (BCH): A peer-to-peer electronic cash system. LEO Token (LEO): A utility token designed to empower the iFinex ecosystem. OKB (OKB): The global utility token issued by the OK Blockchain Foundation. Polygon (POL): A scaling solution for Ethereum, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Algorand (ALGO): A pure proof-of-stake blockchain designed for speed, security, and decentralization. Filecoin (FIL): A decentralized storage network that allows users to rent out unused hard drive space. Arbitrum (ARB): A layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, improving transaction throughput. Stacks (STX): Brings smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin. This diversification allows investors to tailor their exposure to specific sectors within the crypto market, whether it’s decentralized finance (DeFi), layer-2 scaling, or decentralized storage. It’s a strategic move that acknowledges the evolving landscape of digital assets and the varied interests of investors. Valour ‘s Ambitious Vision: Expanding Regulated Investment Products This launch is part of a larger, ambitious strategy by Valour . With these new listings, the firm’s total ETP offerings now exceed 75, and they have set a target of reaching 100 listings by year-end. This aggressive expansion underscores Valour’s commitment to becoming a leading provider of regulated investment products in the digital asset space. Valour’s mission is clear: to make digital assets accessible and secure for investors worldwide. By continuously expanding its product suite and listing on reputable exchanges, Valour is actively contributing to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, building bridges between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning digital economy. Their consistent growth signifies a strong belief in the long-term potential of blockchain technology and its underlying assets. Benefits and Considerations for Investors Benefits: Regulated Access: Trade crypto exposure through a regulated financial market. Ease of Investment: No need for complex crypto wallets or exchange accounts. Diversification: Access to a broad range of digital assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Security: Benefit from the robust security frameworks of traditional exchanges. Considerations: Management Fees: Be aware of the 1.9% annual management fee. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile; ETPs track this volatility. Regulatory Landscape: While regulated, the broader crypto regulatory environment continues to evolve. The Future of Crypto Investment: Actionable Insights For investors considering these new investment products , it’s crucial to conduct thorough due diligence. Understand the underlying assets, their potential, and the risks involved. While ETPs offer a simplified entry point, the fundamental volatility of the crypto market remains. This move by Valour highlights a clear trend: institutional interest in digital assets is not waning; it’s accelerating. As more regulated products become available, the barrier to entry for traditional investors lowers, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into global financial portfolios. Valour’s launch of eight new SEK-denominated crypto ETPs on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market is a landmark event for the European digital asset landscape. It significantly expands regulated access to a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies, empowering Swedish investors with new, secure avenues for participation. As Valour continues its ambitious journey towards 100 ETP listings, its role in bridging traditional finance with the crypto world becomes increasingly vital, shaping the future of investment in the digital age.

Thesis, a prominent Bitcoin-focused venture studio, has just announced a pivotal Thesis acquisition of Lolli, a popular BTC rewards platform. This strategic move is not just another corporate merger; it’s a powerful step towards building a more comprehensive and user-friendly Bitcoin ecosystem , promising exciting new avenues for users to earn, save, and spend their digital assets. What Does This Thesis Acquisition Mean for Bitcoin Users? In a landscape where Bitcoin continues to solidify its position as digital gold, Thesis has been at the forefront of developing infrastructure that enhances its utility. Their recent acquisition of Lolli, though the financial terms remain undisclosed, signifies a clear intent: to integrate the popular act of earning Bitcoin rewards directly into a broader financial framework. For users, this means a more seamless and intuitive experience when engaging with Bitcoin. Before this deal, Thesis was already known for its innovative projects like Mezo, a Bitcoin-based financial platform, and Threshold Bitcoin (tBTC), a protocol designed to bridge Bitcoin with Ethereum-compatible blockchains. Lolli, on the other hand, made a name for itself by offering users Bitcoin rewards for their everyday online purchases, essentially turning shopping into an opportunity to accumulate BTC. This merger creates a powerful synergy, bringing together a rewards system with robust financial tools and cross-chain interoperability. Imagine earning Bitcoin simply by buying your favorite coffee online, and then being able to instantly save, earn interest on, or even spend that Bitcoin within a unified platform. This is the promise of the Thesis-Lolli integration. It simplifies the process for newcomers to acquire Bitcoin and provides existing enthusiasts with more practical ways to grow and utilize their holdings. How Does Lolli Bitcoin Rewards Fit In? Lolli has been a pioneer in making BTC rewards accessible to the everyday consumer. By partnering with thousands of merchants, Lolli allowed users to earn a percentage of their purchases back in Bitcoin. This innovative approach has been instrumental in onboarding new users to the cryptocurrency space, often without them even realizing they were engaging with Bitcoin directly. With Lolli now part of the Thesis family, its reward mechanism will become a foundational layer for the entire ecosystem. Here’s how it enhances the existing Thesis offerings: Enhanced User Acquisition: Lolli’s easy-to-understand rewards system can serve as a powerful entry point for individuals curious about crypto but hesitant to invest directly. Closed-Loop Economy: Users earn Bitcoin via Lolli, then seamlessly transfer it to Mezo for saving or earning, or utilize tBTC to bridge it to other DeFi applications. This creates a more circular and sticky user experience. Increased Utility: By integrating rewards with financial services, Thesis is making Bitcoin less of a speculative asset and more of a practical currency for daily life. The vision is clear: make earning and using Bitcoin as simple and rewarding as possible. This strategic alignment leverages Lolli’s broad user base and merchant network to funnel more activity into Thesis’s financial and interoperability protocols. Building a Comprehensive Bitcoin Ecosystem : Mezo and tBTC The true power of this acquisition lies in its contribution to building a holistic Bitcoin ecosystem . Thesis’s existing products, Mezo and tBTC, are crucial components of this vision: Mezo: Your Bitcoin Financial Hub Mezo is designed to be a comprehensive financial platform built directly on Bitcoin. It aims to empower users to: Save: Securely hold and grow their Bitcoin assets. Earn: Explore opportunities to earn yield on their BTC holdings, potentially through lending or other DeFi mechanisms. Spend: Facilitate the use of Bitcoin for everyday transactions, moving beyond just holding it as an investment. The integration of Lolli means that the Bitcoin earned from shopping can flow directly into Mezo, where users can then decide how to manage it – whether to hold it, earn on it, or prepare it for spending. This creates a complete financial loop for Bitcoin users. Threshold Bitcoin (tBTC): Bridging Bitcoin to DeFi Another critical piece of the Thesis ecosystem is tBTC. This protocol allows users to “wrap” their Bitcoin, essentially creating a Bitcoin-backed token on Ethereum-compatible blockchains. This opens up a world of possibilities for Bitcoin holders in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, enabling them to: Participate in lending and borrowing protocols on Ethereum. Access decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with their Bitcoin. Engage with various dApps that require Ethereum-based tokens. The combination of Lolli, Mezo, and tBTC paints a picture of a future where Bitcoin is not just a store of value, but a dynamic, versatile asset seamlessly integrated into both traditional commerce and cutting-edge decentralized finance. Driving Crypto Innovation : The Synergy Effect This acquisition is a prime example of how strategic mergers can drive significant crypto innovation . By combining a user-friendly rewards platform with robust financial and interoperability protocols, Thesis is setting a new standard for how users interact with Bitcoin. The synergy created here goes beyond simply adding another feature; it’s about fundamentally enhancing the user journey within the Bitcoin space. The challenges, of course, will involve seamless technical integration, ensuring a smooth user experience across all platforms, and navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. However, the potential benefits are immense: Increased Bitcoin Adoption: Lowering the barrier to entry for new users and providing more practical use cases. Enhanced Utility: Making Bitcoin a more versatile asset for everyday transactions, savings, and DeFi participation. Ecosystem Growth: Attracting more developers and users to build upon and utilize the integrated Thesis ecosystem. This move highlights a growing trend in the crypto industry: moving beyond singular applications to create interconnected ecosystems that offer comprehensive solutions for users. It’s about building the necessary infrastructure for Bitcoin to truly become a global, digital currency. Unlocking More BTC Rewards : What’s Next? For those eager to unlock more BTC rewards and leverage the expanded Thesis ecosystem, the future looks promising. Users can anticipate a more integrated experience where their Bitcoin earnings from Lolli can be directly managed within Mezo, or bridged via tBTC for DeFi opportunities. This means less friction and more opportunities to maximize their Bitcoin holdings. Keep an eye on announcements from Thesis regarding the full integration rollout and any new features that emerge from this powerful combination. This acquisition signals a clear commitment to making Bitcoin not just an investment, but a practical and rewarding part of your financial life. The acquisition of Lolli by Thesis marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the Bitcoin landscape. By bringing together a beloved BTC rewards platform with powerful financial and interoperability tools, Thesis is building a truly comprehensive Bitcoin ecosystem . This strategic move promises to simplify Bitcoin adoption, enhance its utility, and drive further crypto innovation , ultimately benefiting users by providing more avenues to earn, save, and spend their digital assets. The future of Bitcoin utility looks brighter than ever, with Thesis leading the charge in creating a seamless and rewarding experience for all.

47310070,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=759379,1751505929,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47310070.jpeg,Mastercard and Bitget launch a card that spends crypto like cash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mastercard-enables-zero-fee-crypto-card/,"Mastercard and Bitget Wallet have partnered to launch the “zero-fee” crypto card, allowing users to spend their crypto directly from their digital wallets at over 150 million Mastercard merchants worldwide. The card even works with stablecoins like USDC to protect users from Bitcoin and Ethereum’s big price swings. With no fees , the project could benefit regions with unstable currencies or limited access to financial services, as it promises a future where anyone, anywhere, can pay with crypto as easily as they pay with cash or a card. However, there are still costs involved that might not show up clearly to users at the moment of payment, possibly through exchange rates, ATM fees, or blockchain network fees that depend on how busy the system is. Mastercard calls it a win for innovation, and Bitget says the project makes crypto more useful, but critics warn that calling it “zero-fee” will mislead first-time users who don’t fully understand how crypto works. Mastercard and Bitget launch a card that spends crypto like cash The Mastercard–Bitget wallet crypto card results from a partnership between the global payment giant, Mastercard, a non-custodial crypto wallet, Bitget, and a licensed card issuer that handles the on-chain conversions and regulatory requirements, Immersive. Users can pay for goods and services at any physical or online store that accepts Mastercard without moving the funds manually, waiting for exchanges to clear transactions, or using multiple apps to make a simple purchase. The approval process takes a few minutes and involves basic KYC verification and a small issuance fee, currently set at 10 USDC. Users don’t have to pay application or annual fees for the card, nor do they need a credit check or a bank account. They received a virtual version of the card instantly once approved and can also get a physical card upon request. Mastercard and Bitget are currently issuing the card in the United Kingdom and the European Union, but have announced plans to expand into Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand soon. “Zero-Fee” does not mean no costs at all Bitget Wallet and Mastercard’s promise of a “zero-fee” crypto card sounds exciting because there are no barriers to entry, such as application fees , paperwork processing, or minimum balance requirements. Similarly, Bitget Wallet’s “GetGas” feature subsidizes or completely waives initial gas fees for new users and offers ongoing discounts for specific types of transfers (such as TRON USDT). In addition, the first 2,000 cardholders will get 5% cashback in BGB tokens in their first month and profit from staking idle stablecoins like USDC directly from the wallet. Several critics say some fees are simply hidden deeper in the system or show up in less obvious ways. For example, the exchange rate used for crypto-to-fiat conversion could include a small markup that acts as a silent profit margin for the service provider (a “spread”). Users will still pay a cost to convert crypto to their local currency, even though they may not see a charge line in their transaction history. ATM operators or Mastercard’s payment network in foreign countries will likely also charge for withdrawals, and transaction fees may apply when spending in different currencies, depending on the user’s region, the card’s issuer policies, and local banking regulations. To top it all off, users transacting on higher-cost blockchains like Ethereum could pay several dollars per transaction during network congestion once the incentives expire. Bitget only subsidizes some gas fees to specific chains or tokens during the promotional phase. The term “zero-fee” sounds exciting in marketing, but the reality often depends on how a person uses the card. You may experience something close to zero fees if you transact mostly in USDC on the Base chain, shop with online merchants in the same country, and never use an ATM. But you’ll pay far more than expected if you shop across borders, switch assets frequently, or interact with other networks. Rules and security could slow down adoption The “zero-fee” card feels more reliable than many earlier crypto payment experiments that lacked such oversight due to Mastercard’s long track record in global payments and its strict compliance protocols. Yet, there are concerns about how secure and future-proof this new product is because the legal and regulatory landscape for crypto payments is far from settled. For starters, the expected Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework in the European Union will introduce strict rules for companies that deal with digital assets, especially stablecoins. Stablecoin users must meet reserve requirements, publish whitepapers, and register with EU regulators. The exact interpretation of MiCA may require Bitget, Immersve, or even Mastercard to change how they handle custody, transaction settlement, or disclosure practices, even though the Bitget Wallet card currently supports USDC. The situation is more fragmented outside the EU, as countries have completely different standards for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules. Some users may face sudden disruptions if local rules change, while others may not complete the identity checks needed to activate their card. Similarly, giving out detailed personal information just to spend crypto might feel like a step backward for users who value privacy or live under strict regimes. Bitget Wallet is also non-custodial, meaning users control their private keys and funds, but it also puts responsibility squarely on the user. There may be no way to recover funds if you lose access to their wallet, forget their recovery phrase, or fall for a phishing scam. The risks multiply in countries with low digital literacy or limited consumer protection laws. Bitget may have a large user protection fund, reportedly worth over $300 million, but they haven’t said when and how those funds would be used to reimburse users in case of fraud, technical error, or regulatory shutdowns. The card still operates in a space regulators struggle to fully define, even with Mastercard’s extensive infrastructure and compliance team involved. What’s compliant today might not be compliant tomorrow. For instance, Bitget and its partners could be forced to redesign the entire payment process if the U.S. introduces its own version of MiCA, or if a court reclassifies USDC or other stablecoins as securities. There’s no guarantee that this product can remain stable and usable long-term unless it continuously adapts to the fast-changing legal environment. Mastercard and Bitget may benefit more than users There are moral concerns about whether this is truly a democratizing tool or a privilege for high-volume traders and loyal customers because the card’s initial exclusivity was limited to Bitget VIP users by invitation only when it launched. The controlled launch suggests the card may first serve Bitget’s interest in reinforcing user loyalty and collecting transaction insights from its most valuable customer segment. The card’s design also creates strong incentives that tether users more tightly to the Bitget ecosystem, especially new users unfamiliar with the broader crypto landscape, or prefer convenience over independence. Every crypto-to-fiat transaction processed through Mastercard’s network reinforces the company’s role as a trusted middle layer. It gives it data about how crypto users behave, such as what they spend, where they spend it, how often, and through which assets. So, who really wins? Users get instant access, a slick user experience, and rewards for participation. Bitget also wins by locking in user loyalty, expanding its footprint in new markets, and growing its native token. Mastercard perhaps wins the most by embedding itself into the future of crypto payments and collecting data to shape the next generation of financial products. However, the promise of decentralization begins to fade if crypto cards replace banks but rely on the same central intermediaries. And while users may enjoy “zero fees,” they may end up paying with their privacy, flexibility, and future choices.

Institutional interest and on-chain momentum continue to strengthen Solana’s position as a high-cap altcoin to watch this quarter. But while SOL grabs headlines, it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s quietly staging what could be one of the most aggressive price movements of 2025. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new DeFi token is gaining serious traction among those who are more interested in utility. Phase 5 Presale of Mutuum Finance is now over 50% sold out and MUTM is priced at $0.03. More than 12,600 investors have joined the Mutuum Finance presale. The sum of more than $11.4 million has been collected. Mutuum Finance is rapidly being labeled the next big crypto, and possibly the most underrated player entering Q3. Solana’s ETF-Driven Outlook Solana (SOL) is trading at a price of $150.30 and this week the coin recorded a high of $152 with the markets trading on a positive note. This comes as SOL ETF approval skyrocket over 90% according to Bloomberg. Seven companies have filed for a spot Solana ETF including – Fidelity and Bitwise. With more mainstream visibility and new evidence that staking-enabled ETFs could indeed become a trend sooner rather than later, Solana is now one of the top-tier altcoins that will be closely monitored and it may promptly face some serious competition in the DeFi arena from a new coin called Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Investor Interest in Mutuum Finance Presale Soars Mutuum Finance is gaining significant momentum in Phase 5 of the presale. The project stands out from others by offering a scalable system of finance with a real-world use case. Investor interest is gaining momentum with the project having raised well over $11.4 million already and having over 12,600 token holders. Introducing a DeFi Lending Model Mutuum Finance introduces a non-custodial liquidity protocol in which users retain their total ownership of assets while they participate in decentralized lending. The project adopts a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to foster increased flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to deliver automated lending without any human intervention and instead, the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model removes middlemen and thus offers a direct link between lenders and borrowers. The model is highly favored by users in dealing with volatile assets where flexibility and tailor-made terms are required. CertiK-Audited with a $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is also operating on the development of the fully collateralized Ethereum-based USD-backed stablecoin. The project incorporates smart contracts that are audited by security company, CertiK. Besides the guarantee of ensuring good maintenance of the code, this audit signifies that the team will be persistent to build a safe protocol DeFi. In order to reinforce this commitment, Mutuum Finance has implemented its Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK through which it has allocated $50,000 in USDT rewards. The program has four levels, critical, major, minor, and low, and makes sure that any level of vulnerabilities are discovered and rewarded. Solana may rally on ETF approval, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as the real breakout. Priced at $0.03, over $11.4M raised, and 12,600+ investors in, MUTM’s audited DeFi model and growing demand hint at a potential 45x surge. Act early.

If you are interested in the cutting edge of financial innovation, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrencies, then the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF is something you need to understand. This groundbreaking fund is not just another addition to the growing list of crypto investment products; it is the first U.S.-listed crypto ETF to combine direct token exposure with the lucrative potential of staking rewards under the stringent Investment Company Act of 1940. This is a monumental step, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the dynamic world of decentralized yield. What Makes This Solana ETF a Game Changer? For years, investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies in a regulated framework have primarily been limited to futures-based products or private placements. The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF, brought to market by U.S. asset managers Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, fundamentally changes this narrative. It offers direct exposure to Solana (SOL), one of the leading high-performance blockchain platforms, known for its speed and scalability. But what truly sets this fund apart is its integration of staking rewards. Direct Exposure: Unlike futures ETFs that track derivatives, this fund directly holds Solana tokens, providing a more authentic price correlation. Staking Rewards Pass-Through: Investors in the ETF will receive the benefits of staking rewards generated by the underlying Solana holdings. This means potential passive income in addition to any capital appreciation of the SOL token. 1940 Act Classification: Operating under the Investment Company Act of 1940 signifies a higher level of investor protection and regulatory oversight, aligning it with traditional mutual funds and ETFs. This classification can instill greater confidence among institutional and retail investors wary of the unregulated crypto market. This structure is a significant departure from previous U.S. crypto ETFs, which have largely focused on Bitcoin futures. By incorporating staking, the REX-Osprey fund introduces a yield component that is common in the crypto space but has been absent from regulated investment vehicles until now. It’s a clear signal that the financial industry is finding innovative ways to package and deliver the unique benefits of blockchain technology within established regulatory frameworks. Why Anchorage Digital for This Pioneering Move? The success and security of a staking-enabled ETF hinge critically on the choice of its custodian and staking partner. Rex Shares and Osprey Funds have selected Anchorage Digital as the exclusive custodian and staking partner for this innovative Solana ETF. This choice is not arbitrary; Anchorage Digital holds a federal banking charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), making it a highly regulated and trusted entity in the crypto banking sector. Anchorage Digital’s role is multifaceted and essential: Secure Custody: As a qualified custodian, Anchorage is responsible for securely holding the underlying Solana tokens. Their institutional-grade security measures and regulatory compliance are paramount for a fund operating under the 1940 Act. Staking Facilitation: Anchorage manages the technical complexities of staking the Solana tokens. This includes selecting validators, delegating tokens, and ensuring the efficient collection and distribution of staking rewards. This removes the operational burden and technical risks from the ETF managers and, by extension, the investors. Regulatory Assurance: Their OCC charter provides a layer of regulatory assurance that is crucial for attracting traditional financial institutions and cautious investors. It signifies that Anchorage operates under strict banking standards, bringing credibility to the nascent crypto asset class. The partnership with Anchorage Digital underscores the fund’s commitment to security, compliance, and institutional-grade infrastructure, which are vital for a product aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. Understanding Staking Rewards : A New Yield Frontier? At the heart of this ETF’s innovation lies the concept of staking rewards. But what exactly is staking, and how do these rewards work? Staking is a core mechanism in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains like Solana. Instead of using energy-intensive mining (like Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work), PoS networks rely on validators who ‘stake’ or lock up a certain amount of the network’s native cryptocurrency (in this case, SOL) as collateral. By staking, validators gain the right to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In return for their service and commitment to network security, they receive new tokens as ‘staking rewards.’ For investors in the REX-Osprey Solana ETF, this means: Passive Income: The ETF’s Solana holdings are staked by Anchorage Digital, generating rewards that are then passed through to the fund’s investors. This offers a potential source of passive income, similar to dividends from stocks or interest from bonds. Yield Generation: In an environment where traditional fixed-income yields have often been low, staking rewards present an attractive alternative for investors seeking yield from their digital asset exposure. Simplified Access: Investors do not need to manage their own crypto wallets, understand staking protocols, or worry about the technical risks associated with direct staking (like ‘slashing,’ where a validator’s staked tokens can be penalized for misbehavior). Anchorage handles all these complexities. While staking rewards offer an enticing yield, it’s important to remember that their value is tied to the underlying asset’s price, which can be volatile. However, the ability to earn yield on top of potential capital appreciation makes this ETF particularly compelling for a broad range of investors. The Broader Impact: How This Crypto ETF Shapes the Future? The launch of a staking-enabled Solana ETF is more than just a product announcement; it’s a bellwether for the future of crypto investment. It signifies a maturation of the crypto market and a growing acceptance by traditional financial institutions. Consider the trajectory of crypto ETFs in the U.S.: Futures-Based ETFs: The initial wave of U.S. crypto ETFs focused on Bitcoin futures, a cautious approach by regulators. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a significant breakthrough, offering direct exposure to the asset. Staking-Enabled ETFs: The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF takes this evolution a step further by integrating yield generation, moving beyond mere price exposure. This progression indicates a regulatory and market willingness to explore the full spectrum of crypto’s financial capabilities. For the broader market, this could mean: Increased Institutional Adoption: Providing a regulated, yield-generating product makes crypto more palatable for pension funds, endowments, and other institutional investors with mandates for income generation. Mainstream Integration: As more sophisticated crypto products become available through traditional investment channels, the barrier to entry for retail investors decreases, fostering wider adoption. Precedent for Other Assets: This success could pave the way for staking-enabled ETFs for other major Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), which recently transitioned to PoS. The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF is not just an investment vehicle; it’s a testament to the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the decentralized economy, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in a regulated environment. Navigating the Landscape of Regulated Crypto Investment The journey of crypto products through the U.S. regulatory landscape has been complex and often challenging. The fact that the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF operates under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is a critical detail, highlighting a significant step forward in regulatory clarity and investor protection. The 1940 Act is a cornerstone of U.S. financial regulation, governing mutual funds and other investment companies. Funds regulated under this act are subject to strict rules regarding: Disclosure: Comprehensive and transparent reporting to investors. Governance: Independent boards of directors overseeing fund operations. Diversification: Rules often encourage diversification, though single-asset ETFs like this one receive specific exemptions or structures. Custody: Requirements for qualified custodians to hold assets securely. This level of oversight provides investors with a sense of security and legitimacy that has often been missing from direct crypto investments. It also sets a precedent for how future crypto products, especially those involving yield generation, might be structured and approved. However, the regulatory environment remains dynamic. While this ETF represents progress, ongoing discussions about the classification of digital assets, consumer protection, and market integrity will continue to shape the future of regulated crypto investment. This fund demonstrates that with robust infrastructure and a commitment to compliance, innovative crypto products can find their place within established financial frameworks, opening doors for massive capital inflow into the digital asset space. Benefits and Opportunities The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF offers several compelling benefits: Simplified Access: Invest in Solana and earn staking rewards through a familiar brokerage account. Enhanced Security: Leverage Anchorage Digital’s institutional-grade custody and the 1940 Act’s regulatory oversight. Yield Potential: Access to passive income from Solana staking, a feature previously complex for traditional investors. Diversification: Add exposure to a high-performance blockchain with yield potential to your portfolio. Reduced Operational Burden: No need to manage private keys, understand staking mechanisms, or worry about slashing risks. Potential Considerations and Challenges While innovative, investors should be aware of potential considerations: Market Volatility: Solana, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to significant price fluctuations. Regulatory Evolution: Future changes in crypto regulation could impact the fund’s operations or tax treatment. Staking Yield Fluctuations: Staking reward rates can vary based on network conditions and validator performance. Expense Ratios: Like all ETFs, there will be management fees that could impact overall returns. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Staking ETFs? The launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF is a powerful signal. It demonstrates that the U.S. regulatory environment is gradually becoming more accommodating to sophisticated crypto products. This could pave the way for a new generation of investment vehicles that not only provide exposure to digital assets but also harness their unique, yield-generating capabilities. We might see similar products emerge for other Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. In conclusion, the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF, with Anchorage Digital as its secure backbone, marks a transformative moment for regulated crypto investment. By combining direct Solana exposure with the lucrative potential of staking rewards under a robust regulatory framework, it offers a new pathway for investors to engage with the rapidly expanding digital asset economy. This fund is not just an investment product; it is a testament to the ongoing innovation and maturation of the cryptocurrency market within the global financial landscape, setting a powerful precedent for the future.

Long-standing names like XRP and Litecoin (LTC) are starting to mimic their behavior from the early days of the 2021 bull cycle —characterized by ETF speculation, improving regulatory clarity, and rising network participation. Analysts are interpreting this activity as a macro signal: the groundwork for another altcoin surge may be forming. But while major tokens gear up under institutional pressure, one lesser-known asset is already riding a wave of speculative energy: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Backed by meme culture and political engagement, it’s earning attention from traders betting on high-upside narratives before listings hit. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Builds Ahead of Exchange Listings While XRP and Litecoin anchor the top end of the market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting early capital through grassroots energy. Blending viral political themes with meme coin momentum, this new entrant has drawn comparisons to early-stage PEPE and SHIBA INU . What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its timing. Still in presale, the token has not yet hit exchanges—making it one of the few projects where traders can enter before any formal market exposure. With a capped supply of 170 billion tokens , a completed audit by HashEx , and early wallet activity climbing, the project is on many early-stage watchlists. As social sentiment begins to turn, the potential for a retail-fueled rally is increasing—and MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the main beneficiaries. XRP Regains Momentum After Regulatory Milestone XRP has taken a leadership role among altcoins since Ripple’s legal victory over the SEC in March 2025. With institutional barriers now significantly reduced, XRP is widely expected to become one of the first altcoins approved for a spot ETF , possibly as early as Q3. This potential approval is being treated as a high-impact catalyst. In the past, both Bitcoin and Ethereum saw rapid inflows and price appreciation following ETF approvals—analysts believe XRP could follow a similar path. On the technical front, XRP is trading in a consolidation zone between $1.95 and $2.53 , with a breakout above $2.88 seen as a signal for larger gains. Expanded utility via EVM-compatible chains and cross-border adoption is also strengthening its long-term thesis. Litecoin Builds Quietly With Institutional Tailwinds Litecoin may not have captured headlines like newer Layer-1s, but its fundamentals remain solid. A 20% price dip in Q2 has actually reset its positioning for a possible rebound. Analysts point to historical patterns—LTC has often rallied hardest following drawdowns, especially when supported by regulatory momentum. Now viewed as a potential ETF candidate, Litecoin’s simplicity, speed, and fixed supply are making it attractive to institutions diversifying beyond Bitcoin. Price targets vary: $130–$200 in conservative cases, and $700+ in bullish, ETF-fueled projections. Implications for the Broader Altcoin Market Historically, altcoin cycles begin with momentum in large-cap names before spreading to smaller, speculative assets. With both XRP and Litecoin flashing bullish signals, analysts suggest the altcoin sector is entering a preparatory phase. Macro conditions—like stabilizing interest rates and shifting regulatory dynamics—are aligning in a way not seen since early 2021. That’s why speculative attention is now turning to narrative-driven plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which offer greater upside potential and lower entry points. Final Word: The Rotation Is Underway XRP and Litecoin are re-establishing themselves as institutional favorites. But as altcoin momentum builds, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE could see accelerated growth—especially if meme sentiment returns. For investors who missed early entries in 2021, the current environment offers a second shot. And for those watching from the sidelines, it may be time to look at the tokens gaining traction now—not after they’ve run.

This futuristic vision is now a stunning reality, thanks to a groundbreaking collaboration between Binance Pay and the innovative French fintech, Lyzi. This partnership is set to transform the way tourists and locals alike engage with crypto payments in one of Europe’s most glamorous destinations, ushering in a new era of financial convenience and accessibility. Binance Pay’s Bold Expansion into the French Riviera: A Game Changer? The announcement that Binance Pay has teamed up with Lyzi marks a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. This strategic alliance isn’t just about enabling a few niche transactions; it’s about embedding digital payments into the very fabric of daily life across a renowned luxury hotspot. With over 80 businesses already on board, from exquisite hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants to exclusive beach clubs and high-end luxury retailers, the scope of this initiative is truly impressive. For those unfamiliar, Binance Pay is a secure, user-friendly, and borderless cryptocurrency payment technology developed by Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It allows users to send and receive crypto payments globally, instantly, and with zero transaction fees on Binance-to-Binance transfers. Its integration into the French Riviera’s vibrant economy signifies a strong vote of confidence in the future of digital assets as a viable payment method, especially in a region synonymous with international tourism and discerning clientele. How Seamless Crypto Payments Are Redefining Transactions: What’s the Experience Like? The beauty of this new system lies in its simplicity and efficiency. For consumers, the process of making crypto payments is designed to be as smooth as possible: Scan and Pay: Customers simply scan a QR code displayed at the point of sale using their Binance app. Instant Confirmation: The transaction is confirmed almost instantly, allowing for a swift checkout experience. Zero Gas Fees: A major advantage is the elimination of gas fees, which can often be a barrier for smaller crypto transactions on other networks. This makes using stablecoins and other digital assets for everyday purchases incredibly cost-effective. Diverse Asset Support: The system supports a wide range of stablecoins and other digital assets, offering flexibility to users. But the benefits aren’t just for the customers. Merchants stand to gain significantly too. By accepting digital asset payments , businesses can tap into a growing demographic of tech-savvy consumers and international tourists who prefer or exclusively use cryptocurrencies. This can lead to increased sales, reduced chargebacks (common in traditional payment systems), and potentially lower processing fees compared to some credit card networks. It also positions these businesses at the forefront of financial innovation, enhancing their appeal in a competitive market. The Strategic Lyzi Partnership: A Local Gateway to Global Digital Assets The role of Lyzi in this collaboration cannot be overstated. As a French fintech company, Lyzi brings crucial local expertise, regulatory understanding, and a network of existing business relationships to the table. While Binance provides the global infrastructure and vast user base, Lyzi acts as the vital bridge, ensuring seamless integration with local payment systems and compliance with regional regulations. This Lyzi partnership is a classic example of how global blockchain giants can effectively localize their services through strategic alliances. It mitigates potential challenges related to cultural nuances, language barriers, and the complexities of national financial regulations. By leveraging Lyzi’s established presence, Binance Pay can offer a truly tailored and compliant solution for businesses and consumers in the French Riviera , making the adoption of digital asset payments not just possible, but practical and appealing. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Asset Payments? This initiative on the French Riviera serves as a powerful case study for the broader adoption of digital asset payments . It demonstrates that with the right partnerships and technological infrastructure, cryptocurrencies can move beyond speculative investments and become a legitimate, convenient medium of exchange for everyday goods and services, even in high-value sectors like luxury tourism. However, the road ahead is not without its challenges. Regulatory clarity remains an evolving landscape globally, and user education is paramount. While stablecoins mitigate volatility concerns for merchants, widespread understanding of how to manage and use digital assets is still developing. Yet, this partnership offers actionable insights for other regions and businesses looking to embrace the crypto economy: Focus on User Experience: Simplicity and speed are key to mass adoption. Strategic Local Partnerships: Collaborating with local fintechs can navigate regulatory and market specificities. Educate and Inform: Providing clear guidance to both merchants and consumers is crucial for building trust. Highlight Practical Benefits: Emphasize zero fees, instant transactions, and global accessibility. The success of this venture could inspire similar initiatives in other tourist hotspots and commercial centers worldwide, gradually normalizing the use of digital currencies in everyday transactions. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Crypto in Tourism? The Binance Pay and Lyzi collaboration is just the beginning. As the world becomes increasingly digital, the tourism sector, known for its adaptability and innovation, is ripe for further blockchain integration. We might see future developments such as: NFT-based Loyalty Programs: Rewarding frequent visitors with unique digital collectibles or exclusive access. Tokenized Travel Experiences: Purchasing specific tours or services as non-fungible tokens. Decentralized Booking Platforms: Cutting out intermediaries to offer more direct and potentially cheaper travel options. Expanded Stablecoin Use: More businesses accepting a wider array of stablecoins to mitigate volatility risks. The French Riviera , with its blend of timeless elegance and forward-thinking spirit, is perfectly positioned to lead this charge, setting a precedent for how luxury and technology can coalesce. Conclusion: A New Era of Financial Freedom on the French Riviera The partnership between Binance Pay and Lyzi to enable crypto payments across the French Riviera is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a bold statement about the future of finance. It signifies a tangible step towards a world where digital assets are not just speculative investments but practical, everyday tools for commerce and convenience. For residents and visitors alike, it unlocks a new level of financial freedom, making transactions seamless, secure, and truly borderless.

Imagine a future where exclusive investment opportunities, once reserved for a select few, become widely accessible. This isn’t just a distant dream; it’s a rapidly approaching reality, as highlighted by influential figures like U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins. His recent comments on CNBC’s Squawk Box have ignited significant discussion, suggesting that this technological advancement is set to democratize private markets and reshape how we think about ownership and investment. What is Stock Tokenization and Why Does it Matter? At its core, stock tokenization involves converting traditional assets, such as shares in a company, into digital tokens on a blockchain. Think of these tokens as digital representations of ownership, imbued with the security and transparency features inherent to blockchain technology. This process isn’t merely about digitizing a certificate; it’s about fundamentally changing the underlying infrastructure of how assets are issued, traded, and managed. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works: Asset Representation: A company’s shares are digitized and represented as tokens on a blockchain network. Fractional Ownership: These tokens can be divided into smaller units, allowing for fractional ownership of high-value assets. Smart Contracts: The terms and conditions of the asset (e.g., voting rights, dividend distribution) are embedded within smart contracts, automating processes. Global Accessibility: Once tokenized, these assets can potentially be traded 24/7 on global digital exchanges, transcending geographical and time-zone barriers. The implications of this shift are enormous, particularly for markets that have historically been opaque and illiquid. The Exclusive World of Private Markets: A Challenge to Investment Accessibility Historically, private markets – encompassing investments in private companies, real estate, and alternative assets – have been the domain of institutional investors, venture capitalists, and high-net-worth individuals. These markets offer significant potential for growth and diversification but are often characterized by: High Entry Barriers: Minimum investment amounts are typically very large, excluding most retail investors. Illiquidity: Investments are often locked up for long periods, with limited options for early exit. Lack of Transparency: Information can be scarce, and pricing mechanisms are less clear than in public markets. Complex Processes: Legal and administrative hurdles can be extensive and costly. This exclusivity has long posed a significant challenge to true investment accessibility , creating a divide between those with substantial capital and the everyday investor seeking diverse opportunities. Many promising ventures and valuable assets remain out of reach for the average person, limiting their potential for wealth creation and participation in innovative projects. SEC Chair Paul Atkins’ Vision: Opening Doors The comments from SEC Chair Paul Atkins on CNBC’s Squawk Box are particularly significant because they come from a key regulatory figure. His assertion that stock tokenization will “open up private markets” signals a growing recognition within regulatory bodies of the transformative potential of this technology. This isn’t just a technical discussion; it’s a policy statement that acknowledges the current limitations of private markets and sees tokenization as a viable solution. While the SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection and market integrity, Atkins’ perspective suggests a willingness to explore how new technologies can align with these goals while simultaneously fostering innovation and broadening participation. This forward-looking stance is crucial for building the necessary regulatory frameworks that will allow tokenized securities to flourish safely and responsibly. His remarks underscore a shift in thinking: from viewing blockchain purely as a disruptor to recognizing its potential as an enabler of more inclusive and efficient financial systems. This endorsement from such a high-profile figure can provide the confidence needed for traditional financial institutions to further explore and adopt tokenization. Revolutionizing Investment Accessibility Through Tokenization The most compelling promise of stock tokenization lies in its ability to dramatically enhance investment accessibility . How exactly does it achieve this? Feature of Tokenization Impact on Investment Accessibility Fractional Ownership Allows investors to buy small portions of high-value assets (e.g., a fraction of a skyscraper, a piece of a rare artwork, or a small stake in a startup), significantly lowering entry barriers. Increased Liquidity Tokens can be traded on secondary markets, offering investors the ability to exit their positions more easily than with traditional private investments, reducing lock-up periods. Global Reach Digital nature allows investors from anywhere in the world to participate, expanding the pool of potential investors and investment opportunities. Reduced Costs & Efficiency Automated processes via smart contracts can cut down on intermediaries, legal fees, and administrative overhead, making investments more cost-effective. Transparency & Auditability Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, verifiable record of ownership and transactions, fostering trust and reducing fraud. Imagine a retail investor being able to own a small, liquid piece of a burgeoning startup before it goes public, or diversifying their portfolio with a share of a commercial real estate property. This level of granular control and flexibility was previously unimaginable for the average investor, but tokenization makes it a tangible reality. The Broader Impact on Digital Assets and the Future of Finance The conversation around stock tokenization is not isolated; it’s part of a larger narrative about the evolution of digital assets and the future of finance. As traditional assets migrate onto blockchain networks, the lines between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) begin to blur. This convergence holds immense potential for creating a more interconnected, efficient, and equitable global financial system. The rise of tokenized securities could pave the way for: New Financial Products: Hybrid instruments that combine features of traditional securities with the programmability of digital assets. Enhanced Market Infrastructure: Faster settlement times, reduced counterparty risk, and lower operational costs across the board. Increased Liquidity Across Asset Classes: Not just stocks, but also bonds, real estate, intellectual property, and even unique collectibles could become more liquid. Greater Innovation: A fertile ground for fintech companies to build new services and platforms on top of tokenized ecosystems. While the journey is still in its early stages, the momentum is undeniable. Major financial institutions, tech giants, and governments are all exploring the possibilities, recognizing that digital assets are not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift. Navigating the Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities Despite the immense promise, the widespread adoption of stock tokenization and the opening of private markets are not without challenges. These include: Regulatory Clarity: Defining how existing securities laws apply to tokenized assets across different jurisdictions is paramount. The SEC, like other regulators globally, is working to provide clearer guidelines. Technological Scalability: Blockchain networks need to handle the immense transaction volume required for global financial markets. Security and Custody: Ensuring the robust security of digital assets and establishing trusted custody solutions are critical for investor confidence. Interoperability: Different blockchain networks and traditional financial systems need to be able to communicate seamlessly. Investor Education: A significant effort is needed to educate the public about the benefits and risks of investing in tokenized securities. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities for innovation and collaboration. The financial industry, technology developers, and regulators must work together to build a robust, secure, and accessible ecosystem for tokenized securities. Actionable Insights for the Future For investors, businesses, and policymakers, understanding the trajectory of stock tokenization is crucial: For Investors: Stay informed about regulatory developments and new platforms offering tokenized securities. Diversify your portfolio cautiously, understanding the risks associated with novel investment vehicles. Consider exploring platforms that prioritize compliance and investor protection. For Businesses/Issuers: Evaluate how tokenization can help you raise capital more efficiently, attract a broader investor base, and enhance liquidity for your shares. Engage with legal and blockchain experts to ensure compliance and a robust technical implementation. For Policymakers/Regulators: Continue to foster an environment that balances innovation with investor protection. Develop clear, adaptable frameworks that encourage responsible growth in the digital asset space without stifling progress. The Unstoppable March Towards a Tokenized Future The comments from SEC Chair Paul Atkins serve as a powerful affirmation: stock tokenization is not just a technological curiosity but a strategic imperative that promises to fundamentally alter the landscape of private markets . By enabling fractional ownership, enhancing liquidity, and reducing barriers, it holds the key to unprecedented investment accessibility for a global audience. As the world increasingly embraces digital assets , the vision of a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent financial system moves closer to reality. While challenges remain, the collective drive towards this future is undeniable, promising a revolutionary era for investors worldwide.

No Certainty in NEAR & TAO Price Patterns?,https://thecoinrise.com/50m-bdag-coins-in-the-pool-heres-how-to-win-blockdags-buyer-battles-no-certainty-in-near-tao-price-patterns/,"Uncertainty is circling nearly every corner of the market. The Bittensor (TAO) price pattern is wobbling at $310, a level that’s held once, but looks shakier with each retest. Near Protocol isn’t faring much better. With a NEAR price drop of nearly 5% and volume down 27%, pressure is mounting. Both coins sit at technical tipping points. Breakdowns are possible. So are rebounds. But neither gives clear conviction right now. BlockDAG (BDAG) is operating in a different lane entirely. The presale price is currently fixed at $0.0016 until August 11, far below the confirmed $0.05 launch level. Add the 50 million Buyer Battle rewards on top, and the math starts leaning heavily in the buyers’ favour. While others brace for what’s next, BlockDAG holders are already in position. TAO Price Pattern at Risk: Will $310 Hold Again? The Bittensor (TAO) price pattern is looking fragile. After another failed breakout under $340, TAO has slipped back to a familiar pressure point: the $310 demand zone. This area triggered a bounce in late June, but repeated tests often weaken support. Momentum isn’t helping. The RSI dropped below 42, and the 50 EMA is now acting as resistance near $333. The bearish structure remains intact: lower highs, lower lows, and a trendline that hasn’t budged. Unless the Bittensor (TAO) price pattern flips that resistance and reclaims the EMA, a deeper move toward $295 or lower stays on the table. NEAR Price Drop Under Review: Is This the Breakdown Before a Breakout? The Near Protocol (NEAR) price drop, down nearly 5% in 24 hours, mirrors Bitcoin’s broader slide, dragging many altcoins along with it. NEAR now trades at $2.04 with volume slipping 27%, but there’s more to this than panic selling. Technically, NEAR is hugging the upper edge of a descending channel, a structure that often precedes upside breaks. If bulls can flip this resistance, targets at $2.70 and $3.65 come into focus. For now, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price drop reads more like a test than a failure. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Heat Up with $50M in Rewards at Stake Buyer Battles have gone from a quiet incentive to one of the most talked-about features of the BlockDAG presale. And now, with the reward pool hitting 50 million BDAG, it’s become a serious mechanism for value. The logic is simple. Each day, BDAG sets a target allocation. If that target isn’t fully met, whatever remains is handed over to the top buyer of the day. That top buyer doesn’t get a thank-you note. They get the actual unsold BDAG coins, often worth tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. With the presale price currently locked at $0.0016 until August 11 and the launch price confirmed at $0.05, the ROI potential here is real and measurable. This structure creates more than urgency. It creates a reason to act with volume. BlockDAG’s crypto presale has already pulled in over $329 million, with more than 23.6 billion BDAG sold and counting. What makes it even sharper is the timing. The network’s Global Launch release is scheduled for August 11. As the presale supply thins and demand swells, missing the top spot might mean missing the surplus. But even those who don’t win the daily battle still gain from the price entry itself. Overall, BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles aren’t just about winning. They’re about entering while real upside still exists. Which Is the Best Crypto to Buy for 2025? In a market where short-term pressure is testing conviction, each asset is telling a different part of the same story: opportunity hasn’t vanished; it’s just evolving. The Bittensor (TAO) price pattern is hanging by a thread near $310, with weakening momentum and a bearish trendline pointing to possible downside. The Near Protocol (NEAR) price drop, while sharp, still holds technical structure, hugging a descending channel that often flips before a breakout. And BlockDAG is taking a different path altogether: $329 million raised, 23.6 billion BDAG sold, and the Buyer Battle pool of 50 million BDAG driving serious volume. For anyone wondering which is the best crypto to buy for 2025 , BDAG remains the clear answer.

This new token blends artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, opening up possibilities across various sectors including finance, marketing, and entertainment. Key Differences Between Ruvi AI and Solana While Solana has been a major player due to its efficiency in DeFi applications, Ruvi AI proposes broader applications, promising to penetrate markets that require AI solutions backed by blockchain. This approach not only diversifies its utility but also ensures long-term demand for its tokens. Ruvi AI has just concluded Phase 2 of its presale, offering tokens at a compelling price of $0.015 each. They plan to increase this to $0.07 at the end of the presale, ensuring early investors can anticipate significant returns. Projections suggest the price could soar to $1 per token post-listing, potentially resulting in substantial gains for initial backers. Understanding the Presale Success of Ruvi AI The initial offering stages of Ruvi AI have demonstrated remarkable market interest: With $1.9 million raised during its presale, Ruvi AI showcases strong investor trust. Over 160 million tokens have been sold, indicating high demand. The project has attracted over 1,600 token holders, reflecting a growing community confident in its roadmap. The stability guaranteed by a post-presale price of $0.07 per token sets Ruvi AI apart from volatile new entrants in the crypto market. This move could offer a more secure investment compared to speculative tokens, providing clear financial horizons to investors. Enhanced Investment Opportunities through VIP Tiers Ruvi AI introduces an innovative rewards system with VIP tiers that offer sizable bonuses to significant contributors: VIP Tier 2, for a $750 investment, offers a 40% bonus, potentially increasing token values significantly from presale to post-listing prices. VIP Tier 3 increases the bonus to 60% for a $2,100 investment, amplifying potential returns considerably. The most generous, VIP Tier 5, offers a 100% bonus for a $9,600 investment, doubling the investor's token count and potentially resulting in substantial financial gains. Partnerships and Operational Transparency Ruvi AI's strategic collaborations and transparent operations act as trust-builders. The project's recent audit by CyberScope promises security and reliability, while its partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures liquidity post-presale. The broader applicability of Ruvi AI in real-world scenarios significantly extends beyond the confines of DeFi and NFTs, which are the primary focus of Solana. This versatility could make Ruvi AI a pivotal player in the blockchain space. Final Take: Is Ruvi AI a Worthwhile Investment? Combining AI and blockchain technology, Ruvi AI presents a compelling investment opportunity, especially for those who join during its early stages. The planned price growth, coupled with innovative applications and firm security measures, positions it as a formidable contender in the evolving blockchain landscape.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The newly launched REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) , the first crypto staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in the U.S., ended the day with $33 million in volume, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas calling the launch better than the average ETF listing. The ETF offers investors indirect access to Solana while earning staking rewards without needing technical expertise. While the volume was much lower than the launch of BTC and ETH ETFs, Balchunas noted that the trading volume was much stronger than recent Solana futures ETF listings or XRP futures ETFs launches. SOL is trading above $150 on the news, up roughly 4%, according to CoinDesk market data . In late May, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that crypto staking does not violate securities laws, paving the way for issuers to offer such staking products. There's no ETH staking ETF currently offered in the U.S., although 3iQ offers one on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Hong Kong's market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, released staking rules in April , and local issuers offer ETH staking ETFs on the city's stock exchange. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Now Out-Earns Its Flagship S&P 500 Fund BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) is now generating more annual revenue than its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to a new report by Presto Research. IBIT, with just $75 billion in assets under management, is expected to bring in $187.2 million a year from its 0.25% fee. IVV, by contrast, holds a massive $624 billion but charges just 0.03%, yielding slightly less in absolute revenue. The difference isn’t just a quirk of fee structures—it’s a window into how institutional investors view crypto exposure in 2025. “IBIT’s fees are 8.3 times higher than IVV’s,” Presto Research notes, “but investors are paying up.” In a world where every basis point usually matters, the willingness to pay a premium for BTC via a trusted wrapper underscores just how early we are in crypto’s institutional adoption cycle. As Presto points out, even Coinbase’s base spot trading fee is higher, at 60 bps. IBIT’s growth story also highlights the power of brand. Institutions want Bitcoin—but they want it with BlackRock’s name on the label. While S&P 500 ETFs have become commoditized, crypto ETFs still command premium pricing. With IBIT holding the lion’s share of Bitcoin ETF market inflows, it’s increasingly clear: the institutionalization of crypto isn’t coming. It’s already happening. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin surged 3.6% over 24 hours to break above $109,000, buoyed by strong volume, new support between $109,064–$109,359, and improving global sentiment following the US-Vietnam trade deal despite continued Middle East tensions. ETH: ETH surged 8.6% to $2,608 in a high-volume breakout fueled by growing institutional interest and bullish momentum, forming new support at $2,565 and testing resistance near $2,617. Gold: HSBC raised its 2025–2026 gold price forecasts to $3,215 and $3,125 per ounce, citing geopolitical risks and strong investor demand, according to Reuters. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.15%, as investors awaited details of the U.S.-Vietnam trade deal announced by President Trump. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.47% to 6,227.42 on Wednesday after Trump announced a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal, though a surprise drop in June private payrolls raised economic concerns.

The crypto market is heating up again, and serious moves are happening. Solana has just smashed through a key resistance level, and Dogecoin is seeing heavy buying from whales. Altcoins are gaining real momentum. But while many traders chase the usual names, some smart investors are jumping into a project with much bigger potential, Unstaked (UNSD) . Unstaked is a new AI-powered crypto that is still in presale, hitting $10.8 million in just a few days. Its native token, $UNSD, is now priced at just $0.01209. It’s backed by real AI agents that will generate on-chain revenue. The best part? These AI agents will go live after the project launches. With a future price target of $5, early buyers could see gains of over 400x. If you’re wondering which crypto will explode next, UNSD could be it! Solana Price Hits 164 With ETF Buzz Solana’s price has grabbed attention this week, jumping from $148 to around $164.5. The rally followed strong volume and positive technical signals. A whale wallet unstaked over $221 million in SOL, moving some to exchanges. The market absorbed it well, showing strong demand. On-chain metrics also look solid. Total Value Locked (TVL) is close to $8.8 billion, and active DApp users are increasing. Traders are eyeing a breakout above $168 to $172, with targets at $185 to $200. Some analysts even predict $300 in the longer term. Speculation about a potential Solana ETF adds more fuel to the move. With growing open interest, bullish MACD, and DeFi strength, Solana could keep rising if it clears key resistance.. Dogecoin Breakout Looms Amid Whale Activity Dogecoin is seeing a major surge in whale buying and on-chain activity. In the last 24 hours alone, DOGE recorded over $23 billion in large transactions, beating both Bitcoin and Ethereum for the day. Active addresses jumped 35%, hitting 157,000. Big wallets are accumulating DOGE instead of selling it. On the charts, Dogecoin has bounced from about $0.189 to $0.199, with strong volume behind the move. Traders are now watching the $0.198 to $0.20 range closely. A breakout could send DOGE quickly toward $0.22 to $0.24. Some are even targeting $0.30 if momentum continues. There’s also buzz about a possible DOGE ETF, drawing institutional interest. The current rally is not just hype, it’s backed by real data and whale buying. If DOGE clears this key level, it could surprise many traders who thought its big days were over. Unstaked: $10.7 Million Raised With 400x ROI Potential Ahead Currently at $0.01209, Unstaked’s $UNSD token looks hugely undervalued. Its public launch price is set at $0.1819, giving early buyers a possible 28x jump on launch day alone. But what’s more exciting is the long-term target, analysts see it reaching $5. That could turn today’s tiny entry into a 400x return. Unstaked isn’t just selling a token. It’s building a full AI ecosystem with AI agents that will go live post-launch. Through a simple drag-and-drop builder, users can create AI agents with no coding needed. These agents will run on X, Telegram, Discord, and other platforms 24/7. The agents generate real user engagement, and all activity is recorded on-chain. Holders will earn $UNSD based on how well their agents perform, not just from holding the token. These features would be fully functional upon launch. Currently in stage 22 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $10.8 million, with more than 1.2 billion tokens sold. The presale is fair-launch, no private sales or VC control. Buyers love the clear setup, the tech behind it, and the growth potential. So, if you’re asking which crypto could explode next, Unstaked looks like a top pick. And while $UNSD is still below 2 cents, the window for early buying is closing fast. The Final Word Solana’s rally and Dogecoin’s whale activity show that the market is alive again. Solana is aiming for $170+ on ETF hopes, and Dogecoin’s on-chain stats show huge whale buying and user activity. But while these coins are already moving, Unstaked offers a different kind of opportunity: low entry, high potential. At $0.01209, Unstaked’s $UNSD token is still flying under the radar. Its AI-powered platform will let users create money-making agents, and when these agents go live after launch, real revenue will start flowing. Think of it like this: From pennies today, to possibly $5 tomorrow. With a potential 400x return, $UNSD is one to watch. If someone is asking which crypto will explode next, don’t just follow what’s already pumping. Look for what’s still undervalued. Unstaked could be that coin.

Among these are SUI , Optimism (OP) , and a rising early-stage contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE —a politically themed meme coin drawing major interest from forward-looking investors. Analysts now suggest that a power shift may be underway, with under-the-radar tokens offering more compelling near-term setups than some of the market’s traditional leaders. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Entry Before Broader Discovery At the intersection of political energy and meme culture, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a breakout candidate for the second half of 2025. Still in its early fundraising stage, the project has already sold out multiple allocation rounds, signaling serious interest from early-stage buyers and smart money watchers. What’s drawing that attention? Scarcity by Design : A fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, supported by deflationary mechanics, makes it attractive for holders seeking strong long-term upside. Exclusive Early Access : Only available via magacoinfinance.com, giving early adopters a rare pre-listing advantage before the token hits mainstream markets. Momentum Building : Early accumulation and repeat wallet activity suggest that accumulation is well underway. Whale Activity : Strategic participation by larger investors points to high expectations around Q3 listings, staking mechanics, and narrative traction. For those seeking the kind of asymmetrical upside not found in more saturated plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a serious watchlist contender. Ethereum: The Market Leader With Slower Short-Term Growth Ethereum continues to serve as the backbone of decentralized applications. With ETF inflows growing, staking reaching new highs, and the Fusaka upgrade on the horizon, ETH remains a top institutional holding. That said, Ethereum’s price action has slowed in recent months. Resistance levels are holding firm, and traders are beginning to diversify into newer assets with greater near-term growth potential. ETH’s long-term case is still strong—but short-term, other names may offer more aggressive ROI setups. Cardano: Steady Progress, But in Need of a Catalyst Cardano’s consistent development and cross-chain ambitions continue to earn praise, especially among infrastructure-focused investors. However, while ADA remains a trusted Layer-1 network, its price growth has been limited. Without a significant event on the horizon, Cardano’s slow and steady progress has made it more of a long-term hold than a Q3 breakout candidate. That’s led some traders to reallocate toward projects with more momentum. SUI: Underestimated Speed and Real Use Cases SUI is fast becoming one of the most efficient Layer-1s on the market. Its Mysticeti protocol enables lightning-fast finality, and usage metrics show steady growth in both DeFi and SocialFi activity. Currently forming a bullish falling wedge pattern, SUI is expected to break out if resistance is breached. Institutions like Galaxy Digital have already taken notice, and ETF filings suggest serious long-term intent. Optimism (OP): Ethereum Scaling With Expanding Ecosystem Control Optimism is redefining the Layer-2 narrative. Through its OP Stack , the project is powering multiple decentralized networks and setting the groundwork for Ethereum’s long-term scalability. With Q3 upgrades coming and strong partnerships with Chainlink and Earned Network in play, OP is gaining traction. Though sentiment remains subdued post-correction, analysts are optimistic that its technical strength will translate into price action. Final Take: Market Momentum Is Shifting Ethereum and Cardano aren’t going away—but investors are now embracing a more diversified view of leadership. SUI and Optimism are showing real traction with scalable models, while MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the narrative-driven excitement and early ROI potential that’s often missing in mature assets. For those who believe the next breakout stars are built before the spotlight hits, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be one of 2025’s defining early-stage bets.

Crypto is shifting fast. New tech rollouts, whale activity, and fresh token listings are changing the game. As traditional markets remain uncertain, crypto is once again in focus. Now it’s not about if you join the market, but where you place your capital for a top crypto investment return in 2025. Some projects are starting to lead the way with visible progress, growing activity, and increasing adoption. Polkadot, VeChain, and Sui are gaining attention for different strengths. But for a complete solution with broad potential, Web3 ai is getting noticed. If you’re thinking about a top crypto investment, this is the time to take a closer look. 1. Web3 ai: A Growing AI Ecosystem with Built-in Tools Web3 ai is becoming a top crypto investment option for those looking past hype. In Stage 9 of its presale, the $WAI token is priced at $0.000443. So far, it has raised more than $8.7 million. With a listing price set at $0.005242, early buyers could see close to 1,747% gains even before exchange trading begins. But the price isn’t the only draw. What makes Web3 ai stand out is its use: eight AI tools designed to help with portfolio management, yield farming, scam detection, market tracking, and more. The $WAI token is not just for access; it connects users to features like staking, voting, and premium services. That builds demand beyond the presale stage. Web3 ai also focuses on secure infrastructure and user control. Some analysts are already pointing to a long-term $5 price goal. For anyone looking for a top crypto investment that blends AI, DeFi, and utility, Web3 ai may offer the kind of edge early buyers are looking for. 2. Polkadot Keeps Expanding Cross-Chain Potential Polkadot (DOT) remains a top crypto investment choice for 2025 with its strong focus on connecting blockchains and driving parachain growth. Trading near $7.20, DOT has seen renewed interest from large holders following upgrades to the XCM messaging system and the addition of new parachain slots. In recent weeks, DOT’s price has shown steady strength, while the network’s total value locked is rising as more DeFi projects turn to Polkadot for its interoperability. Over 50% of DOT’s circulating supply is currently staked, supporting both network security and user rewards. Analysts are watching for a potential move back into double-digit territory as more parachain projects go live and usage grows. Whale accumulation throughout June shows growing confidence in the project’s direction. With ongoing development and a clear solution to blockchain isolation, Polkadot remains a top crypto investment option for those seeking long-term relevance and growth. 3. VeChain Grows with Real-World Business Adoption VeChain (VET) continues to stand out as a top crypto investment for those looking at actual enterprise use. Priced near $0.031 and with a market cap of over $2.2 billion, VET is gaining traction as it signs new partnerships across industries like supply chain, health, and sustainability. Its blockchain is already in use by firms like Walmart China and DNV, proving it’s not just theory, it’s being used. The recent launch of VeBetterDAO and new marketplace incentives has helped increase network activity and developer interest. VET’s two-token system, using VTHO for transactions and VET for value, keeps costs low and makes it more attractive for business. Large wallets have been buying millions of tokens since early June. With its carbon tracking tools and supply chain visibility, VeChain is a top crypto investment for those wanting real-world change, not just speculation. 4. Sui Delivers Speed and a Growing Ecosystem Sui (SUI) is making its way into 2025 as a top crypto investment with real momentum. It’s trading around $0.84 and gaining attention for using the Move programming language and handling speeds up to 297,000 TPS in tests. The ecosystem is growing fast, with new DeFi platforms, NFTs, and gaming apps launching regularly. Cross-chain bridges and listings on more exchanges are also fueling growth. Sui is focused on ease of use, fast transactions, and low fees, all things that bring in new users. Its foundation has launched new grants and hackathons, helping developers build out fresh dApps. As the Layer-1 space heats up, Sui’s mix of fast performance and usability puts it firmly among 2025’s top crypto investment opportunities. For those looking at future-ready networks, Sui checks key boxes. Closing Thoughts on Where to Watch Next If you’re searching for the next top crypto investment , focus on projects that bring real value, strong utility, and signs of adoption. Web3 ai leads with AI tools and a still-running presale that offers a chance to enter early. Polkadot is solving blockchain connection issues with working tech. VeChain is showing how blockchain fits into global business. Sui is proving its tech works and is gaining users fast. These aren’t just ideas. They’re platforms with active use and development. Web3 ai might still hold the biggest upside, but each of these projects has a clear role in shaping what crypto could become. Keep watching. The next wave is already forming.

Pudgy Penguins May Be Following A Similar Path As PEPE In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how PENGU is showing to the memecoin PEPE in its price chart. Below are the graphs shared by Martinez comparing the trends of the two side-by-side. In both charts, the analyst has marked the Fibonacci Retracement levels for the assets, lines that are based on ratios from the famous Fibonacci series. The analyst has set the 1.0 level to a price top for both assets. For PEPE, it’s the high from 2023, and for PENGU, it’s the peak from the start of 2025. Similarly, the zero mark is taken at the bottom point. More specifically, the low that followed the aforementioned top in the coins. Martinez then drew the Fibonacci Retracement levels between the two end points, with each line corresponding to some percentage retracement from top to bottom.

This high led into a retrace, but bullish momentum returned for the coin in 2024, resulting in a sharp explosion where its price far surpassed the 2023 top. From Pudgy Penguins’ chart, it’s apparent that something similar has been developing for it, as its price, too, has seen the pattern of a top above the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement line, followed by a dip and now a rebound. The rebound in question corresponds to the altcoin’s impressive 50% rally over the past week. Even with this surge, however, the asset has only managed to return to the May high. While there has been some similarity between the two price charts, it should be noted that it’s not an exact mirror. For instance, the dip extended to 0.236 for PEPE, but the rebound came for PENGU before such a retracement could occur. With the rebound also not being as strong as PEPE’s so far, it only remains to be seen whether Pudgy Penguins’ surge would end up evolving into anything like the memecoin’s takeoff. As the analyst notes, “a daily close above $0.015–$0.017, and this train could be unstoppable.” Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk? If $2,200 Cracks, $1,160 May Be Coming Something that could also point toward a potential breakout for PENGU is this chart shared by Martinez earlier, showcasing that the altcoin has been traveling inside an Ascending Triangle over the last few months. Pudgy Penguins has recently climbed to the upper line of the pattern, situated around $0.015. Generally, breaks above the resistance line of an Ascending Triangle are considered to be bullish signals. So far, the coin hasn’t been able to surge past the line. PENGU Price At the time of writing, Pudgy Penguins is trading around $0.0148, up over 4% in the last 24 hours.

This isn’t just another company dipping its toes into the digital asset world; Addentax is eyeing up to 12,000 BTC, a staggering sum currently valued at approximately $1.3 billion. For anyone watching the evolving landscape of corporate engagement with crypto, this development from Addentax ATXG is nothing short of groundbreaking. What’s Driving This Monumental Bitcoin Acquisition? The news, first reported via a PR Newswire press release, outlines a non-binding term sheet for this ambitious endeavor. Initially, discussions revolved around 8,000 BTC, but the scope has now expanded significantly to 12,000 BTC. This substantial increase underscores Addentax’s deep conviction in its long-term digital asset strategy . But how exactly does a company of Addentax’s profile plan to fund such a massive undertaking? The answer lies in a strategic share issuance deal . By issuing new shares, Addentax aims to raise the necessary capital without directly impacting its existing cash reserves, a common financing mechanism in traditional markets now being adapted for large-scale crypto investments. Key Aspects of the Proposed Deal: Target Acquisition: Up to 12,000 BTC. Estimated Value: Approximately $1.3 billion at current market rates. Funding Mechanism: Issuance of new company shares. Current Status: Non-binding term sheet, subject to final agreement, due diligence, and regulatory approvals. Strategic Rationale: Aligns with Addentax’s long-term corporate crypto investment strategy. How Does a Share Issuance Deal Impact Existing Shareholders and the Market? A share issuance deal , while a viable way to raise significant capital, can have varied implications. For existing shareholders, issuing new shares typically leads to dilution, meaning their ownership percentage in the company decreases. However, if the acquired asset (in this case, Bitcoin) performs well and adds substantial value to the company over time, the long-term benefits could outweigh the short-term dilution. The market’s reaction to such news is often a mix of excitement and caution. On one hand, it signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future by a Nasdaq-listed entity, potentially attracting more institutional interest. On the other hand, the sheer scale of the deal and the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets introduce a new layer of risk that investors will closely scrutinize. The success of this strategy hinges on meticulous due diligence and the finalization of all agreements. Why Are More Corporations Embracing a Digital Asset Strategy? Addentax is not the first, nor will it be the last, company to pursue a significant corporate crypto investment . Companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, citing its potential as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and a long-term growth asset. The increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, coupled with growing regulatory clarity in some regions, makes digital assets a more attractive component of a diversified corporate treasury or investment portfolio. For Addentax, this move represents a bold step in its digital asset strategy , signaling a long-term commitment to Bitcoin. It suggests a belief that Bitcoin will continue to appreciate in value, offering a robust return on investment that complements their core business operations. This strategic pivot highlights a growing trend where traditional companies are leveraging digital assets to enhance their financial resilience and capitalize on emerging market opportunities. What Are the Next Steps for Addentax ATXG and the Bitcoin Deal? While the term sheet is non-binding, it marks a crucial first step. The path forward for Addentax ATXG involves several critical stages: Due Diligence: Comprehensive review of the terms and implications of the Bitcoin acquisition . Final Agreement: Negotiation and signing of a definitive agreement outlining all terms and conditions. Regulatory Approvals: Securing necessary approvals from relevant financial and regulatory bodies. Share Issuance: Execution of the plan to issue new shares to fund the acquisition. The successful execution of this deal could position Addentax as a significant corporate holder of Bitcoin, potentially influencing its stock performance and setting a precedent for other companies contemplating similar large-scale crypto ventures. The market will be keenly watching how this monumental share issuance deal unfolds and its long-term impact on Addentax’s financial health and strategic direction. A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Finance Addentax’s audacious plan to acquire $1.3 billion in Bitcoin through a share issuance deal is more than just a headline; it’s a testament to the evolving nature of corporate finance and investment. It underscores a growing confidence among traditional companies in the long-term viability and value proposition of digital assets. This move by Addentax ATXG could inspire further exploration of corporate crypto investment strategies across various industries, cementing Bitcoin’s role not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic treasury component. As the deal progresses through due diligence and approvals, the cryptocurrency community and financial markets will be watching closely. This significant Bitcoin acquisition could indeed be a harbinger of a new era where digital assets play an increasingly central role in corporate financial planning.

The U-turn, which ditched billions of pounds worth of savings to consolidate public finances , sent shockwaves through the markets and revived fears of the 2022 bond market crash that aborted Liz Truss’ brief premiership. Chancellor Rachel Reeves fought back the tears during Prime Minister’s Questions today, as she was present alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The appearance, where she appeared tired and tearful, prompted speculation that her days in the Treasury were numbered. While Downing Street later attributed her distress to a “personal matter” and emphasized that Starmer continued to have full confidence in his chancellor, markets were unconvinced. The yield on the UK 10-year gilt shot up to 4.681% at one stage before Christmas, the biggest intra-day surge since the Truss era mania event. It subsequently moderated to 4.60%, but the die was cast. Yields on 30-year gilts climbed 17 basis points as longer-term fears about fiscal credibility reared their head. Reeves under fire amid doubts over Labour’s fiscal plan Chancellor Reeves is in the limelight again over the political fallout from the welfare U-turn. Her fiscal rules are in danger now of being trashed. The benefit cuts that have since been dropped were supposed to buttress those rules by saving the Treasury billions . It has made Britain’s already tight fiscal space even more constrained. Her leadership is now in question, including from within the Labour Party. There have also been reports that some Labour MPs feel the first raft of cuts was cruel and targeted the most vulnerable. But Reeves had pressured them to help meet her spending goals, a reminder of the tightrope she walks between compassion and credibility. Starmer’s refusal to say outright that he backs Reeves in Prime Minister’s Questions also added to the speculation. His press office later reiterated their unity, but traders were already selling the news. The pound was down by almost 1% against the dollar and at a two-month low against the euro, which rose 0.8%. The domestically focused FTSE 250 index, which is frequently seen as a barometer of confidence in the domestic economy, fell 1.3%, lagging behind broader European indexes. “There’s a real fear that if Reeves goes, her replacement could throw out the current fiscal framework,” said Craig Inches, head of rates and cash at Royal London Asset Management. “That would open the door to unbridled borrowing and bring additional instability.” Even if Reeves stays, the episode has already marred the Labour government’s credibility just weeks in. For much of the financial world, it’s an uneasy beginning. Global debt fears put pressure on Britain The UK’s challenges are against a wider background of deepening global concern about government deficits . Bond investors from the United States to Japan are growing wary of soaring government debt. But Britain appears particularly vulnerable. Unlike other major economies, the UK has little fiscal space, its growth is tepid, and its monetary conditions remain tight. The Bank of England is keeping rates higher to fight inflation, which makes borrowing more expensive for the government and shrinks the fiscal space. Simon Blundell, head of European fixed income at BlackRock, said the developments had added another layer of uncertainty to an already delicate situation. He noted that while it wasn’t a repeat of 2022, investors remembered what had happened and were quick to react. While BlackRock has maintained a generally positive stance toward gilts, sentiment could change rapidly if the government fails to send clear, consistent signals about its fiscal intent, according to Blundel. He added that if spending cuts are politically unworkable and self-imposed rules limit borrowing, the only option left is higher taxes.

As July dawns, many investors are left wondering: is this the calm before a storm, or simply a necessary pause for consolidation? According to Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33, the immediate crypto market outlook suggests a period of subdued activity, despite a surprisingly packed macro calendar. This forecast prompts a crucial question for every investor: how should one navigate these potentially tranquil yet significant waters? Understanding the Current Crypto Market Outlook: Why Patience is Key K33’s Vetle Lunde offers a pragmatic view, suggesting that the digital asset space is unlikely to see significant fireworks this July. This prediction isn’t based on a lack of news, but rather an expectation that even major macroeconomic developments might not immediately translate into heightened trading activity. For many, this could feel counterintuitive, given the market’s propensity to react sharply to global events. However, Lunde’s analysis points to a deeper trend: a market potentially entering a phase of digestion and re-evaluation. This calls for a strategic shift from rapid-fire trading to a more measured, patient approach, particularly for those holding spot positions. The prevailing sentiment appears to be one of caution. While some might interpret ‘subdued’ as ‘boring,’ it could also be a period where foundational shifts occur beneath the surface. For investors, understanding this crypto market outlook means recognizing that immediate gratification might be elusive, but long-term opportunities could be brewing. Patience, in this context, isn’t just a virtue; it’s a strategic necessity. What Does the July Crypto Forecast Really Mean for Investors? July’s macro calendar is indeed rich with potentially market-moving events, particularly from the United States. Despite this, Lunde anticipates low trading volumes, echoing historical trends. But what exactly are these key U.S. events, and how might they subtly influence the July crypto forecast ? U.S. President Trump’s Expected Signing of a Large Budget Bill: While the specifics of this bill are crucial, a large budget allocation typically signals increased government spending. This can have multifaceted impacts: it might inject liquidity into the economy, potentially fueling inflation (which some view as a catalyst for Bitcoin as a hedge), or it could raise concerns about national debt and fiscal stability, leading to broader economic uncertainty. The market’s reaction will depend heavily on the bill’s details and the overall economic context. End of a Tariff Pause: The resumption of tariffs, or the end of previous suspensions, could significantly impact global trade and supply chains. Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, which can lead to higher consumer prices and reduced corporate profits. This economic pressure might dampen investor enthusiasm for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as businesses and consumers tighten their belts. Conversely, it could also push investors towards perceived safe havens, though crypto’s role as a safe haven is still debated. Federal Crypto Policy Deadline: This is perhaps the most direct influencer for the crypto market. A looming deadline for federal crypto policy suggests that the U.S. government is poised to make significant decisions regarding how digital assets are regulated. This could involve clarity on stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, or the overall classification of cryptocurrencies. The outcome could either legitimize the industry, paving the way for institutional adoption, or impose restrictive measures that hinder innovation and growth. The anticipation alone can lead to cautious trading as market participants await concrete guidelines. These events, while impactful, might not trigger immediate, dramatic price movements if trading interest remains low. Instead, their effects could be more gradual, shaping the underlying currents that will eventually dictate the market’s direction in the latter half of the year. Decoding the Impact of US Crypto Regulation on Market Dynamics The impending US crypto regulation deadline is a focal point of discussion within the industry. The regulatory landscape in the United States has historically been fragmented and uncertain, leading to a degree of apprehension among innovators and investors alike. Clarity, or lack thereof, from federal bodies like the SEC, CFTC, and Treasury, profoundly influences market dynamics. If the new policies provide a clear framework, it could significantly boost institutional confidence, leading to increased capital inflow and broader adoption. For example, clear rules around stablecoins could unlock massive potential for their use in traditional finance. Conversely, overly restrictive or ambiguous regulations could stifle innovation, push projects offshore, and deter both institutional and retail participation. The market’s subdued nature in July might reflect this collective holding of breath, as stakeholders await definitive pronouncements that will shape the future of digital assets within one of the world’s largest economies. Analyzing Crypto Investor Sentiment: Are We Headed for a Rebound? Current market indicators, as observed by Lunde, point towards a cautious crypto investor sentiment . This isn’t necessarily a bearish signal, but rather a reflection of the uncertainty surrounding the aforementioned macro events. Investors are less willing to take on significant risk, leading to lower speculative activity. However, there’s a silver lining in this cautious approach: reduced leverage. What does ‘reduced leverage’ mean for the market? It implies that a significant portion of speculative, highly-leveraged positions have either been closed out or liquidated. This process, while painful for those involved, effectively cleanses the market of excessive risk. When leverage is high, even small price movements can trigger large liquidations, creating cascading sell-offs. With leverage reduced, the market becomes more stable and less prone to dramatic downside spirals. Lunde highlights that this ‘reduced leverage could lay the groundwork for a bullish move if momentum returns.’ This means that once positive catalysts emerge, and investor confidence begins to rebuild, the market is in a healthier position to sustain an upward trend without being hampered by over-leveraged positions. Therefore, while current sentiment is cautious, it’s also indicative of a market that’s potentially consolidating and building a stronger foundation for future growth. The question isn’t if momentum will return, but when, and what specific catalysts will ignite it. The Curious Case of Crypto Trading Volume in Summer Months Lunde’s observation that ‘even in past Julys with big headlines, crypto trading volume stayed low’ is a fascinating historical parallel. This phenomenon isn’t unique to crypto; traditional financial markets often experience a ‘summer lull’ as institutional traders and investors take vacations, leading to thinner order books and less liquidity. In the crypto space, this effect can be amplified due to its relatively nascent stage and dependence on global, often retail-driven, interest. Lower trading volumes can have several implications: Reduced Volatility (Often): With fewer participants and less capital flowing in and out, large price swings might be less frequent, contributing to the ‘subdued’ atmosphere. Exaggerated Moves (Sometimes): Conversely, in thin markets, even relatively small orders can have a disproportionate impact on price, leading to sudden, sharp movements if a large buyer or seller enters. Lack of Conviction: Low volume can indicate a lack of strong conviction among market participants, with many opting to wait on the sidelines rather than commit significant capital. For investors, this means being extra mindful of liquidity. While the market might seem quiet, executing large trades could be challenging without causing significant slippage. It reinforces the advice to maintain a patient stance and avoid impulsive decisions based on minor fluctuations. Actionable Insights for Navigating a Subdued July Given Lunde’s expert analysis and the confluence of macro factors, what should investors do? The advice remains consistent and clear: stay patient and hold your spot positions . Here’s why this approach is prudent: Mitigating Risk: Holding spot positions (actual ownership of cryptocurrencies, not leveraged derivatives) significantly reduces your exposure to sudden liquidations, especially in a market characterized by lower liquidity and potential for unexpected news. This aligns with the observed ‘reduced leverage’ in the market. Long-Term Vision: For those with a long-term investment horizon, a subdued July presents an opportunity rather than a threat. It allows for potential accumulation at stable or lower prices without the emotional roller coaster of high volatility. This period could be seen as a foundation-building phase before the next significant upward move. Avoiding FUD and FOMO: A quiet market helps filter out the noise. Without dramatic price swings, investors can make more rational decisions, less influenced by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) or the fear of missing out (FOMO). Focus on Fundamentals: Use this time to research projects, understand the implications of upcoming regulations, and strengthen your conviction in your chosen assets. This deeper understanding will serve you well when market momentum eventually returns. While the market may not offer exhilarating gains in July, it provides a valuable window for strategic positioning and calm reflection. This period of quiet could be the very groundwork needed for a more robust and sustainable bullish trend later in the year. Conclusion: A Calm Before the Next Wave? The crypto market outlook for July, as articulated by K33’s Vetle Lunde, points towards a period of relative calm. Despite significant U.S. events on the horizon, including crucial budget decisions, tariff resolutions, and a pivotal federal US crypto regulation deadline, the expectation is for low crypto trading volume and a cautious crypto investor sentiment . This ‘subdued’ phase, however, is not without its merits. The reduction in market leverage suggests a healthier underlying structure, potentially setting the stage for a more sustainable rally once momentum re-enters the space. For investors, the key takeaway from this July crypto forecast is clear: patience is paramount. Holding spot positions and resisting the urge for speculative trading during this period of consolidation could prove to be the most strategic move. While July might not deliver the explosive gains many dream of, it could very well be the quiet, foundational month that prepares the crypto market for its next significant chapter. The market is not stagnant; it’s simply gathering its breath, waiting for the right moment to surge forward.

This isn’t a distant dream for Belgians; it’s rapidly becoming a reality. KBC Bank, Belgium’s largest financial institution, is poised to revolutionize the local investment landscape by offering direct retail crypto investment options through its popular Bolero platform. This groundbreaking move signals a significant shift in how mainstream finance views and integrates cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for broader adoption across Europe. Setting the Stage for KBC Bank Crypto Adoption The financial world has long viewed cryptocurrencies with a mix of fascination and caution. While institutional interest has grown steadily, direct access for everyday retail customers through traditional banking channels has remained largely elusive. That’s precisely why KBC Bank’s recent announcement, reported by Cointelegraph, is so significant. The bank plans to allow its retail customers to invest in both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) later this year, pending crucial regulatory approval. If this initiative comes to fruition, KBC will become the first major Belgian bank crypto provider to offer such services directly to individual investors. This isn’t just about offering a new product; it’s about legitimizing digital assets within a highly regulated and trusted financial environment. For years, investors have navigated complex crypto exchanges or third-party platforms. KBC’s move promises to simplify this process, potentially attracting a new wave of investors who prioritize convenience and security offered by their primary banking partner. The Mechanics of Bitcoin Investment via Bolero For many, the idea of investing in Bitcoin has been intriguing but daunting. Concerns about security, platform reliability, and regulatory oversight have often deterred potential investors. KBC’s integration of Bitcoin investment into its existing Bolero platform aims to address these concerns head-on. Bolero is KBC’s online investment platform, already widely used by Belgian investors for stocks, bonds, and funds. By incorporating crypto assets directly into Bolero, KBC is leveraging a familiar and secure interface. Here’s what this means for you: Simplified Access: Existing KBC and Bolero customers will likely be able to access crypto investments with just a few clicks, similar to how they manage their current portfolios. Enhanced Security: Funds held within a regulated bank environment typically come with robust security protocols, potentially offering a greater sense of safety compared to some standalone crypto exchanges. Integrated Portfolio Management: Investors could view their traditional and crypto assets side-by-side, allowing for a more holistic approach to wealth management. Trust and Familiarity: For many, investing through their established bank provides a level of trust that independent crypto platforms might not immediately inspire. While the exact operational details are still under wraps, the promise of a streamlined and secure pathway to Bitcoin investment is a game-changer for the Belgian market. Exploring Ethereum Investment Opportunities Beyond Bitcoin, KBC’s decision to include Ether (ETH) is equally important. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines as ‘digital gold,’ Ethereum offers a different value proposition. As the foundational blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum represents a vibrant ecosystem of innovation. Offering Ethereum investment alongside Bitcoin provides investors with an opportunity for diversification within the crypto space. Here’s why Ether is a compelling addition: Smart Contract Powerhouse: Ethereum’s smart contract functionality underpins a vast array of digital services, from lending and borrowing to digital art marketplaces. DeFi Ecosystem: It’s the backbone of the booming DeFi sector, offering alternatives to traditional financial services. Future Upgrades: The ongoing development and upgrades to the Ethereum network, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now called the Merge and subsequent upgrades), aim to enhance its scalability, security, and sustainability. By providing access to both BTC and ETH, KBC is enabling its customers to tap into two of the most significant and influential digital assets, each with unique characteristics and growth potential. Why This Matters: The Rise of Retail Crypto Investment KBC’s initiative isn’t just a local story; it reflects a broader global trend towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. The entry of a major bank into this space addresses several critical aspects of retail crypto investment : Aspect Traditional Crypto Investment (Challenges) Bank-Offered Crypto Investment (Benefits) Accessibility Requires navigating new platforms, understanding wallets. Seamless integration with existing banking platforms. Trust & Security Varies greatly by exchange, risk of hacks, self-custody complexities. Leverages bank-grade security, regulatory oversight. Regulatory Clarity Often ambiguous, varies by jurisdiction. Operates within established financial regulations (pending approval). User Experience Can be complex for beginners. Familiar interface, simplified process. This move by KBC could democratize access to digital assets, making them available to a demographic that might have previously shied away due to perceived complexity or risk. It’s a clear signal that cryptocurrencies are maturing as an asset class and are increasingly being recognized by established financial institutions. The Impact on the Belgian Bank Crypto Landscape KBC’s pioneering step could have significant ripple effects across Belgium’s financial sector and potentially beyond. As the first major Belgian bank crypto provider, KBC sets a precedent that other banks in the region will undoubtedly observe closely. Here’s what we might expect: Increased Competition: If KBC’s crypto offering proves successful and attracts a significant number of investors, competing banks may feel compelled to launch similar services to retain or attract customers. Regulatory Evolution: The Belgian financial regulator (FSMA) will play a crucial role in approving KBC’s plans. A successful launch could provide a clearer framework for how other banks might enter the crypto space, leading to more defined national regulations. Enhanced Market Liquidity: Greater participation from retail investors through trusted banking channels could contribute to increased liquidity and stability in the local crypto market. Education and Awareness: As banks offer crypto, there’s a natural inclination to educate their customers, which could lead to greater public understanding and awareness of digital assets. While challenges remain, particularly around regulatory complexities and market volatility, KBC’s initiative represents a significant leap forward for the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance in Belgium. A Compelling Future for Digital Assets KBC Bank’s ambitious plan to offer Bitcoin investment and Ethereum investment through its Bolero platform marks a pivotal moment for the Belgian financial landscape and indeed, for the broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies. By bridging the gap between traditional banking and the burgeoning world of digital assets, KBC is not only providing a convenient service to its customers but also validating the growing importance of crypto in a modern investment portfolio. As we await regulatory approval, the anticipation builds for what could be a new era of accessible, secure, and integrated retail crypto investment . This move underscores a crucial shift: cryptocurrencies are no longer just for tech enthusiasts or niche investors; they are becoming a legitimate part of mainstream financial offerings. The future of finance is undoubtedly a blend of the traditional and the innovative, and KBC Bank is leading the charge in Belgium to make that future a present reality.

XRP , Avalanche (AVAX) , and MAGACOIN FINANCE each offer distinct value propositions—but they differ sharply in terms of volatility, timing, and upside potential. For investors weighing risk versus return, these three assets represent different lanes in the current crypto cycle. Let’s break down which path might be worth taking before this quarter gains speed. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early Momentum With High Upside Potential Still in its presale phase , MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming one of the most talked-about speculative assets of the quarter. With over $10 million already raised , this politically-themed, community-driven token is rapidly building momentum among early-stage traders. Designed with a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens , audited by HashEx , and free of VC ownership , MAGACOIN FINANCE is engineered to benefit early participants. Wallet growth has accelerated, and consistent accumulation suggests investor conviction is rising—particularly among those hunting for meme-cycle asymmetry. While it’s undoubtedly a high-risk, high-reward play, many traders view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential breakout candidate for the second half of 2025. For those comfortable with early-stage volatility and looking for exposure before exchange listings, it could be one of the more explosive opportunities on the table. XRP: Institutional Confidence Returns After years of legal battles, XRP is finally reclaiming its position in the broader altcoin market. The SEC settlement finalized earlier this year cleared major hurdles, reopening the door to institutional adoption and fueling speculation around a spot ETF approval , with some experts placing the odds above 80% . Price-wise, XRP is holding key support and appears poised for movement toward the $2.80–$3.40 range—potentially higher if ETF headlines hit in Q3. Inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto Index has also helped reestablish its credibility among conservative investors. XRP’s primary appeal lies in its regulatory clarity and real-world utility, especially in global payment solutions. But delays in ETF progress or macro headwinds could stall its momentum. Still, for risk-averse traders seeking reliable exposure, XRP remains one of the most “institutional-ready” assets this cycle. Avalanche: Building Quietly Behind the Scenes While XRP leads with legal clarity, Avalanche (AVAX) is making strides through enterprise adoption . Its custom Layer-1 chain partnership with FIFA , combined with a growing presence in digital collectibles, is positioning AVAX for mainstream utility. From a technical standpoint, AVAX is consolidating between $19.50 and $21 , with analysts setting breakout targets around $26–$35 . These ranges are increasingly supported by volume and accumulation, suggesting a potential move if sentiment turns bullish. Avalanche is not without competition—it still operates under Ethereum’s shadow. But as a mid-cap altcoin with real use cases and growing institutional credibility, AVAX may offer one of the stronger risk-adjusted plays in Q3. Conclusion: What’s Your Play This Quarter? XRP delivers regulatory assurance, institutional access, and modest upside for traders seeking stability. Avalanche offers a blend of adoption momentum and technical structure for those targeting mid-range growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the high-risk, high-reward wildcard—rapidly gaining traction ahead of listings and meme cycle resurgence. Each altcoin offers a different balance of security, speed, and speculation. For traders focused on asymmetric returns, the early window on MAGACOIN FINANCE may not stay open for long.

This declaration, made via Truth Social, signals a potential recalibration of international commerce and supply chains, prompting investors and market watchers to consider its broader implications for traditional assets and, crucially, digital currencies. The Significance of the US-Vietnam Trade Deal: What Does It Entail? The announcement of a new US-Vietnam Trade Deal is more than just a headline; it’s a strategic move with far-reaching consequences. While specific details are still under wraps, a trade agreement between these two nations typically involves reducing tariffs, improving market access for goods and services, and establishing clearer frameworks for intellectual property and investment. Vietnam has rapidly emerged as a key manufacturing hub and a crucial player in global supply chains, particularly as companies seek to diversify operations beyond China. For the United States, strengthening economic ties with Vietnam offers an opportunity to: Diversify Supply Chains: Reduce reliance on single countries for critical goods, enhancing resilience against geopolitical disruptions. Boost Economic Growth: Open new markets for American products and services, fostering job creation and economic expansion. Strategic Partnership: Deepen diplomatic and economic relations with a fast-growing Indo-Pacific nation, aligning with broader geopolitical objectives. This deal underscores the ongoing shifts in global trade dynamics and highlights the importance of strategic alliances in an increasingly interconnected world. Understanding Trump Trade Policy and Its Legacy This latest announcement fits within the broader context of Trump Trade Policy , which has consistently prioritized bilateral agreements and an ‘America First’ approach. During his presidency, Trump initiated significant trade actions, including tariffs on goods from various countries, most notably China, aiming to renegotiate what he deemed unfair trade practices. His administration’s strategy often involved leveraging economic pressure to achieve specific concessions. Key characteristics of Trump’s trade approach: Characteristic Description Bilateral Focus Preferring direct agreements with individual nations over multilateral pacts. Tariff Utilization Frequent use of tariffs as a tool for negotiation and to protect domestic industries. Rebalancing Trade Deficits A strong emphasis on reducing trade imbalances perceived as unfavorable to the U.S. Domestic Industry Protection Policies aimed at safeguarding American jobs and industries from foreign competition. The US-Vietnam Trade Deal , if it follows these principles, could serve as a template for future engagements and reflects a continued focus on reshaping global economic partnerships to benefit American interests. Anticipating the Global Economic Impact A significant Global Economic Impact is expected from such a trade agreement. Vietnam’s economy, already booming, could see an even greater influx of foreign direct investment and increased export opportunities. For the U.S., a more stable and diversified supply chain from Vietnam could lead to reduced production costs for certain goods, potentially easing inflationary pressures over time. However, it’s not without complexities. Potential ripple effects include: Supply Chain Realignment: Further acceleration of companies shifting production from China to Vietnam and other Southeast Asian nations. Regional Dynamics: Impact on other ASEAN economies as they compete for investment and trade opportunities. Inflationary Pressures: While diversification can reduce long-term risks, initial shifts might incur costs, but ultimately, smoother supply lines can contribute to price stability. Currency Fluctuations: Increased trade volumes could influence the Vietnamese Dong (VND) and the U.S. Dollar (USD), with potential knock-on effects for international finance. Understanding these macro-economic shifts is crucial, as they form the backdrop against which all financial markets, including digital assets, operate. How Does This Affect the Cryptocurrency Market? The interconnectedness of traditional finance and the Cryptocurrency Market means that major geopolitical and economic developments rarely occur in a vacuum. A stable and growing global economy, fostered by trade deals like the US-Vietnam Trade Deal , can have several implications for digital assets: Investor Confidence: Positive economic news often correlates with increased investor confidence, potentially leading to more capital flowing into risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. Inflation Hedging: If the deal helps stabilize supply chains and temper inflation, it might reduce the immediate urgency for some investors to seek inflation hedges like Bitcoin. Conversely, if currency shifts or unforeseen economic friction arise, Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized alternative could be reinforced. Emerging Market Adoption: As Vietnam’s economy grows, its population’s disposable income might increase, potentially fueling greater interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies within the country. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased economic integration might bring greater attention to cross-border financial flows, including crypto, potentially influencing future regulatory frameworks. The cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility, often reacts to macroeconomic indicators and investor sentiment. A deal that fosters stability and growth could provide a more favorable environment for digital asset innovation and adoption. Navigating the Digital Asset Outlook Amidst Global Shifts For those invested in the Digital Asset Outlook , the US-Vietnam Trade Deal serves as another reminder of how global events can influence market trajectories. While direct causation is rare, the cumulative effect of such macroeconomic shifts can be significant. Investors should consider: Diversification: Maintain a diversified portfolio, balancing traditional assets with a strategic allocation to digital assets. Macro-Awareness: Stay informed about global trade policies, inflation data, and central bank actions, as these indirectly shape crypto market sentiment. Long-Term Vision: Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and specific digital assets rather than short-term price fluctuations driven by news cycles. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-losses and only investing what you can afford to lose. The landscape of global finance is constantly evolving, and digital assets are increasingly a part of this intricate web. Understanding the broader economic currents, such as those initiated by a new US-Vietnam Trade Deal , is key to making informed investment decisions in the crypto space. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Global Trade and Digital Finance The announcement of a US-Vietnam Trade Deal by Donald Trump marks a significant moment in international relations and economic policy. While the immediate details are still emerging, its potential to reshape supply chains, influence inflation, and foster economic growth in both nations is undeniable. For the cryptocurrency market, such developments create a complex interplay of opportunities and challenges. As global economies become more interconnected, the resilience and adaptability of digital assets will be continuously tested and refined. Staying vigilant, understanding the macroeconomic currents, and adopting a strategic approach will be paramount for navigating this exciting, yet unpredictable, future.

Get ready, because tokenized stocks are about to take center stage, promising a new era of accessibility and innovation within the CeDeFi ecosystem. Understanding Tokenized Stocks : A Bridge to New Frontiers Imagine owning a piece of a global corporation like Apple or Tesla, not through a traditional brokerage with limited hours and geographic restrictions, but directly on a blockchain. That’s the revolutionary essence of tokenized stocks . These are digital representations of traditional equities, secured and traded on a distributed ledger. Unlike conventional shares, they offer unique advantages: they can be fractionalized, enabling smaller investments; they can be traded 24/7, transcending market hours; and they potentially offer greater transparency and lower fees due to blockchain’s inherent properties. BounceBit, a pioneering CeDeFi infrastructure platform, has just confirmed its ambitious plan to launch these innovative assets in Q4. This strategic move is not merely about digitizing shares; it’s about making them fully functional and interoperable within the expansive decentralized finance paradigm. This means unlocking capabilities far beyond what traditional markets can offer. BounceBit’s Vision: Harmonizing TradFi and DeFi for Global Access BounceBit is uniquely positioned at the forefront of the financial revolution, aiming to seamlessly combine the robust efficiency and regulatory adherence of traditional finance (TradFi) with the transparency, programmability, and borderless nature of DeFi. Their upcoming launch of tokenized stocks perfectly exemplifies this hybrid approach, striving to offer users the best of both worlds – institutional-grade security coupled with crypto-native innovation. The platform explicitly states that these assets are engineered for “active trading, composability, and borderless use rather than passive holding.” This distinction is absolutely crucial. It signifies that these aren’t just static digital receipts; they are dynamic, foundational building blocks designed to integrate deeply with existing and future financial products within the burgeoning on-chain assets ecosystem. This opens up a universe of possibilities for sophisticated financial strategies previously unavailable to the average investor. Unlocking the Power: Key Benefits of On-Chain Assets The introduction of tokenized stocks by BounceBit brings several compelling and transformative benefits to the forefront of the financial landscape: 24/7 Global Trading: Traditional stock markets operate within strict, limited hours, often tied to specific time zones. On-chain assets , however, can be traded around the clock, every day of the week, offering unprecedented flexibility and liquidity for global investors who can react to news and market shifts instantaneously. Democratized Fractional Ownership: Many high-priced blue-chip stocks are financially out of reach for a significant portion of potential investors. Tokenization allows for precise fractional ownership, meaning you can purchase a small, affordable portion of a share. This democratizes access to valuable assets, enabling broader participation in established markets. Enhanced Composability and Programmability: This is a core and powerful principle of DeFi. Tokenized stocks can be seamlessly integrated into a myriad of existing and new DeFi protocols. Imagine using your tokenized Apple stock as collateral for a decentralized loan, or combining it with other crypto assets in a liquidity pool to earn yield. This interoperability creates entirely new financial instruments and strategies. Borderless and Inclusive Access: Geographic and national barriers to investment are significantly reduced or even eliminated. Anyone with an internet connection and a compatible crypto wallet can potentially access these global equities, fostering greater financial inclusion and leveling the playing field for investors worldwide. Increased Transparency and Auditability: All transactions involving tokenized stocks are recorded on a public blockchain, providing a transparent, immutable, and auditable ledger of ownership and trades. This inherent transparency can help reduce fraud and build greater trust among participants. Faster Settlement: Traditional stock settlements can take days (T+2). Blockchain-based tokenized assets can settle in minutes or even seconds, significantly improving capital efficiency and reducing counterparty risk. Navigating the Horizon: Challenges and Considerations for CeDeFi Growth While the promise of tokenized stocks is immense and transformative, their widespread adoption and full integration will depend on successfully addressing several critical challenges: Regulatory Clarity and Compliance: The legal and regulatory framework for tokenized securities is still in its nascent stages globally and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Clear, harmonized guidelines are absolutely essential for investor protection, institutional confidence, and preventing market manipulation. Liquidity Depth and Market Making: For active and efficient trading, deep liquidity pools are paramount. Building sufficient liquidity for tokenized versions of potentially thousands of traditional stocks will be a significant and ongoing undertaking, requiring robust market-making strategies. Security Risks and Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: As with any blockchain-based asset, the inherent risks of smart contract vulnerabilities, potential cyberattacks, and platform exploits remain a concern. Robust, continuous security audits, bug bounties, and stringent risk management protocols are absolutely paramount to protect user assets. Seamless Integration with Traditional Infrastructure: While aiming to bridge TradFi and DeFi, creating truly seamless and secure bridges between traditional financial exchanges, custodians, and the on-chain world will be necessary for efficient capital flow and widespread institutional adoption. This involves overcoming technical and operational complexities. Investor Education and Adoption: A significant hurdle will be educating traditional investors about the benefits and mechanics of tokenized assets and the underlying blockchain technology. Bridging the knowledge gap will be crucial for broader public adoption. The Profound Impact of BounceBit on the Future of Finance BounceBit’s bold and pioneering move to launch tokenized stocks is far more than just a product release; it’s a profound statement about the inevitable evolution of finance itself. By bringing traditional equities onto the blockchain in a fully DeFi-enabled format, they are not only pushing the boundaries of what’s possible within the dynamic CeDeFi space but also laying foundational groundwork for a more integrated, efficient, and truly global financial system. This future system envisions assets flowing freely and efficiently across borders, breaking down traditional silos and fostering unprecedented financial connectivity. This groundbreaking initiative is poised to attract a new wave of users and substantial capital into the burgeoning crypto ecosystem, particularly those from traditional finance who are actively seeking innovative, transparent, and more accessible investment avenues. It unequivocally underscores the growing maturity, ambition, and disruptive potential of the entire decentralized finance sector to reshape global markets. Are You Ready for the On-Chain Assets Revolution? The highly anticipated Q4 launch of tokenized stocks by BounceBit marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance. For individual investors, active traders, and dedicated DeFi enthusiasts alike, this presents a truly unique and exciting opportunity to engage with traditional assets in a completely novel and potentially more empowering way. It stands as a powerful testament to the transformative power of blockchain technology to democratize finance, foster greater transparency, and create more efficient, accessible, and inclusive markets for everyone. In conclusion, BounceBit’s upcoming launch of tokenized stocks represents a monumental development for the entire crypto and traditional finance landscape. By enabling continuous, on-chain access to equities for active trading, enhanced composability, and borderless use, BounceBit is not just innovating within CeDeFi ; it’s actively laying the groundwork for a more interconnected, transparent, and efficient global financial system. Keep a close eye on BounceBit as Q4 approaches – the future of finance might just be getting revolutionized by tokenization.

If approved, this move would make Ripple one of the few crypto firms to hold both state and federal oversight, taking a step into mainstream finance. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the news, saying, “True to our long-standing compliance roots, Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC.” He said that gaining both state approval (via New York’s financial regulator) and a national charter would set a new benchmark for trust in the stablecoin and digital asset market. What This Means for XRP’s Price Looking at XRP’s price action, the token has been moving sideways in recent weeks. On the 12-hour chart, XRP has been stuck between a support level of around $2.10 to $2.25 and a resistance zone between $2.31 to $2.35. There’s no strong momentum in either direction, with small bullish and bearish moves keeping the price bouncing within this tight range. This pattern could continue for the next few days or even weeks unless a bigger event or announcement shakes up the market. Analyst Casi Trades said XRP is still holding an important support level at 0.382. The price keeps reacting here, showing how strong this area is. If XRP breaks above $2.25 and holds it as support, it could quickly move towards $2.69, with a stop near $2.45. Casi said that the RSI will be key to watch for signs of strength or weakness. Bank License Process Could Take Time While Ripple’s application for a U.S. national bank license is a big headline, the approval process is lengthy. It usually takes at least a year or more to complete, as regulators carefully review business plans, management teams, background checks, and public feedback. The process involves the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for the charter and the FDIC for deposit insurance.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-03 02:46:30

Some call it “yielding bitcoin,” but it’s actually an alternative that hides very different functions and purposes. In some ways, it tries to blend the output of MSTX and MSTY, though with a different methodology. Under current conditions, it’s impossible not to consider a potential risk of return decay and NAV decay, similar to leveraged exposures and option-based strategy funds. Have you ever seen a daily leveraged ETF that combines an income strategy like a credit call spread and distributes income weekly? Well, that’s essentially what the Defiance Leveraged Long + Income MSTR ETF ( MST ) does. Let’s be honest: it’s not something you see every day. And I was really intrigued to see how some analysts are already talking about MST as an ETF offering indirect, income-generating exposure to Bitcoin. Fast thinking: “wow.” Slow thinking: “wait... what?!” Curious, because if I let my imagination run wild, I immediately think of an MSTX with distributions like an MSTY . Then I come back to reality, and realize it’s quite different… but before that. What is MST really? A brand-new ETF from Defiance , launched on May 1, 2025, with just $88 million in AUM and 22 positions in its portfolio, which, as we’ll see, is essentially a piece of financial engineering architecture designed to “optimize” exposure to MSTR. Interestingly, Morningstar immediately categorized it under Trading – Miscellaneous , framing it as a tactical rather than strategic ETF, suited for a satellite rather than a core portfolio allocation, for short-term plays rather than long-term holdings (which, let me say, contrasts a bit with the mindset of an income investor). MST - Profile (Seeking Alpha) First thought: “Okay, but how much does it cost me?” A fair and implicit question. The answer: an expense ratio of 1.31%, and a hidden cost of 0.39% spread (hopefully temporary), as indicated by the 30-day median spread. But focusing on cost without understanding the value is a mistake, we know that well by now. So what value does MST offer in return for such a relatively high cost? The Holdings I prefer to start with the holding distribution , so I can get a sense of what MST is really made of, before being influenced by the marketing and fact sheets: A dominant position: 180% in Total Return Swaps on MSTR (via Marex) + 2.65% via Clear Street. So it’s fair to say that MST gains leveraged exposure to MSTR through derivatives ((TRS)). Then comes the “income-oriented” flavor typical of option-based ETFs: credit call spreads on MSTR, short out-of-the-money calls, long further out-of-the-money calls. Then there are cash equivalents, 11% in Treasuries, etc., mainly serving as collateral (more than for stabilization). MST holding distribution (Seeking Alpha) The Strategy Now let’s read the prospectus: what immediately strikes me is that the primary objective is long-term capital growth, and the secondary objective is to generate consistent income. It aims to provide a daily return equal to 150%-200% of MSTR’s performance. It also integrates a credit call spread strategy to generate weekly (or monthly) income. MST - Dividend summary (Seeking Alpha) The words here are extremely important, and I want to highlight them: Income is secondary and not guaranteed. And the options strategy is applied to ~50% of net exposure . TRS (Total Return Swaps) are reset daily: we enter the logic of leveraged ETFs, where in my opinion there should always be a very large disclaimer : daily leverage does not guarantee the same proportions over the long term. The risk? Return decay, just look at what’s happening to MSTX, which maintains similar leverage to MSTR. Data by YCharts A “Yielding Bitcoin” The term Yielding Bitcoin is my own interpretation, Defiance doesn’t define it this way in the prospectus, although the marketing materials do refer to indirect exposure to Bitcoin, naturally because MSTR’s well-known strategy involves acquiring Bitcoin. I, personally, added the word yielding because MST includes up to 50% of net exposure in credit call spreads. But what does it really make sense to expect in terms of price behavior? In my opinion, we can use the performance of MSTX as a benchmark, however, let’s keep in mind that MST has a cap on the upside movement, which could potentially cut capital gains performance, thus a leverage effect yes, but reduced (in my opinion) on the upside. Data by YCharts As for income, it’s unclear, not even the factsheets shed light on it. The only example I know well is MSTY, but that follows a completely different strategy, and I don’t think it makes sense to expect those levels of yield here; it’s not even the fund’s objective. Data by YCharts As of now, SA reports a TTM dividend yield of 9.92%, while Defiance shows a 30-day SEC yield of 1.22%, although the current distribution rate (which varies significantly) is listed at 78%. Here it’s crucial not to be misled, and for this reason, it lies at the core of the ... Risk Section First fear: NAV decay. Am I wrong to say that the investment strategies used by the managers of MST make it likely to generate a potentially high NAV decay? The 19a filings already show a return of capital distribution above 95%. Resulting in a distribution rate of 78% , which, let me say, is “a bit” misleading. Then there's the 30-day SEC yield, at 1.22%, which doesn’t account for option premiums, also creating a false perception of yield. The discrepancy makes the real size of the income unclear and, in my opinion, reinforces the risk of NAV decay. Am I wrong to say that MSTR’s volatility will not play in favor of MST? In practical terms, the fund sacrifices part of the upside to obtain weekly distributions, which should theoretically cushion the drawdowns. But I think this sort of “hedging” is not so evident when negative volatility is as high as MSTR’s (implied volatility above 50 points). Conclusion A fascinating financial engineering product that, in my opinion, should be considered a tactical allocation, definitely not a core holding (if I may add, by paying close attention to the bid-ask spread on short-term trades). After all, it’s essentially a leveraged derivative exposure to MSTR. Among the metrics to monitor, I definitely include the distributions, through the 19a filings, but also the options strategy, mainly whether it will be able to generate alpha compared to MSTX and MSTY.",MSTR|MSTY|MSTX|MST,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-03 02:52:02

Tron’s steady growth in USDT activity and SUI’s volatile moves after its major token unlock show how quickly conditions can shift and why choosing the right project matters more than ever. While these projects continue to hold strong relevance, BlockDAG is turning heads with its standout numbers and upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release. After raising over $329 million in its presale, selling more than 23.6 billion coins, and moving into batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG is now offering early buyers a rare entry point at just $0.0016 until August 11. This limited-time offer, backed by strong audits and an expanding mining community, positions BlockDAG as a top contender among the best crypto coins for 2025. Tron Market Outlook Boosted by Rising USDT Activity Tron’s foundation in decentralised content sharing and strong partnerships keeps it steady despite market fluctuations. Its latest growth in USDT activity has defied the wider market dip, signalling healthy network usage. The Tron (TRX) market outlook remains promising as more developers and projects leverage its high-speed, low-cost transactions. Notably, Tron’s solid ecosystem supports stablecoin transfers and DeFi applications, giving it real-world utility. However, questions about regulatory clarity and decentralisation still linger. Some critics point out the risks of centralised governance and potential scalability concerns if network demand spikes dramatically. Even so, Tron stays resilient and could surprise many with its next phase of growth. SUI Price Movement Shifts After $164M Unlock & Developer Traction SUI gained traction with its innovative Layer 1 design that promises speed and cost efficiency. However, its recent $164 million token unlock sparked bearish sentiment, putting downward pressure on the SUI price movement. Despite this, SUI’s infrastructure remains attractive for developers who want flexibility and scalability without compromising security. It stands out for supporting on-chain assets and smart contracts with ease, which could help grow its ecosystem over time. Yet, it faces challenges from increasing competition and market volatility. The project’s success now hinges on how it navigates its token economics and community trust while maintaining steady development. BlockDAG’s Upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH Release, Powers $0.0016 Entry & Strong User Growth BlockDAG’s upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release is setting it apart from other emerging coins. The project is giving early buyers one of the lowest entry prices since its initial batch. BlockDAG has already raised an impressive $329 million in its presale, sold over 23.6 billion coins, and advanced to batch 29 at $0.0276. Now, it’s offering buyers a rare chance to secure BDAG at just $0.0016 until August 11, one of the lowest prices since batch 1. This special window is designed to expand access and reward early participation before the broader launch. Beyond this price advantage, BlockDAG has strengthened its credibility with successful Halborn and CertiK audits, signalling that its infrastructure is built to handle future growth securely. These approvals show the team’s commitment to delivering not just presale success but a robust, trusted ecosystem. The ongoing 100M BDAG Airdrop Campaign further fuels interest by letting users claim a share of BDAG through simple quests, adding more ways for new users to get involved. BlockDAG’s attractive pricing with clear trust signals and real adoption momentum. With over 18,284 miners sold and an expanding user base through its X1 Mining App, the project is backing its promises with real tools already in use. For anyone watching Tron or tracking SUI’s recent price movement, BlockDAG’s combination of strong security, major presale figures, and the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release makes it stand out as one of the best crypto coins for 2025 and beyond. The Bottom Line The Tron (TRX) market outlook remains solid with strong USDT activity, though questions around scalability and centralisation could affect its next phase. The SUI price movement shows how quickly a major unlock can reshape sentiment, yet its flexible Layer 1 keeps developers interested. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release, which opens a rare $0.0016 entry window until August 11, a chance far below its current batch 29 price. Backed by a $329 million presale, trusted Halborn and CertiK audits, and a growing miner base, BlockDAG is earning its place among the best crypto coins for 2025. For early movers, this window could be the difference between watching and winning.

In a post on X, the analyst highlighted key on-chain and derivatives data, painting a picture of dense liquidity stacked above current price levels, rising open interest, and a structure that resembles previous pre-squeeze conditions. XRP Short Squeeze Incoming? “Liquidity on the hourly is interesting,” CryptoInsightUK wrote, emphasizing what he described as “SUPER dense liquidity above us,” adding that in his view, “it’s inevitable this gets taken, probably sooner rather than later.” Accompanying images shared by the analyst indicate that the lower liquidity cluster sits around $1.90, while the upper zone—where a potential short squeeze could be triggered—concentrates around $2.40. The implication is clear: shorts are vulnerable to a cascade of forced liquidations if price begins to accelerate upward. The analysis drew on data from @velo_xyz, showing that open interest has been steadily climbing since an unexplained spike on June 24. Notably, during this time, premium remained heavily negative, and funding rates oscillated between positive and negative. “This suggests to me there have been a net addition of short positions to the Open Interest for $XRP,” the analyst wrote, implying that a crowded short trade could now be structurally exposed. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure—Analyst Says ‘Fireworks Ahead’ Layering this with TradingDiff’s liquidity heatmap, CryptoInsightUK inferred that “we are at some point looking for a short squeeze here for XRP.” While the timing remains uncertain, the combination of rising open interest, negative premium, and dense liquidity above suggests growing asymmetry in risk for short sellers. Still, the analyst added a critical note of caution. “Both ETH and XRP on the daily do have some liquidity below us,” he said, acknowledging the possibility of a fakeout or liquidity sweep downward before any aggressive upside movement. “As you guys know, it is possible to leave some liquidity behind as some people win their trades. BUT, we cannot count this out.” Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 A final observation focused on Ethereum’s changing liquidity landscape, which may have broader implications for the market as a whole. “Something has changed on ETH,” CryptoInsightUK wrote. “If we look to the liquidity above us we can see the Red has turned Yellow.” He interpreted this shift as a possible signal that shorts are being closed, or that new longs are building below the current price, thereby visually reducing the intensity of liquidity above. Whether XRP can reach the $2.40 liquidity pocket remains to be seen, but the fuse may already be lit. At press time, XRP traded at $2.18.

XRP , Solana (SOL) , and Ethereum (ETH) are positioned for strong moves as institutional flows, ETF optimism, and macro catalysts converge. But an unexpected contender— MAGACOIN FINANCE —is also capturing attention from early-stage investors and analysts alike. While the big names are powering up on the back of regulatory clarity and growing legitimacy, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum in presale channels as one of the cycle’s most speculative yet promising entries. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Project Gaining Real Traction Initially perceived as a meme project, MAGACOIN FINANCE has evolved into a serious player among early-stage altcoins. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens , a completed HashEx audit , and no venture capital allocations, the project is structured to support first-mover investors seeking outsized returns. Community buzz, presale demand, and repeated wallet engagement are pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE into a stronger position each week. As more investors look for exposure beyond high-cap assets, this politically-branded token could be one of the biggest wildcards of Q3. For traders aiming to capture exponential ROI before exchange listings or staking rewards go live, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a high-conviction play. XRP: Legal Clarity, ETF Momentum, and a Technical Setup in Focus XRP’s legal saga with the SEC officially closed in June 2025, giving the asset one of its biggest boosts in years. The finalized agreement—including a $50 million fine and return of $75 million in escrowed funds—has reinvigorated confidence in Ripple’s global strategy. ETF developments have followed quickly. ProShares will soon launch three XRP-based futures ETFs, and the CME Group is preparing to list XRP contracts, signaling growing institutional comfort. A spot ETF approval is now considered highly likely, with analysts estimating an 85% probability . Technically, XRP is building momentum. Having rebounded from $1.61 lows, it now trades around $2.15 to $2.36 , with breakout resistance at $2.40, $2.61 , and $3.00 . If breached, analysts point to long-range targets up to $19.27 or even $50 , based on previous cycle patterns. Solana: ETF Tailwinds and Enterprise Growth Drive Price Forecasts Solana is surging in institutional popularity, with nine ETF applications now pending in the U.S., including the latest filing from Invesco Galaxy . Bloomberg analysts now forecast a 90%+ chance of ETF approval this year, with SOL likely to lead among altcoin ETF products. SOL currently trades near $144–$147 , showing strength after recovering from its $126 low. A bullish reversal above $142.65 is underway, with upside projections between $168 and $290 by year-end, supported by booming DeFi, NFTs, and CME futures activity. Ethereum: Rebound Watch After June Drop Ethereum endured a rough June, falling over 20% , but key indicators now suggest a possible reversal. Large ETH holders accumulated over $1 billion in recent weeks, reinforcing confidence in a price rebound. ETH is currently hovering around $2,400 , with a Head and Shoulders bottom pattern emerging near $2,330. A breakout could lead to gains toward $2,774–$2,906 in the short term, with long-range targets of $5,925 in play. Staking continues to hit new records, and Ethereum’s core role in smart contracts and infrastructure makes it a foundational hold—even as traders seek volatility elsewhere. The Altcoins to Watch Closely This Quarter XRP : ETF momentum and legal clarity support major upside scenarios. Solana : ETF filings, DEX volume, and CME interest fuel growth. Ethereum : Rebound potential and whale accumulation suggest trend reversal. MAGACOIN FINANCE : Early-stage strength and explosive presale demand put it on breakout watch. As capital rotates and momentum builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a serious contender—especially for those seeking high ROI from early entry positions.

Despite weekly distributions, the fund's total returns are negative, reflecting both payouts and recent declines in underlying holdings. Long-term investors face high risks due to leverage, daily rebalancing, and the questionable long-term outlook for MSTR and BTC exposure. I rate MST a Hold, as its structure favors traders over investors and lacks a compelling case for long-term capital appreciation. Defiance Leveraged Long + Income MSTR ETF ( MST ) is a new ETF, launched in May. About two months old, I wanted to take a look at it and see how it related to Strategy ( MSTR ), being a fund based on that stock. Moreover, what should the investor make of ""Leveraged Long + Income"" part of its name as they stumble upon it? I found that it's much long-term or income-focused about it, and I rate it a Hold, thinking it too risky over time to be a good Buy. Performance So Far The first thing to note is the frequency of distributions. MST has paid weekly since its first dividend on May 20th. MST Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) Altogether, a single share has received $1.9178 in dividends since the launch. Price vs. Total Returns (Seeking Alpha) Thus, some of the price decline since launch is a consequence of these distributions, but the fact that total returns are negative also indicates that the holdings themselves have been down recently. What we are seeing, however, is that the fund prioritizes liquidity and monetization for its shareholders, so let's look at the strategy and portfolio behind this dividend policy. Concept and Holdings According to their prospectus , MST is an actively managed ETF that engages in derivative trades, in order to achieve daily returns of 150% to 200% of MSTR. While not a given, the fund may also use leverage in addition to their derivative position to achieve this goal. The choice of derivatives and timing of leverage are all subject to management's situational judgment. In short, it's a fund that actively trades on the swings of MSTR. It also means that the holdings are highly dynamic. Thankfully, the manager's website gives an up-to-date display of their holdings. Partial Holdings as of July 2, 2025 (Defiance Website) The screenshot (above) from that page shows parts of the holdings, but more or less captures what happens inside this ETF. The derivatives vary between swap agreements and call options. The calls are staggered across several strike prices, in order to provide flexibility to the manager based on market movements. This includes creating call credit spreads, in order to generate income in the portfolio. The Treasury positions (either directly or through funds), meanwhile, serve as collateral for the derivative positions they take. The image I've displayed is truly a snapshot, as per the prospectus: At the end of each trading day, the Fund’s swaps and options are marked to market (valued based on current market prices), and the Fund’s investment adviser rebalances the portfolio to maintain leveraged exposure of approximately 150% to 200% of the Underlying Security’s share price. Given this much activity, it's not surprising that distributions are regularly passed to shareholders. Nevertheless, management states that MST's primary investment objective is long-term capital appreciation, with income being secondary. Future Outlook The investment objective seems to suggest that MST is a fund that could be bought with long-term intentions, perhaps buying a large position and reinvesting the weekly dividends. While this would provide many opportunities of compounding, there are plenty of ways this can pan out badly for long-term investors. Let's talk about the underlying security first: MSTR. I've covered it twice, and last time I rated it a Hold. While that was in February, I am not of a mind to update that rating. One can easily surmise that I won't think MST is a Buy if I don't think that about MSTR. I'll just quote my own closing remarks from there: I take issue with the idea that selling shares at a premium to the portfolio to buy more creates ""BTC yield,"" any more than Berkshire doing the same would create ""KO yield"" with more shares of Coca-Cola. Without a source of earnings (something Berkshire has) to support this BTC accumulation, it's not clear why those who believe in BTC would aim for MSTR instead of buying the BTC directly. It just doesn't make sense to me. For a long-term investor to see appeal in an ETF that has the long term as part of its investment objective, we need to be able to see the long-term potential in the underlying security, and I already find that dubious. MST holding options and its leverage are both especially risky to long-term investors. The potential for magnified losses on even a 5% drop in BTC that gets locked in by daily rebalancing isn't something to ignore. The 1.31% expense ratio doesn't make recovery of principal much easier over time. A similar income fund that I've covered before is YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ). It employs synthetic covered calls and has the effect of regularly passing through gains to shareholders. While it isn't without risks, the potential for losses aren't enhanced in their portfolio, and I didn't even find that to be a Buy. In my view, MST is more a trader's security. MSTR effectively operates as a derivative of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), making MST a derivative of a derivative, potentially very volatile and risky. Conclusion I am initiating a Hold rating largely because I see no compelling case to think BTC will move up or down considerably in the near-term, which would trickle into more volatile reactions from the likes of MSTR and MST. In addition, a Buy rating on this security doesn't make sense for long-term investors. While the fund may declare long-term intentions, it seems to me the approach just doesn't allow for it.",MST,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-03 03:04:44

The first major resistance is near the $2,665 level. A clear move above the $2,665 resistance might send the price toward the $2,720 resistance. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,750 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,615 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,560 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550 zone. A clear move below the $2,550 support might push the price toward the $2,520 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,450 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

This marked a major stride in HTX DAO’s global expansion strategy, highlighting its forward-looking initiatives in decentralized governance, ecosystem growth, and compliance-first innovation. HTX on the Global Stage: Embracing the Stablecoin Surge and Web3 Integration During the event, Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX and Founder of TRON, and Serdar Serdengecti, Listing Director of HTX, delivered key insights into the shifting dynamics of the digital asset landscape. Justin Sun emphasized that the industry is entering a transformative phase, accelerated by regulatory openness and institutional adoption. He pointed to the surging stablecoin momentum as a pivotal opportunity for the crypto ecosystem to demonstrate real-world utility. In particular, Sun highlighted Turkey’s proactive embrace of stablecoins such as USDT on TRON, showcasing how digital assets can drive economic empowerment and financial freedom at scale. “This is just the beginning. The real work is still ahead of us,” said Sun. “I encourage all of you to keep building and keep pushing. I look forward to seeing the progress we will make together in the remaining half of 2025.” At the roundtable, “From Trading Platforms to Financial Superapps: Are Crypto Exchanges Becoming the Everything App for Digital Finance?”, Serdar Serdengecti shared insights on the global regulatory landscape and convergence in Web3. Serdar reiterated HTX’s commitment to compliance as a cornerstone of its global strategy, stating that HTX actively engages regulators, respects jurisdictional frameworks, and designs for long-term trust. He outlined how HTX’s listing process is rooted in user value, supported by research from HTX Ventures, the scalability and interoperability of TRON, and the decentralized governance of HTX DAO. The platform is collectively forming a robust path for sustainable project incubation, fostering a resilient and scalable ecosystem. Looking ahead, Serdar described the next phase of Web3 as the “Era of Integration”, where infrastructure, user experience, regulation, and value creation will increasingly converge. “The lines between CeFi and DeFi, DAOs and TradFi, will continue to blur. Centralized platforms and decentralized protocols will accelerate collaboration, and regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets will gradually take shape. Therefore, the industry’s next phase will not be solely about innovation, but about who can earn trust, integrate ecosystem resources effectively, and scale sustainably.” HTX DAO’s Space Capsule Booth Draws Crowds in Istanbul HTX DAO’s space capsule-themed booth became a major attraction on the exhibition floor. The installation served not only as a visual showcase of HTX DAO’s visions but also as a touchpoint for real-time engagement with global builders and local enthusiasts. HTX DAO team members were on-site to guide attendees through the platform’s latest progress in governance tools, ecosystem expansion, and user engagement. Strategically positioned at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, Istanbul has become a vital hub for Middle Eastern and European crypto innovation. HTX DAO’s participation at IBW reaffirmed its ongoing commitment to a “decentralized governance and global collaboration” framework and reinforces HTX’s broader mission to bridge regional ecosystems with global infrastructure. As Serdar noted, “Turkey’s Web3 community is maturing from the ground up, fast-moving, community-rich, and deeply responsive to both global innovation and local needs. Any project that can thrive here proves its adaptability on a global scale. HTX is proud to partner with local builders and communities to advance a more open, transparent, and inclusive digital future.” About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization.

While Solana (SOL) and Ripple’s XRP have retained their credibility as high-cap leaders, there’s an increasing appetite for deeper, more asymmetric opportunities. For many traders, that path now points directly to MAGACOIN FINANCE —a presale project gathering serious traction ahead of its anticipated debut on exchanges. With an influx of capital flowing into early-stage projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the dark horse of Q3. Its well-structured presale rounds, capped token supply, and unique branding have drawn in investors looking for strong setups before the broader market catches on. Early Momentum Propels MAGACOIN FINANCE Into the Spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities in early investor circles. The project has closed each presale round ahead of schedule—indicating strong demand and sustained retail engagement. Unlike many meme-token imitators, this altcoin is built around more than just hype. The project’s deflationary supply mechanics , combined with a verified smart contract audit , appeal to long-term investors seeking stability in a volatile market. The lack of VC control adds another layer of appeal, providing retail investors with more favorable tokenomics. Its ecosystem positioning is designed with longevity in mind—offering investors a chance to get in before potential listing events and liquidity unlocks drive price discovery. Solana and XRP: Still Strong, But Missing Early-Stage Edge Solana continues to shine as a Layer-1 protocol, especially given its rapid DeFi expansion and developer activity. Similarly, XRP has gained renewed institutional traction following regulatory victories and ETF developments that could broaden its investor base. Yet among seasoned traders, there’s an understanding that high-cap coins like XRP and SOL have already made their major moves in past cycles. That doesn’t mean they lack potential—but it does mean the returns are more incremental compared to early-stage altcoins that are still flying under the radar. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE becomes compelling: it offers the kind of presale-phase exposure that XRP and Solana once represented years ago. Strategic Timing Matters in a Rebalancing Market Portfolio rotation is the name of the game in Q3 2025. As investor appetite shifts from consolidation plays to high-upside bets, early positioning in strong presale projects can offer considerable reward. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining ground in this narrative—its consistent wallet growth, presale sellouts, and cultural relevance are creating a potent recipe for price appreciation. Analysts now rank MAGACOIN FINANCE among the most interesting early-phase assets for the second half of the year. They cite not just its political and meme-driven momentum, but also its robust underlying mechanics that are catching the eyes of long-term capital allocators. Analyst Insight: MAGACOIN FINANCE Has Breakout Potential Market observers note that MAGACOIN FINANCE checks several of the right boxes: A scarcity-based token model No venture capital dilution Strategic messaging aligned with macro and cultural narratives Consistent momentum ahead of public listings With these elements in place, analysts say the project could outperform many listed altcoins in the next leg of the cycle. If exchange listings arrive as expected, the early buyers from the presale phase could stand to benefit the most. Final Takeaway: Not Just a Meme—But a Calculated Move As 2025 unfolds, it’s clear that investors are not abandoning blue-chip assets like Solana and XRP—but they are actively seeking diversification into more aggressive upside scenarios. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a rare window of entry—before wider awareness, media attention, and listings shift the pricing floor permanently. For those preparing for the next rotation, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just an option. It’s a strategic move.

The fintech exited the crypto business in late 2023 due to regulatory pressures to gain the banking license. Crypto fintechs are currently trading at much higher valuation multiples due to the scalable and capital-light business models. Despite recent stock highs, SoFi remains undervalued at 16x EBITDA, especially compared to crypto peers like Robinhood and Circle. While SoFi Technologies, Inc. ( SOFI ) has reported impressive financial results since exiting the crypto sector back in late 2023, the stock has now soared to multi-year highs on just announcing the future launch. The fintech should unlock a whole new segment that has launched a peer stock to a far higher market cap. My investment thesis remains ultra-Bullish on SoFi, even at recent highs, due to a still relatively cheap valuation and a large market opportunity. Source: Finviz Golden Opportunity Back on June 25, SoFi announced the return of crypto to the fintech platform. The company plans to initially offer cryptocurrency trading in the popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with plans to offer stablecoins, the opportunity to borrow against crypto assets and expanded payment options. Source: SoFi website For now, members have to join a waitlist with an unknown timeline to product launches. The U.S. Senate just passed the Genius Act providing a regulatory path for stablecoins, opening up the door for fintechs like SoFi to launch such products. The stablecoin market is forecasted to rise more than tenfold by 2030 to between $3 trillion and $4 trillion , up from only ~$250 billion now. Analysts at Citizens JMP see the potential for annual revenues from stablecoins opening up a $100 billion opportunity. SoFi originally offered limited crypto trading of up to 20 tokens back in 2023 before exiting the opportunity to pursue a digital bank. SoFi handed the operations over to Blockchain.com and apparently included crypto assets of just under $140 million . The fintech didn't provide a lot of details regarding the crypto business size, probably due to its infancy position, but SoFi has experience in the area and could potentially lead to a snappy re-launch. Robinhood started offering crypto a few years back, and the company only topped $50 million in quarterly revenues in Q1'24. Robinhood recently saw revenues jump to $610 million during the Q4/Q1 period, for an annualized rate above $1 billion. The company reported crypto notional trading volumes in Q1 of $46 billion, vastly larger than the limited balances held by SoFi back in late 2023. The online broker lists a cryptocurrency asset balance of $28 billion to end March. Robinhood has total platform assets of $221 billion, so a lot of questions will exist on whether SoFi has the investment products to achieve any level of success, as the brokerage business isn't a prime focus. Source: Robinhood Q1'25 presentation Left Behind Robinhood has ridden these transaction-based revenues from both crypto and stock options trading to produce an $87 billion market cap, now over 4x the valuation of the similarly sized SoFi previously focused on lending products. SoFi has the potential to use the additional growth from transaction-based revenues to boost the stock valuation. Data by YCharts Even recent IPO Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) has seen the market cap start to $45 billion based on offering a 2nd largest stablecoin product. Clearly, the market is offering higher valuations to fintechs involved in the crypto sector. Robinhood has seen adjusted EBITDA targets suddenly double the estimates for SoFi. Robinhood now trades at nearly 40x EBITDA targets of $2.25 billion for 2026 while SoFi only trades at 16x a forecast of $1.27 billion for next year. Data by YCharts SoFi has the opportunity to unleash crypto revenues, along with the push into the SoFi Plus subscription service, similar to how Robinhood used the Gold Card product to attract a horde of new customers. SoFi had already forecast 25% annual growth over the next 3 years, while analysts generally aren't forecasting these same growth rates with estimates for growth below 20% in both 2026 and 2027. Source: Seeking Alpha If crypto generates the next inflection point for SoFi, the stock has substantial upside. The fintech would see both a boost to already solid sales growth forecasts and another step up in profits with a possible corresponding valuation multiple boost due to the shift away from relying on lending products for growth while moving to scalable, capital-light revenue. The risk is that SoFi is now late to offer a crypto product with Coinbase ( COIN ), Robinhood and other platforms having first mover advantage. In addition, SoFi might always have a valuation tied to the risks associated with lending products. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that SoFi already offered a compelling valuation and business model, but crypto could take the fintech to the next level. The stock has a compelling valuation at only 16x adjusted EBITDA targets with much faster growth rates and the opportunity for crypto and new subscription services to boost SoFi to another level.",SOFI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-03 03:33:57

Ethereum’s price has been stuck around $2,400 for some time, without much movement. While some experts like Bitwise think it might not hit new all-time highs this year, Tom Lee remains positive about its future. In an interview with Coinage , said that even though Ethereum slowed down in innovation for a while, it’s now regaining momentum. One reason is the growing trend of tokenizing real-world assets. This means turning things like dollars, company shares, and other financial products into digital tokens. Big companies like Robinhood and Coinbase’s Base network are already working on Ethereum, which helps strengthen its position in the market. Lee also explained that Ethereum is mostly U.S.-based or operates under U.S. regulation, making it a safer and more reliable option for handling tokenized financial products. Another factor, according to Lee, is that many investors have given up on Ethereum, assuming its best days are over. This could actually set the stage for a surprise rally. He said that if the world embraces tokenized assets and starts trading them actively, the value of blockchains like Ethereum will rise sharply. Tom Lee said, “Ethereum could probably go to $10,000 if the world realizes tokenizing assets is the future.” As this trend grows, demand for Ethereum’s network could increase, pulling its price up with it. Ethereum Price Prediction (Short-Term) Ethereum’s price is still moving sideways within a broad range between $2,200 and $2,600. It hasn’t decided whether to move higher or drop towards the support zone again. The price briefly dipped below $2,383 but bounced back, showing bulls are still active at this level. Right now, Ethereum is stuck between the upper and lower boundaries of this range, with no clear breakout yet. If it breaks above the top of the range and holds, the price could target higher levels like $2,530 and $2,780. .",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-03 03:36:48

The rise of liquid staking and restaking protocols is one of the essential DeFi trends of 2025, as the technology transforms how users engage with blockchains to get rewards and obtain returns. Difficulty in registering disasters and disaster gaps filling the traditional staking bottleneck Despite its role as the basis of PoS networks, classical staking has long entailed two potential costs – its users have to give up liquidity by locking the tokens to provide their network with security and earn remuneration in society. Such a constraint has always kept other investors outside the process of staking, especially those interested in having the freedom of selling or frequently using their resources, like in other DeFi services and protocols. As DeFi transitioned into a mature product, the problem was even more imminent. The users were forced to either stake to receive the staking rewards or engage in other yield-generating ones , such as lending, borrowing or supplying liquidity to DEXs (decentralized exchanges). To a large extent, this type of either-or situation left too much value at the table, resulting in inefficient use of capital throughout the ecosystem. That is the liquid staking revolution. Liquid staking was created to solve this dilemma elegantly and enable the user to stake their tokens and maintain liquid derivative tokens reflecting their stake. These LSTs (liquid staking tokens) are freely tradable. They can be secured as collateral or create leverage in other DeFi protocols, thus removing what is known as the liquidity penalty of traditional staking. This idea became popular with protocols like Lido Finance that offered stETH (staked Ethereum) as a fluid version of staked ETH. This new technology made the possible use cases and yield strategies floodgates. By now, users could stake ETH and in return, get their teeth – then use it in DeFi solutions like providing liquidity on DEXs, gaining more rewards by lending protocols or following other DeFi ideas. The implications have been enormous. These protocols boosted the overall security of the network by allowing staked assets to be withdrawn when a stake was less likely to be attacked by a lazy observer, since this raised the number of people staking – thus making the network more secure – and because it added capital to the DeFi ecosystem by making more capital available to be staked and therefore used by all the protocols available. The new frontier – r estaking Restaking has become the logical upgrade based on the effectiveness of liquid staking. With restaking, the users may increase the security assurances of their collateral possessions to cover other blockchain services and protocols and earn other payoffs simultaneously. EigenLayer is one of the first to enter this market, and they have developed what some are referring to as a paradigm shift in how blockchain security is handled. Instead of having each new protocol require booting up its security, restaking enables sharing staked assets to secure many services via a single staking set. That makes the security model more efficient and gives stakes more revenue opportunities. The technology does not end at that point. The LRTs (liquid restaking tokens) are a second layer of such an ecosystem and enable the liquidity of restated positions in the same way LSTs enable traditional staking. This forms a compound effect where users can obtain rewards generated by a single source while keeping their liquidity and capability to engage in other DeFi processes. The awakening of the institution The fact that more and more institutions have become interested in the DeFi staking mechanisms was perhaps the most critical development in 2025. DeFi has been used to define many of the current financial services based in the traditional financial world, but they are becoming more open to the value proposition of these developed staking tactics. Several factors are causing the shift. First, the regulatory climate has improved, and some straightforward rules are crystallizing regarding the staking of digital assets and DeFi engagement. Second, the infrastructure has become highly mature, and forms of institutional-grade custody and compliance tools allow traditional finance to enter the space more safely. Leading financial institutions have stopped seeing DeFi as a speculative turf and instead see it as a plausible yield source that can supplement conventional investment. The fact that liquid staking and restaking protocols allow for the earning of many incomes – keeping the option of moving the positions due to varying market realities – fits the practices of institutional risk management. Risks and its considerations and challenges Along with the thrilling prospects, the development of staking procedures has given rise to new risks that one will have to pay close attention to. The risk of smart contracts has also been compounded, given that people are dealing with more complex protocols. All abstractions between liquid staking, restaking and liquid restaking introduce possible sources of failure. There are more nuances to slashing risks. In classical staking, users are subjected to cuts due to validator malpractices on an individual network. When restaking, these risks add on top of each other on various services and protocols. When a validator is malicious when securing more than one network by staking, the fines may even be more drastic. The complexity of such systems also causes new types of systemic risk. The more capital that flows into interconnected staking protocols, the greater the chance of an escalating failure. The potential effects of a serious problem with one of the largest liquid staking providers on the DeFi ecosystem are huge. To the future – Future of yield This path of the development of DeFi staking speaks of the idea that we are just at the beginning of a paradigm shift, like blockchain networks secured and rewarded to users. The concept of yield staking – the possibility to earn more than one source of income on one underlying asset – is becoming more advanced. Further advancements can also involve cross-chain restaking when the value staked on the first blockchain can be used to secure the services on the other chains. This would make the multi-chain ecosystem even more intertwined and efficient and present users with even more varied sources of revenue. There is also a high probability that integrating traditional finance with such DeFi mechanisms will speed up. There is a potential to create new financial instruments to offer the DeFi rates to the conventional investment portfolio as institutions gain more comfort with the risk-reward curves of more advanced staking strategies. Clarity of regulation will remain extremely important to this evolution. The more lawmakers and regulatory authorities have an insight into the inner workings of these systems, the more guidelines of ease or restriction may emerge that can either speed up the use of these mechanisms or narrow down how they evolve. Conclusion The development of simple staking to more sophisticated yield-generation strategies is an evolution of technology and a paradigm shift in our capital efficiency and blockchain security models. By removing the trade-offs that restricted stake participation in the past, liquid staking and restaking protocols are opening up new opportunities for individual and institutional investors. As these mechanisms keep maturing and becoming mainstream, they are bound to play a focal role in the overall transformation of the financial system. It is possible to have several income streams in one asset, remain liquid and be a part of a larger system of financial services, which has a strong appeal to the point where conventional finance is finding it difficult to ignore. The critical point is that the participants should clearly view the risks and rewards of these opportunities. New optics in DeFi will create a new opportunity, and whoever best understands how to operate in the complexity and manage the risks will be in the best situation to take advantage of this new paradigm.

As legacy coins like XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) show signs of slowing, a wave of early investors is turning to a different kind of opportunity: one that blends early-stage momentum, capped supply, and viral appeal. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE , a political-meets-meme token that’s quietly becoming one of the most talked-about presale altcoins of the year. While XRP and DOGE remain cultural mainstays in crypto, they now face a challenge from a fresh contender with a growing community, strategic structure, and presale demand that’s breaking records. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rapid Presale Growth, Strong Branding, and Community Power Presale tokens rarely attract attention like this. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already secured over $10 million in early-stage funding and is moving through each round at lightning speed. The hype isn’t just noise—it’s being backed by robust fundamentals, including: A fixed 170 billion token supply A full audit by HashEx No VC allocations—100% distributed to the community More than that, it has narrative firepower. MAGACOIN FINANCE combines political satire, meme culture, and grassroots appeal to create a movement—not just a token. Its viral momentum echoes early SHIBA and PEPE cycles, with a community that’s already driving daily traction across social platforms. Why XRP and DOGE Traders Are Taking Notice The timing isn’t coincidental. XRP recently overcame its regulatory hurdles, but its growth curve now leans toward long-term institutional adoption—a slower pace that doesn’t always suit fast-moving retail portfolios. Dogecoin , on the other hand, has struggled to recreate its former highs. Its unlimited token supply and minimal development roadmap have cooled the frenzy, leaving long-term holders looking for the next high-upside narrative. That search is leading them to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a project that merges DOGE’s meme roots with XRP’s early momentum model. With viral branding, capped supply, and presale ROI forecasts ranging from 2,500% to 18,500% , it’s no wonder XRP and DOGE investors are reallocating early. Analysts Signal: This Is a Pre-Listing Opportunity Worth Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being featured in analyst reports that previously only covered top-20 altcoins. The reason? Its structural integrity, growing presale traction, and roadmap—all of which point to breakout potential. With staking utilities in development, a streamlined referral program, and widespread community engagement, the project has everything early buyers look for before a listing wave hits. And the window is closing. Once exchange listings roll out and influencer coverage ramps up, the pricing dynamic is likely to shift—leaving presale buyers in the best position to benefit. Final Thought: A Rare Setup That’s Gaining Speed Fast If you’re holding DOGE or XRP, you’re not alone in looking for faster upside potential. The market is signaling, analysts are confirming, and the community is already rallying. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the project that traders want to talk about before it goes viral. This isn’t just another speculative meme coin. It’s a calculated early entry with asymmetric upside—and it’s gaining attention from those who’ve seen these cycles before.

Over the past seven days, the asset has gained only 0.3%, while it declined 0.2% in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,436. Notably, the ongoing lack of momentum reflects broader hesitation in the crypto market, even as institutional activity and whale behaviors provide structural support for price levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Indecision Masks A Bullish Setup – Here’s Why BTC Holds The Key Ethereum Whales Accumulate, Retail Traders Remain Inactive In a recent market insight shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, on-chain analyst Banker described Ethereum’s current phase as a “deadlock.” According to him, the market is witnessing steady accumulation from large holders, particularly visible through consistent ~60,000 ETH in weekly staking inflows and significant negative exchange netflows, which point to withdrawal activity exceeding deposits. However, these developments are being met with little to no increased activity from retail investors, creating a state of stagnation rather than bullish momentum. Banker noted that exchange data shows over 200,000 ETH being withdrawn in recent spikes, likely absorbed by institutional players. On the other hand, retail-driven deposits, which have reached around 100,000 ETH since 2023, are not enough to create breakout pressure. Daily active addresses remain flat at 300,000–400,000 levels, far below what has historically coincided with strong upward moves in Ethereum’s price. The neutral funding rate of 0.004% further reflects a lack of directional conviction among leveraged traders. According to Banker, the continued withdrawal activity by whales, combined with stable leverage usage, is creating a kind of supply squeeze that prevents significant downside pressure. However, without renewed participation from retail investors or a rise in daily address activity above 400,000, Ethereum is likely to remain within a narrow range. The report concludes that while downside is being contained by large holders, a meaningful breakout would require broader market engagement or a clear external catalyst. Exchange Activity, Divergences, and Macro Factors Add Headwinds Meanwhile, in a separate post, CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha examined Ethereum’s exchange inflows and derivatives data, suggesting the market may be on the verge of short-term volatility. Taha reported that on July 1, over 100,000 ETH, worth around $250 million, were sent to Binance in two separate transactions. Such large inflows typically indicate selling intentions or a preparation for trades, especially when they coincide with other bearish signals. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Drops After Bullish Attempt — Support Area Under Pressure Taha also highlighted a divergence between Ethereum’s spot price and Binance Open Interest. While ETH recently printed three local highs above $2,500, Open Interest has continued to decline, forming three lower highs. This lack of confirmation by derivatives traders suggests hesitation to commit to long positions. At the same time, US Federal Reserve net liquidity has dropped from roughly $6.2 trillion to $5.84 trillion, tightening financial conditions and reducing capital flows into risk assets like crypto. According to Taha, unless macro conditions improve or Ethereum-specific demand surges, the asset could face downward pressure in the short term.

The AI company issued a firm statement on X on Wednesday, rejecting any involvement in the initiative, which the trading platform unveiled earlier this week. On Monday, Robinhood announced a giveaway of 5 euros worth of OpenAI and SpaceX tokens to eligible users in the European Union who register to trade its newly introduced stock tokens by July 7. The move was part of a broader product rollout in Cannes, France, focused on tokenized equities and blockchain infrastructure. The news sent Robinhood shares soaring to a new all-time high, crossing the $100 mark. These “OpenAI tokens” are not OpenAI equity.

Please be careful. — OpenAI Newsroom (@OpenAINewsroom) July 2, 2025 “Your Equity is Fake”: Elon Musk In response, Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI and currently leads SpaceX, amplified OpenAI’s denial with a blunt post of his own. “Your ‘equity’ is fake,” Musk wrote on X. His remark echoed his long-standing criticism of OpenAI’s shift from a nonprofit to a profit-driven model. However, his comment focused on OpenAI’s internal structure. He did not address the SpaceX tokens that were also part of the promotion. Robinhood, for its part, defended the offering. CEO Vlad Tenev acknowledged that the tokens were not technically equity but argued they give retail users a rare opportunity to gain exposure to private tech giants. “Our giveaway plants a seed for something much bigger,” he wrote, adding that the company has heard from many private firms interested in joining what he called a “tokenization revolution.” At our recent crypto event, we announced a limited Stock Token giveaway on OpenAI and SpaceX to eligible European customers.

They are then offered via Robinhood’s crypto platform. In addition, the company is using the EU’s more relaxed rules on investor participation to enable the launch. Further, Robinhood has stated that these tokens are designed to offer indirect exposure to private companies. This approach aims to expand access for individual investors who are typically excluded from traditional venture capital markets. Supporters online echoed that view. One user posted that the critics were “missing the forest for the trees. According to the post, access matters more than legal precision for everyday investors. In response, Tenev replied with a single word: “precisely.” Still, the episode shows ongoing tensions in the crypto space. On one side are platforms eager to democratize access to financial markets. On the other are companies whose brand and equity are being represented on-chain without formal partnerships. Additionally, regulatory barriers prevent US users from accessing these tokens.

The price is now consolidating gains and might face hurdles near the $2.285 zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.220 zone. The price is now trading above $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it fails to clear the $2.2850 resistance zone. XRP Price Restarts Increase XRP price found support near the $2.150 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to recover losses and climbed above the $2.220 resistance level. The bulls were able to push the price above the $2.250 level. There was a spike above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.327 swing high to the $2.148 low. However, the bears were active near the $2.2850 level. The price failed to surpass the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.327 swing high to the $2.148 low. The price is now trading above $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.2580 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.2850 level. The next resistance is $2.320. A clear move above the $2.320 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance or even $2.420 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. Fresh Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.2850 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.220 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.20 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.150 support. The next major support sits near the $2.120 zone.

Although Barron has not provided specific details, the timing of his message aligns with several important updates already expected in the coming weeks, prompting further speculation from market participants. XRP community members are now urging for more clarity on the expected timeline, eager to determine whether the reveal will occur within days or stretch into the coming month. Legal Finality Sets the Stage for Future Growth Recent updates surrounding the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit have also contributed to the rising optimism. Ripple Labs announced last month that it would no longer pursue further legal appeals following a final ruling issued by Judge Torres in August 2024. Rather than continuing its appeal, Ripple stated its intention to prioritize future initiatives. This decision is viewed as a strategic step toward closing the lawsuit. The resolution of this long-standing case is expected to open the door to new partnerships, institutional involvement, and strategic moves that had been postponed due to legal uncertainties. Members of the XRP community are now awaiting Ripple’s formal withdrawal from the case and the official conclusion of the proceedings. Spotlight on ETF Progress and Market Legitimacy Adding to the momentum, XRP recently gained exposure through its inclusion in Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), which has received approval to convert into a spot ETF. This marks a significant shift, as it introduces XRP into an ETF format accessible to institutional investors, previously limited to futures-based products. This development has intensified calls for a dedicated XRP spot ETF. Currently, multiple proposals, including those from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton , are under the SEC review. Observers believe that a standalone spot ETF could be approved before the regulatory deadline in October 2025, especially given the broader trend of increasing institutional involvement in digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Growing Corporate Adoption Signals Confidence Beyond ETF progress, more companies are beginning to adopt XRP as part of their financial strategies. At least nine firms, representing diverse sectors such as pharmaceuticals, energy, cannabis, and technology, have publicly disclosed plans to hold XRP in their treasuries. In total, these companies are investing nearly $1 billion in XRP holdings. Key participants include Trident Digital Tech Holdings ($500 million), Webus ($300 million), VivoPower ($100 million), and Wellgistics Health ($50 million). This growing corporate adoption underscores XRP’s appeal as both a reserve asset and a tool for cross-border financial operations. Upcoming Leveraged ETF Adds to Bullish Outlook Tuttle Capital Management is set to launch a new suite of leveraged crypto ETFs on July 16, which will include products linked to XRP, Solana, and BNB. As per regulatory procedure, the filings will be automatically approved unless the SEC raises formal objections. This move mirrors the previous strategies used by Teucrium and Volatility Shares, which successfully launched XRP futures ETFs using similar regulatory frameworks. With positive legal outcomes, heightened institutional interest, and expanding product offerings, XRP appears to be entering a new phase of market relevance. While details of Paul Barron’s statement remain unclear, the broader environment suggests that XRP holders may have multiple reasons to stay optimistic in the coming months.

Most users flip between tabs, bots, and multiple platforms just to keep up with the action. Now there’s another option. Web3 ai is stepping in as an all-in-one dashboard that shifts how crypto is managed. It does more than display balances. It monitors the market, warns about risks, shows trend signals, and points to live staking and DeFi chances, all within one screen. It works like your crypto command centre. And here’s what matters: this is not open to everyone yet. Web3 ai is still in presale. That makes early access important. For anyone looking for the best crypto to buy now, this tool may offer more than just updates. It could shape how you trade from now on. Web3 ai Could Be the Most Complete Crypto Dashboard Yet Web3 ai goes beyond typical tools. Instead of managing five tabs for prices, news, risk data, and staking updates, imagine one system doing all of that in real time. The platform offers an AI-powered view into your wallet, showing returns, catching scam coins, following market patterns, and highlighting yield and lending options. It works for both new and seasoned users with a clean and simple layout. Here’s the detail that matters. This dashboard is not public. Only presale users can access it for now. Web3 ai is in Stage 9 of its presale. The token is priced at $0.000443, with over $8.7 million already raised. The confirmed listing price is $0.005242. Web3 ai offers early users a 1747% ROI. With the mobile app coming soon and more features on the way, there may be more upside ahead. If you are thinking about the best crypto to buy now, Web3 ai presents a unique option. It is not just about the market price. It offers something useful. As more users join and interact with its features, the value of $WAI could grow. Staking, voting rights, and token burns are all part of the structure, giving it a longer-term use case. This is one of those early access chances where tech, utility, and timing all meet. If you missed earlier AI projects, Web3 ai could be your next entry point for the best crypto to buy now. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Forecast: Will It Cross $50 or Drop Toward $30? The latest Hyperliquid (HYPE) price forecast shows strong movement near the $40 mark. After hitting a high close of $45.72, the token is facing both selling pressure and bullish patterns. Experts expect resistance between $44 and $48, with a chance to reach $50 if buyers stay active. But some signals show weakness, like falling volume and bearish divergence, suggesting a pullback to the $36 to $30 zone. CoinCodex sees a drop to $27.8 by mid-July, while Bravenewcoin points to treasury inflows and buybacks from firms like EyeNovia and Lion Group. This mix of data makes the current Hyperliquid (HYPE) price forecast worth watching. MACD readings and open interest numbers are losing strength, but the upward trendline remains. If support holds near $41.60, bulls could push back toward $48. If not, $36 may be the next stop. The price is still moving fast, and traders using real-time tools and on-chain tracking will have better chances to catch the next swing. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Movement: Can It Stay Above $455 or Hit $500? Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price movement is holding firm after bouncing at $454 and rising above $480. Trading volume is growing, and the 50/200 moving average crossover on the 4-hour chart adds to the bullish view. BCH has also outpaced BTC in volatility, and the BCH/BTC pair just crossed above its 200-day moving average. With RSI sitting near 68, momentum remains strong, though it is close to overbought. Key levels to watch are $455 to $460 for support and $487 to $500 for resistance. A clean move above $500 could start a bigger rally, but RSI changes and a weaker BCH/BTC ratio are warning signs. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price movement is one of the few large caps showing active buying with strong volume. For traders watching short-term trades, this chart is one to watch closely, especially as it tests levels where buyers have stepped in more than once this week. Final Thoughts The Hyperliquid (HYPE) price forecast is unclear. It could climb above $50 or slide toward $30. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price movement is stronger above $480 with growing volume and bullish signs, but RSI shows a possible slowdown ahead. Both charts are active, but tracking them without the right tools can be tough. That is where Web3 ai comes in. Instead of switching between apps or following multiple feeds, this AI platform brings alerts, scam checks, and market insights into one dashboard. It is only available for crypto presale users now, with over $8.7 million raised and the price set at $0.000443. The future listing price is $0.005242, which gives early users a high potential return. Web3 ai is not just another idea; it is a working upgrade. For those who want a better way to manage crypto, early access still counts.

Solana’s pullback may be setting up a breakout, Cardano is flashing early reversal signals, and XRP is quietly showing strength in the face of uncertainty. These trending tokens could be the first to rally if momentum returns. This market preview is supported by Outset PR —an agency that merges data analytics, editorial finesse, and proprietary distribution tools to help crypto projects rise with the tide. When interest spikes and sentiment shifts, Outset PR ensures your project gets seen, heard, and remembered. Solana (SOL): Pullback or Launchpad? Bulls Eye Major Reversal Levels Source: tradingview Solana is currently trading between $139.87 and $167.27, suggesting a consolidation phase that could turn bullish with the right momentum. Despite a recent 4% dip this week and an 18% monthly pullback, the RSI hovers around 50—indicating a neutral zone that could quickly swing upward. Key resistance levels at $181 and $208 offer nearly 25–35% upside from current prices if bulls step back in. As Solana continues expanding its DeFi and NFT ecosystems and benefits from high-speed scalability, any shift in sentiment could spark a rapid push through resistance. Long-term believers may see this dip as an entry point rather than a warning sign. Cardano (ADA): Oversold Signals Could Spark a Rebound Source: tradingview Cardano's price is fluctuating between $0.59 and $0.71, with bears leading short-term movements after a 24% drop this past month. However, support above $0.54 has held strong so far, and a bounce from this level could target $0.78 and even $0.90—a potential 30% move. With the RSI below 50, the asset is edging closer to oversold territory, possibly setting up a trend reversal. Cardano’s strong developer activity, expanding dApp ecosystem, and upcoming protocol upgrades may fuel fresh demand. If the broader market stabilizes, ADA could become one of the week’s surprise gainers. XRP (XRP): Stability Amid Volatility Signals Hidden Strength Source: tradingview XRP is trading steadily between $2.00 and $2.30, showing resilience even as broader market uncertainty weighs on momentum. Though it remains just under its 10-day moving average of $2.13, the weekly decline is under 1%, suggesting strong underlying support. Resistance at $2.45 remains the next major hurdle, and a breakout could push XRP toward $2.70—about a 17% gain from current levels. With support holding around $1.94, the technical base looks solid for a bullish attempt. As institutional interest in XRP-based payments continues to grow, it could quietly outperform expectations in the near term. PR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection.

Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits. Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone. Case in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after Outset PR amplified a well-polished organic coverage with a massive Google Discover campaign, powered by its proprietary content distribution engine. Drive More Traffic with Outset PR’s In-house Tech Outset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd Outset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge. The team regularly provides valuable insights into the performance of crypto media outlets based on the criteria like: domain activity month-on-month visibility shifts audience geography source of traffic By consistently publishing analytical reports, identifying performance trends, and raising the standards of media targeting across the industry, Outset PR unlocks a previously untapped niche in crypto PR, which poses it as a trendsetter in this field. Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Conclusion Solana’s technical setup, Cardano’s oversold structure, and XRP’s resilient base suggest that these tokens deserve close attention this week. Each offers a compelling case for upside, provided market conditions align and bullish momentum builds. As always, early recognition of trend shifts can make all the difference. Outset PR is built for those moments—where media timing meets market movement.

But with the right coins, it becomes easier. What makes a good choice for beginners isn’t just popularity. It’s how easy it is to use, how real its use cases are, and how strong the project can grow over time. The top crypto projects in 2025 are ones that offer a fair mix of clear use, growing demand, and simple design. Whether you’re curious about tools powered by AI or want exposure to blockchain-based finance, this list keeps things practical and beginner-friendly. Here are four top crypto projects in 2025 worth checking out, starting with Unstaked, which is becoming known for being both effective and easy to use. Each of these has something different to offer, helping new users understand the space better. Below is a full breakdown of the top crypto projects in 2025 with both working ideas and room for growth. 1. Unstaked ($UNSD): Clear Use and Simple Tools for First-Timers Unstaked focuses on AI tools that can be built with no coding skills. Instead of typing commands, people can create AI agents using a drag-and-drop builder. These agents are designed to do tasks on places like Telegram, Discord, or X. From chat moderation to promotion tools, all actions are recorded under something called “Proof of Intelligence,” and users earn based on actual task results. Unstaked is now in Stage 22 of its presale. Over 1.2 billion coins have been sold, with more than $10.8 million raised. The price currently sits at $0.012091, and the launch price is expected to be $0.1819, showing a return possibility of up to 2,700%. There are no early private deals, and all liquidity will be locked. Its tools will only go live after the presale ends and the platform is launched. For those seeking top crypto projects in 2025, Unstaked offers a solid mix of ease and real use, making it a smart entry point. 2. TON: Built Inside Apps People Already Use TON is deeply linked to Telegram, a globally popular messaging service. This link makes it easier for new users to try out crypto inside a space they already know. From NFTs to wallet features, users can do crypto tasks within Telegram. For beginners, this removes the need to learn new systems right away, which is why TON stands among the top crypto projects in 2025. On June 13, TON was priced between $3.20 and $3.24. While it faced a slight pullback due to wider market dips, key events like the “First Force” NFT release on June 17 are keeping attention high. If it holds $3.15, it could climb again. Its easy access and wide use make TON useful for anyone new to the space. 3. Arbitrum (ARB): Smoother Crypto Use Through Layer-2 Power Arbitrum helps Ethereum run faster and at a lower cost. While the technical parts can be complex, what new users need to know is that ARB reduces fees and boosts speed. That benefit puts it on the list of top crypto projects in 2025. It works quietly in the background, helping people use apps better without needing to learn deep tech. ARB traded between $0.336 and $0.383 on June 13. A token unlock is expected on June 16, which could impact short-term moves. Looking ahead, some forecasts suggest it could climb to $0.82 in 2025, with average outlooks near $0.49. If it breaks past $0.38, more gains could follow. Its close tie to Ethereum and steady use growth make it a simple but powerful choice. 4. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Mixing Real Assets With Crypto Systems Ondo connects crypto with more stable real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries. While that may sound boring at first, it’s a growing trend in digital finance. ONDO recently launched its OUSG asset-backed coin on the XRP Ledger with $30 million behind it. It’s a way for newcomers to try crypto while staying close to ideas they’re already familiar with. As of June 13, ONDO is priced at about $0.775. It dipped 8% recently but still shows strong gains overall with a market cap near $3.25 billion. While it might go down to around $0.66 in the short term, future price guesses for 2026 are between $2 and $8. For those searching for top crypto projects in 2025, ONDO delivers real purpose and stability, without needing to jump into high-risk coins. Final Words! Choosing the top crypto projects in 2025 starts with looking at ease of use, actual purpose, and chances to grow. Unstaked stands out thanks to its drag-and-drop AI tools, upcoming platform release, and clear use cases. TON builds crypto into everyday apps. ARB removes the pain of high fees. ONDO gives blockchain access through familiar finance models. What connects all four projects is how they work in real ways that new users can follow. These aren’t hype-driven ideas but actual working systems. From AI automation to faster networks, easy-to-use apps to safer assets, the top crypto projects in 2025 are shaping up to offer real value without overwhelming complexity. Whether you want to test AI tools, speed up Ethereum, explore NFTs inside Telegram, or get linked to U.S. finance with crypto, each option on this list has something valuable. And for anyone starting out, these four picks represent smart and simple places to begin.

While major altcoins like Avalanche (AVAX) , XRP , and Shiba Inu (SHIB) remain foundational to many portfolios, emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are beginning to generate outsized attention. Analysts and early-stage traders are now weighing the potential of undervalued tokens with stronger narratives and momentum-driven price action. Could the next wave of returns come from smaller-cap altcoins rather than established names? MAGACOIN FINANCE: One of 2025’s Most Watched Underdogs? Positioned as a politically infused meme-token hybrid, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the ranks of investor attention with surprising speed. The project has seen a wave of interest across social media platforms and trading communities, with its fully audited smart contract by HashEx providing credibility many meme coins lack. Unlike hype-driven tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built with clear tokenomics, fixed supply , and a community-first distribution model . This structure appeals to a new generation of traders who want both culture and utility—without the fluff. Forums, Telegram groups, and crypto influencers are already treating the token as a dark horse candidate for Q3 and Q4 performance . With upcoming launches, a growing online base, and product rollouts planned, this presale token is capturing capital that once flowed into projects like SHIB and DOGE. AVAX: Bullish Setups Mixed With Market Uncertainty Avalanche (AVAX) recently climbed over 8% in late June, peaking at $18.64 before settling near $18.03 . While some technical indicators hint at bullish continuation, sentiment remains mixed, with nearly 71% of analysts leaning bearish. A decisive break above $18.50 could clear the path toward $22.14 , though failure to hold support may send AVAX back to $15.50 —or even $10.50 . Still, Avalanche maintains a respected position in the DeFi and tokenization arenas, bolstered by institutional interest and real-world asset integration. XRP: Legal Clarity, Ledger Upgrades, and Institutional Flow Trading near $2.18 after a 9% weekly gain, XRP is benefiting from a favorable U.S. court ruling that reaffirmed it’s not a security on secondary markets. This long-awaited clarity has opened the doors for institutions, many of whom are now reentering the XRP market. Meanwhile, major upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) are rolling out—including permissioned DEXs , escrow tokens , and batch transactions . With visibility heightened by the APEX 2025 summit , analysts believe XRP could break $2.60 soon, with higher targets stretching toward $3.30+ if bullish momentum holds. SHIB: New Utility, Strong Whales, and L2 Innovations Shiba Inu (SHIB) has jumped 17% off recent lows, now trading around $0.00001168 . A push beyond $0.00001175 could trigger a rally to $0.0000120 , supported by massive whale accumulation exceeding 10 trillion SHIB in one day. Ecosystem innovations like Shibarium (Layer-2), Shib Alpha Layer (privacy-enabled smart contracts), and the ShibDAO governance framework are adding tangible utility. With partnerships such as DeLorean Labs gaining traction, SHIB is evolving beyond its meme coin roots. Final Take While AVAX , XRP , and SHIB offer solid mid- to long-term growth potential, the hunger for early-stage upside is turning more heads toward MAGACOIN FINANCE . With a powerful brand identity, secure token mechanics, and fast-growing online traction, it’s quickly becoming one of the most compelling altcoins on watchlists for late 2025.

Bitcoin Realized Dominance Shows Shift In Market Sentiment According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, the latest trend in BTC’s Realized Dominance metric highlights a significant shift in overall market structure and sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Realized Dominance metric tracks how much of the realized cap is held by STH vs LTH. A rising LTH cohort share signals strong conviction and maturing supply, while a falling STH share suggests reduced speculation or loss-taking. The latest on-chain data shows that STH Realized Cap has dropped to around 45%, signalling reduced activity from recent buyers. This implies that new BTC entering the market is either being sold at a loss or maturing into long-term holdings – easing short-term speculative pressure. Conversely, the LTH Realized Cap has risen, suggesting long-held coins are being moved at a profit – typically seen during late-stage bull markets. This increase also indicates aging supply, as coins held by short-term investors transition into the LTH category, reflecting strong holder conviction. The analyst added: The divergence between falling STH Realized Cap and rising LTH Realized Cap highlights a supply transfer dynamic: recent entrants struggle with profitability amid lackluster price action, while long-term participants maintain control of an increasing share of network value. Such transitions often precede bullish reversals. As short-term realized cap shrinks, selling pressure typically declines, paving the way for more sustainable upside, provided fresh demand returns. In conclusion, Crazzyblockk noted that the Bitcoin market is currently in a consolidation phase, with weaker hands exiting and stronger holders gaining dominance. If this trend continues, it could establish a more resilient price base for BTC and potentially pave the way for a new ATH. BTC Apparent Demand Has Declined Despite the rise in LTH Realized Dominance, some on-chain signals point to weakening demand. This has raised concerns of a potential short-term drawdown, which could be as severe as the April 2025 pullback to almost $75,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K–$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest Notably, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand – a metric that assesses whether new buyer demand is sufficient to offset selling from miners and LTHs – has dropped to -37,000 BTC. This sharp decline suggests fading buying interest. That said, one positive indicator remains. The STH floor price has been steadily rising over the past few months and is now nearing the psychologically important $100,000 level. At press time, BTC trades at $107,796, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours.

Fed Chair Faces Rising Pressure,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-trump-fire-jerome-powell-fed-chair-faces-rising-pressure/,"The post Will Trump Fire Jerome Powell? Fed Chair Faces Rising Pressure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News President Donald Trump is once again targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, demanding his immediate resignation as tensions over interest rate policy boil over. Trump is furious that Powell has not slashed rates, blaming the Fed for rising debt-servicing costs that he claims are burdening the U.S. economy. His frustration intensified after Powell suggested that Trump’s tariffs are contributing to inflation, making it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts. Trump quickly fired back, accusing Powell of standing in the way of economic recovery. Trump Amplifies Resignation Demands The situation escalated when Bill Pulte , head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of lying during Senate testimony and acting with political bias. Trump reposted Pulte’s remarks on social media and doubled down on his demand that Powell step down immediately. This leads to the big question: Will Trump fire Jerome Powell? Can Trump Fire Powell? Legal Obstacles Remain While Trump has previously threatened to remove Powell , experts say the legal route is not that simple. The Supreme Court has reinforced that the Federal Reserve’s independence is protected, and forcibly removing the Fed Chair before the end of his term could face major legal challenges. When Does Jerome Powell’s Term End? Jerome Powell is currently serving a four-year term as Chair of the Federal Reserve, which began in May 2022. His term is set to end in May 2026. Unless he resigns voluntarily, Powell is legally protected from being removed without cause, making Trump’s threats more political than practical. [post_titles_links postid=”477927″] Powell Blames Tariffs, Trump Blames Powell Powell has repeatedly pointed out that the ongoing tariff policies introduced by Trump are driving inflationary pressure. This gives the Fed reason to remain cautious with rate cuts, regardless of political demands. Some analysts are watching a possible tariff expiration around July 9, which may create room for the Fed to ease its stance — but that’s far from guaranteed. Analysts and Crypto Experts Join the Criticism The pressure isn’t limited to politics. Crypto analyst Matt criticized Powell’s refusal to cut rates, noting that inflation is already near the Fed’s 2% target. He compared it to past election years when rate cuts were more aggressive and suggested Powell’s current stance may be politically influenced. Bitcoin Price Reacts Bitcoin jumped 2.62% to over $108,000 in the wake of the political drama, signaling the market’s sensitivity to Fed policy uncertainty. While Powell’s resignation is still unlikely, the growing war of words between Trump and the Fed is keeping both traditional and crypto markets on edge.

President Trump is demanding Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s resignation because he believes Powell has not cut interest rates aggressively enough. Trump blames the Fed’s high rates for increasing U.S. debt-servicing costs and hindering economic recovery, especially after Powell linked Trump’s tariffs to inflation. How do Jerome Powell and Donald Trump differ on the cause of current inflation? Jerome Powell attributes current inflationary pressures partly to President Trump’s ongoing tariff policies, which he states make it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts. Donald Trump, however, blames Powell and the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, arguing that rising debt costs are hindering the economy. How is the financial market, including Bitcoin, reacting to the Trump-Powell conflict? The financial market, including Bitcoin, is reacting with sensitivity to the Trump-Powell conflict over Fed policy. Bitcoin, increasingly behaving like a macro asset, jumped 2.62% to over $108,000 in the wake of the political drama, indicating how market participants are closely watching central bank policy uncertainty.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-03 05:03:22

On July 1, the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets approved the NYSE Arca’s proposal to list and trade shares of the Grayscale fund under an amended rule. The approval came with accelerated status, signaling initial confidence in the product’s readiness for market. But within 24 hours, the Commission exercised its right to review the decision, automatically staying the approval under Rule 431 of the SEC’s Rules of Practice. The reversal adds an unexpected twist to what had been hailed as a landmark moment for multi-asset crypto ETFs in the US. Fund’s Heavy Bitcoin-Ethereum Mix Offset by Riskier Altcoin Holdings Launched in 2018, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund holds a basket of top cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for more than 91% of its portfolio. Altcoins such as XRP, Solana and Cardano make up the rest, each carrying differing degrees of regulatory uncertainty. The plot thickens. Upper level of SEC telling $GDLC it can't launch until otherwise notified. Not sure why, no other info than this letter. My guess tho: They want to issue the crypto ETP listing standards before any '33 act spot ETFs hit market with these other coins. So likely… https://t.co/Za7rYk1o0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 By intervening directly, the SEC’s commissioners have signaled that the conversion merits closer inspection beyond what staff-level approval typically requires. Historically, this kind of review is rare and often suggests internal debate over regulatory implications, investor protection or market readiness. Unlike single-asset ETFs such as those tied to Bitcoin, multi-asset products like Grayscale’s bring new complexity. The inclusion of tokens with unsettled legal status, like XRP and Solana, may have prompted concerns over clarity in investor disclosures or the legal treatment of underlying assets. No Timetable Given as SEC Weighs Path Forward for Multi-Asset Crypto Funds Some analysts believe the Commission’s caution could reflect a broader effort to establish a unified approach before opening the gates to more diversified crypto products. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas has suggested the SEC is holding off on GDLC’s ETF conversion until a more consistent regulatory framework for crypto ETPs is in place. Grayscale’s ETF bid comes at a time of renewed momentum for digital asset firms under a more crypto-friendly political backdrop. However, the Commission’s move illustrates that regardless of shifting sentiment, regulatory rigor still holds sway over timing. For Grayscale and NYSE Arca, the stay means an indefinite delay. The SEC has not offered a timeline for its review or any additional guidance on next steps.

The crypto fund generates an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees from its $75 billion in assets with a 0.25% expense ratio. In contrast, the BlackRock iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) makes $187.1 million from $624 billion in assets and a 0.03% expense ratio, reported Bloomberg on July 2. IBIT is nearly nine times smaller but charges over eight times more in fees. Simply a Machine Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management (formerly ETF Store), told the outlet that “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure.” “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios.” The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF.

The fund has also seen inflows in 17 of its first 18 months. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told the outlet that it was an indication of how much “pent-up demand” there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio. “It also illustrates the leadership of Bitcoin in the crypto space where its perceived utility as a store of value has essentially left the others in its dust,” he added. The BlackRock fund has not seen an outflow day since June 6 and has had $1.47 billion in inflows over the past fortnight. It is “simply a machine,” said Geraci. Busy Week For Crypto ETFs The REX-Osprey Solana staking ETF launched on Wednesday and saw $33 million in trading volume on its first day. Solana fans were celebrating the statistic, but it is dwarfed by the first days of trading for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds. In related news, the SEC has approved Grayscale’s filing to convert its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an ETF, which is comprised of a basket of the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

With July kicking off and volatility returning to the markets, participants are back to asking a familiar question: which altcoins show both immediate upside and long-term staying power? Between token burns, protocol upgrades, and surging trading volumes, July 2025 is shaping up to be a defining month for a few standout projects. One name that’s been showing up repeatedly across CMC rankings and real-time volume charts is Qubetics , which has already proven it can deliver outsized gains. This blog breaks down three of the best altcoins to buy for July 2025 based on performance metrics, fundamentals, and ongoing community momentum. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently trending among the top 10 on CoinMarketCap, following an explosive debut and a utility-focused development roadmap that includes seamless cross-chain interaction, delegation-based income generation, and fast finality for global transactions. Alongside Qubetics, Celestia and Injective also stand out this month. These projects are bringing modular frameworks and DeFi-native infrastructure to Web3 with real usage and scalability. Whether you’re looking for short-term price action or long-term infrastructure plays, these are the best altcoins to buy for July 2025 if you’re serious about crypto beyond memes and speculation. 1. Qubetics Enables Fast Global Payments with Built-In Cross-Border Utility Qubetics Network is addressing one of the most persistent challenges in global finance: cross-border payments. Through its blockchain architecture, Qubetics enables banks and financial service providers to execute near-instant international settlements without depending on traditional intermediaries. Instead of navigating the cost-heavy and delay-prone traditional banking rails, institutions can use Qubetics’ native token, $TICS, to process fast, secure, and transparent transactions. This system becomes especially relevant in contexts where remittance speed and transactional efficiency are non-negotiable. For example, a multinational enterprise operating across Europe and Southeast Asia could streamline payroll processing and vendor payments in both regions through a single blockchain-backed network. Rather than routing through multiple correspondent banks and suffering delays, Qubetics allows that enterprise to transfer value securely with minimal overhead and no excessive wait times. This positions the platform as one of the best altcoins to buy for July 2025, particularly for those eyeing functional blockchain use cases with real economic upside. Qubetics Sees 420x Launch ROI, 30% APY, and Cross-Chain Utility without KYC Qubetics didn’t start slow. Priced at $0.40 at launch, the token spiked to $4.20 within its first hour on MEXC and LBank, producing a 950% gain or a 10.5x increase. For those who joined the earliest presale at just $0.01, the figures are even more dramatic. A participant who bought $100 worth of tokens at that stage received 10,000 $TICS. When the token peaked at $4.20, those tokens became worth $42,000. Similarly, early buyers who came in with $5,000 walked away with 500,000 tokens. At peak, that amounted to $2.1 million. That return didn’t come from speculation alone; it came from strong fundamentals and early demand. The token’s presale performance also tells the story of its foundation. Over 517 million tokens were distributed to more than 28,500 early participants, raising $18.4 million in total. Since then, the token has maintained a solid support level at $2, where it has continued to attract steady buy pressure. Within its first 24 hours on MEXC, Qubetics logged over $700,000 in trading volume, making it one of the most active newcomers in 2025. Beyond the launch performance, Qubetics has utility at its core. Its architecture supports native interoperability with Bitcoin and other chains. This eliminates the need for bridges or third-party tools when moving assets across networks. Instead of swapping chains through expensive intermediaries, users can complete cross-chain transactions directly on Qubetics with no KYC and minimal fees. Qubetics also runs on a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model. Participants can either become validators by holding 25,000 $TICS or delegators with just 5,000 $TICS. Validators are responsible for transaction validation and receive 30% APY for their service. Delegators earn a proportional share of that return based on the validators they support. This model encourages active network governance while offering a passive earning route for those less technically inclined. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Qubetics has demonstrated real-world demand, a proven use case in cross-border finance, and a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) system that pays users to participate. Its interoperability with BTC and impressive launch metrics further position it as one of the best altcoins to buy for July 2025 . 2. Celestia’s Modular Design Is Reshaping Blockchain Development in 2025 Celestia has emerged as a go-to modular blockchain network designed to separate execution from consensus, making it easier and faster to launch scalable rollups. By shifting away from traditional monolithic architectures, Celestia allows developers to deploy custom chains without needing to build the entire infrastructure layer from scratch. This has made the protocol especially popular among L2 and app-specific rollup creators. Throughout Q2 2025, Celestia gained traction among zero-knowledge rollup projects, and it has become a foundational layer for several new decentralized applications. Its data availability layer is being integrated into various developer toolkits, making it a default option for projects that require trust-minimized data propagation. As demand for modular scaling grows, Celestia continues to expand its presence in core developer communities and governance forums. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Celestia is solving major scalability issues with a clear modular approach. Its appeal to developers building the next generation of decentralized applications makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for July 2025. 3. Injective Powers Web3 DeFi with Interoperability and Institutional Appeal Injective is quietly becoming a backbone for DeFi applications in 2025. Its interoperable protocol supports seamless trading and decentralized exchange functionality across multiple blockchains. Designed with institutional usage in mind, Injective offers advanced features like on-chain order books, perpetual markets, and composability with other smart contract platforms. This makes it highly attractive to both developers and market-facing protocols looking for scalable financial infrastructure. In recent months, Injective rolled out enhancements to its CosmWasm smart contract engine and broadened support for synthetic assets. It has also formed partnerships with data oracle providers to improve the precision of price feeds across its network. Unlike many older DeFi projects that are still figuring out how to serve institutional clients, Injective has already built tools that meet those demands without compromising on decentralization or permissionlessness. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Injective brings the speed, cross-chain functionality, and professional-grade tools needed for next-gen finance. It stands out as one of the best altcoins to buy for July 2025 because of its continued product development and institutional-grade infrastructure. Conclusion: These Are the Best Altcoins to Buy for July 2025 for Real Growth Potential July 2025 is shaping up to be a breakout month for high-utility altcoins. Qubetics is leading the charge with top-tier returns, validator rewards, and built-in interoperability. Celestia is gaining momentum as developers flock to its modular stack for app-specific rollups. Injective continues to strengthen its DeFi-first protocol with enhancements that cater to large-scale users. Together, these projects highlight the best altcoins to buy for July 2025 for those who are looking beyond memes and toward lasting crypto infrastructure. If you’re still on the sidelines, this could be the moment to step in and make informed decisions while value is still on the table. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What are the best altcoins to buy for July 2025? Qubetics, Celestia, and Injective are currently the best altcoins to buy for July 2025 due to their strong fundamentals and ongoing development. Why is Qubetics trending among the best altcoins to buy for July 2025? Qubetics offers passive income through Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), seamless interoperability, and a track record of strong price performance since launch. Is Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) better than Proof of Work for altcoins in 2025? Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) provides faster transaction speeds and energy efficiency while allowing participants to earn rewards, making it a preferred model for many altcoins in 2025. Summary Qubetics, Celestia, and Injective have all positioned themselves at the intersection of short-term upside and long-term viability. Qubetics, with its 420x presale ROI, 30% validator APY, BTC interoperability, and seamless cross-chain transfers, has shown it’s more than just a launch pump. Celestia’s modular architecture and Injective’s DeFi-native infrastructure add further weight to their inclusion. All three demonstrate the practical use cases, developer traction, and passive income models that define the best altcoins to buy for July 2025. As the market shifts, these projects offer the blend of innovation and value retention that serious participants are looking for.

The REX ETF launched under the Investment Company Act of 1940, posting $33 million in first-day trading volume while offering native staking rewards—a first for US-listed crypto ETFs. On the same day, DFDV announced an upsized convertible note offering to support additional Solana purchases and a stock repurchase program, marking a bold strategic move that reinforces the blockchain’s growing role in regulated finance. REX-Osprey’s Solana Staking ETF Makes Waves with $33M Debut as Institutional Crypto Access Expands The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF launched with a bang on Wednesday, becoming the first spot Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) to trade on a US exchange. According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the ETF generated around $33 million in trading volume on its first day—a strong showing for a niche digital asset product in its early innings. By the close of trading, the ETF had accumulated approximately $1 million in assets under management (AUM). Balchunas noted on X (formerly Twitter) that, based on the day’s volume, he expects AUM to balloon to as much as $10 million by the second day, signaling early confidence and demand among investors. Unlike other crypto ETFs currently awaiting clarity from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the REX-Osprey ETF was filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a more stringent framework than the simpler 1933 Act used for most spot crypto ETFs. This classification requires a higher level of custodial and investor protections, a move that may help ease regulatory concerns and pave the way for broader adoption. The ETF’s launch also distinguishes itself by offering native staking rewards. All Solana tokens held within the ETF are staked on-chain, with 100% of the staking yield passed directly to investors in the form of monthly distributions. This feature sets the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF apart from other ”staking-lite” products that either simulate yield or offer indirect exposure. Anchorage Digital, the ETF’s custodian, is the only federally chartered crypto bank approved to custody and stake digital assets. Its role was crucial in meeting the regulatory compliance standards of the 1940 Act. ”Staking is the next chapter in the crypto ETF story,” said Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley. ”This launch marks a major step forward in giving institutions full access to the crypto ecosystem in a regulated package.” Solana’s Momentum Grows Amid Regulatory Hurdles Solana’s selection for the ETF marks a continued rise in institutional interest around the Layer 1 blockchain, known for its high transaction speed and low fees. The network’s technical merits, combined with a burgeoning DeFi and NFT ecosystem, have placed SOL among the top-performing altcoins in 2025. Despite the ETF’s early success, regulatory uncertainty still looms. On the same day of the REX-Osprey launch, the SEC’s Deputy Secretary J. Matthew DeLesDernier notified the New York Stock Exchange that a newly approved Grayscale ETF would be placed under “review,” indicating that the agency is still wrestling with the broader implications of crypto-related fund approvals. The SEC has not yet issued broad guidance for staking ETFs. As a result, many products remain in limbo, with only those that can navigate the more robust requirements of the 1940 Act making it to market. The REX-Osprey ETF represents a new phase in the evolution of crypto ETFs—one that blends decentralized finance mechanics like staking with the familiar structure of traditional financial products. By combining regulated custody, staking yield, and transparency, the ETF appeals to a growing class of institutional and sophisticated retail investors seeking on-chain yield without the operational complexities of self-custody or direct network participation. If AUM growth continues as projected, and if early success translates into sustained inflows, the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF could serve as a blueprint for future digital asset ETFs—particularly those involving staking mechanisms for tokens like Ethereum, Polkadot, or Cosmos. The Road Ahead While the debut of the REX-Osprey Solana ETF may seem like a niche event in the broader ETF universe, it’s emblematic of a larger shift: regulated access to crypto-native yields. As the SEC continues to review and refine its stance, asset managers are likely to push for more clarity and innovation in this space. For now, the Solana staking ETF stands as a milestone in bringing Web3 functionality into Wall Street infrastructure, offering a glimpse of a future where decentralized protocols and traditional finance coexist under one regulatory roof. Defi Development Corp Issues $112.5M in Convertible Notes to Double Down on Solana Bet In related news, Defi Development Corp (Nasdaq: DFDV), a company at the forefront of publicly traded firms embracing crypto-native treasury strategies, has announced a $112.5 million convertible note offering as part of a major capital-raising initiative. The offering, which was upsized from an initial $100 million target, will primarily fund a stock repurchase program and additional purchases of Solana (SOL), the blockchain network at the heart of the company’s operations. The notes are scheduled to mature in 2030 and will offer investors a 5.5% annual interest rate. They also include an equity conversion option priced at $23.11 per share—representing a roughly 10% premium over DFDV’s closing share price earlier in the week. Investors have also been granted the right to acquire an additional $25 million in notes before the round closes on July 7, further increasing the potential capital available to the company. A Strategic Shift Toward Crypto Formerly known as Janover, a real estate technology firm, Defi Development Corp has reinvented itself by pivoting its business model to focus on the Solana ecosystem. The company now operates validator nodes on the Solana blockchain and continues to accumulate its native token, SOL, which traded at $153.68 at the time of the announcement. The move follows a growing trend of public companies using debt and equity financing to acquire crypto assets—mirroring the strategy employed by Strategy Corp with its massive Bitcoin treasury. DFDV’s crypto-centric pivot has proven transformative: despite the stock being down 12% in early Wednesday trading and over 60% off its May peak, DFDV shares are still up over 3,500% since the company began accumulating Solana and refocusing its operations. Of the $112.5 million raised, approximately $75 million is earmarked for a prepaid forward stock purchase agreement currently being negotiated with one of the offering’s initial investors. According to DFDV, this facility will allow the investor to hedge their convertible note exposure through derivative trades and short-selling strategies. This move may mitigate dilution while aligning long-term interests between DFDV and its capital partners. The remaining capital will be allocated toward general corporate purposes, including an expansion of its Solana holdings. As of now, Solana remains one of the most actively developed blockchains in the space, with DFDV aiming to deepen its strategic exposure to the network beyond simply holding the token. Previous $5 Billion Equity Deal Sets the Stage This latest fundraising round comes just weeks after DFDV secured a $5 billion equity line of credit with RK Capital Management. While that facility gives DFDV room to issue shares over time, the convertible note approach provides upfront liquidity and signals strong institutional interest in the company’s direction. The company’s aggressive financing posture signals a broader shift in how crypto-aligned public firms are leveraging traditional capital markets to bet on decentralized technologies. With Solana-specific ETFs like REX-Osprey’s $SSK now live and more institutional money entering the space, DFDV appears poised to be a major player in bridging crypto finance and Wall Street. Despite the strategic enthusiasm, markets reacted cautiously. DFDV shares slipped 12% on the news—reflecting concerns around dilution, rising debt obligations, or perhaps broader crypto market sentiment. Nonetheless, long-term bulls point to the company’s staggering growth since its crypto pivot and the increasing institutional attention to the Solana network as reasons for continued optimism.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-03 05:30:00

Ethereum (ETH) , Cardano (ADA) , and Litecoin (LTC) are each at pivotal technical levels that could shape their Q3 performance. But while these established players experience mid-cycle volatility, one emerging name is surging without hesitation: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The project’s pre-sale trajectory has analysts calling it the most explosive early-stage opportunity of 2025 , with investors scrambling to secure positions before listings go live. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Momentum Play Everyone’s Watching While ETH, ADA, and LTC contend with resistance and consolidation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing unrelenting demand. Its early entry phases have sold out rapidly, and investor attention continues to grow as buyers seek asymmetrical upside. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its limited-supply structure , fully audited tokenomics , and a clear roadmap toward launch. Analysts tracking inflows note persistent accumulation from early backers, suggesting smart money is moving in before mainstream coverage accelerates. In an era where community, scarcity, and utility converge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the token that momentum traders and long-term strategists don’t want to miss. Ethereum Holds Structure, Eyes Summer Breakout Ethereum continues to trade in a tight consolidation range, but technical analysts are closely monitoring a potential breakout setup. The asset has formed a triple bottom near key long-term support , signaling resilience. Positive developments around Layer-2 scaling and tokenized real-world assets on the Ethereum network are contributing to its on-chain strength. Technical indicators like RSI and MACD are also turning bullish, with growing divergence hinting at a possible breakout if macro sentiment holds steady. Investors are watching closely for confirmation before loading up on ETH ahead of a broader rally. Cardano Faces Volatility, But Fundamentals Stay Strong Cardano (ADA) is currently under short-term pressure, with key support levels being retested. However, long-term outlook remains bullish thanks to catalysts like the upcoming Midnight protocol airdrop and the Plomin Hard Fork , which moves Cardano closer to full decentralized governance. While ADA may face downside risk if current support fails, ongoing development—including more stablecoin integrations and smart contract upgrades—keeps investor interest intact. Long-term holders are viewing any dip as a buying opportunity, with eyes on a sustained breakout once resistance clears. Litecoin Sees Steady Usage, Institutional Growth Litecoin (LTC) continues to demonstrate resilience amid market noise. Its rising transaction volume , real-world merchant adoption , and low-fee peer-to-peer usage are helping the network remain relevant in 2025. Although it doesn’t command headlines like other altcoins, LTC is quietly attracting both retail and institutional interest. Analysts suggest that key support convergence zones could trigger a stronger upward move—especially if broader sentiment tilts back toward utility-based assets with longevity. Final Thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Apart in a Crowded Market Ethereum, Cardano, and Litecoin are still pillars of the digital asset space, each offering compelling reasons for long-term investment. But in terms of short-term momentum , early-stage entry , and community-driven demand , MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. With technical fundamentals aligning and investor sentiment heating up, this may be the defining pre-sale moment of 2025 —a chance for early movers to secure positions before the broader market takes notice.

From January through May, progress unfolded steadily, with little indication of how dramatically the tone would shift. Now, that silence has been broken, as the Shiba Inu lead ambassador Shytoshi Kusama recently shared a major development for the ecosystem. The JUL-AI Initiative Begins On the first day of July, Kusama introduced a new phase in the project’s evolution under the banner “JUL-AI.” The announcement came through a brief video posted on X, signaling the start of a month-long rollout focused on artificial intelligence. The presentation highlighted the passage of time since the beginning of the year, emphasizing the coming shift, and setting the stage for what is expected to be a series of releases, updates, and public discussions. This marked a clear pivot toward AI-driven initiatives within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The timing, tone, and structure of the post indicate that July was intentionally selected as the point to unveil developments that have been in progress behind the scenes. The announcement also reinforced the notion that prior months had been dedicated to foundational work. Kusama disappeared from social media for a month during this time, and some speculate he was away working hard to help advance SHIB. With that groundwork presumably complete, JUL-AI now acts as the formal unveiling of these efforts. JULY is… JUL-AI. Prepare for many announcements, releases, and discussions around everything we've built thus far and where we see the future going. Talk soon: pic.twitter.com/mG3Rq55buR — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) July 1, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 AI and the Shiba Inu Ecosystem While Kusama’s recent post refrains from naming specific partners or technologies, he previously revealed that the team has been working closely with TokenPlayAI and other unnamed collaborators. The goal, based on earlier statements, is to create AI-native tools that interact seamlessly with Shibarium, the project’s layer-2 blockchain. Kusama also teased an AI-related whitepaper, which, when released, is expected to detail this strategy and outline both short-term objectives and long-term integrations. By connecting blockchain infrastructure with AI capabilities, Shiba Inu appears to be positioning itself beyond the typical memecoin narrative. Instead, JUL-AI may serve as the formal starting point for the ecosystem’s pivot toward applied technologies, particularly in AI-based applications and utility-focused deployments. Experts believe Kusama’s work within the ecosystem and these upcoming developments could help SHIB reach the coveted $0.01 level .

According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the fund ended its first trading day with around $33 million in volume. Another Bloomberg analyst, James Seyffart, reported that the ETF had about $8 million in trading volume in the first 20 minutes of its launch. While the trading volume of the ETF was impressive, it still fell short of the levels seen during the debut of Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Balchunas commented : SSK ended the day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch), but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Eric Balchunas The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF reached about $1 million in AUM on Wednesday The Solana staking ETF also wrapped up its debut day with about $1 million worth of assets under management. Balchunas believes the ETF could soon manage $10 million in assets on its second trading day, given its current trading volume. The ETF differs quite from others, which are still awaiting the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval. The commission registered the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940—an investor-focused framework with stricter regulations. That means the fund must hold its assets with a qualified and trusted custodian. The ETF’s founders selected Anchorage Digital for the role, seeing that it’s the sole federally regulated crypto bank authorized to handle both custody and staking of digital assets. Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley commented on the ETF’s launch, describing staking as the next evolution in the crypto ETF space and calling the fund’s debut a significant step toward offering institutions secure and regulated crypto access. The SEC announced that Grayscale’s ETF conversion plans are still under review On Tuesday, Grayscale also earned the SEC’s approval to change its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an ETF. The fund includes the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap: Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, and Cardano’s ADA. Arbitrage traders once profited by exploiting gaps in market prices and NAV in Grayscale’s crypto trusts, mostly fueled by restricted redemptions and mandatory lock-up periods. However, with the firm moving to convert its private trusts into ETFs, those opportunities have significantly narrowed. Grayscale even explained that moving forward, it wants the values of the shares to reflect the value of the digital assets held by the fund. The SEC, however, is still reviewing the firm’s ETF conversion plans. On Wednesday, in a letter to the New York Stock Exchange, the agency’s deputy secretary announced that the commission would reexamine the approval for Grayscale’s ETF conversion, signaling continued hesitation to loosen its approach to crypto ETFs. In June 2022, the firm also faced trouble when it tried to convert the BTC Trust into an ETF. It filed a petition in court after the agency rejected its application. The legal battle stretched over a year until August 2023, when a US judge ruled that the SEC’s rejection of the conversion was “arbitrary and capricious,” ultimately granting Grayscale’s petition. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust operates as an ETF with a 1.5% expense ratio—the highest among Bitcoin ETFs—and remains the top-earning BTC investment product.

Per local reports, the government is still engaged with international institutions to refine the plan. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” said Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan, during a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power. According to a report by Profit , the IMF has warned that the plan could add strain to the power sector. Dr Irfan told the committee that the agency is concerned about market distortions over Pakistan’s subsidised energy rates proposal. IMF Flags Several Concerns Against Pakistan’s Power Proposal for Bitcoin Mining Last month, the IMF questioned Pakistan’s power push for Bitcoin mining, raising concerns over legal issues and power strain. The international financial body laid out several concerns, including the legality of crypto mining in Pakistan and the additional strain on the already burdened power grid. The @IMFNews is pushing back on Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. #IMF #Bitcoin https://t.co/X9YHqz9qTO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 1, 2025 Further, the fund warned about resource distribution and knock-on effects on power tariffs. The IMF noted that Pakistan did not consult the fund ahead of the announcement. In May, Pakistan announced that it will allocate 2,000MW to power crypto mining and data centres, in a move to attract foreign investment. The initiative is driven by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance. Pakistan in Talks With International Institutions Dr Irfan confirmed that the government is still in talks to redefine its power subsidiary plan after the IMF has rejected the proposal. The committee further discussed technological solutions aimed at combating electricity theft.

These applications aim to bring Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin under dual state and federal oversight to align with new legislation like the GENIUS Act. This follows a similar move by Circle, the issuer of USDC, which also applied for OCC approval. Meanwhile, billionaire Peter Thiel is backing a new startup- and crypto-focused bank called Erebor, which will fill the gap left by Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. In Europe, Belgium’s KBC Bank is set to offer crypto investments via its Bolero platform. Ripple Makes Power Play in US Banking Ripple Labs is seeking a US banking license to deepen its ties with traditional finance and comply with emerging stablecoin regulations. The company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced on X that Ripple formally applied for a national bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, it would bring Ripple under both federal and state regulatory oversight. The New York Department of Financial Services already supervises Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin, and Garlinghouse said that this added federal oversight will set a new standard of trust in the stablecoin industry. This development happened after a similar application by Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Just days earlier, Circle applied to the OCC to form a national trust bank responsible for managing its stablecoin reserves. Both moves come on the heels of the US Senate passing the GENIUS Act, which is legislation that outlines regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers and designates the OCC as the key federal watchdog for larger players in the space. Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said that the company is aligning itself with the changing regulatory landscape around dollar-pegged payment stablecoins. In addition to its OCC application, Ripple also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve. This would allow Ripple to hold RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed. Garlinghouse described this feature as a critical safeguard to reinforce long-term trust in the stablecoin. The application was made via Standard Custody, a crypto custody firm that Ripple acquired in early 2024. Garlinghouse explained that the tide is turning in Washington, with Congress advancing clearer crypto regulations and traditional banks showing renewed interest in engaging with digital asset firms. This is in stark contrast to the restrictive environment of previous years, which was often referred to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” XRP’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Market reaction to Ripple’s banking ambitions has been positive. XRP climbed 2.87% to $2.24. The rally began shortly after Garlinghouse’s announcement and peaked at $2.27 before slightly retreating. Peter Thiel Backs New Bank for Startups and Crypto Meanwhile, a group of billionaires, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, is reportedly working on launching a new financial institution named Erebor to fill the void left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March of 2023. According to the Financial Times , Erebor will focus on serving startups and cryptocurrency companies, and has already applied for a US bank charter to operate as a fully licensed bank . Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, is said to be among the early investors in the new bank. Other backers reportedly include Palmer Luckey, co-founder of defense contractor Anduril, and Joe Lonsdale, founder of investment firm 8VC. Thiel is a long-time supporter of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem, and he is also known for backing Bullish, a crypto exchange that recently filed for an initial public offering in the United States. Erebor’s strategy seems to be centered on providing banking services and loans to early-stage startups and other high-risk ventures that have found it difficult to access capital in the wake of tighter financial regulations. The initiative is also seen as an attempt to reestablish a specialized financial services institution that mirrors the role Silicon Valley Bank once played in the innovation economy. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 sent shockwaves through the banking and crypto industries. It was shut down by California’s financial regulator after rapidly rising interest rates devalued its bond holdings. The bank failed when a flood of clients tried to withdraw funds, triggering a liquidity crisis. At the time, the bank served around half of all venture capital-backed tech and life sciences firms in the country. Bank failures in the year 2023 (Source: FDIC ) The demise of Silicon Valley Bank also contributed to a wider crisis that saw the downfall of other institutions like Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. The crypto sector was particularly hard-hit, with investment funds losing roughly 10% of their assets under management in a single week. According to Harvard Business Review, the bank's failure tightened credit access for venture-backed startups, which created an urgent need for a replacement institution. Although Silicon Valley Bank still operates as a division of First Citizens Bank after its acquisition in March of 2023, its collapse shed some light on the vulnerabilities in the venture capital and digital asset banking landscape. Erebor now plans to fill that gap. KBC Bank to Offer Crypto Investments KBC Bank, one of Belgium’s largest financial institutions, is preparing to allow its customers to invest in cryptocurrencies through its online investment platform Bolero. The bank confirmed that Bolero will provide access to Bitcoin and Ethereum investments later this year. A spokesperson for KBC stated that the bank is currently undergoing an analysis to become recognized as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP), with the aim of launching the service by autumn. The initiative is expected to give private investors the opportunity to invest directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum in a secure and regulated environment, with an emphasis on education and compliance. If the rollout proceeds as planned, KBC will become the first major Belgian bank to offer crypto investment services to retail clients. Currently, most Belgian investors rely on international exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, or on fintech platforms like Revolut and N26 to access crypto markets. KBC’s move forms part of the trend among European banks that are increasingly exploring crypto investment and custody solutions. In Germany, both Deutsche Bank and Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe are reportedly preparing to introduce crypto offerings in the near future. Meanwhile, Spain’s BBVA has been advising its high-net-worth clients to allocate a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This wave of crypto adoption by banks was anticipated by industry leaders. In April, executives from major crypto firms Messari and Sygnum predicted that banks would start entering the space more aggressively in the second half of 2025, encouraged by a more favorable global regulatory landscape. Supporting this trend, Stripe’s co-founder John Collison revealed in May that the payments giant has been in discussions with several banks interested in experimenting with stablecoins.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-03 06:00:33

At the center of this new wave is MAGACOIN FINANCE —an emerging asset that’s creating significant buzz among investors seeking high-reward setups with early access pricing. With each pre-sale phase selling out faster than the last, and community momentum surging across social media platforms, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is uniquely positioned to become one of the most profitable tokens of the current cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Gaining Market Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly earned a reputation as a potentially high-yield altcoin for 2025. It combines sharp branding with a capped supply of 170 billion tokens and a token structure built for long-term sustainability. Unlike many early-stage projects that rely on influencer hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on fundamentals—featuring a fully audited smart contract , transparent tokenomics, and a clear rollout strategy. Analysts have pointed out that this is one of the rare low-cap entries that checks the boxes for early retail adoption and institutional positioning alike. With 25x to 30x ROI projections making rounds in investor circles, the project is quickly becoming a serious contender among speculative crypto portfolios. XRP Shows Long-Term Strength Despite Near-Term Resistance Following renewed institutional activity and improved market sentiment, XRP has broken above key resistance in recent weeks. However, its trajectory remains tied to lingering supply zones that capped multiple previous rallies. Legal clarity and broader enterprise adoption are boosting long-term confidence, and exchange outflows point to accumulation among large holders. But with price action stalling below upper resistance bands, some investors are choosing to rotate funds into faster-moving assets while XRP’s breakout fully materializes. Solana Maintains Structure, But Momentum Faces Hurdles Solana (SOL) has maintained a solid technical profile this summer, attracting interest due to its growing role in tokenized infrastructure and NFT ecosystems. High trading volume and consistent developer activity highlight its strength. Yet, like XRP, SOL remains boxed within a narrow trading range. Until SOL breaks past resistance, its price action may remain rangebound—prompting some short-term traders to seek higher-beta setups elsewhere. Shifting Capital: Why Investors Are Rotating Toward MAGACOIN FINANCE Investor sentiment in 2025 is evolving. With large caps moving at a slower pace, capital is increasingly flowing into emerging tokens with clear narratives and robust pre-sale momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers just that. Its blend of politically themed branding, clear supply structure, and viral appeal is capturing trader attention across Telegram, X, and Reddit. Add to that its growing pre-sale demand, and you have a token that’s quietly becoming one of the year’s most compelling asymmetric opportunities . Final Thoughts: A Rare Early-Entry Opportunity? The 2025 market cycle continues to shift, and recalibrating portfolios has become essential. While XRP and Solana offer long-term potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents an early-stage option with the possibility for 25x returns or higher , according to analyst estimates. As interest builds and the pre-sale window narrows, investors looking for alpha-generating plays may find this moment to be the optimal time to act.

As of the time of writing, the asset is priced at $108,071 after recording a modest 2% gain in the past 24 hours. Despite nearing its all-time high in recent weeks, Bitcoin appears to be caught in a holding pattern as institutional rebalancing and on-chain dynamics take center stage. Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi has drawn attention to unusual on-chain activity during the final days of June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Institutional Rebalancing and Local Exhaustion Signals In a post titled “Whale Profit-Taking and Loss Realizations: Was Late June a Local Pivot Point?” the analyst noted conflicting behaviors among Bitcoin whales. A notable $641 million in realized profits was recorded alongside more than $1.24 billion in realized losses, a combination that suggests a potential inflection point in market sentiment. Mevsimi emphasized that this mixed realization trend came at the close of the second quarter, a period often associated with institutional portfolio adjustments. “Structurally, late June is also the end of H1, when ETFs and institutional funds often rebalance portfolios,” he wrote. Mevsimi added: “That timing adds weight: this wasn’t just noise — it may have been a deliberate repositioning.” Notably, these large movements in realized profit and loss did not extend into early July, which may imply either a temporary stabilization or the beginning of a new market phase. The report also detailed divergent whale behavior. Newer whales, likely short-term participants entering in Q2, showed signs of capitulation, realizing both profits and significant losses. In contrast, older whales locked in $91 million in profits with negligible losses. This division may indicate a shift in control, with experienced holders offloading risk while short-term players exited amid market uncertainty. According to Mevsimi, the convergence of these trends hints at a local exhaustion phase rather than a continued rally. Bitcoin LTH Unrealized Profits and Historical Context In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant’s Darkfost explored the unrealized profit profile of Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs), revealing a downward trend despite BTC’s proximity to record highs. Citing the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, Darkfost noted that average unrealized profits have fallen to around 220%. This is well below the peaks recorded during market tops in March and December 2024, which reached 300% and 350%, respectively. “Although these profits may seem substantial, we’re still far from the levels observed during the tops of this cycle,” Darkfost stated. The realized price for LTHs now stands at approximately $39,000, suggesting a strong cushion but also reinforcing that speculative excess has yet to return in full force. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Explode Soon The analyst added that a return to top-cycle unrealized profit levels would require BTC to rise to around $140,000, a target echoed by several bullish forecasts.

In contrast, Vietnamese exports to the U.S. will continue to face duties ranging from 20% to 40%, a highly favorable deal for American trade. M2 Money Supply Gives Bitcoin a Push Bitcoin Price is up today due to a surge in the US M2 money supply, which is a measure of how much money is flowing into the economy. The M2 jumped 4.5% in May, reaching a record $21.94 trillion. This marks the 19th consecutive month of growth. BTC price always tends to follow money supply growth after a few months, so this trend could push prices higher in the coming weeks. Bitcoin ETFs Attract Big Money Bitcoin spot ETFs are still pulling in big dollars. On July 2, Bitcoin ETFs saw $407.8 million flow in . Fidelity, Ark Investment, and Bitwise led the pack, seeing an inflow of $184 million, $83million, and $64.9 million, respectively. Short Traders Got Wiped Out Another boost came from short liquidations. In the last 24 hours, traders betting against Bitcoin were forced to close losing positions, about $248.85 million of the total $294.5 million came from short positions. Meanwhile, long traders saw liquidation of $45.80 million according to CoinGlass data. Altcoins Join the Rally Meanwhile, it’s not just Bitcoin enjoying the 2.5% rally and trading at around $109,366. Ethereum price today is up by more than 5% trading around $2588, while coins like XRP , Solana, and Cardano have each gained around 5%. Even memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are up by 5%–8%. Meanwhile, overall crypto market sentiment remains bullish for today.

Key Takeaways: The first US Solana staking ETF launched with $12 million in inflows and $33 million in volume. Opening day trading volumes topped earlier Solana and XRP futures ETFs. REX-Osprey’s creative fund structure overcame SEC hurdles, avoiding the standard spot ETF approval process. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, trading under the ticker SSK, launched Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The fund offers investors exposure to Solana (SOL) while providing staking yields, positioning it as the first ETF in the U.S. to combine spot Solana exposure with staking rewards. Solana Staking ETF Outpaces Futures Funds According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the ETF’s opening day volumes surpassed those seen by earlier Solana and XRP futures ETFs. However, they fell short of the explosive debuts of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, which together recorded $4.6 billion in shares traded on their first day in January 2024. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart noted the ETF saw $8 million in trading volume within its first 20 minutes, describing it as a “healthy start to trading.” $SSK ended day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch) but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/t6LkQwDXLc — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley called the launch a “defining moment” for digital assets, highlighting its role in expanding institutional access to crypto staking opportunities. The ETF’s launch was not without hurdles. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially raised objections in late May, questioning whether the product qualified as an “investment company” under federal securities laws. REX-Osprey navigated these challenges by structuring the fund to invest at least 40% of its assets in other exchange-traded products, many of which are listed outside the United States. The regulatory workaround allowed the fund to avoid the traditional 19b-4 filing process typically required for spot crypto ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, previously described the strategy as a “regulatory end-around,” a view shared by analysts who have debated whether the fund should be classified as a conventional spot Solana ETF. yes, altho to be fair this is some 400-level ETF technical nerd-ery — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 1, 2025 Strong Start Sparks Hopes for Spot Solana ETF Approval The promising debut has fueled speculation about the potential approval of true spot Solana ETFs. Both Seyffart and Balchunas recently estimated a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot Solana ETFs before the year ends. Seyffart added that a wave of new ETFs, including products tied to XRP and Litecoin, could arrive in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Solana’s price saw muted movement, gaining 3.6% over the past 24 hours and trading around $153 at press time. Despite the ETF launch, SOL remains down nearly 48% from its highs earlier this year. However, Solana CME futures showed rising institutional appetite, with open interest reaching $167 million after the ETF’s debut, according to data from SolanaFloor. As reported, digital asset investment funds pulled in $2.7 billion last week, capping an 11-week streak of inflows that now totals $16.9 billion. The bulk of the inflows came from the United States, accounting for $2.65 billion. Switzerland and Germany recorded modest additions of $23 million and $19.8 million, respectively, while Canada, Hong Kong, and Brazil posted small outflows. Bitcoin remained the primary magnet for capital, drawing $2.2 billion last week, a commanding 83% of total inflows, while short-Bitcoin products extended their year-to-date outflows to $12 million.

As the July 9th deadline approaches, the U.S. has finalized only three trade agreements: with the UK, China, and Vietnam. Global market sentiment was also tempered by anticipation of today's U.S. jobs report, a crucial indicator for the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Gold declined to around $3,340 per ounce on Thursday, giving back some of the gains from the previous session. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.20% to around 39,800 on Thursday, snapping a two-day losing streak as optimism over trade developments helped steady market sentiment. The Japanese yen stabilized around 143.7 per dollar on Thursday after facing some pressure in the previous session. The au Jibun Bank Japan Services PMI was revised higher to 51.7 in June 2025, up from 51.5 in the preliminary estimate and following a final reading of 51.0 in May. The Bank of Japan should resume rate hikes after a temporary pause to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japan’s economy, board member Hajime Takata said in a speech Thursday. “My view is that the BoJ is currently only pausing its policy interest rate hike cycle,” he noted, adding the bank should shift away from its ultra-loose policy after a period of ""wait and see"". China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.17% rallied with the Shenzhen Component climbing 0.5% to above 10,460, following reports that the US has lifted certain export restrictions on chip design software to China, and the offshore yuan steadied around 7.16 per dollar on Thursday as investors digested the latest PMI data. A private survey showed China’s services activity expanded at the slowest pace in nine months in June. The Caixin China General Services PMI declined to 50.6 in June 2025, down from May’s 51.1 and below market forecasts of 51.0. In a significant development for U.S.-China trade agreement, the U.S. has lifted some export controls on chip design software sales in China , previously imposed in May, that required licenses for certain tools and chemicals. This policy shift is set to resume trade in critical sectors like rare earths and advanced technologies. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.74% to 23,963 on Thursday morning, swinging from the prior session’s gains amid weak data from the mainland. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.46% to 83,715 in early deals on Thursday, halting losses from the previous session amid optimism over trade negotiations following a US-Vietnam trade deal just days ahead of a July 9 deadline. India's private sector growth hit a 14-month peak in June 2025, with services and manufacturing rising the most in 10 months and 14 months, respectively. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.03% to around 8,580 on Thursday after closing at a record high in the previous session. The Australian dollar slipped to around $0.657 on Thursday, ending a three-session winning streak, weighed down by lackluster trade figures. Australia’s May trade surplus narrowed sharply to AUD 2.24 billion , well below expectations of AUD 5.09 billion and a revised AUD 4.86 billion in April, marking the smallest surplus in nearly 5 years, with exports hitting a 3-month low due to weaker US shipments affected by tariffs. The S&P Global Flash Australia Services PMI Business Activity Index rose to 51.8 in June, up from 50.6 in May, signaling the fastest pace of expansion since May 2024. In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended higher after President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. will impose 20% tariffs on imports from Vietnam under a new trade deal finalized during last-minute talks. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by renewed trade optimism and soft labor market data, which reinforced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Markets turned their focus to the upcoming June jobs report. U.S. stock futures held steady on Thursday as investors awaited the closely watched June jobs report: Dow +0.05% ; S&P 500 +0.04% ; Nasdaq +0.04% .

Here’s What Happened",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-abruptly-spikes-to-691667-on-live-tracker-heres-what-happened/,"Crypto analyst John Squire recently posted a tweet highlighting a significant pricing anomaly involving XRP on a live market tracker. According to the tweet, the glitch showed XRP priced at an unprecedented $691,667 per token. The screenshot attached to the tweet displays this figure, appearing alongside the USD price feed. The anomaly was presented without further technical explanation, leading the crypto community to question whether it was purely a technical malfunction or if it indicated something more substantial. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM A wild glitch just showed $691,667 per $XRP on a live tracker! Glitch? Error? Or is the system telling us something early… #XRP #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/HFld8oXjId — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) July 2, 2025 Community Responses and Interpretations John Squire’s post quickly attracted attention from various crypto users who offered their interpretations of the glitch. TM Research responded to the tweet by pointing out a pattern of similar glitches occurring with XRP over the years. The user emphasized that these price anomalies are not new, suggesting a peculiar consistency in XRP-related glitches that has not been observed with most other cryptocurrencies. Another user, C.E. Parker, provided a more skeptical response. He expressed disbelief regarding the figure shown in the glitch, noting that a price of over half a million dollars per XRP appears to be an unrealistic valuation. His comment reflected a cautious stance, indicating that while he is engaged in the XRP community , he chooses to remain grounded in his expectations. Blue Collar Crypto offered further commentary aimed at educating newer participants in the XRP ecosystem . He cautioned that such pricing errors should not be interpreted as legitimate market movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His statement emphasized that the figure, if taken seriously, would imply that XRP had become the most valuable asset in the world by a significant margin, which he considers implausible under current market conditions. Nonetheless, he did acknowledge long-term price predictions in the range of $5 to $15, expressing moderate optimism for XRP’s growth potential over time. Technical Considerations Behind the Glitch While John Squire did not provide a technical breakdown of the cause, price glitches on cryptocurrency trackers are not uncommon. These errors can occur due to data feed mismatches, server syncing issues, or bugs in aggregation systems. The fact that this error appeared only on the tracker and not across multiple exchanges suggests it was not a reflection of actual market activity. Despite that, the recurrence of similar anomalies specifically associated with XRP continues to fuel speculation within certain segments of the community. The nature of the glitch also raises questions about the reliability of price feed data in the cryptocurrency space. Ensuring the accuracy of pricing information is critical, especially for traders who rely on real-time data. While most experienced participants recognize the difference between a data error and legitimate price movement, these anomalies often attract attention because of the significant implications if taken at face value.

The price pushed toward the $2.30 region, reaching a local high near $2.2980 before pulling back slightly. The critical development now is not just the initial rally, but what comes next. In her recent chart analysis, CasiTrades identified two key scenarios for XRP. The price action has so far followed the first scenario, with a sharp move toward $2.30, followed by a likely retracement to the $2.25 zone. That retracement is being watched carefully, as it could determine whether the breakout holds or stalls. XRP Needs One Thing to Ignite the Next Wave! The breakout we’re tracking is officially underway, and so far, it's following what we'd expect to see in a breakout… Yesterday, I described two scenarios. Today’s action aligns with Scenario 1 – a push to $2.30 first, followed… pic.twitter.com/tZ7JnPgHgu — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 30, 2025 $2.25 Emerges as a Defining Support Level CasiTrades predicted XRP’s recent climb above $2.25. The importance of this level lies in its technical relevance. It aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level of the broader consolidation range, as well as the former resistance area from which XRP recently surged. According to CasiTrades, a clean retest and hold of this level would represent the entire consolidation apex, providing the strongest possible confirmation that XRP is establishing new support. $2.25 was a crucial resistance for XRP , and if it can hold as a support, the breakout structure would be considered intact, and the move could extend significantly. CasiTrades noted that this is a critical point in the breakout, emphasizing that true strength is shown when resistance becomes support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 RSI Readings Suggest Room to Climb Momentum indicators also appear to support the current breakout narrative. On lower timeframes, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not shown bearish divergence, suggesting that the recent price surge was not overextended or lacking conviction. Instead, the strength appears genuine, fueled by volume and structural support. The RSI spiked to the high 60s but has already begun resetting. If XRP revisits $2.25 and the RSI pulls back accordingly without dipping into bearish territory, this would create favorable conditions for a renewed move upward. Next Targets Identified Above $2.30 If the $2.25 level is validated as new support, CasiTrades projects the next major upside levels at $2.69 and $3.04. The chart also marks $2.3048 as the 0.618 retracement from a prior swing, indicating that a break above this area could trigger further acceleration. While XRP remains below $2.30 at the time of writing, the structure of the move suggests that a bigger breakout is coming . The coming sessions will be critical as the market watches whether $2.25 can serve as the foundation for the next climb.

Bitcoin Is Trading Between These Two Short-Term Holder Price Bands In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about the short-term price band that Bitcoin has been trading inside lately. The band in question is based on two levels relevant to the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Related Reading: This Altcoin Looks Like PEPE Before It Exploded, Analyst Says The indicator related to the STHs that’s of interest here is the Realized Price, which keeps track of the average cost basis or acquisition level of the BTC addresses belonging to the group. When the value of this metric is greater than the asset’s spot price, it means the STHs as a whole can be considered to be in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the coin’s value suggests the dominance of loss among this cohort. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode, which shows the trend in the STH Realized Price and a few lines corresponding to different standard deviations (SDs) from it: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin price has interestingly traded in a range defined by two of these lines over the last six months. The lower bound of the range has been the -1 SD and the upper one the +1 SD. The STHs are made up of the new entrants into the sector and fickle-minded traders, so the group tends to easily react to happenings in the market. As such, the cryptocurrency’s price can have some interactions with the STH Realized Price, due to the cohort’s panic buying/selling. From the chart, it’s apparent that the same has been true in this period of consolidation as well. While the indicator has certainly not acted as an absolute support or resistance, the asset has still seen such effects around it in the short term. Related Reading: Ethereum In Demand: ETF Inflow Streak Extends To 7 Weeks Currently, Bitcoin is trading above the metric after finding a rebound at it last month. The level ahead of the asset now is the +1 SD. In this period of sideways movement, it has so far only been able to test this line once. “This level can be seen as the upper band of the short-term price action,” notes the analytics firm. The +1 SD is located at around $117,000 right now. It only remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will test this level in the near future or not.

The company also stated that the transfer of its own shares is only possible with its own approval, and warned, “Any share transfer requires our approval, we have not approved any transfer. Please be careful.” Robinhood, meanwhile, introduced its new crypto and blockchain-focused products in Cannes, France. The company attracted attention with its tokenized shares, staking services, and a new blockchain infrastructure move. Following the introduction, Robinhood shares rose above $100, hitting an all-time high.

The tokens are offered through shares we own through a special purpose company,” a Robinhood spokesperson said in response to OpenAI’s statement. Robinhood, in line with looser investor regulations in the European Union, has distributed €5 worth of OpenAI and SpaceX tokens to eligible users who sign up to buy equity tokens by July 7. The tokens are being offered through the company’s crypto platform. Robinhood’s Crypto General Manager Johann Kerbrat said, “Our goal is to expand access. With tokenization, we want everyone to be able to participate in this economy.” However, this development has once again highlighted the clash between crypto platforms’ efforts to democratize access to financial products and the desire for control of the companies on which these products are based. Due to regulatory restrictions in the US, the tokens in question are not accessible to US users. *This is not investment advice.

A recent Bloomberg report reveals that Donald Trump holds at least 8% of his net worth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This revelation comes amid growing speculation that Trump’s pro-crypto stance may not be just political, but personal. Donald Trump Net Worth: Real Estate, Truth Social, and Crypto As of now, Trump’s total net worth is estimated at $6.4 billion, largely made up of: Real estate assets, including 19+ properties valued over $50 million each His stake in Trump Media & Technology Group (Truth Social) And now, a rapidly growing share of crypto holdings While Trump’s real estate empire remains the backbone of his business, the report suggests that cryptocurrencies are becoming a larger slice of Trump’s financial pie. World Liberty Financial: The Core of Trump’s Crypto Holdings The centerpiece of Donald Trump’s crypto wealth is a project called World Liberty Financial (WLFI). WLFI has raised over $550 million from token sales $390 million of that amount reportedly went directly to the Trump family Trump and his family also own 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, valued at approximately $2 billion (though currently non-transferable, hence not included in his official net worth) USD1 Stablecoin and TRUMP Memecoin Fuel Trump’s Crypto Empire Trump’s crypto holdings don’t stop with WLFI. The report highlights two other major assets in his portfolio: 1. USD1 Stablecoin Market Cap: $2.2 billion+ 24H Trading Volume: $1.5 billion+ Annual Earnings from Reserves: $100 million [post_titles_links postid=”477986″] 2. TRUMP Memecoin Market Cap: $1.79 billion 24H Trading Volume: $269 million Total Supply: 1 billion TRUMP tokens Circulating Supply: ~200 million CIC Digital, the firm controlling 80% of TRUMP tokens, is reportedly linked to the Trump Organization Trump Steps Into the Crypto Mining Business Donald Trump has a 20% stake in American Bitcoin, a U.S.-based crypto mining firm. The company recently merged with Gryphon Digital Mining and is now valued at over $3 billion. This move places Trump directly in the mining sector, further diversifying his crypto interests. Final Thoughts While Trump’s public support for cryptocurrencies has often made headlines, this new report suggests something more: Donald Trump’s crypto holdings are now a central piece of his fortune. With over $500 million directly tied to crypto and even more in token valuations, Trump may be one of the most crypto-exposed political figures in the world. As the next election cycle heats up, Trump’s net worth and growing crypto empire are likely to remain in the spotlight.

Donald Trump’s significant crypto wealth rapidly grew, especially after October 2024. It stems from the launch of his own meme coins ($TRUMP, $MELANIA) and a substantial stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with his family. He has also directly engaged with the crypto mining sector. What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and how does it generate value for the Trump family? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a crypto venture co-established by Donald Trump, with his sons Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron listed as Web3 ambassadors. It generates value through token sales (raising over $550 million), with a Trump family entity receiving 75% of net revenues from these sales and holding 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. How does Trump’s crypto wealth compare to other political figures or billionaires? Donald Trump is likely one of the most crypto-exposed political figures globally, with over 8% of his estimated $6.4 billion net worth tied to crypto. While exact comparisons with other politicians are hard, his direct involvement in crypto projects and substantial holdings make him an outlier among major political figures.

The billionaire tells his 1.7 million followers on the social media platform X that the US will likely lower interest rates and print money to address the nation’s ballooning debt obligations. However, he warns that such measures are not very effective. “When countries have too much debt, lowering interest rates and devaluing the currency that the debt is denominated in is the preferred path government policy makers are most likely to take, so it pays to bet on it happening. At the moment of my writing, we know that the projections are for big deficits and big increases in government debt and debt service expenses ahead… I also shared last week why I believe the political system in the US won’t be able to get its debt problems under control. We know how debt service costs (paying back interest and principal) will grow rapidly to squeeze out spending, and we also know that, at best, it is highly doubtful that there will be an increase in demand for the debt commensurate with the supply that needs to be sold. I laid out in detail what I think the implications of all this are in ‘How Countries Go Broke,’ where I offer a description of the mechanics behind my thinking. Others have stress tested it, and thus far there has been almost total agreement that the picture I am painting is accurate.” Dalio believes the US will eventually have to both cut spending and raise taxes to save itself from the looming fiscal crisis. “There is no way that the deficit/debt bomb problem can be sustainably dealt with unless there is a mix of tax revenue increases and spending decreases that are determined in a bipartisan way. Our representatives in Washington, D.C., both Republicans and Democrats, know this is true. They understand the need to reduce the deficit by having those from both sides chip in a bit (e.g., a 4% increase in tax revenue and a 4% spending cut) which would lead to a supply/demand balance improvement for US debt which in turn would lower interest rates.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Tim Heath escaped a kidnapping attempt in Estonia by biting an attacker’s finger. The suspects stalked Heath for weeks, using disguises and a GPS tracker. Seven men are accused of plotting to abduct Heath and steal his crypto assets. The chilling incident highlights the growing wave of targeted abductions against wealthy crypto figures in 2025, which has forced many executives to bolster their security measures. Heath, a prominent investor and founder of the Estonian-based Yolo Group, was ambushed by two men disguised as painters in the stairwell of his apartment building. Ex-Boxer Tries to Muzzle Crypto Tycoon in Failed Kidnapping According to testimony cited by Estonian outlet Eesti Ekspress and the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the attackers, Azerbaijani national Allahverdi Allahverdiyev, a former boxer and wrestler, tried to silence Heath by covering his mouth. In a desperate act of self-defense, Heath bit through Allahverdiyev’s index finger, managing to break free and retreat into his apartment. The struggle, which lasted about 30 seconds, cost Heath a tooth but forced the kidnappers to flee. The attackers abandoned a rented van nearby, and police later discovered part of Allahverdiyev’s severed finger about 100 meters from the scene. Court documents revealed the attackers had been stalking Heath in the weeks before the assault, both physically and with a GPS tracker placed on his vehicle. The group allegedly planned to force Heath into the van, transport him to a rented sauna house, and coerce him into transferring his crypto holdings. This is David Balland. He co-founded Ledger, one of the biggest companies in crypto This week, he was kidnapped and tortured Here’s the full story of what happened: (and why it’s a wake-up call for everyone in crypto) pic.twitter.com/0NpLlN8aZm — Pix (@PixOnChain) January 24, 2025 Prosecutors say a hacker was also involved to expedite the digital theft. The group of seven suspects reportedly entered Estonia using fake Georgian passports. In the days before the attack, they bought painters’ uniforms and equipment to pose as workmen. Two men have been arrested so far: Allahverdiyev and Georgian citizen Ilgar Mamedov, who prosecutors claim was the getaway driver. Mamedov has denied involvement, insisting he ended up in Estonia by accident. Three other suspects remain unidentified, and two, including the alleged ringleader Najaf Najafli, are wanted by authorities. Kidnappers Demanded 30 Bitcoin After Failed Abduction After the failed abduction, Heath allegedly received a Telegram message containing photos of his apartment along with a demand for 30 Bitcoin, worth about $3.3 million at the time. When Heath didn’t respond, there were no further attempts to contact him, but prosecutors argue the threat could still be active. Heath has since spent over $3.1 million on private security and relocated to a new home. His legal team is pursuing reimbursement of these costs from the accused kidnappers as the court case continues in Estonia. The recent attack follows a more brutal incident on May 1, when four masked men abducted the father of a crypto entrepreneur in Paris, cutting off one of his fingers before police intervened. In another incident, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials.

AllUnity Secures BaFin License On July 1, AllUnity received an e-money institution (EMI) license from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), allowing the company to issue stablecoin that is fully compliant with Europe’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework . Alexander Hoptner, CEO of AllUnity, said, “Securing the EMI license from BaFin is a monumental achievement for AllUnity and a testament to our dedication to regulatory excellence.

With this euro-pegged stablecoin, EURAU, AllUnity is aiming for seamless cross-border transactions across Europe and beyond, catering to both fintech platforms and established financial institutions. AllUnity is offering a versatile and compatible solution for the evolving digital payments landscape with the EURAU, which is expected to be compatible with enterprise systems and decentralized finance protocols. [post_titles_links postid=”477955″] Stablecoin Battle and MiCA Compliance AllUnity’s announcement comes at a time when Europe is becoming a hotspot in the global stablecoin race, especially with new MiCA rules coming into effect in December 2024. Tether, the biggest stablecoin in the world, has chosen not to follow these rules, causing its USDT token to be removed from top exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase for European users. With a MiCA-compliance, support of financial institutions, and a determined focus, AllUnity is poised to succeed with EURAU. Final Thought AllUnity is expected to endure a big competition and hurdles in its way of regulating EURAU, like the Tether did during the USTD launch. However, despite all the challenges, USDT emerged to be the dominant market leader with a significant lead over other stablecoins. Now, it is time for the investors to see if EURAU can accomplish the same heights or will it fail to gain such popularity.

In the meantime, Peer-to-Peer does not rely on third parties, which means that transactions take place between the parties directly and this makes it quite suitable for assets, such as meme coins, that are volatile. The two-fold approach provides a safe, smooth-running DeFi experience. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on a stablecoin marking USD on Ethereum, which will be resistant to depegging risks, and will allow increasing trust in an ecosystem. Such characteristics makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the leaders in crypto investment, that can grow enormously. Security and community incentives bolster growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, achieving a 95.00 security score with zero vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust platform. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, allocating $50,000 in USDT rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. This initiative reinforces security and transparency. A leaderboard tracks the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. Consequently, these efforts strengthen investor trust and drive its crypto prices upward. MUTM price predictions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for three key price milestones. At launch, its listing price of $0.06 guarantees a 100% ROI for Phase 5 buyers at $0.03.

Although speed contributed to the growth of Solana, its current high cost of entry cannot allow quick profits as compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Thus, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresher opportunity in the crypto market.

However, this will be done via financial innovation and regulatory tweaks, not overt money printing, he added. Bessent is “done getting fluffed,” and it’s time for him to “soak the world with his liquidity juices,” he exclaimed. Trillions in T-Bill Buying Power Hayes stated that this stealth liquidity injection strategy has two massive beneficiaries: Bitcoin and JPMorgan. JPMorgan’s stablecoin ( JPMD ) allows it to digitize deposits, eliminate compliance costs, and earn a risk-free spread by buying US Treasury bills. “Quid Pro Stablecoin” is a discussion on how US banks adopting stablecoins can provide $6.8 trillion of buying power for The BBC’s shitty treasuries. https://t.co/QHqgZAPv0J pic.twitter.com/pcejYZ8Urx — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 3, 2025 Additionally, regulatory changes such as the GENIUS Act could effectively hand “too big to fail” banks a monopoly on stablecoins, which could lock out fintech firms such as Circle. “The adoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power.” Moreover, if JPMorgan converts even a fraction of its deposits into stablecoins, it unlocks hundreds of billions in low-risk, high-margin earnings, potentially doubling or tripling its market cap. Bitcoin would also benefit because stablecoin issuance creates massive Treasury bill demand without quantitative easing, which suppresses yields and reflates risk assets. The primary cryptocurrency thrives when liquidity expands and rates drop. “The real stablecoin play isn’t betting on crusty FinTechs like Circle—it’s understanding that the US government just handed TBTF banks the launch keys to a multi-trillion-dollar liquidity bazooka disguised as ‘innovation’.” Ethereum to Benefit The JPMD stablecoin will ride on Base, a layer-2 operated by Coinbase built on top of Ethereum, confirming that the asset will use Ethereum infrastructure. This positions the protocol as the settlement layer for the new banking liquidity engine. “This is debt monetization dressed in Ethereum drag,” said Hayes. If big banks settle stablecoins on Ethereum, the current industry standard for real-world asset tokenization, demand for the network’s blockspace, layer-2s, and validators increases. The Ethereum infrastructure is quietly powering the entire play, so it is also likely to benefit, though Hayes didn’t directly address it. It could also become the next corporate treasury gold rush due to its staking yields, which are not available with Bitcoin, according to analysts.

Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $26.83 level by 2027 and above $52.95 by 2031. Why is UNI up?

Uniswap is trading just above the $7 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $7.5 and $8.6; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future?

Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $55.07 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of pushing toward potential new highs in July as ETF inflows return and investor sentiment strengthens. But while the spotlight shines on BTC’s macro momentum, a wave is building underneath, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding it fast. The project is 5th stage of presale that is already sold out more than 50%. The current amount amassed by Mutuum Finance is already over $11.5 million with over 12,700 holders.

Bitcoin Holds Firm as July Rally Approaches Bitcoin is now selling at about $108,526, recovering gradually after its April crash on about $74,000 and just short of its new all-time record of about $111,970. This uptrend is supported by technical data: BTC itself re-took its 50-day moving average, which is around $106,000, and has not fallen beneath good support, which shows BTC to have a solid base. As macro trends and regulatory clarity work in favor of BTC, the case is made to reach new highs BTC finds itself in arguably its best position all year, substance, clarity on regulations, and an at-long-last climate.

The model is more prevalent among the users of less stable assets.

Lee states that this strategy will initiate institutional-level Ethereum accumulation, similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments. According to Lee, the financial sector and the cryptocurrency world will become increasingly intertwined by 2025. The basis of this convergence is stablecoins, which are rapidly being adopted and used by both consumers and large institutions. The majority of these stablecoins are built on the Ethereum infrastructure. Lee, who says, “ETH is the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem,” argues that banks will aim to ensure the security of the network by investing in Ethereum. Lee predicts that stablecoins will be one of the key components of the future banking infrastructure. Stating that especially large banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan will start issuing their own stablecoins using the ETH network, Lee stated that these institutions will contribute to network security by staking Ethereum. Related News: How Much U.S. President Donald Trump Has Earned from Cryptocurrency Ventures Revealed - Here Are the Hard-to-Believe Number In the Ethereum network, which operates with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, institutions that stake ETH on the network become transaction validators, which both ensures network security and provides income to the staking institutions. According to Lee, this will play a critical role, especially in ensuring the security of stablecoins. Lee also said that Ethereum currently hosts 51% of stablecoins and 30% of network fees come from stablecoin transactions. He stated that this situation will further increase the dominance of the US dollar in global finance. “If the stablecoin market reaches $2 trillion from $250 billion, transaction fees and therefore returns on the ETH network will also increase exponentially,” he said. Bitmine Immersion, a company led by Lee, has launched a $250 million private investment round in line with this strategy. All funds raised will be used to purchase ETH. Investors include leading institutions in both traditional finance and crypto, such as Founders Fund, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Pantera. The company’s strategy will be evaluated based on the amount of Ethereum earned per share. It is also expected that the company’s value will increase over time through methods such as generating returns by staking Ethereum, financing transactions with ETH in hand, and increasing the price of Ethereum. *This is not investment advice.

The fund stakes up to 60% of its SOL directly, with additional exposure via staked ETPs and liquid tokens. REX and Osprey pass 100% of staking rewards to investors, with no cut taken from the yield. REX-Osprey launched the first U.S.-listed ETF offering exposure to Solana (SOL) and its staking rewards. The new product, called SSK – REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF, started trading on July 2, 2025. It allows investors to earn blockchain-native yields directly through their brokerage accounts. The fund offers spot exposure to Solana, avoiding futures contracts that can suffer from contango . More importantly, it includes direct and indirect staking mechanisms. Around 50–60% of the ETF’s assets are directly staked SOL, while 40% are placed in exchange-traded products that stake SOL. The remaining portion includes liquid staking tokens like JitoSOL.

The price broke slightly above a multi-week high and currently targets a key level. After a fearful weekly start, which caused a serious panic sell across the crypto space, altcoins regained strength and began to show bullish signs. WIF, alongside several top meme coins, are in the spotlight today as they react strongly to the new positive sentiment surrounding the market at the time of writing. Prior to the panic sell, the meme coins have been forming a fresh bullish pattern since last week. But it is now rising back with full speed following a significant inflow in the last 24 hours. This led to a slight break from a three-week high and is now trading well above $0.9. A significant daily close above the key $1 level should fuel a major rally in the coming days. The May high may pose little threats. Overcoming that high should confirm a bullish rally in the short term. Right now, the bears are off the market. If they manage to return with mounting pressure, we may see a sharp price nosedive. Breaking below June support would confirm a new selling phase in the market. But with the look of things, the bulls are much more likely to gain more control. WIF Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While targeting the key $1 level in the latest surge, the main resistance level to watch for the bulls on the way up is $1.39. If they overcome it, the $1.75 and $2.25 levels would be their next area of interest. The $0.64 level currently serves as support. If the price drops below it, the $0.522 and $0.4 levels are lower supports to keep in mind.

47334480,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=31031,1751528489,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,Litecoin Shows Bullish Signs Despite Price Dip Below $90,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/litecoin-shows-bullish-signs-despite-price-dip-below-90/,"Litecoin (LTC) has slipped beneath the $90 level, raising concerns among investors, but several technical and onchain signals suggest that a bullish reversal could be taking shape. While the current price action may seem weak, analysts are pointing to a shift in market sentiment and upcoming macro events that could pave the way for a significant rally in the months ahead. Market Activity Suggests Buyer Dominance Is Returning One of the clearest signs of a potential bullish turnaround is seen in the 90-day Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD). This metric, which measures the balance between buy and sell pressure, turned positive for the first time since December 2024. The flip to a “taker buy dominant” environment indicates that market participants are stepping in to accumulate LTC at current price levels. The return of buy-side dominance often marks the early stages of a trend reversal and suggests that selling pressure is beginning to subside. ETF Speculation Adds Fuel to the Fire Further boosting bullish sentiment is the growing optimism around a potential Litecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to Bloomberg analysts, there is a 95% probability that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve LTC, SOL, and XRP ETFs by October 2. Such approval would mark a major milestone for Litecoin, opening the door for increased institutional participation and broader retail access. The market often reacts positively in anticipation of such regulatory developments, which could provide a meaningful catalyst if confirmed. Seasonal Weakness Could Delay Immediate Gains Despite these positive indicators, historical trends suggest caution in the short term. Data reveals that August and September have consistently been Litecoin’s weakest months, delivering average returns of -6.99% and -5.06% respectively since 2012. However, these months are typically followed by a strong recovery, with November standing out as the most profitable period for LTC historically, boasting an average return of 94.79%. If the anticipated ETF approval aligns with Litecoin’s seasonal pivot, the convergence of timing and sentiment could amplify the upside. Price Structure Echoes 2024 Breakout Pattern Technically, Litecoin’s daily chart is mimicking its 2024 setup, when a Q1 rally was followed by a correction throughout Q2. This year, the price has once again retested a significant demand zone that served as a launchpad for a breakout in late 2024. If LTC continues to accumulate within this zone, it may soon challenge the descending trendline that has contained its price for several months. A successful breakout above the trendline, accompanied by a reclaim of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, would provide a strong confirmation of bullish momentum heading into Q4. Strategic Opportunity or Risk? While price weakness persists for now, multiple layers of technical and fundamental signals suggest that current levels may present a strategic accumulation opportunity rather than a warning sign. With institutional interest growing and technical setups pointing to historical parallels, the path forward for Litecoin could become significantly more optimistic if conditions align in the coming weeks.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,TRADING|LTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-03 07:41:29

The stolen haul, including 800 ETH funneled into Tornado Cash across June 25 and 27, underscores the persistent threat of state-sponsored cyberattacks in the crypto market. Meanwhile, a new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is capturing investor attention with its Phase 5 presale, offering tokens at $0.03 for a guaranteed 100% return upon its $0.06 launch. As cyber threats loom, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a beacon of innovation. This shift in focus highlights a growing interest in secure, utility-driven projects. Lazarus Group’s latest heist The Lazarus Group’s audacious theft of $3.2 million in Solana assets reveals the crypto market’s vulnerability.

This surge signals strong trader confidence in ADA reaching $0.60 soon. Currently trading at $0.5593, Cardano shows a modest 0.91% daily gain. Yet, its trading volume dropped 6.62% to $478.84 million, hinting at cautious investor moves. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its presale phase 5, raising $11,500,000 with over 580 million tokens sold to 12,700 holders. Priced at $0.03, MUTM promises a 100% return at its $0.06 launch. Can Cardano outpace this rising DeFi star to hit $1 first? Let’s explore. Cardano’s push toward $0.60 Cardano is showing signs of a potential breakout. Its open interest climbed 0.99% in 24 hours, reflecting bullish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index at 23 suggests ADA is undervalued, ripe for a rebound. Trading at $0.5593, Cardano faces resistance at $0.60, a key level due to past buy-ins. Sustained bullish momentum could push it past this barrier. However, the 6.62% dip in trading volume raises questions about investor commitment. If bulls hold firm, Cardano’s crypto prices could soar. Moreover, the broader crypto market’s 0.56% uptick supports ADA’s upward trajectory, making it a top crypto to watch in 2025. Mutuum Finance’s presale powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing rapidly through phase 5, already over 50% filled. Priced at $0.03, the token has tripled from its phase 1 price of $0.01. Investors are flocking, with $11,500,000 raised and 12,700 holders onboard. The presale’s success underscores MUTM’s appeal in the crypto investment space. Phase 6 will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, narrowing the window to buy at this level. With a launch price of $0.06, buyers now secure a guaranteed 100% return. Additionally, projections estimate MUTM could hit $2.50 post-launch in 2025, offering a staggering 8,233% ROI, making it a top crypto contender. Innovative DeFi solutions by Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending model.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $107,138.45 and $109,763.65 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, yet it struggles near a multi-month supply block. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. In the first week of July, daily active addresses, whale transactions count (>1m USD), and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases, as a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside. Now, if Bitcoin can break through June’s swing high of $110K then this time the chances of surpassing $112,000 become more likely. A successful breakout could propel BTC towards a new high of $120,000 by the end of July. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses, then the consolidation under the flag would continue and could return to the critical May swing low support zone. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

Using a compromised app, or inputting private phrases into one may lead to significant losses. Users are already reporting losses from the fake apps. Hacks and exploits accelerated in the first half of 2025, as crypto increased in value. Threats also came from DPRK hackers infiltrating projects, with hundreds potentially affected by malicious code. Firefox fake extensions target the most widely used wallets Koi intercepted fake apps for some of the most widely used wallet extensions, including Coinbase, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Exodus, OKX, Keplr, MyMonero, Bitget, Leap, Ethereum Wallet, and Filfox. The researchers discovered over 40 apps posing as wallets, with new ones appearing. Some of the fake wallets are still active on unofficial links. According to researchers, the fake apps started spreading around April 2025. The extensions extract and send out wallet extensions, reaching a server controlled by the attacker. The apps also transmit the user’s IP address for tracking and further targeting. Attackers cloned the open-source code of legitimate wallets The attack was relatively simple, often using the legitimate wallet code for open-source projects like MetaMask. The fake apps then injected the malicious code to allow the wallet to steal data and credentials. The fake wallet apps were active on app stores, using the same logos and style as the original wallet. Previously, faked wallets have targeted specific niche projects, but this time, the attacker spoofed multi-asset wallets, widely used for DeFi, trading, NFT and other on-chain tasks. Code analysis concluded the attack most likely originated from Russia, as Russian-language code comments were discovered in some of the apps. Metadata from a file on one of the command-and-control servers also points to a Russian attacker. Koi advices users to install an allow list filter and avoid downloading apps without vetting. Some of the apps may not show problems, but later update and change their behavior. Security researchers also advice against searching apps directly, as the results may point to fake wallets with deliberately inflated five-star reviews. The best approach is to use the wallet’s official web page or social media. Users were also advised to be skeptical when seeing an app with too many five-star reviews, that were artificially placed to make the app seem established and legitimate.

Secretary Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan informed the Senate Standing Committee on Power that although surplus electricity is available during winter, the IMF strictly stands against it. Pakistan’s 2,000 MW Crypto Mining Plan Gets Rejected In a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power, chaired by Senator Mohsin Aziz, the ongoing discussions with the IMF on crypto mining were outlined. IMF cited concerns about market distortions before rejecting the proposal to offer subsidized rates to energy-intensive industries such as crypto mining, data centres, and metal industries. Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts for crypto mining , aiming at interest foreign investments, has now been rejected by the IMF. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” said Secretary Irfan. However, ongoing discussions suggest that Pakistan is committed to refining its energy plan to align with global standards and recommendations.

Senator Shibli Faraz criticized the deal, accusing the banks of being “forced at gunpoint” to offer loans. Power Theft in Pakistan The Secretary Power added that 58% of users pay a subsidized rate of Rs. 10 per unit, which is a lot less than the government standard price.

Pakistan’s 2,000 MW crypto mining plan aimed to allocate surplus electricity, especially during winter, to energy-intensive industries like crypto mining, data centers, and metal industries. Its goal was to attract foreign investment, monetize underutilized power, and create high-tech jobs, turning surplus energy into a revenue-generating asset. What are the implications of the IMF’s rejection for Pakistan’s crypto ambitions? The IMF’s rejection creates significant hurdles for Pakistan’s crypto ambitions, particularly regarding large-scale, subsidized crypto mining operations. It means Pakistan must refine its energy plan to align with global standards and avoid market distortions, potentially slowing down its aim to become a regional crypto and AI hub. How does electricity theft in Pakistan impact the feasibility of large-scale crypto mining? Widespread electricity theft in Pakistan poses a significant challenge to the feasibility of large-scale crypto mining. It contributes to financial losses for utilities, potentially leading to higher tariffs for honest consumers and instability in the power grid. Such issues make it difficult to guarantee a stable and cost-effective power supply for energy-intensive operations like crypto mining.",News|Mining,EN,0,0,MINING|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-03 07:56:27

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-prediction-analyst-says-everything-just-changed-for-xrp-heres-why/,"XRP has spent months consolidating beneath a persistent downward trendline, with price compressing further as each test of resistance narrows the range. According to crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), who shared a detailed breakdown on the 3-day chart, XRP may now be approaching a pivotal turning point. He stated that everything has changed for XRP, and his analysis is centered on a descending triangle structure that has been forming since January 2025, suggesting that the asset is nearing the end of a prolonged period of tightening price action . In his video, Steph pointed out that volume has declined substantially during this compression phase, and he considers this a critical precursor to a large move. #XRP PRICE PREDICTION (EVERYTHING Just Changed!!!) pic.twitter.com/PvNBoBlGHb — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 30, 2025 XRP Breakout Criteria and Price Confirmation The analyst emphasized $2.33 as a clear breakout level for traders to monitor . He identified this value as the upper boundary of the descending resistance line, saying that a daily close above that level would confirm the breakout . He stressed that without this c At the time of his analysis, XRP was trading just above $2.18, approaching that breakout zone. If the candle closes decisively above $2.33 on the 3-day chart, Steph said it would validate the bullish thesis that XRP is entering the next impulsive phase of its cycle. Fibonacci Targets Suggest XRP Multi-Leg Rally To outline possible upside targets, Steph used a trend-based Fibonacci extension tool, measuring from XRP’s 2024 low to its recent high of $3.39 in January and extending to the $1.61 retracement point marked in April. This calculation produced several key levels for the next potential rally. He highlighted $5.38 as the initial significant target (0.618 Fibonacci), suggesting it would be a reasonable level for partial profit-taking. Further projections place potential moves around $11.31, $23.78, and even as high as $37.63 if momentum remains strong. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steph acknowledged that such levels would take time to reach, but noted that “back in 2024 we also had a similar thing… and the moment XRP broke the trend line, price literally exploded.” Other experts have predicted that XRP could experience a similar rally by late 2024 , making Steph’s targets more realistic. Short-Term Support Levels While the focus was largely on the bullish scenario, Steph also addressed possible retracements. He argued that $1.61, the April low, is likely to hold and serves as the base of the current structure. Immediate support sits at $2.06 and $1.95, with $1.80 acting as a final key level in the short-term structure. He noted that a minor rejection could occur before a sustained breakout.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate headlines, it's the altcoin space that could deliver outsized returns in the months ahead. In this analysis, we spotlight five altcoins currently flying under the radar but displaying strong technical setups and long-term fundamentals. From Layer-2 scaling solutions to Web3 infrastructure plays, these picks may be closer to liftoff than most expect. Arbitrum (ARB): Oversold and Primed for a Reversal Rally Source: tradingview Arbitrum is currently trading in the low $0.30s, reflecting significant pressure—but also presenting a compelling entry point for risk-tolerant investors. Down more than 60% over the last six months, ARB's RSI below 40 suggests the asset is nearing oversold territory, often a precursor to sharp rebounds. If it can break through resistance around the mid-$0.40 range, the next target could be the high $0.50s—a possible 50% gain from current levels. As Ethereum’s Layer-2 narrative continues to grow, Arbitrum’s strong fundamentals and scaling potential could drive renewed interest. A shift in sentiment might quickly flip this downtrend into a breakout. Render (RNDR): Short-Term Pressure, Long-Term Vision Intact Source: tradingview Render is currently navigating a volatile patch, trading between just over $3 and $4, but this could be a setup for accumulation rather than decline. While the price has dropped by over 10% this week and more than 35% this month, the long-term vision of powering decentralized GPU rendering remains intact. A move past the $4.50 resistance level could trigger a bullish reversal, offering more than 20% upside from today’s range. As AI and 3D content continue to dominate digital innovation, Render’s utility could spark renewed momentum once market confidence stabilizes. The fundamentals are solid—what’s missing now is a catalyst. Theta Network (THETA): Quiet Accumulation Before a Breakout? Source: tradingview Theta is trading between $0.64 and $0.80 in what looks like a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Although momentum has been modest, technicals show that a break above $0.89 could pave the way to $1.05, translating into over 30% upside from current levels. The convergence of the 10-day and 100-day moving averages near $0.66 indicates price compression—a typical setup before sharp directional moves. As demand for decentralized video delivery increases, Theta's unique infrastructure may once again capture investor attention. This sideways action could be laying the groundwork for a decisive breakout. JasmyCoin (JASMY): Climbing the Wall of Worry Source: tradingview JasmyCoin is currently trading between $0.01188 and $0.01500, showing signs of resilience even amid a 30% monthly decline. Its RSI near 48 suggests the coin is neither overbought nor oversold, meaning it’s in a critical pivot zone. A push above $0.016 could open the door to testing $0.020, which would represent a strong recovery from current levels. With its roots in IoT data privacy and partnerships in Japan, Jasmy still has an ecosystem worth watching. Once buying momentum picks up, the upside could surprise those who wrote it off too early. The Graph (GRT): Technical Weakness, Strategic Positioning Source: tradingview The Graph is currently consolidating between $0.08 and $0.10 after a near 30% drop this month, but the structure suggests a potential breakout is in sight. The RSI near 41 highlights that the asset is approaching oversold territory, a common setup for bullish reversals. If GRT breaks through the $0.11 resistance and approaches $0.13, that could yield over 30% gains from the lower range. As a leading protocol for querying blockchain data, The Graph remains a foundational tool in Web3 infrastructure. Smart investors might view this price zone as a long-term discount. Conclusion The altcoin market is no stranger to volatility, but for those who look beyond the noise, moments like these often present the best opportunities. Arbitrum, Render, Theta, JasmyCoin, and The Graph are all showing signs of underlying strength despite recent pullbacks. Whether it’s through technical breakouts or real-world utility, each project has a case for upside. As sentiment begins to shift, these coins could be among the first to catch fire—so keeping them on your radar might just pay off in a big way.

Following its breakout, some analysts forecasted that a retest of the range highs could be around the corner. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Level Amid $108,000 Rejection, But Analysts Suggest Caution This Quarter Ethereum Reclaims Crucial Area On Wednesday, Ethereum jumped over 7% from its local low to the $2,550 mark, setting the stage to reclaim another crucial resistance. The King of Altcoins climbed from the $2,380 support to the $2,585 area, hitting a two-week high. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $2,400-$2,800 price range since the early May breakout, but briefly lost this area after failing to hold the $2,550 support two weeks ago. After recovering its local range, ETH struggled to break past the $2,500 barrier, trading between the range low and this resistance for a week. Nonetheless, today’s market recovery, which also saw Bitcoin jump to the $109,600 mark, has sparked bullish sentiment among investors. Amid today’s performance, Daan Crypto Trades called ETH’s price action a “nice move out of the local range.” However, he suggested that bulls must hold the $2,520 area to confirm it isn’t another deviation or liquidity grab in a “bigger chop.” To the trader, failing to hold this area would send the cryptocurrency to the range lows again. As a result, the major levels to watch remain the $2,310 support and $2,735 resistance. Market watcher Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum has “respected support every single time,” forming “one of the cleanest breakouts we’ve ever seen.” He highlighted a three-month ascending triangle in ETH’s chart, pointing out that the King of Altcoins bounced from the rising support line during the recent price deviation and now targets the next key resistance around the $2,700 mark. Ethereum is charging up. Higher lows, strong base, bullish MACD crossover. A clean break of $2,700… and ETH will fly. $3,000 is just the beginning. The real move comes after that. ETH To Repeat ATH Set Up? Merlijn also affirmed that ETH’s two-year setup is repeating, which could signal that a massive breakout is coming. According to the chart, the Ethereum price has moved in stages that last about two years since 2018. During the first stage, the cryptocurrency’s price forms a base, which later leads to the second stage, where the price rejects and retests the base lows. Lastly, Ethereum experiences the liftoff phase, where the price breaks out to new highs. The last liftoff phase, between 2020 and 2022, saw ETH surge from the $100 mark to its $4,878 all-time high (ATH). To the trader, “This time we start from $1,500. Not a dip. A launchpad.” Similarly, analyst Kaleo pointed out the structural resemblance between ETH’s performance this cycle and last cycle. He noted that, while BTC hit a new ATH in December 2020, Ethereum was 60% down from its previous cycle highs, leading many investors to suggest it was “dead.” Related Reading: Solana Summer Loading? SOL Eyes $180 Following Staked ETF-Fueled Breakout Nonetheless, ETH climbed over 800% from there, outperforming Bitcoin’s 250% increase in the following months. This time, the cryptocurrency has also seen up to a 68% retrace from its previous ATH, while BTC soared to new highs. If history repeats, “The bottom for ETH is in. Up only from here,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,568, a 6.1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

But this isn’t just any price rally. According to top crypto trader Michael van de Poppe, Bitcoin is showing strong momentum that could soon push it past its previous all-time high of $111,970. If this rally holds, a new record could be just a week or two away. BTC Price Breakout In Weeks In a recent bitcoin price analysis, Michael shared a key 4-hour chart showing that Bitcoin has cleared a big hurdle, the $106,500 level. Breaking this barrier pushed BTC up past $108,000, where it’s now holding firm near $109,000. This shows that buyers are back and momentum is building. He notes that when Bitcoin passed $106,500 earlier, it took liquidity from lower levels, which pushed out short traders and gave BTC more energy to rise. Michael believes the next target is around $110,500. If Bitcoin stays above this mark, it could break its old all-time high of $111,970, or even go higher in the next couple of weeks. Key Levels to Watch Next Even with strong momentum, Michael believes that Bitcoin could see small dips along the way. If there’s a pullback, traders are watching the $105,500 area and the $100,000 zone as good spots to add more positions. These levels should act as strong support if the price cools down before the next leg up. Big Predictions From Big Banks Being more bullish, Standard Chartered, one of the world’s top banks, just shared a bold Bitcoin forecast . They believe Bitcoin could hit $135,000 by the end of the third quarter of 2025 and might even touch $200,000 by the end of this year. This big target adds even more hope for traders who believe Bitcoin’s rally is far from over. With BTC holding above $109,000 and traders feeling confident, the next one or two weeks could be huge for the crypto market.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-03 08:00:51

47335056,https://zycrypto.com/?p=108104,1751530200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,JPMorgan Creates Tokenized Carbon Credit Market to Revitalise the Economy and Ecology,https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-creates-tokenized-carbon-credit-market-to-revitalise-the-economy-and-ecology/,"JPMorgan Chase is creating a pilot program to tokenize carbon credits, collaborating with three major carbon registries, to improve the transparency and efficiency of carbon markets. JPMorgan wishes to build a carbon credit blockchain based on pre-existing carbon trading markets. JPMorgan wishes to collaborate with the three carbon registries: S&P Global Commodity Insights, International Carbon Registry, and EcoRegistry. The carbon tokens will represent one ton of carbon dioxide offset. Businesses could use the tokens as verifiable proof of their credits. The first businesses to test the blockchain credits would most likely be the renewables and forestry industries. Carbon accounting can be a complex undertaking, but could benefit from an immutable blockchain. The latest trend in blockchain is to issue stablecoins pegged to real-world assets such as US dollars and Gold. Carbon credits could extend this trend and focus on environmental projects. JPMorgan announced the project, stating that they were undertaking a collaborative project to address decarbonization from within the financial sector. The banking giant will collaborate primarily with carbon registry business S&P Global Commodity Insights. JPMorgan argued that the partnership with S&P would take advantage of their data analytics expertise and combine it with JPMorgan’s experience in finance. JPMorgan is promoting the project as a way to address the issue of sustainability and lower carbon emissions, particularly in the commodities sector. The combined efforts of a data analysis firm and a finance institution may be better able to address the issue of carbon pollution by promoting teamwork between their industries. JPMorgan wishes to address economic and ecological issues from within the financial sector. Blockchain is a financial innovation that could be used for various applications such as economics and sustainability. The polymorphic abilities of programmable digital assets can easily translate into polymorphic business models. Despite being critical of digital assets in the past, JPMorgan wishes to take advantage of these benefits because they have suddenly realised the profitability and utility of blockchain. JPMorgan further mentioned in their announcement that climate change is a pressing problem that businesses can address, using their strengths and unique networks to build a more sustainable future. The carbon credit system represents one ton of CO2, which has been removed or avoided, and can later be redeemed for credits or rewards. Tokenized carbon credits involve the same system, only with a technology such as blockchain to record the credits. JPMorgan will collaborate with three major carbon registries, including S&P Global Commodity Insights, to create a blockchain that tracks the lifecycle of carbon credits from end to end. The registries already have the data analytics of carbon data, and will only need to include a blockchain to represent the credit system with tokens. Alastair Northway, natural resources manager at JPMorgan, said a blockchain could bolster the carbon credits markets and build trust in an otherwise obscure process. Northway also commented that market liquidity could be improved by using a blockchain to manage carbon credits. The CO2 markets have been a longstanding interest of the bank JPMorgan, creating many reports on the future of carbon markets and their potential for profitability. JPMorgan believes CO2 markets will mature alongside technical innovations and infrastructure improvements. However, JPMorgan also considers that the CO2 markets could deteriorate if market infrastructure is left to falter. Alastair Northway, natural resources manager at JPMorgan, said that interoperability of carbon markets between countries would add to confidence in the underlying market infrastructure. Carbon accounting is a complex process often construed as unnecessary and corrupt. Northway believes blockchains would improve carbon markets’ transparency and liquidity, revitalising them for a future generation. Regenerative Finance (ReFi) is the term for sustainability tokens, such as those used in carbon markets. ReFi has regressed in recent years because large firms often dominate the process. ReFi tokens are usually less profitable than regular tokens because they are less speculative. The field could benefit from decentralised projects, but might hit a roadblock if carbon credit registries do not open their doors to open-source developers. ReFi is also a challenging market because it requires collaboration between various agencies and businesses. Yet there is still a high demand for sustainability tokens that could tackle the global warming crisis. JPMorgan may be the company best suited to pushing forward a tokenized carbon credit system. However, their efforts may motivate other entities to create ReFi sustainability tokens. Many companies have already signed up for net-zero targets. A carbon credit market would allow companies to buy carbon offset tokens to achieve net-zero results.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|JPMorgan,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-03 08:10:00

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro announced Wednesday that the office filed a complaint, classifying the scam as a Business Email Compromise Scheme. According to the prosecutors, the FBI has traced 40,353 USDT.ETH from the transaction via blockchain analysis. The complaint seeks the recovery of these funds to be returned to the victim. Scammer Conned Victim Using Faint Address Typo The scammer sent an email to the victim last December, posing as Steve Witkoff, co-chair of the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. The mail address used by the scammer had a lowercase ‘L’ instead of a lowercase ‘I’ in the mail @t47lnaugural.com. The campaign’s real email address is @t47inaugural.com. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia noted that the fake address appeared nearly identical to the original, given the font used by the perpetrator. The Nigerian scammer then instructed the victim to deposit funds into a crypto wallet ending in 58c52. On December 26, 2024, the victim sent crypto to the wallet, believing that it belonged to the Inaugural Committee. Per the FBI, $250,300 worth of USDT.ETH was moved from the wallet to another crypto address within two hours.

Jensen. “To avoid becoming a victim, carefully review email addresses, website URLs, and spelling in any messages you receive.” Attorney Pirro warned donors to “double and triple check” whether they are sending crypto to their intended recipient. “It can be extremely difficult for law enforcement to recoup lost funds due to the extremely complex nature of the blockchain.” The post Scammers Steal $250K in Crypto Posing as Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|crypto scams,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-03 08:10:50

However, investors will have to wait longer as its debut has been temporarily delayed. SEC Hits Pause On GDLC Conversion To ETF The SEC put a pause on converting the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC a day after agency staff approved the fund to start trading. “This letter is to notify you that, pursuant to Rule 431 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.431, the Commission will review the delegated action,” the letter, addressed to the New York Stock Exchange, stated . “In accordance with Rule 431(e), the July 1, 2025 order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise.” It can be found here on the SEC website. We have a few theories as to why this happened. 1. The SEC doesn't want to let anything to launch under the 19b-4 process until they officially approve or come up with some framework for digital assets in the ETF wrapper. pic.twitter.com/WegC5d2Tcj — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 2, 2025 Bitcoin comprises around 80% of the fund’s holdings. Roughly 11% of the ETF’s assets would be in Ethereum, while Solana accounts for approximately 2.8% of the fund, Ripple’s XRP commands over 4.8%, and Cardano (ADA) has a weighting of 0.8% in the fund. The SEC told NYSE that it would let it know “of any pertinent action taken by the Commission.” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested the delay may be tied to the SEC’s ongoing efforts to create an internal framework for issuing crypto exchange-traded products. The SEC doesn’t want to let anything launch under the 19b-4 process until they officially approve or come up with some framework for digital assets in the ETF wrapper,” Seyffart noted . Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas concurred with this observation. The plot thickens. Upper level of SEC telling $GDLC it can't launch until otherwise notified. Not sure why, no other info than this letter. My guess tho: They want to issue the crypto ETP listing standards before any '33 act spot ETFs hit market with these other coins. So likely… https://t.co/Za7rYk1o0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 While the SEC greenlighted Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, it has yet to give the nod to other altcoin spot products, including those tracking the price of Solana, XRP, and Cardano.

This monumental shift marks a profound departure from their long-standing reliance on traditional real estate and licensing agreements, signaling a bold embrace of the faster-moving, high-stakes digital asset markets. For those keenly observing the intersection of high-profile figures and the burgeoning crypto world, this development underscores the immense, often unpredictable, wealth-building potential that digital currencies offer. The Astounding Rise of Trump Crypto Ventures The Trump family’s deep dive into digital assets represents a fascinating case study in wealth diversification. Traditionally synonymous with towering skyscrapers and golf courses, their financial interests have now expanded dramatically into the volatile yet lucrative realm of cryptocurrencies. This strategic move highlights a growing trend among influential figures to explore alternative investment avenues beyond conventional markets. A significant portion of their reported earnings stems from their involvement with the DeFi protocol, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This venture alone has seen tokens sold worth over $550 million, with a substantial chunk—approximately $390 million—directly benefiting the Trump family. Beyond these sales, the family also holds a considerable amount of WLFI-branded tokens, whose value was reported to exceed $2 billion as of June. This dual approach of token sales and strategic holdings demonstrates a comprehensive engagement with the DeFi ecosystem. Key Aspects of WLFI’s Contribution: Direct Earnings: Over $390 million from token sales. Asset Holdings: More than $2 billion in WLFI-branded tokens. Strategic Shift: A clear move from traditional real estate to digital assets. Unpacking the Trump Family’s Digital Fortune Beyond WLFI, the Trump family’s crypto portfolio is surprisingly diverse, encompassing stablecoins and even the highly speculative memecoin market. This multi-pronged approach showcases an aggressive strategy to capitalize on various facets of the crypto economy. The USD1 Stablecoin Initiative One notable initiative is the launch of their proprietary stablecoin, USD1. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. The USD1 stablecoin gained significant traction following a major investment from MGX, indicating institutional confidence in its potential. The success of USD1 highlights the growing demand for stable, reliable digital currencies in an often-turbulent market. Venturing into Memecoins and Branded Tokens Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of their crypto journey is the embrace of memecoins, including a dedicated Trump-branded coin. Memecoins, characterized by their community-driven nature and often rapid price fluctuations, represent a high-risk, high-reward segment of the crypto market. The launch of a Trump-branded memecoin generated significant attention, leveraging the family’s public profile to drive engagement and, reportedly, substantial profits. This move blurs the lines between political branding and speculative digital assets, creating a unique phenomenon in the crypto landscape. Navigating the Future of Political Crypto Earnings The Trump family’s crypto ventures extend further, with a strategic investment in a significant crypto entity. Their 20% stake in American Bitcoin, a company reportedly planning to go public, represents another potential avenue for massive wealth generation. An Initial Public Offering (IPO) of American Bitcoin could add even more substantial value to their already burgeoning digital portfolio, solidifying their position as major players in the crypto investment sphere. The involvement of such a high-profile political family in digital assets raises important questions about the future of finance, regulatory oversight, and the evolving relationship between traditional power structures and decentralized technologies. As more public figures and institutions engage with cryptocurrencies, the landscape of wealth accumulation continues to transform. Examining the Impact of Donald Trump’s Crypto Foray The Trump family’s substantial earnings from their Trump crypto ventures offer a compelling case study into the benefits and challenges inherent in the digital asset space. Their success highlights the unprecedented speed at which wealth can be generated in crypto markets, far surpassing the traditional timelines associated with real estate or conventional investments. Benefits Observed: Rapid Wealth Generation: Crypto markets offer unparalleled speed for capital appreciation compared to traditional assets. Diversification: A significant shift away from traditional real estate, diversifying their wealth portfolio. New Market Access: Tapping into a global, digital-native investor base. Leveraging Brand Power: Utilizing public recognition to drive interest in branded digital assets like memecoins. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: The inherent price swings in crypto markets pose significant risks. Regulatory Scrutiny: High-profile involvement can attract increased attention from financial regulators. Public Perception: The association with speculative assets like memecoins can be polarizing. Security Risks: Digital assets are vulnerable to hacks and technological failures. Strategic Insights from Trump’s Crypto Portfolio The journey of Donald Trump crypto earnings provides several actionable insights for both seasoned investors and newcomers to the digital asset space. The Trumps’ approach underscores the importance of exploring diverse crypto segments, from foundational DeFi protocols and stablecoins to the more speculative memecoins and equity stakes in crypto companies. Lessons for Investors: Embrace Diversification: Don’t put all your digital eggs in one basket. Explore different types of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Understand Risk Tolerance: High-reward opportunities often come with high risks. Assess your comfort level with volatility. Stay Informed: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Continuous learning about new protocols, technologies, and regulatory changes is crucial. Consider Long-Term Holdings vs. Short-Term Trading: The Trumps hold significant amounts of WLFI tokens, indicating a long-term belief in the asset, alongside more speculative ventures. The Trump family crypto ventures illustrate a broader trend: the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance and even political narratives. This intertwining of high-stakes finance and public personas will likely continue to shape the future of both sectors. The remarkable accumulation of wealth by the Trump family through their diverse crypto ventures signals a paradigm shift in how prominent figures approach wealth creation. From substantial earnings via the World Liberty Financial DeFi protocol and the successful launch of their USD1 stablecoin, to the high-profile engagement with memecoins and a significant stake in American Bitcoin, their digital portfolio is both extensive and lucrative. This bold pivot from traditional real estate to the dynamic world of digital assets underscores the transformative power of cryptocurrencies, while also highlighting the inherent complexities and considerations that accompany such high-profile involvement in the nascent industry. Their journey serves as a powerful testament to the evolving landscape of global finance, where political crypto engagement is becoming an increasingly visible and impactful force.

47338502,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73309,1751533916,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s How Ripple’s Banking License Could Change Everything for XRP Holders,https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-ripples-banking-license-could-change-everything-for-xrp-holders/,"Ripple has made a significant step that could reshape the future of XRP and its role in the broader financial landscape. In a notable development, Ripple has officially applied for a U.S. banking license . While this may appear procedural, Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X) has explained its implications for regulatory clarity, financial infrastructure, and digital asset adoption. For XRP holders, he says this could mark a pivotal shift. Direct Access to Financial Infrastructure Redbeard explained that by becoming a licensed bank, Ripple positions itself to operate within the U.S. financial system without relying on third-party intermediaries. This change enables Ripple to process payments and financial services directly. With regulatory oversight and trust from traditional institutions , Ripple strengthens its credibility and expands its operational scope in a way few crypto-native companies have. This development also enhances Ripple’s cross-border payment strategy , a core use case for XRP. With a banking license, Redbeard noted that Ripple can integrate XRP more effectively into legacy financial systems, improving the speed, cost, and reliability of international money transfers. The ability to connect crypto-native technologies with conventional banking services provides a clearer path for utility-driven demand for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Enhancing Regulatory Legitimacy A U.S. banking license also signals a shift toward greater regulatory alignment. The crypto space has long faced uncertainty due to a lack of clear and consistent oversight. Ripple’s decision to seek formal banking status introduces a layer of legitimacy and compliance that could encourage wider adoption from institutions previously hesitant to engage with crypto assets. This level of oversight could also reduce legal risks and boost investor confidence. Redbeard noted that this step gives XRP and the XRPL ecosystem stronger foundations. He emphasized that “Ripple becoming a bank means more oversight and legitimacy,” and for a space often challenged by unclear regulations, that change is substantial. Potential Growth in Long-Term Value XRP holders stand to benefit from Ripple’s strategic shift. Redbeard stated that the increased utility , broader adoption, and deeper integration into the financial system strengthen the asset’s value proposition. Institutional access to XRP through bank-regulated channels could lead to higher transaction volumes and sustained demand, which supports long-term value growth. Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license represents a turning point. It positions the company to bridge traditional finance with digital assets through regulatory and operational legitimacy. For XRP holders, this move could create new opportunities for adoption, utility, and value creation in both the short and long term.

This comes amid an even more impressive rally from certain meme coins such as Fartcoin and Bonk. The total crypto market capitalization added around $50 billion during the day and is inching closer to $3.5 trillion. All of this happens as important regulatory changes are likely to take effect in the United States. Bitcoin Price En Route to New All-Time Highs At the time of this writing, BTC trades at around $109,500 which is around 2% below its all-time high achieved on May 22nd – about a month a go. And while we’re on the topic of statistics – the all-time low recorded on CoinGecko took place on July 6th 12 years ago. Since then, the cryptocurrency has returned the staggering 161,270% increase. Anyways, back to the day-to-day news. BTC looks eager to take on its former highs and this is happening as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” proposed by Donald Trump’s administration passed both Senate and the House votes in the past 24 hours. It doesn’t include any direct crypto regulations, but it does intend to alleviate taxes on retail users and also introduce (or re-introduce, to be more precise) the so-called 100% bonus depreciation rule, which will allow Bitcoin mining companies to write off their equipment immediately, potentially allowing them to ramp up operations and increase the network’s hash rate, which has historically been bullish for the price. Source: TradingView In other BTC-related news, the BlackRock IBIT ETF, which tracks Bitcoin’s price, is now generating more fees than their legendary S&P 500 fund – a clear indication of the pent up demand and the fact that investors are willing to pay premium fees for exposure. Fartcoin, Bonk Lead Meme Coin Gains As you can see in the heatmap below, it’s a sea of green in the altcoins market today. Most of them are charting notable increases. Even the large-caps are up a lot – ETH gains 5.8%, DOGE – 7.7%, ADA – 8.5%, HYPE – 5.5%, SUI – 11.6%, and so forth. But the most impressive gains for the day come from two of the more polarizing meme coins – Fartcoin and Bonk. The latter is today’s best performer, gaining about 20%, while the latter is up by 17%. Right behind them is Celestia (TIA), which gained 16%. It’s one of those days where the worst-performing cryptocurrencies are stablecoins (ironically, of course), with just Fasttoken (FTN) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) struggling to gain and trade flat.

Solana just made a bold entry into the U.S. ETF market! The first-ever Solana staking ETF launched by REX Shares under the ticker SSK recorded over $33 million in trading volume on its first day, with $12 million in inflows. That’s more than what we saw with the XRP and Solana futures ETFs when they launched earlier this year and well above the average ETF debut in the U.S., according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “$SSK ended day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch) but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs,” Balchunas posted on X. $SSK ended day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch) but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/t6LkQwDXLc — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 ETF Launch Draws Big Interest Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which pulled in billions on launch day, this Solana ETF is a different kind of product. It’s structured as a C-corporation, which allowed it to skip the usual SEC approval process. That legal move was made so the fund could offer staking rewards, something traditional ETFs can’t do yet. That feature gives SSK a unique edge. Investors get indirect exposure to SOL, while also benefiting from the network’s staking yields. The fund is custodied by Anchorage Digital, a well-known name in digital asset custody. What Comes Next? Spot Solana ETFs Are in the Pipeline The success of SSK has sparked fresh interest in pure spot Solana ETFs, which are still waiting for regulatory green lights. Big players like Franklin Templeton and Bitwise have filings in progress, and Balchunas recently said he sees a 95% chance of approval later this year. That puts Solana ahead of XRP in the ETF race, at least for now. Here are mine and @EricBalchunas ' most recent odds on spot crypto ETF approvals by the end of 2025. We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025. pic.twitter.com/H3pxJhqMy3 — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2025 SOL Price Moves Higher on Positive Sentiment Following the ETF debut, Solana’s price rallied 4% and continued to climb the next day, trading around $154 at the time of writing. Traders are watching the $160 resistance level closely, with bullish momentum building on both the RSI and MACD indicators. If that level breaks, analysts expect a possible move toward $184. Why This Matters for Solana This launch shows real demand for Solana from larger investors. A staking ETF is a first in the U.S., and while it’s not a full spot ETF, it’s a big step forward. With more Solana ETF proposals lined up and strong early interest in SSK, Solana may be entering a new phase as a serious player in regulated finance.",News,EN,0,0,SOL|XRP|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-03 09:13:20

Cryptocurrency assets held by Firefox users, a widely used open-source browser, are at risk, according to a recent report from the security firm. A large-scale campaign, active since at least April 2025, is leveraging malicious extensions still available on the Mozilla Add-ons store, highlighting significant gaps in the browser’s plugin vetting process. Koi Security warns that these fake extensions mirror legitimate wallet offerings with alarming accuracy, using the same names, logos, and branding to deceive users. In many cases, the extensions replicate the code of open-source wallets, with malicious code discreetly inserted to swipe cryptocurrencies while functioning as a normal plugin. Some of the brands impersonated by the fake Firefox extensions include MetaMask, Coinbase, OKX, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Exodus, Keplr, MyMonero, Bitget, Leap, Ethereum Wallet, and Filfox. Earlier this year, OKX warned of a fake browser extension listed on the Firefox store, which mimicked the exchange’s origins plugin to steal credentials from the victims’ wallets. Malicious extension still live on Firefox store Koi linked the campaign to over 40 individual extensions through shared tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as overlapping infrastructure. According to the report, the campaign is currently “active, persistent, and evolving,” with new versions of the extensions continuing to appear despite takedown efforts. The latest uploads were detected as recently as June. Once installed, the fake extensions silently extract wallet secrets and transmit them to a remote server controlled by the attackers. In addition to stealing login credentials, the malware captures users’ external IP addresses, potentially to aid in further profiling or follow-on attacks. To encourage downloads, attackers also exploit trust mechanisms on the plugin marketplace. Many of the fake extensions are propped up with hundreds of fake five-star reviews, far exceeding what would be expected based on actual user installations. Koi found signs pointing to a Russian-speaking threat actor, including Russian-language comments embedded in the extension code and metadata retrieved from a command server used in the operation. While attribution remains tentative, Koi researchers believe these indicators suggest a well-organized and technically proficient group. The scale and sophistication of the campaign pose a significant threat to crypto users. By hijacking browser extensions, a commonly trusted tool among traders and investors, attackers can bypass traditional phishing defences and gain direct access to wallets. Since these extensions often operate with elevated permissions, they can compromise a victim’s accounts without them being able to detect it until it’s too late. An age-old tactic Campaigns such as these underscore the risks retail crypto users face, especially as cryptocurrency adoption increases and browser-based wallet interactions become more common. According to a NASAA survey, crypto-related fraud and social media-based scams remain among the top threats to investors in 2025. Over the past years, malicious browser extensions have become a prominent tool in the cybercriminal’s arsenal, with incidents surfacing across other browsers as well. For instance, in March, a compromised version of the Chrome proxy tool SwitchyOmega was found stealing private keys from crypto wallets after a phishing attack enabled malicious code injection. Another malicious Chrome extension dubbed “Bull Checker” was flagged by Solana-based DEX Jupiter last year. The extension drained user wallets by modifying transaction payloads. Similar tactics have also been employed in earlier campaigns involving fake versions of the Ledger Live app and Aggr trading tools . Some extensions prompt users to input their seed phrases during setup or secretly collect browser cookies, which are then used to reconstruct passwords and access crypto accounts.

The trailblazing changemakers are recognized for their pioneering work in redefining regulatory compliance as a strategic growth engine in the digital asset industry. Acknowledging the fresh challenges faced by chief compliance officers in an era of fragmented regulations, ALB Magazine highlights MacDonald’s demonstrable leadership in navigating cryptocurrency complexities through “regulatory diplomacy.” He has been instrumental in reinforcing Bybit’s commitment to legal integrity and robust governance while balancing sustainable growth. His background in regulatory compliance and combating financial crime has positioned Bybit at the forefront of industry best practices.

The list showcases Asia’s best compliance leaders from diverse sectors including the world’s leading financial service institutions, emerging cryptocurrency exchanges, technology giants, luxury brands, and multinational corporations, highlighting the strategic importance of compliance roles across industries in today’s complex regulatory environment. “I’m truly honoured to be recognised in the June 2025 edition of ALB. Grateful to be featured among such esteemed peers and for the opportunity to contribute to the evolving crypto compliance landscape in Asia . My journey in crypto over the last 3 to 4 years has seen the adoption of crypto and practical use cases grow exponentially,” said Robert MacDonald , Chief Legal and Compliance Officer at Bybit . “From ‘HODLing’, trading to daily spending via card partnerships to institutional adoption. This growth has led to greater awareness and understanding from global regulators and emerging market regulators keen to understand the technology for adoption and regulatory frameworks in their own jurisdictions,” he said. “My journey with Bybit has seen Bybit grow from 30 million registered users to over 70 million users. This growth has seen Bybit obtain a number of new licences, to name a few: Austria (MiCAR), UAE, Turkey and Georgia . Obtaining and maintaining these licences aligns with our broader commitment to providing secure, compliant and regulated services across global markets,” MacDonald reflected on his Bybit experience. Robert MacDonald was appointed Chief Legal and Compliance Officer of Bybit in September 2024 . Prior to joining Bybit, MacDonald started his career in criminal justice as a UK-qualified barrister before transitioning to the public sector and later to multinationals in financial services, technology, and crypto and Web3. The ALB Asia recognition underscores the growing importance of compliance leadership in the digital asset sector, where regulatory frameworks continue to develop across multiple jurisdictions.

In a recent interview with Thinking Crypto, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan spoke about the upcoming decisions for XRP and Solana ETFs. He mentioned that the approvals could happen soon, possibly as early as July, with official deadlines for many applications set in October. More than ten XRP ETF applications are currently awaiting review, including those from Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and Canary. A green light for any of them could trigger a sharp move in XRP’s price before the end of the year. Key Market Levels and Updates On the technical side, XRP’s price is holding steady with increased buying interest. Ripple’s move to apply for a U.S. national bank license might strengthened its long-term outlook, but it hasn’t driven a big short-term rally yet. The $2.26 to $2.45 zone is important. A break above this range could open the way for a larger move. However, today’s U.S. economic reports, including unemployment and inflation data, may affect market sentiment. Big Price Predictions for XRP Analyst Casi Trades has set her targets for XRP. She expects the price to hit at least $6.50, with plans to sell part of her position around $8. If XRP crosses $13, she thinks it could reach as high as $26 by the end of 2025. Min. $6.50 at the first extension target, but I actually am planning to sell a chunk near $8. Once we start breaking to new high, I think I'll be able to narrow down a top — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 30, 2025 When asked if XRP could hit $20 within the next 18 months, Casi said it’s possible if the coin can maintain its strength during the next big rally. What’s Next for XRP XRP’s next big move depends on two things: ETF decisions and upcoming market data. If ETF approvals arrive in the coming weeks, XRP may be on track for one of its biggest price surges in years.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-03 09:25:21

They ambushed Heath at his apartment with the intent to extort his crypto holdings. In response, he spent over $3 million on security and is seeking legal restitution. Separately, cybersecurity firm Sentinel Labs uncovered a North Korean hacking campaign targeting Apple users in the crypto sector by using Nim-based malware to steal sensitive data. Meanwhile, the US Justice Department is investigating a former DigitalMint employee for allegedly profiting from ransomware deals. Crypto Billionaire Fights Off Kidnappers Australian crypto billionaire Tim Heath narrowly escaped a violent kidnapping attempt in Estonia last year, according to details that were revealed in an Estonian court . Heath founded the Estonia-based Yolo Group and its venture capital arm Yolo Investments, and was ambushed in July of 2024 by two men posing as painters in the stairwell of his apartment building. The court heard that Heath fought off one of the attackers—former boxer and wrestler Allahverdi Allahverdiyev—by biting off part of his index finger during a 30-second struggle. Heath managed to break free and retreat to his apartment, though he lost a tooth in the process. The attackers fled the scene and abandoned their getaway van nearby. Part of the severed finger was later found about 100 meters from the site of the attack. Tim Heath (Source: Sydney Morning Herald ) The kidnapping plot was planned for months by a group of seven individuals, prosecutors allege. Heath was reportedly stalked in person and via GPS tracking before the attack. The suspects entered Estonia using forged Georgian passports and purchased disguises from local hardware stores to pose as workers. Their plan was to abduct Heath, transport him to a rented sauna house, and force him to transfer his crypto holdings. A hacker was also allegedly enlisted to help in accessing the funds. Two suspects—Allahverdiyev and Georgian citizen Ilgar Mamedov—are currently on trial in Estonia. Allahverdiyev told the court he was promised €100,000 for the job but claimed he never intended to go through with it and tried to call off the plan. Mamedov is accused of being the getaway driver, and denies involvement. He says he ended up in Estonia by accident while traveling. Two suspects (Source: Sydney Morning Herald ) Authorities are still looking for two additional suspects, including alleged mastermind Najaf Najafli, while three other people involved have yet to be identified. A few weeks after the attempted abduction, Heath reportedly received a threatening message via Telegram that included photos of his apartment and a demand for 30 Bitcoin—which was then worth about $3.3 million. Though the kidnappers made no further contact after Heath ignored the message, prosecutors warn the threat may still be active. Since the incident, Heath spent more than $3.1 million on private security and relocated to a new residence. His legal team is now seeking reimbursement for these costs from the defendants. According to the Australian Financial Review Rich List, Heath’s net worth is estimated at 2.46 billion Australian dollars, or roughly $1.61 billion. New Malware Hits Apple Devices in Crypto Attack In addition to kidnappings, the crypto community should also look out for North Korean hackers who are targeting Apple devices with new strains of malware. They are specifically aimed at cryptocurrency companies, according to cybersecurity firm Sentinel Labs . The attackers impersonate trusted people on messaging platforms like Telegram, luring victims into a fake Zoom meeting via a Google Meet link. They then send a malicious file disguised as a Zoom update. When executed on a Mac, the file installs malware known as “NimDoor,” which is designed to steal crypto wallet data and browser credentials. (Source: Sentinel Labs ) What makes this campaign particularly concerning is the use of the programming language Nim, which is a relatively obscure language that allows malware to operate across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems without modification. Its rarity and technical features make Nim-compiled malware much harder for antivirus systems to detect. While North Korean threat actors previously experimented with languages like Go and Rust, researchers shared that Nim offers faster compilation, ease of cross-platform deployment, and more effective evasion techniques. The malware includes a credential-stealing payload that collects browser data, system information, and even Telegram’s encrypted local database along with its decryption keys. It uses a delayed activation strategy to evade detection by security software. This campaign builds on similar efforts by North Korean hacking group BlueNoroff, which Huntress linked to malware capable of bypassing Apple’s memory protections to inject keylogging and screen recording tools. One of the payloads, CryptoBot, serves as a comprehensive infostealer with an emphasis on compromising crypto-related browser extensions and wallets. Adding to the concern, blockchain security firm SlowMist recently identified a wave of fake Firefox extensions that are designed to extract cryptocurrency wallet credentials. Security researchers warn that macOS is no longer immune to cyber threats. Over the past few years, Apple’s operating system has become an increasingly attractive target for state-sponsored hackers because of its growing adoption and perceived invulnerability. Ex-Ransomware Negotiator Under Federal Investigation The US Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into a former employee of DigitalMint, a firm that helps victims of ransomware attacks negotiate and make payments to hackers. The individual is accused of striking unauthorized deals with cybercriminals and taking a cut of the cryptocurrency used in ransom payments. DigitalMint President Marc Grens confirmed the probe, and explained that the employee was “immediately terminated” once the allegations surfaced. According to Grens, the investigation is solely focused on the former employee and DigitalMint itself is not a target. He added that the company has been cooperating fully with law enforcement and acted quickly to protect its clients and inform affected stakeholders. DigitalMint is based in Chicago, and is registered with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. It claims to have a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies. The incident took place during a decline in ransomware payments. According to cyber response firm Coveware , only 25% of targeted companies paid ransom demands in the final quarter of 2024, down from 32% in Q3 and 36% in Q2. This is a sharp drop compared to 2019, when 85% of victims paid. (Source: Coveware ) Coveware attributes the trend to stronger cybersecurity practices, better backup and recovery systems, and a growing resistance to rewarding criminal behavior. The firm also pointed to heightened law enforcement activity and regulatory guidance discouraging payments as possible contributing factors. The US Treasury also recently sanctioned Russia-based Aeza Group for allegedly hosting ransomware operations and info-stealing malware. The action included sanctions against the group’s leadership and a connected crypto wallet. Meanwhile, Chainalysis reported that total ransomware-related crypto payments fell by 35% in 2024, dropping from $1.25 billion in 2023 to $815 million.",News|Security,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-03 09:30:00

As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction.

Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future.

This uptick comes at a time when a key company is considering ETH as a potential treasury reserve asset, underscoring renewed interest in the cryptocurrency. Forecasting $7,000 Potential Despite being one of the poorer performers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a year-to-date decline of 24%, Ethereum’s recent 6% surge has allowed it to outpace competitors, including Bitcoin (BTC), which is close to its all-time high. Crypto analyst Alek Carter has also expressed a bullish outlook on Ethereum (ETH), drawing parallels between the current price patterns and those observed in 2020. Related Reading: Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases He describes the recent movements in ETH’s chart as reminiscent of the “dead cat bounce” phenomenon—a term used to describe a temporary recovery in price after a significant decline—followed by a final retest before a substantial upward trend. Carter points out that Ethereum underwent a similar trajectory in 2020, where it initially experienced a dip before rebounding sharply to reach a peak of over $3,500. He believes that the recent completion of what he terms the “final retest” suggests that Ethereum is poised for another significant rally. If the current setup mirrors the previous cycle, Carter anticipates that ETH could potentially reach a new high of $7,000. Bullish Sentiment For Ethereum The bullish sentiment surrounding ETH is further reflected in the performance of stocks associated with the cryptocurrency. BitMine, a Bitcoin mining company that recently announced plans to make ETH its primary treasury reserve, saw its stock soar by about 20%, with an increase of over 1,000% since the announcement. Similarly, SharpLink Gaming, which has adopted an ETH treasury strategy, experienced an 11% rise, while Bit Digital, which shifted its focus from Bitcoin mining to Ethereum treasury and staking, gained more than 6%. Moreover, the recent interest in ETH is evident in the performance of Ethereum ETFs, which saw inflows of $40 million on Tuesday, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. A Experts also highlight that ETH’s smart contract capabilities have established it as a leading platform for the tokenization of traditional assets, including US dollar-pegged stablecoins. The ‘Backbone’ Of Stablecoins? Fundstrat’s Tom Lee characterized Ethereum as “the backbone and architecture” of stablecoins, given that issuers like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) operate on its network. Additionally, BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL, launched on Ethereum last year. Tokenization itself represents a transformative process, allowing digital representations of publicly traded securities and real-world assets to be issued on blockchain networks.

The buzz is undeniable: analysts are forecasting an astonishing new target for Bitcoin, potentially reaching as high as $117,000! This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a projection rooted in robust Bitcoin analysis and a close look at key technical indicators. For anyone interested in cryptocurrencies, understanding these insights is crucial for navigating the volatile yet exhilarating journey of digital assets. Let’s dive deep into what’s driving this optimistic Bitcoin price prediction and what it could mean for the market. Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin Price Prediction : Is $117,000 Within Reach? The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with the latest projections, suggesting Bitcoin could be on a direct path to an impressive $117,000. This isn’t a random number pulled from thin air; it’s a figure derived from careful observation of market behavior and specific on-chain metrics. For months, Bitcoin has been consolidating within a defined trading range, oscillating between approximately $78,000 and $110,000. This period of consolidation is often seen as a precursor to a significant price movement, and the current sentiment points towards an upward breakout. Analysts highlight that a decisive move above the $109,000 mark would be a critical trigger, potentially paving the way for new all-time highs. This isn’t just about breaking a psychological barrier; it’s about confirming strong buying pressure and diminishing selling resistance at those levels. The journey to $117,000, while ambitious, is seen as a logical progression if these technical thresholds are surpassed, backed by the underlying strength of the network and growing institutional interest. Deep Dive into Bitcoin Analysis : What Are the Charts Telling Us? When we talk about Bitcoin analysis , we’re looking beyond simple price charts. We’re examining the intricate dance between supply and demand, investor behavior, and the fundamental health of the Bitcoin network. The current market structure suggests a strong accumulation phase, where long-term holders are increasing their positions, and short-term holders are showing resilience. Several factors contribute to this optimistic outlook: Consolidation Period: The prolonged trading range between $78,000 and $110,000 has allowed for a healthy reset, shaking out weaker hands and strengthening the base for the next leg up. Volume Trends: Observing trading volumes during price dips and rallies can reveal underlying strength. High volume on upward moves and lower volume on corrections often indicate bullish sentiment. Market Structure: Higher lows and higher highs on the macro scale suggest an intact bull market, despite periodic corrections. Understanding these patterns is key to appreciating the current Bitcoin price prediction and why analysts are confident in its potential. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about interpreting data. Understanding Key Technical Indicators Driving the Forecast The $117,000 target isn’t arbitrary; it’s heavily influenced by specific technical indicators that provide insights into market psychology and potential price ceilings or floors. Two primary indicators cited by analysts, particularly from Glassnode, are the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis and the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. What are these indicators? Indicator Explanation Significance Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis The average price at which short-term holders (those who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days) acquired their coins. Historically, when Bitcoin’s price approaches the STH Cost Basis, it often acts as a strong support level during pullbacks or a resistance level during rallies. The fact that it’s currently near $117,000 suggests this could be a significant target or resistance point. Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Compares Bitcoin’s market capitalization (market value) to its realized capitalization (realized value), which is the sum of all coins valued at the price they last moved on-chain. A high MVRV ratio indicates that the market is overvalued and holders are sitting on significant unrealized gains, potentially signaling a top. A low MVRV suggests undervaluation. Analysts use MVRV to gauge if the market is overbought or has room to grow. The fact that the STH cost basis is currently near $117,000 suggests it acts as a magnetic target or a significant resistance level that Bitcoin aims to test. Coupled with the MVRV metric, which indicates there’s still considerable room for growth before hitting historically “overbought” levels, these technical indicators paint a compelling picture for continued upside potential. The Role of Glassnode Data : STH Cost Basis and MVRV When we delve into on-chain analytics, Glassnode data provides an unparalleled view into the fundamental health and investor behavior within the Bitcoin network. Their comprehensive suite of metrics allows analysts to go beyond simple price action and understand the underlying dynamics of supply and demand. The STH Cost Basis, for example, is particularly insightful because short-term holders are often more reactive to price changes. Their average acquisition cost can become a psychological pivot point for the entire market. Similarly, the MVRV ratio, a cornerstone of Glassnode data , helps determine if Bitcoin is currently trading at a fair value, undervalued, or overvalued. As Cointelegraph reported, the current MVRV readings suggest that despite recent gains, Bitcoin is not yet in “euphoria” territory, meaning there’s still significant room for price appreciation before the market becomes overheated. This implies that the journey towards $117,000 could occur without triggering an immediate, sharp correction often seen at market peaks. These sophisticated metrics from Glassnode offer a deeper layer of confidence to the $117,000 Bitcoin price prediction , moving it from mere speculation to an evidence-backed possibility. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends : Opportunities and Challenges Beyond the specific technical indicators, understanding the broader crypto market trends is crucial for any investor. The current environment is shaped by a confluence of factors, including the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the ongoing macroeconomic landscape. Opportunities: Institutional Inflow: The entry of major financial institutions through ETFs has provided a new, regulated avenue for capital to flow into Bitcoin, creating sustained demand. Halving Event Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving further reduced the supply of new Bitcoin, historically a bullish catalyst that tightens supply against rising demand. Growing Retail Interest: Renewed interest from individual investors, often spurred by positive price action and mainstream media coverage, adds momentum. Challenges: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and central bank policies can still introduce volatility into the market. Regulatory Scrutiny: While progress has been made, evolving regulatory frameworks worldwide can still pose challenges for the broader crypto ecosystem. Market Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. While the potential for significant gains is real, so is the risk of sharp corrections. Keeping an eye on these overarching crypto market trends allows investors to better position themselves, understanding both the immense opportunities and the inherent risks. It’s about being informed and prepared, not just reacting to price movements. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the compelling Bitcoin analysis and the optimistic forecasts, what should investors consider? Monitor Key Levels: Pay close attention to the $109,000 resistance level. A clear breakout above this could signal the next leg up towards the $117,000 target. Understand On-Chain Data: While complex, familiarize yourself with basic concepts of STH Cost Basis and MVRV. Resources like Glassnode provide accessible dashboards. Practice Risk Management: Despite bullish predictions, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Volatility is inherent in crypto. Diversify (Wisely): While Bitcoin often leads the market, consider a diversified portfolio if it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves fast. Follow reputable news sources and analysts to stay updated on the latest developments and shifts in crypto market trends . These insights empower you to make more informed decisions, leveraging the power of data and expert analysis. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Bitcoin The journey towards $117,000 for Bitcoin is not just a speculative fantasy; it’s a meticulously analyzed possibility backed by strong technical indicators and on-chain data, particularly from Glassnode. While the path to new all-time highs will undoubtedly have its twists and turns, the current Bitcoin analysis suggests a robust foundation for continued growth. As the digital asset landscape matures and institutional adoption deepens, understanding these underlying metrics becomes paramount for any serious investor. The stage is set for what could be an exhilarating period for Bitcoin, reaffirming its position as a leading force in the financial world. Prepare to witness history in the making as Bitcoin continues to redefine wealth and investment opportunities.

The malicious extensions impersonate legitimate wallet tools from well-known platforms, including Coinbase, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Exodus, OKX, Keplr, MyMonero, Bitget, Leap, Ethereum Wallet, and Filfox. According to Koi Security , the campaign has been active since at least April 2025, with new malicious extensions uploaded to the Firefox Add-ons store as recently as last week. The extensions extract wallet credentials directly from targeted websites and transmit them to remote servers controlled by attackers. Notably, OKX has previously warned users in January about fake OKX Wallet Firefox extensions , confirming the exchange had not released any Firefox plugins. The exchange filed complaints with Firefox officials, requesting the removal of the fraudulent browser extensions, while advising users to transfer their wallet assets immediately if they had installed malicious plugins. Sophisticated Trust-Building Tactics Fool Thousands of Users The malicious campaign employed sophisticated trust-building mechanisms to increase installation rates and avoid immediate detection. Many extensions featured hundreds of fake 5-star reviews that far exceeded their actual user bases, creating the appearance of widespread adoption and positive community feedback. Source: Koi Security Threat actors carefully mimicked legitimate wallet tool branding, using identical names and logos to real services they impersonated. This visual similarity increased the likelihood of accidental installations by users searching for official cryptocurrency wallet extensions. The attackers exploited the open-source nature of legitimate wallet extensions by cloning authentic codebases and inserting malicious logic. This approach allowed them to maintain expected user experiences while secretly exfiltrating sensitive wallet data in the background. This strategy reduced development time while increasing the likelihood that security tools would miss malicious modifications to otherwise legitimate code. Some malicious extensions remained undetected for extended periods due to their functional similarities to legitimate wallet tools. Users experienced standard wallet functionality while their credentials were simultaneously transmitted to an attacker-controlled infrastructure. Hardware and Software Attacks Expand Beyond Browser Extensions The Firefox extension campaign represents one vector in an expanding ecosystem of cryptocurrency theft methods targeting both software and hardware security measures. According to a recent report by Cryptonew, a Chinese crypto investor lost nearly $7 million after purchasing a fake cold wallet through Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese platform. Crypto investor loses $6.9 million after buying fake cold wallet on Chinese TikTok as sophisticated hardware scams evolve beyond traditional phishing to compromise trusted security devices. #ColdWallet #CryptoScam #TikTok https://t.co/DnbI4arD8V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 The sophisticated hardware trap compromised the wallet’s private key generation at the fundamental level. When the victim initialized the device, it generated keys already known to attackers, creating a false sense of security while providing criminals complete access to funds. Similarly, Cybersecurity firm Moonlock recently warned about fake Ledger Live applications targeting macOS users through the Atomic macOS Stealer malware. The malware embedded across at least 2,800 compromised websites replaces genuine Ledger Live applications with fake versions that harvest seed phrases through convincing pop-ups. Attackers are also expanding their reach beyond hardware and software. Physical phishing attacks have emerged through traditional mail systems, with scammers impersonating Ledger and sending fake letters via USPS. The letters urge users to “validate” their wallets through QR codes that link to phishing sites designed to steal private keys. This latest discovery adds to the growing threat from sophisticated attackers to the crypto industry. Crypto investors lost more than $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and security breaches in the first half of 2025 alone, according to CertiK’s security report. Wallet-related breaches alone accounted for $1.7 billion across just 34 attacks, while phishing followed with over $410 million stolen in 132 incidents. Ethereum remained the most targeted blockchain, experiencing 175 security events and over $1.6 billion in losses.

At this point, Ripple has applied for a national bank license in the United States, following a similar move by stablecoin giant Circle. While this move was seen as a major development for Ripple, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett drew attention to a more significant development. Eleanor Terrett said that Ripple also applied for a Fed main account through Standard Custody, the crypto custody company it acquired last year, which was a much bigger deal. Terrett argued that granting a Fed master account is more important than a banking license in terms of access, because a Fed master account provides direct access to the payments system, a significant step up from an OCC charter. Noting that the FED has historically refused to grant such access to crypto companies, Terrett added that a decision on this issue is awaited in the ongoing case between Custodia Bank and the FED. “In terms of access, granting a Fed master account is a much bigger deal than granting an OCC charter. One banking attorney described it to me this way: “In terms of tiers, a master account is Diamond, a bank is Platinum, trust companies are Gold, and money transmitter licenses are Silver.” The Fed has historically resisted granting crypto companies direct access to the payment system. It is currently defending this stance in a lawsuit regarding depository institutions’ access to primary accounts (Custodia Bank – FED ), and a decision is expected any day now.” If Ripple’s Fed master account application is accepted, it will gain access to the Federal Reserve’s payment infrastructure and allow it to hold its RLUSD stablecoin reserves directly at the central bank. In addition to applying for an OCC trust charter, @Ripple has also applied for a Fed master account through the trust company it acquired last year — @StandardCustody — which I reported Monday (see below — although I admittedly missed the Ripple connection ).

This development, initially reported by Watcher.Guru on X, could be a truly transformative moment not just for Ripple and XRP, but for the entire landscape of US crypto banking . It signals a bold step towards deeper integration with traditional financial systems and a significant move to embrace formal financial services license requirements. What Does a Ripple Banking License Truly Mean? At its core, a banking license, often referred to as a bank charter, grants an entity the legal authority to operate as a bank. For a company like Ripple, which has historically focused on cross-border payments using its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product and the XRP ledger, securing such a license would unlock a myriad of new possibilities and cement its position within the regulated financial sector. Why is a Banking License So Pivotal for Ripple? The benefits of obtaining a bank charter are extensive, particularly for a fintech company operating in the often-unregulated crypto space. Here’s a breakdown of what it could entail for Ripple: Direct Access to Payment Rails: A banking license allows direct access to critical payment infrastructure like Fedwire and ACH, bypassing third-party traditional banks. This can significantly reduce costs, improve transaction speeds, and offer greater control over payment flows for Ripple’s enterprise clients. Enhanced Trust and Legitimacy: Operating as a regulated bank instantly confers a higher level of trust and credibility. This is crucial for attracting traditional financial institutions, corporations, and even retail customers who might be hesitant to engage with a non-regulated crypto entity. It signals a commitment to regulatory compliance and consumer protection. Broader Service Offerings: With a banking license, Ripple could potentially offer a wider range of financial services beyond its current cross-border payment solutions. This might include holding customer deposits, issuing loans, providing custodial services for digital assets, and even offering banking services directly to businesses. Reduced Reliance on Third Parties: Currently, many crypto firms rely on traditional banks for basic banking services. A license would reduce this dependency, mitigating risks associated with bank partners suddenly withdrawing services due to regulatory concerns or internal policy changes. Regulatory Clarity and Stability: While the application process itself is rigorous, obtaining a license provides a clear regulatory framework within which to operate. This can offer long-term stability and predictability, essential for strategic planning and growth in a volatile market. Navigating the Labyrinth of XRP Regulation in the US The news of Ripple’s banking license application comes amidst a complex and often contentious regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the United States. The most prominent example is the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the classification of XRP. This makes Ripple’s pursuit of a banking license particularly intriguing. How Does the SEC Lawsuit Impact This Ambition? The SEC lawsuit, which alleges that XRP is an unregistered security, has cast a long shadow over Ripple’s operations in the US. While recent court rulings have provided some clarity, the legal saga is not fully resolved. The question arises: how can a company apply for a banking license while its core digital asset’s regulatory status is still contested? Separate Entities vs. Core Asset: It’s possible that the banking license application is for a specific subsidiary or a new entity that would operate distinct from the direct handling of XRP as a security. This entity might focus on other financial services where XRP is used as a bridge currency, not necessarily sold as an investment. Strategic Play: Applying for a license could also be a strategic move to demonstrate Ripple’s commitment to compliance and regulation, potentially strengthening its argument in the ongoing legal battle by showing its intent to operate within established financial frameworks. OCC’s Stance: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which grants federal banking charters, has shown a willingness to engage with fintech and crypto firms. However, they also emphasize robust risk management and compliance, especially concerning money laundering and financial stability. The SEC’s classification of XRP would undoubtedly be a significant factor in their assessment. The path to obtaining a banking license is notoriously long and arduous, requiring extensive documentation, rigorous background checks, and a clear demonstration of financial stability and robust compliance frameworks. For a company like Ripple, with its history of innovation and its ongoing legal challenges, this process will be under intense scrutiny from regulators and the public alike. The Dawn of Digital Asset Banking : Broader Implications Ripple’s move is not an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger trend where digital asset companies are increasingly seeking to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto economy. If successful, Ripple could set a powerful precedent for other major players in the crypto space. What Does This Mean for the Wider Crypto Industry? The success or failure of Ripple’s banking license application will send ripples (pun intended) across the entire digital asset ecosystem: Legitimization of Crypto: A major crypto company securing a banking license would be a huge step towards legitimizing digital assets in the eyes of mainstream finance and the general public. It would signal that crypto is maturing and becoming a reliable part of the global financial system. Increased Institutional Adoption: Banks and financial institutions are often hesitant to engage with crypto due to regulatory uncertainty. If a company like Ripple can operate as a regulated bank, it could pave the way for more traditional players to enter the digital asset space, fostering greater institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Push for Regulatory Clarity: This move could accelerate the need for clearer and more comprehensive federal regulations for digital assets in the US. As more companies seek to operate within traditional financial structures, regulators will be compelled to provide definitive guidelines. Innovation in Financial Services: A licensed Ripple could combine the efficiency and speed of blockchain technology with the trust and security of traditional banking. This could lead to innovative financial products and services that leverage the best of both worlds, potentially disrupting traditional banking models. This development underscores a growing understanding that for cryptocurrencies to achieve their full potential, they must integrate seamlessly with existing financial infrastructures, rather than operating in isolation. The pursuit of a financial services license by crypto firms highlights a maturation of the industry, moving beyond speculative trading to providing core financial services. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For Next For investors, industry watchers, and anyone interested in the future of finance, Ripple’s banking license application is a story to follow closely. Here are some key aspects to monitor: Regulatory Response: The reactions and requirements from the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and other relevant bodies will be crucial. Their feedback will indicate the feasibility and potential timeline for such an approval. Legal Developments: The ongoing SEC lawsuit will remain a significant factor. Any definitive ruling on XRP’s status could either streamline or complicate the banking license process. Market Reaction: While immediate price movements for XRP might be speculative, the long-term implications of a successful license approval could be profound for its utility and adoption. Competitor Moves: Observe how other major crypto players react. Will they follow suit in seeking similar licenses, or will they pursue different strategies for regulatory integration? This application is not just about Ripple; it’s about setting a precedent for how digital assets will be integrated into the mainstream financial system. It challenges the existing paradigms and forces regulators to adapt to the rapidly evolving technological landscape. Conclusion: A New Era for US Crypto Banking ? Ripple’s reported application for a US banking license represents a monumental step towards legitimizing and integrating digital assets into the traditional financial system. It’s a clear signal of Ripple’s long-term vision to become a foundational pillar of global finance, not just a disruptor. While the road ahead is undoubtedly long and fraught with regulatory complexities, including the ongoing challenges related to XRP regulation , the potential rewards are immense. This move could usher in a new era of digital asset banking , offering unprecedented levels of trust, efficiency, and innovation. It forces a critical conversation about how traditional financial frameworks can adapt to blockchain technology, ultimately benefiting consumers and businesses worldwide. The outcome of this application will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of cryptocurrencies and their role in the global economy.

Unveiled at the eighth Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes, France, the ECF operates independently from the Ethereum Foundation. According to Cole, the ETH Foundation has increasingly sidelined ETH’s value in favor of ecosystem development. “We are the Ethereum Community Foundation. We say what the [Ethereum Foundation] can’t, we do what the [Ethereum Foundation] won’t,” Cole declared during his presentation. Zak Cole’s ECF rejects VC-backed tokens in push for Ethereum monetary reform The ECF plans to fund infrastructure projects that grow the Ethereum ecosystem and bolster ETH’s price. Grant recipients must build tokenless, immutable applications that use Ethereum’s mainnet as the settlement layer, thereby contributing to ETH burn through transaction fees. Source: Ethereum Community Foundation Eligible projects must also support public goods and scale ETH without introducing new tokens or relying on venture capital. “ETH’s price is a direct function of its security,” Cole wrote in an X post, underscoring the foundation’s vision for a stronger monetary foundation for the token. The first grantee, Ethereum Validator Association (EVA), will give validators a greater role in shaping ETH’s monetary direction by prioritizing EIP development and client performance. Cole said the EVA introduces validator representation, noting it will empower high-performing clients. Cole also criticized the Foundation for backing projects like Uniswap, Optimism, and Ethereum Name Service, which later launched venture capital-backed tokens. He said publicly funded projects should remain public and benefit those who have paid for them. He further raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, citing Offchain Labs’ ownership in Prysmatic Labs—developers of Prysm, ETH’s second-largest consensus client. As of press time, the Foundation has not responded to a request for comment. Ethereum developer launches ECF to target $10K ETH as ETF inflows hit $260M ETH price predictions are once again dominating crypto conversations, with analysts forecasting a possible rally to $10,000 by early 2026. Cole’s mission to restore ETH’s monetary status coincides with growing institutional interest, which may already align with his vision. This renewed optimism comes as Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a combined $260 million inflows last week — a strong signal of growing institutional appetite for ETH. Adding fuel to the fire, market intelligence reveals a surge in interest surrounding a new altcoin following a wallet reveal tied to the project. The token, slated for launch in Q3, has attracted attention from “smart money,” with on-chain activity spiking sharply in response. Blockchain data shows a marked increase in ETH’s network demand since the wallet’s unveiling, with daily active addresses and transaction volumes ticking upward. Analysts leveraging Fibonacci retracement models suggest a possible breakout scenario, projecting a price range of $10,000 to $12,000 by early 2026, provided ETH can overcome critical resistance levels. More cautious forecasters maintain that while ETH may eventually breach $10,000, such a move is more likely in the post-2026 horizon, contingent on broader market cycles and macroeconomic tailwinds. ETH technicals and fundamentals align for a bullish setup Currently trading at $2,599.98, ETH is holding firm amid a consolidation pattern just below a descending resistance trendline. June’s close near $2,470 has formed a base for what some analysts interpret as a Wyckoff accumulation phase — a bullish technical setup that could precede a major breakout. The narrative is further supported by improving fundamentals: institutional wallets have quietly accumulated more ETH, and speculation surrounding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs has led to renewed retail and institutional interest. DeFi activity, boosted by ETH’s upcoming sharding upgrade, is also pivotal in building long-term bullish sentiment. Some ETH price models call for a medium-term move toward $3,400, suggesting bulls remain in the market.

Bitcoin surged past $109,500 late in the day, fueling gains in Ethereum, which jumped 6%, while Dogecoin and Cardano climbed more than 7%. Although Bitcoin briefly pulled back by about $1,000 early Thursday, it quickly recovered to retest the highs seen in early June. Market participants are now watching whether the cryptocurrency can challenge or surpass its all-time high near $112,000, set in late May. Risk appetite remains elevated across global markets, adding to the bullish setup. However, attention is turning to the upcoming US jobs report due later Thursday. The data could either reinforce the rally or act as a roadblock, depending on its implications for Federal Reserve policy and broader risk sentiment. The bullish momentum is also seen in the early-stage project Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale has seen continued momentum from investors. Bitcoin to hit $200K? Standard Chartered has reaffirmed its bullish stance on Bitcoin, projecting the cryptocurrency will climb to $135,000 by the end of the third quarter and surpass $200,000 by the end of 2025. In a research note published Wednesday, the bank cited accelerating institutional demand—particularly from ETFs and corporate treasury allocations—as the key catalyst for the ongoing rally. The forecast comes from Geoff Kendrick, head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, who has maintained a consistently optimistic outlook on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Kendrick wrote that the underlying drivers of Bitcoin’s market performance have shifted meaningfully, moving away from traditional halving-cycle dynamics. Earlier in the week, analysts at Bitwise also reiterated their bullish call for Bitcoin to reach $200,000 by year-end , citing surging institutional interest and a supportive regulatory backdrop. Bitcoin Pepe presale remains strong A renewed rally in Bitcoin, fueled by accelerating institutional demand, is once again spilling over into the broader crypto market, reviving speculative appetite across altcoins and meme tokens. One of the standout beneficiaries of this rotation is Bitcoin Pepe, which has positioned itself at the confluence of meme coin appeal and Layer 2 infrastructure innovation. Marketed as the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe aims to offer scalability and speed akin to Solana while anchored to Bitcoin’s base-layer security. This blend of cultural relevance and technical substance is helping the project differentiate itself in a crowded field of speculative assets. The team has also secured strategic partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, initiatives that aim to extend Bitcoin Pepe ’s ecosystem, create broader cross-platform integrations, and move the token beyond pure speculation into functional utility. With the presale now having raised over $16 million, investor interest appears to be gaining traction. A final listing announcement is expected on July 31, which could serve as a key catalyst heading into the final phase of the token’s launch.

Grayscale, a prominent digital asset manager, had seemingly cleared a major hurdle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). The initial nod to convert GDLC into a suite of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) covering Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) sent ripples of excitement through the market. However, just as quickly as the good news emerged, a swift and unexpected stay order from the SEC slammed the brakes on the conversion. This sudden turn of events, particularly concerning the Grayscale GDLC ETF , has left many wondering: what exactly happened, and what does it mean for the future of digital asset investments? So, What Exactly Just Happened with the Grayscale GDLC ETF? For those closely following the digital asset space, Grayscale’s efforts to convert its existing trusts into spot ETFs are well-known. Their landmark victory against the SEC last year, which paved the way for the spot Bitcoin ETFs, set a precedent. The approval for GDLC to transform into ETFs was seen as a natural progression, a testament to the growing maturity and acceptance of a broader range of cryptocurrencies by institutional bodies. The GDLC fund, a diversified portfolio of large-cap digital assets, was poised to offer investors a regulated, easily accessible way to gain exposure to a basket of leading cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. The initial approval signaled a potential paradigm shift, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to embrace other significant altcoins. But the celebration was short-lived. A stay order, essentially a temporary halt, was issued by the SEC, putting the conversion process on hold. This means that while the intent to approve was there, the actual execution is now delayed, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. It’s a classic case of ‘one step forward, two steps back’ in the often-turbulent world of crypto regulation. Why is the SEC Throwing a Wrench in the Works? Understanding the SEC ETF Delay The immediate question on everyone’s mind is, of course, ‘Why?’ The SEC’s actions are often shrouded in regulatory jargon, but insights from industry analysts provide some clarity. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed to a few potential reasons behind the SEC ETF delay : Broader Standard Setting: The SEC might be aiming to establish a comprehensive framework or set clear standards for all digital asset ETFs, rather than approving them on a piecemeal basis. This suggests a more cautious and holistic approach to integrating crypto products into traditional finance. Unresolved Issues with GDLC’s Structure: Despite the initial approval, there might be lingering structural or operational concerns specific to the GDLC fund that the SEC wishes to address before allowing its conversion. This could relate to custody, valuation, or other technical aspects. Another Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, offered a slightly different perspective, suggesting the delay could be more directly related to establishing robust listing standards for Altcoin ETFs . While Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained some regulatory footing, the path for other altcoins is far less clear. The SEC might be grappling with how to ensure market integrity, investor protection, and surveillance capabilities for a wider array of digital assets. This regulatory pause highlights the SEC’s ongoing struggle to balance innovation with its mandate to protect investors. It’s a complex dance between allowing new financial products and ensuring they adhere to stringent regulatory requirements. Are Altcoin ETFs Now on Shaky Ground? What the Delay Implies The GDLC fund’s diverse holdings make this delay particularly impactful for the broader altcoin market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant progress in their ETF journey, the path for XRP, Solana, and Cardano has always been less certain due to various regulatory classifications and market structures. The SEC’s stay order on GDLC’s conversion could be a signal of increased scrutiny for any future Altcoin ETFs . What does this mean for investors and issuers hoping for a wave of altcoin-specific ETFs? Increased Scrutiny: Expect the SEC to apply even more rigorous standards to altcoin-focused products. This could involve deeper dives into market manipulation risks, liquidity, and the underlying technology of each asset. Slower Pace of Approvals: The dream of a rapid succession of altcoin spot ETFs might be put on hold. The SEC appears to be taking a deliberate, cautious approach, prioritizing regulatory clarity over speed. Focus on Surveillance Sharing Agreements: A key hurdle for spot ETFs has been the requirement for robust surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size. For altcoins, identifying such markets and establishing these agreements can be more challenging than for Bitcoin or Ethereum. This delay doesn’t necessarily spell the end for altcoin ETFs, but it certainly suggests a more challenging and protracted journey than some might have anticipated. It underscores the need for clearer regulatory guidelines for these assets. Beyond Bitcoin: The Grand Vision for Digital Asset ETFs The broader context of this delay is the evolving landscape of Digital Asset ETFs . The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a monumental achievement, opening the floodgates for institutional capital and mainstream investors. It validated Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. The vision, however, extends far beyond Bitcoin. Industry players envision a future where various digital assets, from large-cap altcoins to potentially even tokenized real-world assets, are accessible through regulated ETF structures. These products offer: Benefits of Digital Asset ETFs: Accessibility: Allows traditional investors to gain exposure to crypto without managing private keys or navigating complex exchanges. Liquidity: Traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying/selling. Regulation: Provides a layer of investor protection and oversight that direct crypto investments often lack. Diversification: Enables easy diversification into a basket of digital assets through a single product, like the GDLC. However, the SEC’s cautious approach, as seen with the GDLC delay, highlights the inherent challenges. The lack of a clear regulatory framework for many digital assets, concerns over market manipulation, and the unique characteristics of blockchain technology all contribute to the complexities faced by regulators. What’s Next for Crypto ETF Approval? Navigating the Regulatory Maze The road to full Crypto ETF approval for a wide range of assets remains a winding one. The Grayscale GDLC delay serves as a stark reminder that even after initial positive signals, regulatory hurdles can emerge unexpectedly. What steps might be crucial for the industry and regulators moving forward? Key Considerations for Future Approvals: Regulatory Clarity: The industry desperately needs clear, consistent guidelines on how various digital assets are classified and regulated. This includes clarity on whether an asset is a security, commodity, or something else entirely. Market Surveillance: Establishing robust surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated spot markets is paramount. This helps the SEC ensure that the underlying markets are not susceptible to fraud and manipulation. Investor Education: Both regulators and issuers need to prioritize educating investors about the risks and rewards associated with digital asset ETFs. Dialogue and Collaboration: Continued open dialogue between industry participants, regulators, and policymakers is essential to finding common ground and fostering innovation responsibly. While the delay is undoubtedly frustrating for Grayscale and investors, it also provides an opportunity for the SEC to refine its approach and for the industry to address any lingering concerns. The ultimate goal is to create a secure and transparent environment for digital asset investments within the traditional financial system. Conclusion: A Pause, Not a Halt, in the Crypto ETF Journey The SEC’s stay order on the Grayscale GDLC ETF conversion is a significant development, underscoring the complexities and cautious approach regulators are taking towards digital assets beyond Bitcoin. It highlights the ongoing efforts to establish clear standards for Digital Asset ETFs and address specific concerns related to Altcoin ETFs . While the immediate impact is a delay in offering a diversified basket of crypto ETFs, it doesn’t necessarily signal a complete halt to future Crypto ETF approval . Instead, it serves as a powerful reminder that the regulatory landscape is still evolving, and patience, coupled with persistent advocacy and clear communication, will be key for the crypto industry’s continued integration into mainstream finance. The journey towards comprehensive crypto adoption through regulated products is undoubtedly long, but each step, even a delayed one, contributes to building a more robust and understood ecosystem.

The 219-213 vote on the House “rule,” a procedural motion that opens the floor for amendments and final passage, was much to the relief of Speaker Mike Johnson, who spent the better part of Wednesday convincing GOP policymakers on the fence to vote yes. The House originally passed the legislation in May, then underwent several changes in the Senate. It now includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, increases in military and border security spending, and reductions to Medicaid and food assistance programs. House GOP unites after overnight talks House Republicans, many of whom stayed through the night, managed to coalesce after days of internal strife. GOP leaders were afraid of going through the marathon witnessed in the Senate earlier this week, where the bill passed by a single vote, cast by Vice President JD Vance. Senate’s revisions on the bill added more tax reductions and reduced cuts to social programs. Fiscal conservatives in the House argued that the provisions could add more figures on the national debt, while moderates worried about how slashing Medicaid benefits could affect them politically. Speaker Johnson held several meetings throughout Wednesday and into the early hours of Thursday to garner enough support against the liberals. “It’s been a good day, we’re in a good place right now,” Johnson said after the vote. He refuted every claim that political deals were made to win over holdouts, insisting that lawmakers simply “needed time to understand the bill’s latest provisions.” Midday Wednesday, President Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to push Right-wing aligned lawmakers to unite and move his administration’s bill to a final vote. “ It looks like the House is ready to vote tonight. We had GREAT conversations all day, and the Republican House Majority is UNITED, for the Good of our Country, delivering the Biggest Tax Cuts in History and MASSIVE Growth ,” Trump posted. “ Let’s go, Republicans, and everyone else. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! ” Members of the House Freedom Caucus were initially reluctant to vote, but after they supposedly talked to the POTUS, all was well in the GOP house. “FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!” he wrote later in the night. Fiscally conservative Republicans yield to President Trump Towards the vote, fiscal hawks from the House Freedom Caucus were against what they viewed as “excessive spending,” unsure of how the bill would help solve the issue of a ballooning US deficit. “ The Senate doesn’t get to be the final say on everything ,” said Representative Chip Roy of Texas and Freedom Caucus member. On Wednesday morning, Roy told his colleagues that enough Republicans wanted to reopen the bill and rework it, even if it meant delaying the July 4 recess. By evening, however, Roy voted in favor of bringing the bill to the floor. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania was the only Republican to vote against the procedural motion. House Democrats, though unable to win in the vote, held a press conference on the Capitol steps Wednesday, accusing Republicans of bending to Trump’s will. “ When we say the Republican Party has turned into a cult, this is what we mean ,” said Representative Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island. “ Our Republican colleagues are pushing a bill that would throw their constituents under the bus … all because Donald Trump wants a bill signing photo-op by the Fourth of July. ” Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the House Minority Whip, called out GOP Representative David Valadao of California. She asked how he could support the bill, given how opposed he was to deep cuts to Medicaid, a program his constituents rely on. Even with his publicly stated reservations, Valadao voted to advance the bill. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate.

The key level to watch in July is $0.60 . If ADA holds and reclaims this level, it could trigger a move back toward the upper boundary of its falling wedge pattern. A breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.74 , and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 in the long term. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55 , with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40 .

Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF, which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high, there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

LILPEPE has already raised over $2.5 million by Stage 3 of its presale, which sold out faster than expected. Now in Stage 4, tokens are priced at just $0.0013, and over $100,000 has poured in within the first 15 hours. This early-stage excitement signals intense investor demand for what could be the most viral meme coin of 2025. The LILPEPE story is anything but boring. Its roadmap humorously positions the project as still in its “pregnancy stage,” being “cooked in the cryptowomb with Mumma Pepe.” While this light-hearted branding brings the meme magic to life, the fundamentals are no joke. With no taxes, no rug pulls, and a laser focus on decentralization, LILPEPE is checking all the boxes that seasoned crypto investors demand in a post-2021 world. LILPEPE’s team knows how to build hype. They’re running a massive community giveaway where 10 lucky winners will each bag $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. The campaign has already received over 12,000 entries. The project has plans to list on two top-tier centralized exchanges (CEXs) immediately after the presale. It is reportedly in advanced talks to list on the world’s largest crypto exchange. These listings could serve as catalysts for a significant post-launch rally, especially when combined with its loyal and vocal community base. With a still-low entry price, an energized community, and a roadmap geared for viral growth, Little Pepe could easily outshine its predecessors. Analysts suggest a 50x return is realistic, especially if meme coin sentiment returns in full force in 2025. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Proven Leader Eyeing a Second Rally Trading between $0.00000929 and $0.000013, with a market cap ranging from $3.87 billion to $5.67 billion, PEPE has already shown its explosive power. Yet, technical analysis suggests its journey is far from over. PEPE is currently consolidating above critical support zones at $0.0000107–$0.0000114. If the price breaks above $0.000012, it may initiate a surge to $0.0005, which would give early buyers a chance to make 25 to 50 times their investment. The average daily trading volume of $736 million to $1.4 billion indicates a significant amount of liquidity and ongoing investor interest. SPX6900 (SPX): The DeFi-Fueled Meme with Massive Ambitions Priced between $1.69 and $1.73, with a market cap of $1.58 billion, SPX is consolidating after a modest 11.7% pullback. A 14-day RSI of 63.34–64.88 indicates healthy momentum. Analysts forecast a year-end price target of $55, which could represent returns of 25 to 30 times the current level. With projections showing the 50-day and 200-day SMAs rising steadily, SPX is not just a meme—it’s a momentum machine. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Underdog Gearing Up for a Comeback Currently trading at $0.76–$0.80, with a market cap of around $763 million to $800 million, WIF is bouncing within a range of $0.65–$1.09. The 14-day RSI of 45.60–65 suggests neutral to bullish conditions, while trading volumes of $265 million–$313 million daily confirm vigorous market activity. Although WIF saw a 32.59% drop over the past month, it only takes one meme-fueled spark to reignite interest. A successful breakout above $1.5 could send WIF on a 32x rally. Conclusion While meme coins are often perceived as speculative, the data and narratives behind Little Pepe (LILPEPE), PEPE, SPX, and WIF indicate that the sector is maturing, and profits are indeed very real for early believers. With a presale that’s flying off the shelves, strategic exchange listings on the horizon, and a campaign that’s rallying thousands, LILPEPE could easily lead the meme coin revolution in 2025.

This isn’t just a win; it’s a profound statement about the shifting landscape of investment and the undeniable ascent of digital assets. For anyone tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market, this news is a powerful indicator of a new era of institutional interest and investor confidence in Bitcoin. How could a fund nearly nine times smaller in assets under management generate more income than its colossal counterpart? Let’s dive into this captivating financial phenomenon. The Astonishing Ascent of BlackRock Bitcoin ETF: A Revenue Revolution It’s a tale of two titans, but with an unexpected twist. On one side, we have BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), a behemoth with a staggering amount of assets under management, representing a broad swathe of the American economy. On the other, the relatively nascent BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), launched just in January 2024. Yet, despite IVV being nearly nine times larger in assets, IBIT has managed to outshine it where it counts for the fund manager: annual fee revenue. According to Watcher Guru, IBIT, with its 0.25% expense ratio, has generated an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees. Compare this to IVV’s $187.1 million. This razor-thin difference, in favor of IBIT, speaks volumes. It’s a testament not just to the product’s design but to the underlying demand for its core asset – Bitcoin. This remarkable feat underscores the immense profitability potential when a new asset class meets enthusiastic investor adoption, even if the asset base is comparatively smaller. The higher expense ratio, though seemingly modest, compounds significantly when applied to consistent, robust inflows. What Drives IBIT’s Unprecedented Performance? The success of IBIT is not a mere fluke; it’s a reflection of several converging factors that highlight its impressive IBIT performance. The primary driver is unequivocally strong investor demand for Bitcoin exposure through a regulated, accessible vehicle. Here’s a breakdown: Ease of Access: For years, investing in Bitcoin directly presented hurdles for many traditional investors, including concerns about custody, security, and navigating unfamiliar crypto exchanges. ETFs like IBIT remove these barriers, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through their existing brokerage accounts, just like buying stocks or traditional ETFs. Institutional Trust: BlackRock, as the world’s largest asset manager, brings an unparalleled level of credibility and trust. Its entry into the Bitcoin ETF space signaled to many institutional and retail investors that Bitcoin was maturing as an asset class, worthy of serious consideration. Consistent Inflows: Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has seen inflows in 17 of the past 18 months. This consistent accumulation of capital indicates sustained investor interest and confidence, rather than just a fleeting speculative wave. These continuous investments are the lifeblood of an ETF’s revenue generation, directly contributing to its fee income. Market Timing: The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs coincided with a renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market, fueled by anticipation of Bitcoin’s halving event and growing macroeconomic stability. This favorable market environment provided a fertile ground for IBIT’s rapid growth. Unlocking Bitcoin Exposure: A New Era for Investors For a long time, gaining Bitcoin exposure was a niche activity, largely confined to crypto-native platforms or complex direct purchases. The advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly one backed by a financial titan like BlackRock, has democratized access to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This is a game-changer for several reasons: Diversification Made Easy: Traditional portfolios often seek diversification across various asset classes. Now, with a regulated ETF, investors can easily add Bitcoin to their holdings without the operational complexities of direct crypto ownership. Mainstream Integration: Bitcoin is no longer an exotic, fringe asset. Its inclusion in major investment platforms via ETFs signifies its integration into mainstream finance, making it more palatable for conservative investors and financial advisors. Liquidity and Transparency: ETFs offer superior liquidity compared to direct crypto holdings for many investors, allowing for easier buying and selling. They also provide a layer of transparency and regulatory oversight that can be reassuring. This ease of access is crucial for the continuous flow of capital into products like IBIT, directly impacting the impressive ETF fee revenue we are observing. Beyond AUM: The Significance of ETF Fee Revenue While Assets Under Management (AUM) is often the headline metric for funds, the fee revenue generated by an ETF is arguably more telling about its profitability and the value it brings to the fund manager. The fact that IBIT, with a fraction of IVV’s AUM, can generate comparable fee revenue is a powerful statement. This highlights: High Demand for Specific Exposure: Investors are willing to pay a slightly higher expense ratio for direct, regulated exposure to a high-growth, high-volatility asset like Bitcoin, rather than settling for lower-fee, broader market exposure. Profitability of Niche Markets: Even within a large fund family, a highly sought-after, specialized product can be a significant profit driver, proving that sometimes, quality of demand can outweigh sheer quantity of assets. Future of Fund Management: This trend suggests that asset managers will increasingly look to offer specialized ETFs for emerging asset classes, understanding that even with lower AUM initially, the right product with strong demand can yield substantial returns. This revenue milestone is not just about BlackRock; it’s a bellwether for the entire asset management industry, signaling where future growth and profitability might lie. Paving the Way: Institutional Adoption and Future Prospects The success of IBIT is a clear indicator of growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. When a player as significant as BlackRock sees such a positive response to its crypto-backed product, it sends a powerful message across the financial landscape. What does this mean for the future? Increased Competition: Other asset managers are likely to double down on their efforts to launch or promote their own crypto-related investment products, leading to more options and potentially lower fees for investors in the long run. Validation of Bitcoin: This level of success from a traditional finance giant further validates Bitcoin as a legitimate and investable asset class, moving it beyond speculative circles into mainstream investment portfolios. Regulatory Clarity: The operational success of these ETFs may encourage regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks for digital assets, fostering a more mature and stable market environment. Innovation in Financial Products: We might see a proliferation of more sophisticated crypto-backed financial products, including options, futures, and even leveraged ETFs, as the market matures and investor appetite grows. The trajectory of IBIT, from its rapid launch to its astonishing revenue generation, serves as a compelling case study for the future of finance, firmly cementing Bitcoin’s place within the institutional investment landscape. What Does This Mean for You, the Investor? The triumph of IBIT in fee revenue offers several actionable insights for both seasoned and novice investors: Consider Diversification: If you haven’t already, explore how a small allocation to Bitcoin via a regulated ETF might fit into your diversified portfolio, considering its potential for growth and its low correlation with traditional assets at times. Evaluate Expense Ratios: While IBIT’s expense ratio is higher than IVV’s, its performance illustrates that sometimes, a slightly higher fee is justified by access to unique market opportunities and strong underlying asset performance. Always weigh the fee against the value and access provided. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep abreast of new product launches, regulatory changes, and market trends to make informed decisions. Understand Risk: While ETFs mitigate some risks associated with direct crypto ownership, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Invest only what you can afford to lose and align your investments with your risk tolerance. A New Dawn for Digital Assets BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF achieving higher annual fee revenue than its venerable S&P 500 counterpart is more than just a financial statistic; it’s a seismic shift. It signifies the mainstreaming of Bitcoin, the power of institutional trust, and the insatiable investor appetite for digital asset exposure. This remarkable feat underscores a future where digital assets play an increasingly prominent role in diversified investment portfolios, challenging traditional financial paradigms and opening up unprecedented opportunities. The success of IBIT is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its undeniable place in the future of finance.

According to Finbold’s H1 2025 Crypto Market Report , the asset manager’s holdings surged from $54.77 billion on January 1 to $78.67 billion by June 30, a 30.38% gain. Bitcoin accounted for the bulk of the growth. BlackRock’s BTC holdings jumped from $51.16 billion to $74.47 billion, an increase of $23.3 billion, or 31.3%. Ethereum also contributed meaningfully, rising from $3.53 billion to $4.21 billion, up $678.95 million or 16.15%. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); This sharp increase stems from inflows into BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs, which began trading earlier this year. To back these products with real assets, BlackRock made substantial on-chain purchases of BTC and ETH throughout the first half of 2025. BlackRock’s Q1 crypto holdings By the end of Q1 2025, BlackRock held approximately 575,860 BTC and 1.17 million ETH, with a total crypto portfolio value of $49.85 billion. By June 30, its holdings had surged to $74.47 billion in BTC and $4.21 billion in ETH, pushing the portfolio’s total to $78.67 billion. That marks a $28.82 billion increase from Q1 to Q2 and a $23.91 billion gain across the first half of the year. While the $23.91 billion surge is publicly visible through on-chain data, it’s important to note that these figures reflect only the wallets linked to ETF custody.

In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions. Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC . Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . The sentiment has changed, and with market-wide optimism in early July, as the short-term EMA is breached and the XRP price is inching closer to retest the falling channel’s upper border aligned with a supply block near the key $2.40 resistance. This time, a break of the upper border could trigger a rally toward $2.80 in the short term, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. The first week of July’s momentum is backed by growing whale transaction count (>100K USD), rising exchange outflow, and spiked spot volume. It indicates a sustained short-term rally. In case, if no strong catalyst emerges to push beyond the pattern’s upper border and the $2.40 supply block, a flash crash could occur, pushing XRP’s price down. If selling pressure were to resume the $2.10 support, which aligns with the 200-day EMA is crucial, as losing grip at this mark could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years.

Currently in Phase 5 of its presale and trading at just $0.03, this token has captured more than $11.50 million in funding and is gaining serious traction for its dual lending system, high-utility token mechanics, and real income-generating potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) P2P and P2C Models Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing a hybrid decentralized lending structure combining both P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) models. This dual system will give users the flexibility to choose how they lend or borrow, depending on their strategy and risk preferences. In P2C, lenders will deposit assets like USDT, DAI, or ETH into a smart contract pool and earn variable interest. Borrowers will secure loans using overcollateralized deposits, unlocking liquidity without having to sell their crypto. P2P, on the other hand, will give users the freedom to directly negotiate terms—including interest rates and repayment windows—based on mutual agreement. This will even allow lending and borrowing of niche assets like SHIB or DOGE, offering a wider range of use cases for communities looking to do more than just hold their tokens. In both models, borrowers will retain exposure to their assets while accessing liquidity, and lenders will receive mtTokens in return for their deposits. These mtTokens will represent both the principal and the real-time compounding interest earned from lending activities. For example, a $5,000 deposit in DAI earning 12% APY (depending on pool utilization) will return mtDAI tokens, which grow in redeemable value over time—resulting in $600 in passive income over one year. These mtTokens will also be eligible for staking in designated contracts, unlocking access to additional rewards distributed through the platform’s revenue-backed buyback system. Built for Sustainable Utility, Supported by Community and Incentives Unlike meme coins and hype-driven assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering real token utility that aligns long-term platform growth with holder value. A portion of protocol revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute them to users staking mtTokens. This model will build lasting demand while directly rewarding contributors to the ecosystem’s health. In parallel with its growing DeFi infrastructure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a high-impact $100,000 giveaway , with ten lucky winners set to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each. This campaign is drawing thousands of new users and accelerating wallet growth, which has already crossed 12,700 holders during the presale. The project’s traction across social media and Telegram reflects genuine retail interest backed by growing whale activity. As of now, over 50% of Phase 5 tokens have been claimed at the $0.03 level, and the next price tier is approaching. For early buyers, this could be the final opportunity to lock in maximum upside before the next increase. With a realistic 200% price surge projected based on current demand, presale momentum, and an actively progressing roadmap, investors are beginning to move capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most promising DeFi plays of the year. One such example is a retail investor who recently exited a long-held position in a popular memecoin, frustrated by months of sideways action and zero yield. They redirected $1,000 into MUTM at the Phase 5 price of $0.03, securing 33,333 tokens ahead of the upcoming price jump to $0.035. If the token reaches $0.09—a modest 200% increase from today’s level—that same position would grow to $3,000, representing a 3x gain. Unlike meme tokens that rely on virality and speculation, MUTM’s price movement is fueled by actual protocol mechanics: lending demand, stablecoin usage, and mtToken staking cycles. With its hybrid lending model, growing treasury, overcollateralized stablecoin in development, and ongoing presale success, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most promising DeFi plays of the summer. The clock is ticking on the $0.03 entry point—investors waiting too long may end up watching this opportunity from the sidelines.

Through its strategic acquisition of Standard Custody, Ripple has formally applied for a U.S. Federal Reserve master account. This audacious bid, alongside an application for an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) trust charter, signals Ripple’s unwavering commitment to establishing itself as a legitimate and compliant player within the global financial framework. But what exactly does a Federal Reserve master account entail, and why is Ripple’s pursuit of it such a game-changer for the entire crypto industry? What is a Ripple Fed Master Account and Why Does it Matter? For most financial institutions, direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payment systems – like Fedwire and FedNow – is the bedrock of their operations. A Federal Reserve master account provides this direct access, allowing banks to settle transactions instantly, hold balances directly with the Fed, and participate fully in the nation’s payment infrastructure without needing an intermediary bank. Traditionally, non-bank financial institutions, including most crypto firms, have been reliant on commercial banks to access these services, adding layers of cost, delay, and potential points of failure. Consider the implications: Direct Settlement: Ripple could potentially settle transactions directly with other financial institutions holding master accounts, bypassing commercial banks. Reduced Costs: Eliminating intermediaries can significantly cut down transaction fees and operational overhead. Increased Efficiency: Faster settlement times, especially for cross-border payments, are a core benefit. Enhanced Legitimacy: Holding a master account would confer a significant level of regulatory legitimacy and trust, crucial for the nascent crypto industry. While an OCC trust charter offers a regulated framework for digital asset custody and other services, a Fed master account elevates a firm to a different league, granting it direct access to the very heart of the U.S. financial system. This distinction is paramount, as it positions Ripple not just as a crypto company, but as a potential participant in the foundational infrastructure of global finance. The Strategic Role of Standard Custody in Ripple’s Vision Ripple’s application for a Federal Reserve master account is not a standalone effort; it’s intricately linked to its acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Co. Standard Custody is a regulated institutional-grade custodian for digital assets, holding a New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter. This acquisition was a strategic masterstroke by Ripple for several key reasons: Regulatory Foundation: Standard Custody already operates under a robust regulatory framework, providing Ripple with a pre-existing compliant entity. This significantly streamlines the application process for further regulatory approvals. Expertise and Infrastructure: The acquisition brings in established infrastructure and expertise in secure digital asset custody, a critical component for any financial institution dealing with cryptocurrencies. Streamlined Applications: Leveraging Standard Custody’s existing licenses and operational compliance makes the applications for both the OCC trust charter and the Federal Reserve master account more compelling and easier to process. Eleanor Terrett, a prominent Fox Business journalist, first brought this development to light on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the dual applications. This move underscores Ripple’s long-term strategy to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset economy, using regulated entities like Standard Custody as their operational spearhead. Navigating the Complexities of XRP Regulatory Approval The path to obtaining a Federal Reserve master account for a crypto firm is anything but straightforward. The Federal Reserve has historically demonstrated significant caution, and often outright resistance, to granting direct access to cryptocurrency-focused entities. This reluctance stems from concerns about money laundering, financial stability risks, and the nascent nature of the digital asset industry. A crucial precedent in this ongoing debate is the high-profile lawsuit involving Custodia Bank. Custodia, a Wyoming-chartered special purpose depository institution (SPDI) focused on digital assets, has been engaged in a legal battle with the Federal Reserve over its own application for a master account. The Federal Reserve initially delayed and then denied Custodia’s application, citing various concerns, prompting Custodia to sue. The outcome of this lawsuit is closely watched by the entire crypto industry, as it will likely set a significant precedent for how the Fed approaches similar applications from other crypto-native firms. Ripple’s application will undoubtedly face intense scrutiny, mirroring the challenges Custodia has encountered. Regulators will assess factors such as: Regulatory Concern Ripple’s Potential Response Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Know Your Customer (KYC) Compliance Leveraging Standard Custody’s established compliance frameworks and robust internal controls. Systemic Risk to Financial Stability Highlighting XRP’s use case for efficient, low-cost payments and its potential to reduce rather than increase systemic risk. Cybersecurity and Operational Resilience Demonstrating advanced security protocols and resilient infrastructure through Standard Custody. Consumer Protection Adhering to strict consumer protection guidelines and transparent operations. Despite these hurdles, Ripple’s long-standing commitment to regulatory clarity, evidenced by its own protracted legal battles with the SEC, positions it uniquely to navigate these complexities. The company has consistently advocated for clear regulatory frameworks and has invested heavily in compliance. The Quest for Direct Federal Reserve Access : A Game Changer? If Ripple successfully secures a Federal Reserve master account, the implications could be transformative, not just for Ripple and XRP, but for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Direct access would enable Ripple to: Revolutionize Cross-Border Payments: By settling transactions directly with other financial institutions globally, Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which uses XRP for instant international transfers, could become even more efficient and cost-effective. Enhance Institutional Adoption: A master account would signal a significant vote of confidence from a top-tier regulator, potentially encouraging more traditional financial institutions to engage with Ripple’s technologies and XRP. Pave the Way for Others: A successful outcome for Ripple could establish a crucial precedent, potentially opening the door for other compliant crypto firms to gain similar access, fostering greater innovation and competition in financial services. Deepen Liquidity and Stability: Direct access could lead to greater liquidity for XRP and other digital assets, reducing volatility and enhancing their utility in real-world applications. This pursuit isn’t just about Ripple’s growth; it’s about validating the potential of digital assets to integrate seamlessly into existing financial infrastructure, moving beyond niche applications to become foundational elements of a modernized global payment system. The Future of Crypto Banking and Ripple’s Vision Ripple’s pursuit of a Federal Reserve master account is a bold statement about the future of crypto banking. It envisions a world where digital assets and blockchain technology are not just parallel systems but are deeply interwoven with traditional finance, offering superior efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity. This vision extends beyond just payments to potentially encompass other financial services like lending, trading, and asset management, all underpinned by compliant digital asset infrastructure. For investors and enthusiasts, Ripple’s progress in this area is a critical indicator of its long-term viability and potential for growth. While regulatory approvals are never guaranteed, each step towards greater integration with established financial systems adds to the legitimacy and potential utility of XRP and Ripple’s broader suite of solutions. Actionable Insights: Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on the Custodia Bank lawsuit and any announcements from the Federal Reserve regarding crypto firm access. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between various licenses and approvals (OCC charter vs. Fed master account) to grasp their true significance. Assess Long-Term Potential: Recognize that regulatory clarity and institutional integration are key drivers for the sustained growth and adoption of digital assets. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Digital Finance Ripple’s application for a Federal Reserve master account via Standard Custody represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital finance. It is a direct challenge to the traditional gatekeepers of the financial system, pushing for greater inclusion and efficiency through blockchain technology. While the path ahead is fraught with regulatory complexities and legal precedents, the potential rewards – a more streamlined, cost-effective, and globally interconnected financial system – are immense. The outcome of this application, and the broader regulatory landscape it navigates, will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of crypto banking for years to come, solidifying Ripple’s role as a trailblazer in this exciting new era.

What The Lawsuit Says The lawsuit, filed in Virginia’s Eastern District Court , claims that Strategy misled investors between April 30, 2024, and April 4, 2025. According to the law firm, Strategy gave the impression that its Bitcoin investments were highly profitable, while hiding key risks like price volatility and changes in accounting rules. Pomerantz says both Strategy and its CEO, Michael Saylor, focused on positive results like BTC Yield and BTC Gain but didn’t talk about the real dangers, including the chance of major losses. The lawsuit says the company left out important details that investors needed to fully understand the risks involved. New Accounting Rules Exposed $5.9B Loss One big point in this case is the Strategy’s change to new crypto accounting rules known as ASU 2023-08. This new rule means companies must show the real-time value of their Bitcoin holdings, not just the cost minus past drops. Earlier, Strategy only showed losses when Bitcoin fell in price, but did not show gains until coins were sold. Under the new rule, it became clear that Strategy faced an unrealized loss of $5.9 billion in early 2025. However, this news caused the stock to fall over 8% in a short time, shocking many investors. Overall Strategy Bitcoin Holding Strategy has been a major player in the crypto space since 2020 and holds over 597,000 Bitcoins worth around ($65.85 billion, more than any other public company. Its stock has grown over 204% in the past 1 year, inspiring other firms like Metaplanet to follow its strategy. Despite recent gains, including a 7.7% rise to $402.28, this lawsuit puts Strategy under serious pressure.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has soared to a notable 73, firmly entrenching itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This significant jump, a 10-point increase from the previous day, signals a palpable shift in the broader crypto market trends . But what does this elevated level of optimism truly signify for your investments and the future direction of digital assets? What Drives the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? For anyone navigating the often-volatile waters of cryptocurrencies, understanding the prevailing market sentiment is crucial. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, serves as a powerful barometer for this very purpose. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed,’ the index distills complex market dynamics into a single, digestible number. But how exactly does it arrive at this figure? It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of several key factors, each weighted differently to provide a holistic view: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volumes in a strong uptrend often indicate greedy behavior. Social Media (15%): The index sifts through various social media platforms, analyzing the number of posts and hashtags related to cryptocurrencies. A high volume of positive mentions can contribute to a ‘Greed’ reading. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component previously involved weekly polls to gauge the general sentiment of crypto investors. When active, it offered a direct insight into individual perspectives. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance often indicates a flight to safety (fear) or a belief in Bitcoin’s continued leadership (greed, if it’s leading an uptrend). Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries related to cryptocurrencies, particularly those indicative of fear or greed, this factor captures the public’s general interest and emotional state. The index’s rise to 73, therefore, isn’t arbitrary; it’s a calculated reflection of these combined forces pushing the market into a state of heightened optimism. Why the Sudden Surge in Market Sentiment? The recent 10-point jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73 isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal of shifting market sentiment . This significant uptick suggests a growing wave of confidence sweeping across the digital asset landscape. But what factors might be fueling this renewed optimism? While the index itself aggregates various data points, the underlying reasons often stem from a combination of on-chain activity, macroeconomic developments, and significant news events. For instance, positive developments around regulatory clarity, increasing institutional adoption, or even a sustained period of price stability can contribute to a more bullish outlook. When investors see consistent upward movement or resilience in the face of minor pullbacks, their apprehension often gives way to a desire to participate, pushing the needle further into the ‘Greed’ zone. This collective shift in perception is a powerful force, capable of creating self-fulfilling prophecies in the short term. Navigating the Greed Zone: Insights into Investor Psychology When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters the ‘Greed’ zone, particularly at levels like 73, it offers fascinating insights into collective investor psychology . On one hand, high greed can be a sign of a strong bull market, where prices are rising, and confidence is high. Investors might feel a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), leading to increased buying pressure and further price appreciation. This can be a lucrative period for those already holding assets. However, it’s also a double-edged sword. Extreme greed often precedes market corrections. When everyone is optimistic, and prices are consistently hitting new highs, the market can become overextended and susceptible to sudden downturns. The prevailing sentiment might overshadow fundamental analysis, leading to speculative bubbles. For the discerning investor, understanding this psychological dynamic is paramount. It’s a time to review risk management strategies, consider taking some profits, or at least exercise caution against impulsive decisions driven by euphoria. The goal isn’t to predict the top, but to be prepared for potential shifts when sentiment is running hot. The Crucial Influence of Bitcoin Price and Dominance It’s impossible to discuss the overall crypto market trends without acknowledging the pivotal role of Bitcoin price . As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the direction of the broader market. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects this influence, with Bitcoin’s volatility and market momentum being significant factors in its calculation. When Bitcoin experiences a strong upward trend, it naturally boosts overall market sentiment, pulling the index higher into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s value can quickly plunge the index into ‘Fear.’ Furthermore, Bitcoin dominance , which accounts for 10% of the index’s calculation, provides another layer of insight. A rising Bitcoin dominance during a market rally can indicate that investors are prioritizing Bitcoin as the primary asset for gains, potentially at the expense of altcoins. Conversely, if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, leading to a drop in its dominance, it might signal a broader speculative phase. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin’s price action and its market share is essential for interpreting the index’s signals accurately and understanding the underlying forces shaping the market. Actionable Insights: How to Leverage the Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s crucial to remember that it’s an indicator, not a crystal ball. Here are some actionable insights on how to use it effectively: Counter-Cyclical Thinking: Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ A high ‘Greed’ reading (like 73) might suggest it’s a good time to be cautious, perhaps even to trim positions, rather than blindly chasing pumps. Conversely, extreme ‘Fear’ can present buying opportunities. Combine with Other Analysis: Never rely solely on the index. Integrate it with fundamental analysis (project utility, team, roadmap), technical analysis (chart patterns, support/resistance levels), and macroeconomic factors (interest rates, inflation) to form a comprehensive view. Risk Management: High greed periods are prime times to reassess your portfolio’s risk exposure. Ensure you’re not overleveraged or investing more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or profit targets. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: The index is most useful for gauging short to medium-term market sentiment. Long-term investors might use it to identify opportune times for dollar-cost averaging, buying more during periods of extreme fear. Emotional Discipline: The index is a stark reminder of the emotional biases that drive markets. Use it to check your own emotions. Are you buying purely out of excitement (greed) or selling out of panic (fear)? Objectivity is key. Conclusion The ascent of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73, placing the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, is a compelling indicator of robust market sentiment and growing confidence among participants. While this elevated optimism reflects positive crypto market trends and the enduring influence of Bitcoin price , it also serves as a critical reminder for investors. Understanding the nuances of investor psychology is paramount; extreme greed, while exhilarating, often warrants a cautious approach. By leveraging the insights from this index in conjunction with sound financial principles and a disciplined strategy, market participants can better navigate the exciting yet unpredictable landscape of digital assets, making informed decisions rather than succumbing to emotional impulses. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always prioritize prudent risk management.

Bitcoin (BTC) and the market could move sideways or slightly more bearish between now and the Jackson Hole conference in August, Arthur Hayes wrote in a new blog post. Hayes stressed that US bonds should be bought instead and claimed that buying US government bonds was a mistake. Bitcoin (BTC) May Drop to These Levels! The famous name said that the US government's recent support for stablecoins is not to benefit fintech companies like Circle, but to strengthen large traditional banks and fill the treasury. At this point, Hayes said the U.S. Treasury Department needs new ways to sell trillions of dollars in bonds and replenish the U.S. Treasury (TGA) without causing interest rates to rise. This has led Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look for alternative buyers and stablecoins. However, according to Hayes, the US government's support for stablecoins is a huge liquidity game, which could negatively affect the Bitcoin price. Because the market is not interested in bonds at high prices, and this is pushing the US government towards stablecoins. At this point, according to Hayes, the issuance of stablecoins by US banks could provide a purchasing capacity of $6.8 trillion, and banks could convert their existing deposits into bond purchases. This could provide new liquidity to the market for the future and trigger an increase. However, Hayes said that by then, in the short term, Bitcoin could fall to the $90,000 to $95,000 range if the effort to refill the US Treasury and sell bonds negatively impacts USD liquidity. Arthur Hayes lastly stated that there is a risk that the US government's liquidity and stablecoin game could pull Bitcoin to the $90,000-$95,000 range, and that altcoins could also be negatively affected by this. At this point, Hayes stated that his company Maelstrom has sold all of its illiquid altcoin positions and is considering reducing its Bitcoin positions depending on market performance. *This is not investment advice.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an upward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has jumped to $0.604 in the last 24 hours. If the upward momentum continues, the SNX price might retest resistance at the $0.643 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $4.01 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is in a bullish trend, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting positive sentiment as the SNX price increased to $0.604, gaining 6.54% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.06 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2031. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $4.60, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $4.60 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and at the start of July, the token is trading near $0.57 as the current Synthetix sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-03 11:45:00

The allegations are tied to the $4.5 billion embezzlement conspiracy carried out against the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, known as the 1MDB scandal, which began back in 2009. Standard Chartered “emphatically rejected” the claims made in the new Singapore lawsuit, according to a new Reuters report . Liquidators from the financial services giant Kroll filed the suit, claiming that the British bank enabled the 1MDB fraud. Standard Chartered allegedly ignored red flags and processed more than 100 intrabank transfers between 2009 and 2013, which contributed to hiding the 1MDB funds, according to three companies in liquidation associated with the scandal. Explain the liquidators, “According to this lawsuit, the transfers demonstrate serious breaches and control failings which ultimately enabled the theft of public funds by people operating at the highest levels of the Malaysian government during that period.” Standard Chartered told Reuters any claims made by the companies were “without merit.” Earlier this year, former Goldman Sachs employee Tim Leissner was sentenced to two years behind bars for playing a part in the multibillion-dollar heist. Prosecutors say that Leissner and others who worked for the banking giant aided Malaysia in raising $6.5 billion for the nation’s investment fund through bond sales.

According to the July 2 release , the scam occurred in December 2024, when impersonators tricked a political donor into sending $250,300 in USDT ( USDT ) on Ethereum by posing as the co-chair of the Trump-Vance committee. The scammers used a lookalike email address to make the fraudulent request, swapping an “I” for a lowercase “L” in the email address to deceive the victim into thinking the request was legitimate. Thinking it was real, the donor fell for the scheme and sent the funds. Upon receipt, the scammers moved the assets through several wallets within hours. However, authorities traced the transactions and successfully recovered $40,300.

The latest case adds to Tether’s track record of working with law enforcement to freeze and recover illicit funds. In June, the DOJ credited the company for assisting in the takedown of a $225 million crypto pig-butchering scheme. The firm has also been repeatedly praised by multiple agencies for its swift action in freezing suspicious assets and supporting investigations. Meanwhile, rival stablecoin issuer Circle is facing scrutiny over its handling of similar abuse. Earlier this week, on-chain investigator ZachXBT accused the firm of turning a blind eye toward the growing use of its stablecoin USDC by North Korea-linked hackers and malicious actors ZachXBT raised questions over Circle’s compliance standards, stating that despite substantial wallet flows tied to sanctioned actors, it has failed to investigate or freeze the wallets involved.

Pepe (PEPE) – the third-biggest meme coin – is up 13% for the day, dogwifhat (WIF) has soared by 16%, while Bonk (BONK) has pumped by nearly 20%. BONK Price, Source: CoinGecko In fact, BONK is the best-performing top 100 cryptocurrency for the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization jumped above $1.3 billion, making it the 80th-largest in the entire market. The rebound has attracted attention from prominent analysts who think this upward trend might just be getting started. Bluntz – an X user with over 320,000 followers – predicted that BONK’s price could skyrocket by “at least” 100%-130%. MOODENG is Flying Even Higher The hippo-themed meme coin Moo Deng (MOODENG) has experienced a 43% price surge over the past day, and there is a compelling explanation behind it. MOODENG Price, Source: CoinGecko The asset caught the eye of the leading South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit, which listed the trading pairs MOODENG/USDT, MOODENG/KRW, and MOODENG/BTC. The company explained that it will support only deposits via the Solana network, while large deposits from unclear sources may require an explanation of fund origin. Upbit is undisputedly the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, and its backing often triggers a substantial pump for the involved assets due to factors like increased liquidity, improved accessibility, and a reputational boost. A month ago, the company listed the RVN/KRW trading pair, which was followed by a 75% price explosion for the underlying token. Prior to that, it embraced Pocket Network (POKT) and Livepeer (LPT), resulting in even greater gains.

Traders are heavily betting on July 25 XRP calls at $3 and $4, and a September $2.80 strike, reflecting optimism around a possible XRP spot ETF approval now seen as 95% likely, according to Bloomberg analysts. Ripple’s application for a U.S. national banking license further boosts market sentiment. Technically, the XRP/BTC pair has broken out of a bullish falling wedge pattern, signaling a potential trend reversal. Despite bearish SMA indicators, the breakout suggests renewed upward momentum for XRP in the short term. July 3, 2025 12:08:44 UTC Ripple’s RLUSD Gets Banking Boost as AMINA Integrates Stablecoin Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD , just got a major credibility boost. On July 2 , Switzerland’s AMINA Bank became the first fully regulated bank to support RLUSD, offering custody and trading for institutional clients. The announcement drove RLUSD’s 24-hour volume up 20% to $60 million , with its market cap hitting $469 million . Hours earlier, Ripple also filed for a U.S. banking charter , aiming to legally hold reserves and bypass state regulations. As the GENIUS Act tightens stablecoin oversight, Ripple’s move positions RLUSD as a serious competitor to USDC and USDT in regulated finance. July 3, 2025 12:05:00 UTC Ripple News LIVE: When Will XRP Price Reflect Real Demand? As Ripple expands its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors, real demand for XRP may soon overpower speculative bot activity. But for now, bots dominate, manipulating prices through spoofing, wash trades, and latency advantages. Only when utility meets transparency will XRP’s price reflect true investor interest instead of algorithmic games. July 3, 2025 12:04:15 UTC XRP Live News: Can Regulation Break the Bot Grip on XRP? The XRP market is dominated by fast-reacting bots using privileged APIs. But this may change. Regulatory frameworks like MiCA and crackdowns on exchange favoritism could level the field. Transparency from on-chain trading and the rise of decentralized order books may finally expose bot activity. Until then, the illusion continues. July 3, 2025 12:01:56 UTC Ripple News – How Bots Are Gaming the XRP Market Bots are controlling XRP’s price moves, leveraging VIP APIs to front-run trades, spoof orders, and execute arbitrage. They even trigger rises in unrelated coins to fake market-wide rallies. These tactics trick retail traders and create artificial volume. Without regulation or transparency, price action around XRP will remain largely manipulated by unseen code, not market logic. July 3, 2025 11:59:48 UTC XRP Price USD Surges: Real Demand or Bot Illusion? XRP often pumps after big news, but oddly, unrelated coins like ADA and XLM rally too. That’s not organic, it’s bots. High-frequency trading bots react in milliseconds, front-running humans and mimicking market momentum. The result? A distorted price that misleads retail traders. Until real utility kicks in, XRP’s price may continue to be shaped more by algorithms than investors. July 3, 2025 11:55:41 UTC Ripple CEO to Testify in Senate Hearing on Crypto Market Structure The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a pivotal hearing on Crypto Market Structure on July 9th , with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse among the key witnesses. This marks a major step forward in giving crypto a formal voice in shaping U.S. regulations. With Ripple at the center of the discussion, it’s a bullish signal for XRP and the broader crypto space. All eyes on Washington next week—this could be a defining moment for XRP and regulatory clarity in the U.S. July 3, 2025 11:51:17 UTC Ripple CEO Says XRP Is Solving a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Problem Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has made a bold statement, emphasizing Ripple’s unique position in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem. “When I zoom out… we are incredibly fortunate to be the only company with real customers solving real problems,” he said. With Ripple targeting the global cross-border payments market, a multi-trillion-dollar industry, XRP is emerging as a powerful solution to real-world inefficiencies in finance. As regulatory clarity improves and adoption grows, XRP could soon become the backbone of international value transfer. Big moves ahead for Ripple and even bigger implications for the global banking system. July 3, 2025 11:44:02 UTC XRP News – Ripple’s Bank Charter Move Could Shatter Traditional Banking Ripple is making history by seeking a U.S. banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account—potentially becoming the first crypto-native bank. This move would allow Ripple to hold reserves directly with the Fed, offer FDIC-insured deposits up to $250K, and provide lending services using XRP and other crypto assets as collateral. With integrated cross-border remittance capabilities and on-chain financial services, Ripple is poised to disrupt traditional banking from within.

XRP is now up by the same percentage in a week and by 6% in a fortnight, while also boasting an impressive 375% increase in a year. Its moves today come after the SEC approved the Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF, which includes XRP in its basket of digital assets, although the regulator has already frozen this approval , pending the establishment of clearer regulatory framework for ETPs. However, analysts are still optimistic that the approval clears the way for spot-based XRP ETFs, something which would have hugely positive implications for the long-term XRP price prediction . XRP Price Prediction – Crypto Analyst Says Wall Street’s Full-Scale Entry is Just Beginning – $100 XRP Next Target Posting on X, analyst Nate Geraci had suggested that the approval makes a spot-based XRP ETF much likelier, and while the SEC did actually include a stay on the approval, Geraci still insists that the news is encouraging. Fwiw, I actually view this as extremely positive… SEC Division of Trading & Markets *did* issue GDLC approval order. Agree w/ James that delay is simply SEC wanting to put in place formal listing framework/standards for crypto ETFs overall. Once that happens, floodgates open. https://t.co/tOU4RleQx2 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2025 And as he reiterates above, the “floodgates open” to XRP ETFs once the SEC does introduce the regulatory framework analysts are now expecting. This means that we may experience a delay while the regulator formulates a set of guidelines for ETFs and other ETPs, but the fact that it approved Grayscale’s ETF would indicate that it’s very open to exchange-traded funds involving XRP (and other cryptocurrencies). It’s arguable that this news is reflected in the XRP price today, given its sudden and obvious bounce. And if we look at its chart, we see that it’s beginning to regather some good momentum, with its RSI (yellow) shooting up to 60 this morning. Similarly, its moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) is about to turn positive, a sign that bulls are about to take control of XRP’s market. Source: TradingView Other positive signs include an increase in XRP fund inflows this week, while the coin’s funding rate has also risen , reaching 0.0104% today. We may therefore be on the cusp of a bullish period for XRP, which has strong enough fundamentals to support a long, sustained rally in the latter stages of the year. Not only could XRP ETFs be a massive boost to the XRP price, but Ripple’s ongoing expansion as a business will also support the altcoin. For example, yesterday saw the firm apply for a US banking charter , something which would facilitate the growth of its stablecoin business. This is very bullish for XRP, which could reach $2.50 in August and then $3.50 by the final months of the year. Automated Sniping Bot Raises $1.3 Million in Presale: Is Snorter the Next Big Alt? There’s no doubt that XRP could have a big end to 2025, yet there are other alts which have the potential to do very well in the coming months. Some of these will be presale coins, which have an advantage over other new coins, in that they can generate enough momentum during their sales to have big rallies once they list. One of the most promising presale coins around at the moment is Snorter (SNORT), a new Ethereum- and Solana-based token that has raised over $1.3 million in its ICO. Starting to see @SnorterToken is popping up everywhere, and for good reason. Clean site, strong push, and seriously good vibes. If you're tired of missing out on those wild Solana meme coins, the Snorter Bot is your new secret weapon. Powered by $SNORT , it makes on-chain trading… pic.twitter.com/qnn8f2Gjyp — MANDO CT (@XMaximist) June 17, 2025 This is an impressive figure, and the reason why Snorter is doing well is because it’s preparing to launch its own automated sniping bot. As a sniping bot, it will make trades ahead of the market, buying emerging tokens before they blow up. It will also offer several other important features, including copy trading, limit orders, atomic swaps, and protection against front-running and honeypot scams. This promises to make it one of the best bots in the market, with traders able to buy its SNORT token early by going to the Snorter website . The coin will have a max supply of 500 million SNORT, with holders able to stake it for a passive income. It currently costs $0.0971, although this will rise again in just under two days.

The Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric from CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered 24 at 00:30 UTC on July 3. This uptick from the previous day’s figure signals a clear message: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season . But what does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these dynamic market conditions? Let’s dive deep into understanding this pivotal indicator and its implications for your cryptocurrency investing journey. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index (ASI): Your Market Compass The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital compass for investors, helping to determine whether the broader market is favoring Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric that offers insights into prevailing crypto market trends . Here’s how this fascinating index works: Scope: The index tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a pure measure of market sentiment and capital flow. Timeframe: Its assessment is based on the performance of these coins over the past 90 days, providing a robust, medium-term view rather than short-term fluctuations. Defining Seasons: The index operates on a simple yet effective rule: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation over the 90-day period. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin during the same timeframe. The Score: The index scores range from 1 to 100. A higher score leans towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score indicates Bitcoin Season. The current reading of 24, up four points, firmly places us in Bitcoin Season territory, meaning Bitcoin is currently the dominant performer against most major altcoins. To put it simply, the ASI tells us where the smart money is flowing. Is it into the established, less volatile Bitcoin, or are investors seeking higher, albeit riskier, returns in the myriad of altcoins? What Does ‘Bitcoin Season’ Truly Mean for Your Portfolio? When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season, it signals a period where Bitcoin’s price appreciation outpaces the vast majority of altcoins. This isn’t just about Bitcoin going up; it’s about Bitcoin going up more significantly than most other cryptocurrencies, or holding its value better during market downturns. During a Bitcoin Season, you’ll typically observe: Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance, its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, tends to increase. This indicates that capital is consolidating in BTC, often seen as the ‘safe haven’ asset within the crypto space. Altcoin Underperformance: Many altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, may struggle to gain significant traction. Some might even bleed value against Bitcoin, meaning their USD value might rise, but their BTC value (e.g., ETH/BTC, ADA/BTC) decreases. Reduced Volatility in BTC (Relatively): While Bitcoin is inherently volatile, during its season, it might offer comparatively more stability than the highly speculative altcoin market. Why does Bitcoin Season happen? Several factors contribute to this phenomenon: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or uncertainty, investors often flock to assets perceived as more stable. Within crypto, Bitcoin often plays this role due to its larger market cap, institutional adoption, and established network. Pre-Halving Rallies: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, historically precede significant price surges, drawing capital away from altcoins. Institutional Inflow: When large institutions enter the crypto space, their initial investments often flow into Bitcoin due to its liquidity and regulatory clarity. Market Cycle Behavior: Bitcoin often leads market rallies, with altcoins typically following once Bitcoin’s rally cools off and profits are rotated. For investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective cryptocurrency investing . It means re-evaluating risk exposure and potentially adjusting your portfolio allocation. The Elusive ‘Altcoin Season’: What Triggers the Shift? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the crypto market is cyclical, and an Altcoin Season is always a possibility. This highly anticipated period is characterized by explosive growth in altcoin prices, often dwarfing Bitcoin’s gains. It’s when many investors see their smaller altcoin holdings multiply rapidly. What typically triggers a shift from Bitcoin Season to Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance Peak: Often, Bitcoin’s dominance reaches a peak, and capital that flowed into BTC during its run begins to seek higher returns elsewhere. This ‘profit-taking’ from Bitcoin is then rotated into altcoins. Innovation and Narratives: New technological breakthroughs, significant upgrades to existing altcoin networks (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades), or emerging narratives (like DeFi, NFTs, AI tokens, GameFi) can ignite interest and capital flow into specific altcoin sectors. Reduced Risk Aversion: As the overall market gains confidence and stability, investors become more willing to take on higher risks associated with altcoins, which have lower market caps and greater upside potential. Liquidity Spreading: Once Bitcoin establishes a new price floor or consolidates, the increased liquidity in the market starts to spread out to smaller cap assets, leading to their exponential growth. Recognizing the signs of an impending Altcoin Season is key for maximizing returns. It requires constant monitoring of market sentiment, Bitcoin dominance charts, and news from promising altcoin projects. Navigating the Seasons: Strategic Cryptocurrency Investing Knowing whether it’s Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season isn’t just academic; it has direct implications for your cryptocurrency investing strategy. Adapting your approach based on the Altcoin Season Index can significantly impact your portfolio’s performance. Strategies During Bitcoin Season: With the Altcoin Season Index at 24, here’s how to navigate the current environment: Focus on Bitcoin Accumulation: This is an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value, dollar-cost averaging into BTC can be a sound strategy. Selective Altcoin Accumulation: While most altcoins underperform, this period can be excellent for accumulating strong, fundamentally sound altcoin projects at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Research projects with solid technology, active development, and clear use cases. Risk Management: Reduce exposure to highly speculative or unproven altcoins. Their volatility can be amplified during Bitcoin Season, leading to significant losses. Education and Research: Use this period to research potential altcoin gems for the next Altcoin Season. Identify sectors or projects that could lead the next bull run. Strategies for the Next Altcoin Season: When the Altcoin Season Index starts climbing towards 75 and beyond, your strategy should shift: Profit Taking: Be prepared to take profits from your altcoin holdings. Altcoin seasons are known for parabolic pumps, but they can also reverse quickly. Having a profit-taking strategy (e.g., selling in tranches) is vital. Diversification within Alts: While Bitcoin Season often means consolidating into BTC, Altcoin Season might call for diversifying across promising altcoin sectors, spreading risk and capturing different narratives. Beware of FOMO: Not every altcoin will pump. Avoid blindly investing in every coin that is rising. Stick to your research and investment thesis. Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing your portfolio by moving some profits back into Bitcoin or stablecoins to secure gains and prepare for potential market corrections. Index Value Range Market Condition Key Characteristic Investor Action 75-100 Altcoin Season 75%+ of top 100 alts outperform BTC Focus on altcoin opportunities, profit-taking 25-74 Neither (Transition) Mixed performance, market indecision Cautious approach, research, observe 1-24 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer alts outperform BTC Focus on Bitcoin, strategic alt accumulation Table: Altcoin Season Index Interpretation and Investor Strategies Historical Context and Future Outlook for Crypto Market Trends History often rhymes in the crypto world. Past bull cycles have consistently shown phases of Bitcoin Season followed by an explosive Altcoin Season . For instance, in late 2017 and early 2021, Bitcoin led the initial charge, breaking new all-time highs. Once Bitcoin’s momentum cooled, capital flowed into altcoins, leading to massive pumps across the board. Understanding these historical patterns can provide valuable context for current crypto market trends . While past performance is not indicative of future results, it offers a framework for anticipating potential shifts. What could trigger the next shift from Bitcoin Season? Keep an eye on: Bitcoin Dominance Chart: A significant reversal or consolidation in BTC dominance often precedes an Altcoin Season. Major Altcoin Developments: Breakthroughs in scalability, new DeFi protocols, or significant institutional adoption of specific altcoins could act as catalysts. Global Economic Climate: A more risk-on environment in traditional markets might encourage greater speculation in altcoins. The market is a living, breathing entity, constantly evolving. Staying informed about these broader trends is paramount for successful cryptocurrency investing . Challenges and Considerations in Following the Index While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to acknowledge its limitations and challenges: Lagging Indicator: The index is based on 90-day performance, meaning it reflects what has already happened. It’s not a predictive tool but rather a confirmation of current market conditions. Not All Altcoins are Equal: Even during an Altcoin Season, not every altcoin will pump. Many projects may fail, and some will simply not gain traction. Individual research and due diligence remain critical. Market Volatility: The crypto market is notoriously volatile. Conditions can change rapidly, and what is Bitcoin Season today might transition faster than anticipated. External Factors: Macroeconomic events, regulatory news, and major hacks or security breaches can override typical market cycle behavior. Therefore, use the Altcoin Season Index as one piece of your analytical puzzle, not the sole determinant of your investment decisions. Conclusion: Mastering the Seasons of Cryptocurrency Investing The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 24 unequivocally signals that we are in a period dominated by Bitcoin. This understanding is not merely academic; it provides a crucial framework for informed cryptocurrency investing . Whether it’s consolidating your position in Bitcoin, strategically accumulating promising altcoins, or preparing for the eventual shift to Altcoin Season , adapting your strategy to prevailing crypto market trends is paramount. The crypto market is a dynamic landscape, constantly shifting between periods of Bitcoin leadership and altcoin exuberance. By staying informed about metrics like the Altcoin Season Index and understanding the underlying drivers of these market seasons, you empower yourself to make more strategic decisions, navigate volatility with greater confidence, and ultimately, enhance your potential for long-term success in this exciting asset class.

NimDoor, a sophisticated malware compiled in the Nim programming language specifically targets macOS systems. Unlike more widely used programming languages, Nim allows code execution during compilation, creating binaries that mix runtime and malware logic. This complicates reverse engineering and detection efforts. According to a new report by SentinelLabs, the campaign was first observed in April 2025 during an attack on a crypto startup. Multiple security firms have since confirmed similar incidents affecting other companies in the space. How North Korea Deploys Cyberattacks on Crypto Startups: SentinelLabs Report SentinelLabs reported that the attackers use classic social engineering techniques to trick victims into running the malicious code. Victims are approached on Telegram by impersonated contacts and invited to schedule a meeting via Calendly. They later receive an email with a Zoom link and instructions to install a supposed “Zoom SDK update.” According to the report, the link directs users to an AppleScript file hosted on domains mimicking Zoom’s official URLs. The script is heavily padded with thousands of lines of whitespace and ends with code that fetches a second-stage payload from attacker-controlled servers. After the initial download, the malware deploys two Mach-O binaries in the system’s temporary directory. The first binary, written in C++, performs process injection to launch a trojan. The second binary, compiled from Nim and labeled installer, installs persistence tools that ensure the malware remains active even after a system reboot or termination. This stage drops two more Nim-based binaries: GoogIe LLC and CoreKitAgent, both of which play roles in long-term access and system monitoring. Once deployed, the malware executes two that steal user data. The upl script extracts login credentials and browsing history from browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox. The tlgrm script specifically targets Telegram data. All stolen data is compressed and sent to servers disguised as secure upload portals hosted by the attackers. North Korea’s Cyber Arsenal Evolves: Hackers Turn to Rare Programming Language SentinelLabs notes that this isn’t the first time DPRK-affiliated actors have used less common programming languages. Past campaigns have involved Go and Rust, and more recently, Crystal. Analysts believe the use of such languages will rise as attackers look for ways to evade traditional detection tools. This recent cybersecurity threat adds to the growing list of such activities emanating from North Korea. In April, North Korean hackers targeted U.S. crypto developers through a malware campaign using fake companies, including Blocknovas LLC and Softglide LLC, registered with false addresses. North Korean cyber spies reportedly set up fake US firms to deploy malware targeting crypto developers, violating Treasury sanctions. #NorthKorea #CyberSecurity https://t.co/TvCmrspaep — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 Tied to a Lazarus Group subgroup, the operation used fake job offers to spread malware stealing crypto wallets and credentials. In May, South Korea and the EU pledged closer cooperation to combat cyber threats, focusing on North Korea’s crypto crimes. During talks in Seoul, officials stressed the need for joint action amid rising attacks. Lawmaker Ha Tae-keung stated that North Korean hackers have stolen another $310 million in cryptocurrency from South Korean wallets since the $2 billion thefts reported by the UN in 2019. Chainalysis, in addition, reported $1.3 billion in stolen funds in 2024 Crypto hackers from North Korea stole $1.3 billion in funds in 2024, new data released this week from Chainalysis shows. #NorthKorea #CryptoHackers https://t.co/TQYgKiaQ22 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 Just two days ago, the U.S. DOJ charged four North Koreans with stealing over $900,000 in cryptocurrency by posing as remote IT workers at blockchain firms. Using fake identities, they altered smart contracts to carry out the thefts, part of a scheme to fund North Korea’s weapons program.

In the note led by strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the bank outlined a more tempered view of the sector's trajectory, arguing that crypto-native demand, not broader payment adoption, remains the primary driver of stablecoin usage. “We find forecasts for an exponential expansion of the stablecoin universe rom $250 billion currently to $1 trillion-$2 trillion over the coming years as far too optimistic,"" the team wrote. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing among other things a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. According to the bank's analysts, roughly 88% of stablecoin demand today comes from crypto-native activity, including trading, decentralized finance (DeFi) collateral, and idle funds held by crypto firms, with payments accounting for just 6%. Even under generous assumptions, the growth of stablecoin use in payments would only marginally increase overall market size, the report said. JPMorgan also dismissed the likelihood of a large-scale shift from traditional bank deposits or money market funds into stablecoins, citing the lack of yield and added friction in moving between fiat and crypto. The firm's analysts pushed back on comparisons with China’s e-CNY or the rise of Alipay and WeChat Pay, noting that these systems are centralized and not representative of how stablecoins operate. Ultimately, the bank sees moderate, crypto-driven growth as the most realistic path for stablecoins, not a mass adoption story. Some banks are more bullish than JPMorgan about the outlook for stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (Genius) Act is expected to be passed in the U.S. in the coming months, and that could trigger an almost 10-fold jump in stablecoin supply, investment bank Standard Chartered said in a research report in April. U.S. legislation ""would further legitimize the stablecoin industry,"" the bank's analysts wrote at the time, adding that ""we estimate this would cause total stablecoin supply to rise from $230 billion today to $2 trillion by year-end 2028.""

The highest yield accepted at auction, the auction’s tail, was at 0.31 yen versus 0.49 yen at the previous sale. Market Live Strategist Mark Cranfield acknowledged that today’s 30-year JGB auction passed with solid metrics, with a notable improvement in the bid-to-cover ratio to 3.58, although the lowest actual price was below forecasts. Ansh Gandhi, a fixed-income strategist at Futures First Info Services, said the sale of 10- and 20-year bonds bodes well for the 20-year offering. Japanese yields drop from recent peaks Japan’s bond yields were pulled higher due to renewed concerns about fiscal spending globally. The country’s recent 30-year government bond auction drew a level of demand that suggests lawmakers are making progress in getting rid of debt-market volatility. Although the offer-to-bid was at 3.58, the minimum bid price was lower than expected in a sign that some in the market are still cautious. Japanese bond yields surged, including the 30- and 40-year bond yields both adding 8 bps to 2.965% and 3.14% respectively. Source: Bloomberg . Japanese bonds regain stability after a spike in yields. Kazuya Fujiwara, a bond strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., argued that the sharp rise in long-term interest rates in the UK due to concerns over fiscal expansion is likely contributing to anxiety over Japan’s fiscal outlook. He noted that an increase in government borrowing costs globally is driving yields higher, especially with the surge in yields on Wednesday in the U.S., Germany, and the UK. Fujiwara believes that Japan’s yield auction results suggest that the country may be able to prevent a repeat of the market turmoil caused by sales of longer-maturity bonds in May. During that time, the Ministry of Finance unveiled plans to reduce bond sale amounts for longer maturities to sell fewer super-long bonds. The MOF promised to cut issuance of 20-, 30-, and 40-year debt from July by a combined 3.2 trillion yen ($22 billion) in the next 9 months. The Bank of Japan also revealed that it would withdraw from credit acquisitions. Shuichi Ohsaki, a senior portfolio manager at Meiji Yasuda Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, noted that there was a certain level of demand at the auction. However, it still showed a fair amount of caution. He said that the auction felt somewhat weak, but still believes it’s unlikely to cause turmoil in the bond market. Ohsaki noted that this week’s high demand at the country’s 10-year bond sale soothed the market, although a drop in UK gilts on Wednesday reignited concerns about fiscal spending globally. Japan gears up for a national election this month Shoki Omori, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities, argued that investors still need to see the upcoming 20-year auction to fully understand investor appetite for the long-end. He acknowledged that the auction gave some relief for long-end investors, referring to a sale of 20-year debt on July 10. The Liberal Democratic Party’s Policy Chief and former Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said in an interview with Bloomberg last week that Japan’s fiscal outlook was already facing a “yellow alert.” He also expects expenditures to surge as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sets salary increases and a one quadrillion yen economy as the top campaign promises for the upcoming upper house elections. Ken Matsumoto, a macro strategist at Credit Agricole in Tokyo, mentioned that uncertainty around the upper house election would likely hold back demand at the auction. He believes that the fiscal policy stance of the government could change drastically depending on the election results.

Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the US dollar, have become a cornerstone of the digital economy. Recent figures have unveiled a truly staggering achievement: Stablecoin companies have collectively pulled in close to $10 billion in annual revenue over the 12-month period ending in June 2025. This remarkable figure underscores the growing influence and profitability of these digital assets, signaling a new era of financial prowess within the crypto space. Understanding the Unprecedented Stablecoin Revenue Boom For many, the idea of a ‘stable’ asset generating billions in revenue might seem counterintuitive. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies that aim for appreciation, stablecoins are built for stability. So, how do these issuers rake in such substantial earnings? The primary mechanism involves holding reserves—often in the form of short-term U.S. Treasury bills or other liquid assets—that back the stablecoins in circulation. The interest earned on these reserves, often referred to as ‘seigniorage,’ forms the bulk of their income. As the demand for stablecoins grows, so does the pool of reserves, leading to increasingly significant returns. The reported $10 billion in Stablecoin Revenue highlights the immense scale at which these operations are now running. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a testament to the fundamental utility stablecoins provide in facilitating seamless transactions, acting as a safe haven during market volatility, and enabling efficient cross-border payments. The ecosystem they support is vast, touching everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to everyday crypto trading. Who Are the Big Players in the Stablecoin Market? The CoinDesk figures, shared on X, offer a clear snapshot of the leading entities driving this revenue surge. While the overall pie is impressive, a few key players dominate the landscape, showcasing their strategic positioning and market penetration. Here’s a breakdown of the top earners: Stablecoin Issuer Annual Revenue (12 Months ending June 2025) Tether $6.56 billion Circle $1.89 billion Sky Protocol $384 million Ethena $332 million Total (Approx.) ~$10 billion This table clearly illustrates the hierarchy within the stablecoin market, with Tether maintaining a significant lead. Tether Earnings: The Undisputed Leader’s Financial Might Tether (USDT) stands out as the dominant force, accounting for a staggering $6.56 billion of the total revenue. This figure alone is more than three times the earnings of its closest competitor, Circle. Tether’s longevity, widespread adoption across exchanges, and its first-mover advantage have cemented its position as the most used stablecoin globally. The sheer volume of USDT in circulation means that even a modest yield on its extensive reserve holdings translates into monumental profits. This robust performance of Tether Earnings not only validates its operational model but also highlights the immense trust and utility it provides to millions of users worldwide. Tether’s strategy often involves diversifying its reserves into various low-risk, high-liquidity assets, including U.S. Treasury bills, which have seen rising yields in recent periods. This prudent management of its backing assets is a key factor in its consistent and impressive revenue generation. Circle and Other Stablecoin Companies: Diversifying the Landscape While Tether leads, Circle, the issuer of USDC, follows with a substantial $1.89 billion in revenue. USDC has positioned itself as a highly regulated and transparent alternative, particularly appealing to institutional investors and businesses. Its growth underscores the demand for compliant and audited stablecoin solutions. The strong performance of Stablecoin Companies like Circle indicates a maturing market where different issuers cater to diverse user needs and regulatory preferences. Beyond the top two, newer players like Sky Protocol ($384 million) and Ethena ($332 million) are also making significant inroads. Their emergence and substantial earnings demonstrate that innovation and specific niche offerings can carve out profitable segments even in a market dominated by giants. Sky Protocol and Ethena, for instance, might be exploring different stablecoin models or targeting specific DeFi ecosystems, showcasing the evolving dynamics within the stablecoin space. What Drives the Growth of Crypto Stablecoins? The impressive revenue figures aren’t just arbitrary numbers; they are a direct reflection of the underlying utility and adoption of Crypto Stablecoins . Several factors contribute to their burgeoning growth and profitability: Market Volatility: Stablecoins serve as a safe haven during periods of high crypto market volatility, allowing traders to quickly move out of riskier assets without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely. DeFi Expansion: They are the lifeblood of decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols without exposure to price fluctuations. Cross-Border Payments: Stablecoins offer a faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative to traditional remittance services, particularly in regions with limited access to conventional banking. Global Accessibility: They provide financial access to unbanked and underbanked populations, fostering financial inclusion. Institutional Adoption: More institutions are exploring stablecoins for treasury management, settlement, and as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto. Interest Rate Environment: Rising global interest rates on reserve assets have directly boosted the profitability of stablecoin issuers. These drivers collectively create a robust demand for stablecoins, which in turn fuels the revenue generation of their issuers. The Mechanics Behind Digital Currency Revenue: How Do They Do It? Delving deeper into how these entities generate such significant Digital Currency Revenue reveals a sophisticated interplay of financial management and market dynamics. The core business model revolves around: Reserve Management: Issuers take fiat currency (or other assets) from users in exchange for stablecoins. These fiat deposits are then invested in highly liquid, low-risk instruments like U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, money market funds, or even corporate bonds. Interest Income: The interest earned on these reserve investments is the primary source of revenue. As the total supply of stablecoins increases, so does the amount of reserves, leading to higher interest income. Transaction Fees (Minor): While less significant than interest income, some platforms may charge small fees for minting or redeeming stablecoins, or for certain on-chain transactions involving their stablecoins. Lending/Staking (for some): Certain stablecoin models or related entities might engage in lending out a portion of their reserves (overcollateralized) or staking them in DeFi protocols to generate additional yield, though this carries higher risk and is less common for the largest, most conservative issuers. The transparency and auditing of these reserves are crucial for maintaining user trust and regulatory compliance, particularly for major players like Tether and Circle. Benefits and Opportunities: What Does This Mean for the Ecosystem? The burgeoning revenue of stablecoin companies signals several positive developments for the broader cryptocurrency and financial ecosystems: Increased Investment in Infrastructure: Higher profits enable issuers to invest more in security, compliance, and technological advancements, benefiting all users. Enhanced Stability: The robust financial health of issuers contributes to the overall stability and reliability of the stablecoin market, reducing systemic risk. Regulatory Engagement: Significant revenue incentivizes issuers to engage more proactively with regulators, potentially leading to clearer guidelines and broader acceptance. Innovation and Competition: Profits can be reinvested into research and development, fostering new stablecoin models, features, and use cases, and encouraging healthy competition. Mainstream Adoption: The proven profitability of stablecoins makes them more attractive to traditional financial institutions and corporations, accelerating mainstream adoption of digital assets. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Stablecoins Despite the impressive revenue, the stablecoin sector faces ongoing challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a significant hurdle, with governments worldwide grappling with how to classify and regulate these digital assets. Concerns around reserve transparency, consumer protection, and potential systemic risks are frequently raised. Geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic shifts can also impact the value and liquidity of reserve assets, posing risks to issuers. However, the proactive engagement of leading stablecoin companies with regulators, coupled with their strong financial performance, suggests a path towards clearer regulatory frameworks. The future likely holds increased integration with traditional finance, expansion into new use cases like tokenized real-world assets, and continued innovation in stablecoin design. Conclusion: A New Pillar of the Digital Economy The revelation that stablecoin companies are generating nearly $10 billion in annual revenue is a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the profound utility and economic impact of stablecoins, moving them beyond mere trading tools to become a significant, revenue-generating pillar of the digital economy. Tether’s commanding lead, coupled with the strong performance of Circle, Sky Protocol, and Ethena, paints a picture of a maturing and incredibly lucrative sector. As the world increasingly embraces digital finance, stablecoins are not just facilitating transactions; they are building substantial businesses, driving innovation, and laying the groundwork for the financial systems of tomorrow. Their success is a powerful indicator of the crypto market’s evolution and its growing integration into global finance.

The rally is fueled by a mix of macroeconomic signals, institutional activity, and strengthening on-chain metrics, which point to a renewed investor appetite for the crypto asset. In fact, one of the main drivers behind the ETH rally is a wave of optimism in traditional markets. U.S. payroll numbers released earlier today came in weaker than expected, reinforcing hopes that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates sooner rather than later. With lower rates potentially reducing the cost of capital and boosting demand for riskier assets, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are experiencing renewed inflows. Data from SoSoValue shows that even though Ethereum ETFs have seen outflows of $1.82 million, its cumulative total net inflow is still standing tall at $4.25 billion.

How SpacePay Makes Crypto Payments Simple,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/spend-ethereum-anywhere-how-spacepay-makes-crypto-payments-simple/,"The post Spend Ethereum Anywhere? How SpacePay Makes Crypto Payments Simple appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News You’ve got Ethereum sitting in your wallet, but when’s the last time you actually spent it? Probably never. Most places still give you blank stares when you mention paying with crypto. That’s exactly what SpacePay is fixing with their payment platform that works with existing card machines, supports over 325 crypto wallets, and charges just 0.5% in fees while protecting merchants from price swings through instant fiat conversion. The London startup has already raised over $1.1 million in their presale, with $SPY tokens currently priced at $0.003181. Making Ethereum Payments Work in Real Stores Most crypto payment solutions fail because they’re complicated. Store owners take one look at the setup requirements and walk away. Who wants expensive new equipment and weeks of staff training? SpacePay solves this by working with Android card readers that businesses already have. No new hardware needed. Just a software update and suddenly that same terminal can handle Ethereum payments alongside regular cards. The customer experience stays simple too. You scan a QR code with whatever wallet you’re using, check the amount, and tap to pay. Takes about as long as using Apple Pay. No typing long wallet addresses or waiting around while transactions process forever. Since SpacePay plays nice with hundreds of different wallets, you can keep using whatever app you already have. Got MetaMask? Perfect. Prefer Trust Wallet? That works too. Some obscure wallet nobody’s heard of? Probably fine. Pretty simple stuff. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1937934902780944413 How Merchants Stay Safe from Crypto Price Swings Here’s the thing that scares most business owners about accepting Ethereum. The price jumps around like crazy. Nobody wants to sell a $100 item for ETH in the morning, then find out it’s only worth $85 by afternoon because the market had another episode. SpacePay handles this perfectly. When someone pays with Ethereum, the merchant gets regular money in their account right away. That $100 sale stays exactly $100, period. Doesn’t matter if ETH decides to crash or the moon five minutes later. The system locks in the exchange rate for those few seconds while payment processes. If the market goes wild during that tiny window, SpacePay absorbs the difference. The shop owner just sees a normal payment hitting their account. This removes the biggest excuse merchants have for avoiding crypto. They don’t need to understand blockchain technology or follow price charts. They just get paid in dollars like always, except now they can serve customers who prefer digital money. Visit SpacePay Presale Why Those Low Fees Actually Matter Credit card companies have been taking their cut for so long that most people just accept it. But those 2.5% to 3.5% fees really add up fast. A busy coffee shop doing $25,000 monthly is handing over about $750 just in processing fees. SpacePay charges 0.5%. Same coffee shop would pay $125 instead. That’s $625 extra every month that could go toward better equipment, staff bonuses, or actually fixing that broken espresso machine that’s been acting up. The savings work because SpacePay cuts out all the middlemen. With regular credit cards, your payment bounces around between banks and processors, with everyone taking their piece. SpacePay creates a more direct route using blockchain tech, so there are fewer hands grabbing money along the way. Small businesses can’t catch a break lately – costs keep rising while customers spend less. Every dollar they can keep matters. That extra cash might be what lets them hire another employee instead of working seven days a week. The Crypto Community Finally Gets What It Wants Crypto holders have been sitting on their digital money for years, watching it grow but never actually using it. Sure, you could sell your Ethereum and buy stuff with cash, but then you miss out if prices keep climbing. Plus selling means dealing with taxes and exchange fees. SpacePay lets you spend your ETH directly. No converting, no extra steps, no hassle. Got a wallet full of Ethereum and want to grab dinner? Just scan and pay. Your crypto gets used for what it was supposed to do – buy things. The speed matters too. Regular crypto payments can take forever to confirm. Sometimes you’re standing there for twenty minutes waiting for the blockchain to do its thing. With SpacePay, everything happens in seconds. Fast enough that it feels normal. Since the system accepts pretty much any wallet you throw at it, there’s no need to clutter your phone with another app or figure out some new system. Just stick with what you know. Getting Started with SpacePay The $SPY presale accepts various payment methods including ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, USDT, USDC, and regular bank cards for people new to crypto. Anyone interested can visit SpacePay’s official website , connect their crypto wallet, and purchase tokens at the current price of $0.003181 per $SPY.

As meme coins rebound, could the purest meme coin of them all be poised to hit the stratosphere? Time for a closer look. What’s Driving the Rally? A wave of optimism around potential US Federal Reserve rate cuts , prompted by recent dovish statements from key officials, energized risk assets. Overall, markets are bullish and tokens are up for a number of reasons. Approvals of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) signaled increased institutional interest, especially in altcoins. Greater clarity in US crypto regulation is drawing fresh capital into the market. Growing TradFi and DeFi convergence – including banking applications for key crypto institutions – has lowered barriers to entry while increasing a sense of trust. There’s still uncertainty, especially ahead of the Labor Department’s expected employment report on July 3. But for now, positivity reigns, and traders clamor for more gains. Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, noted , ‘Bitcoin is in the passenger seat… Recent crypto ETP approvals may be raising investor confidence that TradFi capital will make its way into altcoins.’ He expects new token highs later in the year, and it’s not just Bitcoin we’re talking about. Wider Market Backdrop Still Positive for Key Crypto Players US equity benchmarks like Nasdaq and the S&P 500 also ticked up, with the S&P 500 hitting an all-time high . However, geopolitical and fiscal uncertainties – such as the delayed U.S. budget , ongoing global trade tensions, and regional conflicts – remain a constant worry for investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows on July 1 , suggesting some caution, though that was the first day in a 15-day streak of inflows. Ripple’s application for a national bank charter with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) marked another sign of growing institutional integration. And President Trump’s enthusiastic endorsement of a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal may boost broader risk-on sentiment. All told, it’s no surprise that Dogecoin made a strong push – and could be forming the base for another surge to $0.19 or beyond. A strong performance from the world’s biggest meme coin creates a favorable environment for the purest, simplest, strongest meme coin presale – Token6900 ($T6900). Token6900 ($T6900) – All Meme, All the Time First there was the SPX6900 token, a meme with no utility, just a $1.2B market cap. It’s up 4.3% in the past week, kicking butt and taking names. Now there’s Token6900 ($T6900) , with even less utility but more…tokens? Yes, it has one more token than SPX6900. Talk about pettiness, right? The project is pure meme coin madness, all mood and all vibe. And it’s all potential, too – the potential to ride the growing meme market to unprecedented heights. The truth of $T6900 is that it isn’t just another meme coin – it’s the most literal meme coin possible. The truth is the meme, and the meme is truth. There’s no hiding, no fancy promises of future utility – just a meme, a presale, and slaptastic potential. True meme coin aficionados are already buying in; the presale has raised over $191K in a matter of days, with tokens priced at only $0.006425. Visit the Token6900 presale page to learn more. Memes Ready to Make Bank in Bullish Markets Crypto markets are currently buoyed by encouraging macro signals, institutional momentum, and regulatory progress. While underlying uncertainties persist, the prevailing sentiment leans toward upside – and Token6900 taps into that outlook to unleash pure meme coin momentum.

As of press time, SUI is priced at $3.02, up 9.58% in the past 24 hours and nearly 13% on the week, which is an impressive gain. Much of this enthusiasm comes from the SEC’s approval of a Grayscale ETF that includes leading assets such as BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and ADA. This has lifted sentiment across the Layer-1 space, including SUI. On the utility side, the Sui network hit a key milestone by processing $27.3 billion in token volume in June, signaling significant ecosystem growth and dApp usage. Intriguing enough? Join me as I decode the short-term SUI price analysis. Sui Price Analysis: Technically speaking, SUI is showing signs of bullish momentum, supported by surging volume and a breakout from key resistance zones. The 4-hour chart shows SUI trading above the 20-day Bollinger Band midline and holding well above the lower band. The token hit a 24-hour high of $3.08 and is now testing a critical resistance zone between $3.20 and $3.30, as marked on the chart. This area has previously rejected price advances and could act as a short-term hurdle. If bulls manage to push above this level with sustained volume, a breakout toward new local highs could follow. On the downside, immediate support lies at $2.9847, aligning closely with the middle Bollinger Band and psychological support. Below that, $2.84 is a major support level, clearly marked on the chart, and has historically served as a strong demand zone. Also read: Sui Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Why is SUI price surging today? ETF news, surging transaction volume, and strong on-chain fundamentals have all contributed to the bullish move. Should I buy SUI now?

The token has ridden out the regulatory turbulence and is now supported by Ripple's growing On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network and improved legal landscape. But what do the charts and indicators say it will do next? Price Structure and Key Levels XRP's price action since the start of 2025 has been defined by a series of higher lows, which suggests an uptrend forming. The token has established a firm support level between $0.70 and $0.80, where buyers consistently come in. Conversely, resistance has formed at $1.20—a level that has reined in rallies multiple times this year. Technical Analysis: What Do the Charts Say? Technical traders are closely following the convergence of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The pattern, a ”golden cross,” is typically bullish and indicates that short-term momentum is overpowering the longer-term trend. When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA in July, it can trigger a wave of algorithmic and retail buying. Current Status : Moving averages are closest now, with the 50-day MA rising at an increased slope and the 200-day MA flattening to its most horizontal. What to Watch : A confirmed golden cross, especially if it is preceded by a spectacular surge in trading volume, would take XRP up to the next resistance at $1.80. RSI and Momentum The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering near 60. This suggests that XRP is in bullish territory but not yet overbought (which typically occurs above 70). The RSI’s steady climb from the low 40s in May to its current level reflects growing momentum and renewed investor interest. Volume and Volatility: The Fuel for Breakouts Volume is the fuel of any sustained price action. The volume of XRP has been higher over the past while, especially on those days where there were announcement days with significant partnership news or regulatory updates. Volatility remains moderate compared to previous bull cycles, which means interest is growing but the market remains far from panicked. Bullish Scenario : Break above $1.20 followed by an increase in volume can force XRP to test $1.80 or even $2.00 in short order. Bearish Scenario : Failure to break resistance, coupled with declining volume, can lead to a retest of the $0.80 support. Analyst Price Projections for July 2025 Despite nobody being able to actually know what's going to happen, this is what top analysts and models expect from XRP this month: Analyst/Model July 2025 Price Target Rationale CryptoQuant $1.50–$2.20 ODL growth and positive regulatory news Cointelegraph $1.80 Technical breakout and altcoin rotation Twitter Polls $1.20–$2.00 Community bullishness and ETF rumors On-Chain Metrics $1.60 Whale accumulation and rising active addresses Final Thoughts XRP's technical setup for July 2025 is one of cautious optimism. The convergence of moving averages, bullish RSI, and rising volume all indicate that a powerful move could be in the offing—if key resistance levels are breached.

Bitcoin (BTC) has once again captured headlines, surging remarkably close to its all-time high. For many, this is a clear sign of renewed strength and a potential bull run. However, a deeper dive into the sophisticated world of the derivatives market reveals a more nuanced story. While the price action is undoubtedly exciting, professional traders are signaling a significant degree of hesitation, raising questions about the conviction behind this impressive crypto rally . Understanding the Derivatives Market’s Hesitation on Bitcoin ‘s Surge When Bitcoin’s price approaches significant milestones, it’s natural for excitement to build. But seasoned investors and analysts often look beyond spot prices to the derivatives market for a clearer picture of professional trader sentiment . This market, which includes futures and options, provides valuable insights into how institutional players and experienced traders are positioning themselves. According to Cointelegraph, despite BTC soaring above $109,000 and coming within 2% of its previous peak, key derivatives metrics are flashing yellow, not green. Here’s what we’re seeing: BTC Futures Premium: This metric, also known as the basis, measures the difference between futures contract prices and the current spot price. A healthy bull market typically sees a futures premium above 5%, indicating traders are willing to pay more for future exposure, expecting higher prices. Currently, the BTC futures premium remains below this neutral 5% level. This suggests a lack of aggressive long positioning and speculative buying from professional traders. They aren’t betting big on sustained price increases. 25% Delta Skew: The delta skew for Bitcoin options assesses the cost of call options versus put options at similar maturities. A positive skew indicates that call options (bets on higher prices) are more expensive than put options (bets on lower prices), reflecting bullish sentiment. A negative skew suggests bearishness. The fact that the 25% delta skew remains at 0% signals a perfectly neutral outlook. Traders aren’t paying a premium for upside protection or downside hedges, indicating no strong directional conviction. They’re essentially saying, “We don’t know which way it’s going, so we’re not committing.” These two indicators, when combined, paint a picture of caution. While retail enthusiasm might be pushing the spot price, the smart money appears to be holding back, suggesting that this rally might lack the broad-based institutional support typically seen in robust bull markets. Why is Trader Sentiment So Cautious Despite Rising BTC Price ? The discrepancy between Bitcoin’s rising price and the cautious derivatives market isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several macroeconomic factors and global uncertainties are likely contributing to this reserved trader sentiment : Global Economic Uncertainty: Persistent concerns over global trade tensions, potential economic slowdowns, and geopolitical instability create an environment of risk aversion. Even assets like Bitcoin, sometimes seen as a safe haven, are not immune to broader market jitters. Investors might be hesitant to commit large capital to riskier assets when the global economic outlook remains cloudy. Eurozone Monetary Expansion: While monetary expansion might theoretically support asset prices by increasing liquidity, its effectiveness and long-term implications are still being debated. Traders might be wary of the potential for inflation or other unintended consequences, leading them to exercise caution. Weaker U.S. Payroll Data: Softer economic data from major economies like the U.S. can signal a weakening global economy. This can lead to reduced consumer spending and investment, which in turn can dampen appetite for speculative assets. These macroeconomic signals create a complex backdrop for Bitcoin. While some might interpret them as reasons for Bitcoin to shine (e.g., as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation), others see them as reasons to remain defensive and cautious, especially given the asset’s historical volatility. Regional Weakness and ETF Outflows: Further Dampening the Crypto Rally Beyond the derivatives market, other indicators suggest underlying weakness in demand, further contributing to the hesitant trader sentiment surrounding the current crypto rally : Weak Crypto Demand in China: China has historically been a significant market for cryptocurrency. However, reports indicate that Tether (USDT), a stablecoin widely used for trading in the region, is currently trading at a 1% discount. This discount suggests an oversupply of USDT relative to demand, often indicating that local traders are selling off their crypto holdings and moving into fiat, or that capital controls are making it harder to acquire USDT. This is a notable shift from periods where USDT traded at a premium, signaling strong demand. BTC ETF Outflows: Tuesday saw a significant $342 million in outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs were once hailed as a major driver for institutional adoption and increased demand. Consistent outflows, especially substantial ones, indicate that institutional investors or large holders are withdrawing capital from these accessible Bitcoin investment vehicles. This directly contradicts the narrative of strong, sustained institutional demand for Bitcoin at its current price levels. These regional and institutional outflows are critical. They show that while Bitcoin’s spot price is climbing, the underlying demand from key segments of the market might not be as robust as the price action suggests. This creates a disconnect that experienced traders are keenly aware of, hence their cautious positioning in the derivatives market. Navigating the Uncertainty: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio and Bitcoin’s Price ? So, what should investors make of this mixed signal? On one hand, Bitcoin is demonstrating remarkable resilience, pushing towards new highs. On the other, the sophisticated players are not yet fully on board, raising concerns about the sustainability of this current upward trend. Here are some actionable insights and considerations: Monitor Derivatives Closely: Keep an eye on the BTC futures premium and delta skew. A sustained increase in the premium above 5% and a positive delta skew would signal a shift in professional trader sentiment and stronger conviction behind the rally. Assess Macroeconomic Developments: Pay attention to global economic data, central bank policies, and geopolitical events. These factors significantly influence risk appetite and can either support or hinder further Bitcoin gains. Understand Regional Dynamics: While China’s market might be complex, the USDT discount is a tangible sign of reduced demand. Similarly, ongoing ETF flows provide a pulse on institutional interest. Risk Management is Key: In an environment of uncertainty, robust risk management becomes even more crucial. Consider setting stop-losses, diversifying your portfolio, and not over-allocating to a single asset, even one as compelling as Bitcoin. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: This analysis primarily focuses on short-to-medium term market dynamics. Long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition as a decentralized, scarce asset might view these fluctuations as temporary noise. However, short-term traders need to be acutely aware of these conflicting signals. The current situation highlights the complexity of the crypto market. It’s not just about price, but also about the underlying conviction and demand from all market participants, especially the institutional ones who can move markets significantly. The Road Ahead: Will the Crypto Rally Find Full Support? The question on everyone’s mind is whether this impressive Bitcoin surge will eventually gain the full backing of the derivatives market . For a truly sustainable and robust bull run, we would ideally see futures premiums rise, delta skew turn positive, and strong inflows into institutional products like ETFs. Without this alignment, the current rally could be more vulnerable to corrections or consolidation. The coming weeks will be crucial. Will the positive momentum in the spot market eventually sway the cautious professionals? Or will the hesitancy in the derivatives market act as a ceiling, preventing Bitcoin’s price from breaking out definitively to new all-time highs? The interplay between these forces will define the next chapter for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In short, while Bitcoin’s price is soaring, the derivatives market has yet to show full support for the rally. This creates a fascinating tension, reminding us that market analysis requires looking at all angles, not just the most obvious one. It’s a powerful reminder that even in a surging market, prudence and a comprehensive understanding of all market indicators are paramount.

According to data shared by BitPay, USDC, which held an 85% transaction share in January 2024, saw its share drop to 56% by May 2025. In contrast, USDt climbed from 13% to 43% over the same period, reflecting a clear change in user and merchant preferences. This transition comes amid Circle’s high-profile public listing in June and its regulatory advantages under Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). Despite these strengths, Tether’s simplicity and user familiarity appear to have swayed the market’s momentum, particularly within payment flows. What Drives Tether Surge? Beyond transaction counts, Tether has established itself as the leading stablecoin by payment volume on BitPay. According to the crypto payment platform, USDT began capturing a significant share of processed stablecoin volume in March 2025, eventually surpassing 70% of total stablecoin volume on the platform. BitPay’s Chief Revenue Officer, Bill Zielke, noted that while USDC continues to hold the top spot in transaction counts, the volume shift to Tether is driven by both an increase in overall stablecoin transactions and a noticeable swing among existing users and merchants preferring USDT over USDC. Zielke added that although BitPay maintains a strong user base in Europe, its focus remains on expanding its reach within the United States. Divergent Strategies Amid Regulatory Shifts The competition between the two stablecoin issuers extends beyond user metrics, reflecting stark differences in regulatory strategy. Circle became the first global stablecoin issuer to secure MiCA approval in July 2024, positioning itself to comply with evolving European frameworks. In contrast, Tether has openly rejected MiCA compliance , citing concerns with specific regulatory provisions. Further, while Circle proceeded with a $1.05 billion public listing on June 5, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that his company has no plans for an IPO, maintaining a private operational structure. Despite USDC’s slip on BitPay, it has seen robust market capitalization growth, rising 88% year-over-year to $61.7 billion. Meanwhile, Tether’s market value climbed 40% to $158.3 billion during the same period, underscoring both stablecoins’ expanding footprint amid rising institutional and retail adoption.

It will launch the product in cooperation with HSBC using its Orion platform. The blockchain-enabled bond will be issued by the First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), which also recently announced it is working to issue an AED stablecoin . As per the press release , the upcoming blockchain-enabled digital bond listing represents a landmark step in ADX’s mission to lead financial innovation and support Abu Dhabi’s digital transformation agenda. ADX taps HSBC and FAB in digital bond launch The Blockchain-enabled bond is powered by HSBC Orion, which is operated by the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) in Hong Kong and structured with support from leading international law firms. This will allow global investors to access the digital bond through accounts held with CMU Euroclear and Clearstream, onboarding onto HSBC Orion as a direct participant, or via their existing custodian who can participate through one of the above options. ADX considers this an introduction to tokenized finance. Digital bonds, fixed-income securities issued and recorded on blockchain technology, offer operational efficiencies, improved settlement cycles, reduced counterparty risk, improved security and enhanced transparency for institutional investors. Abdulla Salem Alnuaimi, Group Chief Executive Officer of ADX, stated that this marked a defining moment in transforming capital markets through innovation by ensuring the bond’s seamless integration with existing post-trade infrastructure and compatibility with global settlement standards. He added, “This initiative not only expands access to institutional-grade digital instruments, but also lays the foundation for a broader class of tokenized assets—including green bonds, sukuk, and real estate-linked products.” Additionally, Lars Kramer, Group Chief Financial Officer at First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), noted that this is a milestone for FAB as it becomes the first issuer of a blockchain-based digital bond in MENA. He stated, “By transforming traditional settlement processes into seamless digital workflows, we are not only advancing FAB’s digital transformation but also supporting investors navigate the global digital assets landscape. This bond issuance accelerates the development of a robust digital capital markets ecosystem in the UAE.” HSBC Orion facilitated the European Investment Bank’s first digital bond Speaking on behalf of HSBC, Mohamed Al Marzooqi, Chief Executive Officer, UAE, HSBC Bank Middle East Limited said he believes that the launch using HSBC Orion shows how the bank is transforming the promise of tokenization into a reality that will bolster the MENA region’s capital markets and make them more transparent, efficient and accessible to investors. Since its launch, HSBC Orion has led the way in the digitalization of capital market infrastructure. It facilitated the launch of the European Investment Bank’s first digital bond in pound sterling, and the world’s first multi-currency digital bond offering as well as the largest digital bond issuance for the HKSAR Government.

Under the plan , items genuinely produced in Vietnam face a 20% duty, while those judged to be merely passing through will have a 40% levy. Analysts say the success of this approach will rest on how strictly “Made in Vietnam” is defined and enforced, reports Bloomberg . China uses Vietnam as a route into US markets The new framework follows years of Chinese firms shifting parts of their supply chains into Southeast Asia to avoid higher US tariffs. Much of Vietnam’s exports, such as earbuds, cellphones and other electronics, are assembled locally using imported Chinese components before shipping to the United States. It’s legal, but it makes it hard to tell which products really come from Vietnam. Roland Rajah, from Sydney’s Lowy Institute, cautions that the critical factor will be where Washington draws the line for the steeper duty. “A lot will depend on how the 40% tariffs are applied.” He continued, “If the approach is too broad and blunt, then it could be quite damaging”. Data from the Sydney think tank indicates that in 2022, almost 28% of Vietnam’s US-bound exports contained Chinese-made inputs, up sharply from roughly 9% in 2018. Meanwhile, Chief Economist Pham Luu Hung notes that in 2021, rerouted shipments represented about 16.5% of Vietnam’s exports to America. He believes that share has likely fallen more recently, as both countries have stepped up origin checks. “An important caveat is that the rules of origin remain under negotiation.” Hung adds, “In practice, these rules may have a greater impact than the tariff rates themselves.” Yet some analysts doubt the pact will fully block indirect Chinese exports . Duncan Wrigley at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “The devil is in the details, but I think China’s exports will either go via other markets to the US, or some value-added will be done in Vietnam”. Southeast Asian authorities crack down on fake origin labels This year, trade between South Asia and China has surged. Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia have all reported record inbound shipments from China. Citigroup economists point out a strong link between those rises and the volume of Southeast Asian exports bound for America. Across the region, authorities have moved to show they are cracking down. In April, South Korea’s customs seized over $20 million in goods mislabeled to hide their true origin, most were meant for the US market. In May, Malaysia’s Airfreight Forwarders Association warned that Chinese brokers were offering illegal rerouting schemes online. Malaysia has since centralized its origin certificate system under the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry, backed by customs enforcement. Thailand has added items like solar panels and auto parts to a high-risk roster and is weighing tougher penalties for offenders. Cambodian exporters are already being affected. Casey Barnett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, says customs officials now meticulously inspect shipments headed for US retailers. This includes Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s. He notes that export paperwork has grown heavier and processing times have doubled to as long as two weeks. In comparison, Indonesia still issues origin certificates swiftly for marked exports based on a letter and a list of products to the local trade office. Soon after Trump put in place his April 2 “ Liberation Day ” tariffs, Chinese firms offered to help Indonesian clothing makers reroute their shipments, said Redma Gita Wirawasta, head of the Indonesian Filament Yarn and Fiber Producers Association. For now, both sides say they will finalize the rules soon. But because traders can still find loopholes and supply chains are complex, the deal will only work if inspections are strict and origin rules are clear. Otherwise, shipments will just go another way, and the problem will stay.

The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

A significant development is on the horizon that could dramatically reshape the landscape of digital assets in the United States. Next week, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee GOP is set to hold a crucial full committee hearing on the CLARITY Act, a key piece of legislation aimed at defining the U.S. crypto market structure. This isn’t just another committee meeting; it’s a pivotal moment that could bring much-needed clarity and direction to the rapidly evolving crypto space. The CLARITY Act: Unpacking What It Means for Crypto Regulation So, what exactly is the CLARITY Act, and why is everyone talking about it? While the full text and specifics are still being closely watched, the CLARITY Act (which stands for “Certainty for Digital Asset Transactions Act of 2023”) is designed to provide a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. For years, the U.S. crypto market has operated under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty, with different agencies asserting jurisdiction and a lack of consistent rules. This proposed legislation aims to: Define Digital Assets: Clearly categorize various digital assets, distinguishing between securities, commodities, and other types of tokens. This is crucial for determining which regulatory body (e.g., SEC or CFTC) has oversight. Establish Regulatory Authority: Assign specific regulatory responsibilities to agencies, reducing jurisdictional disputes and providing a predictable environment for businesses. Foster Innovation: Create a framework that encourages technological advancement in the blockchain and crypto sectors within the U.S., rather than stifling it. Protect Consumers: Implement safeguards for investors and users, ensuring transparency and accountability in digital asset transactions. The core idea behind the CLARITY Act is to move beyond enforcement actions and instead provide a foundational set of rules that allow the industry to grow responsibly. This hearing is a vital step in that legislative journey, offering a platform for key stakeholders to voice their perspectives. Why This Senate Hearing is Crucial for the U.S. Crypto Market The upcoming Senate Hearing is more than just a procedural step; it’s a direct engagement with the future of the U.S. crypto market. The fact that the Senate Banking Committee is dedicating a full hearing to this legislation underscores its importance. This isn’t a niche topic anymore; it’s a mainstream financial and technological concern. The witnesses invited to testify further highlight the gravity of the situation: Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple: Ripple has been at the forefront of a high-profile legal battle with the SEC, which has significantly impacted the perception of XRP and the broader crypto industry. Garlinghouse’s insights will be invaluable, bringing a perspective shaped by direct experience with regulatory ambiguity and enforcement actions. His testimony could shed light on the real-world impact of current regulations and the urgent need for comprehensive digital asset legislation. Summer Mersinger, CEO of Blockchain Association: As the head of a leading advocacy group for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, Mersinger represents a wide array of businesses and innovators. Her testimony is expected to articulate the industry’s collective desire for clear rules that promote growth, protect consumers, and maintain U.S. competitiveness in the global digital economy. Jonathan Levin, CEO of Chainalysis: Chainalysis is a prominent blockchain analysis company that works closely with governments and businesses on compliance and illicit activity detection. Levin’s perspective will emphasize the importance of robust frameworks for combating financial crime and ensuring market integrity, offering a crucial balance to discussions around innovation. The diverse expertise of these witnesses ensures a comprehensive discussion, covering everything from market operations and innovation to compliance and consumer protection. Their testimonies will directly influence how senators perceive the challenges and opportunities within the crypto space, shaping the direction of future crypto regulation. The Road Ahead for Crypto Regulation in the U.S. While the CLARITY Act hearing is a significant step, the path to comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. is complex and multifaceted. The challenges are numerous, including: Jurisdictional Disputes: The ongoing debate between the SEC and CFTC over which agency should primarily regulate various digital assets continues to create uncertainty. The CLARITY Act aims to resolve this, but legislative consensus is hard-won. Technological Complexity: The rapid pace of innovation in blockchain technology often outstrips the ability of traditional regulatory frameworks to adapt. Crafting legislation that is future-proof yet effective is a major hurdle. Political Divides: Achieving bipartisan agreement on such a novel and impactful area of law requires significant negotiation and compromise. However, the opportunities are equally vast. Clear regulation could unlock massive investment, foster a more secure environment for users, and solidify the U.S. as a leader in the global digital asset economy. This hearing represents a proactive effort by lawmakers to engage with these complexities and work towards a solution. Digital Asset Legislation: What It Means for You Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor, a developer building on blockchain, or simply curious about the future of finance, the outcome of this hearing and the progress of the CLARITY Act will affect you. Here’s what it could mean: For Investors: Greater clarity on which assets are regulated by whom could lead to more stable markets and better consumer protections against fraud and manipulation. For Businesses and Developers: A defined regulatory landscape means less uncertainty for launching new projects, raising capital, and operating within the U.S. This could spur significant innovation and job creation. For Financial Institutions: Traditional finance institutions may find it easier to engage with digital assets if clear guidelines are in place, potentially leading to broader adoption and integration of crypto into mainstream financial services. It’s an opportunity for the industry to move beyond the “Wild West” narrative and towards a mature, regulated environment that benefits all participants. Key Players and Their Influence on the CLARITY Act The individuals testifying at this hearing are not just figureheads; they are central to the ongoing discourse surrounding digital asset legislation. Brad Garlinghouse’s testimony will likely focus on the need for a clear distinction between digital assets used for utility versus those deemed securities, advocating for a framework that supports innovation without stifling it through outdated regulations. Summer Mersinger, representing the Blockchain Association, will undoubtedly push for a framework that encourages U.S. competitiveness and innovation, emphasizing the economic benefits of a thriving digital asset sector. Jonathan Levin of Chainalysis will bring the perspective of market integrity and security, highlighting how effective regulation can also enhance trust and prevent illicit activities. Their collective input will provide the Senate Banking Committee with a well-rounded view of the industry’s needs, challenges, and potential, directly influencing the final shape and direction of the CLARITY Act and broader crypto regulation efforts. A Moment of Reckoning and Opportunity The upcoming U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing on the CLARITY Act is undoubtedly a pivotal moment for the U.S. crypto market. With influential voices like Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, the Blockchain Association’s Summer Mersinger, and Chainalysis’s Jonathan Levin set to testify, the discussions will be robust and far-reaching. This hearing is a significant step towards achieving much-needed crypto regulation, aiming to bring certainty, foster innovation, and enhance consumer protection in the digital asset space. The outcome could set a precedent for how digital asset legislation evolves, not just in the U.S. but potentially globally, shaping the future of finance for years to come. The industry and policymakers are at a crucial juncture, and the world will be watching.

The altcoin stands to extend its multi-month decline into the new month, with bullish sentiment still scarce as these developments fail to trigger a lasting uptrend. Cardano remains vulnerable to broader macro narratives, with weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data and the looming July 8 “Liberation Day” tariff pause expiry fueling fresh FUD. President Donald Trump says he is not considering delaying his July 9 deadline for higher tariffs to resume and renews his threat to cut off talks and impose duty rates on several nations, including Japan https://t.co/euXZd60N6g pic.twitter.com/IMwXDnOzYC — Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) July 1, 2025 Cardano Lags Behind Fundamentals – Crisis for ADA? Mid-June saw the Cardano narrative strengthen with plans for full integration into the XRP ecosystem—an interoperability step aimed at strengthening cross-chain liquidity. Late June added further optimism as Coinbase unveiled cbADA, a wrapped version of ADA on Base, enabling Cardano holders to participate in dApps within the Coinbase ecosystem. While these fundamentals signal long-term adoption and increased utility for ADA, CoinGlass data shows that they have done little as a catalyst for Cardano price moves. ADA spot net outflows over June. Source: Coinglass. Net spot market outflows totalled $182.1 million for the four weeks of June, the brunt of which occurred alongside the XRP and Coinbase announcements. This pattern of outflows stretching back to February could soon reach its boiling point as the percentage of ADA supply in profit fell anothe 27% over June, according to Santiment data . 46% of hodlers now grapple with unrealised losses, creating further downside risk as steady outflows continue to erode conviction among bulls. ADA supply in profit declines over June. Source: Santiment. Cardano Price Analysis – Is it Time to Sell? While fundamental catalysts fail to catch on, early bullishness is creeping into the daily chart with the breakout of a triple bottom pattern feeding into a much larger move. ADA / USDT 1-day chart, triple bottom fuels descending triangle breakout. Source: TradingView, Binance. The consolidation range formed between $0.60 and the accumulation zone above the lower support of an 8-month descending triangle around $0.51 has broken out in a triple bottom. With the neckline cleared, the Cardano price targets its last local top around $0.73. Crucially, this would clear the key $0.65 threshold for a breakout of the triangle, opening the path to a wider move towards $1.44—a potential 137% gain from current levels. Momentum indicators support this outlook. The RSI has kicked off July in a sharp uptrend, hovering just below the neutral 50 line at 49, flirting with bullish territory. The MACD line reads similarly, widening its gap above the signal line after a recent golden cross—often an early sign that a new short-term uptrend is taking shape. If buying pressure continues and the triple bottom plays out, July could mark the beginning of a long-awaited reversal for ADA. If the $0.60 neckline fails to hold, Cardano risks invalidating the current bullish setup. A breakdown from the triangle eyes key support level at the 2024 U.S. election market bottom around $0.31.

As of now, it is trading at $154.82, boasting a market cap of $82.75 billion and a 24-hour spot volume of $4.08 billion. While the price reaction may not seem explosive, experts are optimistic with recent market events, believing that SOL could soon surpass the $300 mark . Why Is SOL Up 7%? Bitcoin serves as the primary gateway and confidence booster for the entire crypto market, which has turned green, lifting not just BTC but also altcoins like Solana. As the saying goes, “When it rains, it pours,” and this sentiment is evident as Bitcoin has surged to $109.8K today, igniting a wave of FOMO across social platforms . The increase in social volume reflects a growing belief among retail investors that Bitcoin’s price could soar to between $120K and $160K by early July. $SSK ended day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch) but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/t6LkQwDXLc — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 Adding to the positive momentum, the recent launch of the Rex-Osprey Solana staking ETF has captured attention. James Seyffart reported that it reached $8 million in trading volume within just 20 minutes, while Eric Balchunas noted that it ended the day with an impressive $33 million. With rising interest in Solana, Seyffart and Balchunas have pegged a 95% chance that spot Solana ETFs will be approved by the end of the year. The optimism in the air has surged, market is full of excitement, and investors are keenly waiting for Solana crypto’s rise. Analyst Predicts- Solana price To Hit $300 Recently, the Solana price surged nearly 7%, yet it remains below the 200-day EMA band, currently sitting at $159.40. This uptick comes on the heels of high trading volume, particularly around the “fixed range volume profile” at $144.65. In the short term, if Solana can flip the 200-day EMA, it could set its sights on $185 in July. Achieving this would signify a Break of Structure (BoS), allowing the cryptocurrency to resume its Q2 uptrend that began in April, as clearly illustrated on the daily chart. [post_titles_links postid=”478103″] Similarly, experts are optimistic, believing that the short-term downtrend from mid-May to June has been reversed, with a target of $300 now appearing likely. However, as its said , “Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.” If Solana fails to maintain its upward momentum, it could retreat to the $125 support level. A further decline could even push the price back to the April lows of $95.

Key Takeaways: Webus secured up to $100 million in funding to back its XRP treasury plans. The firm set a $300 million mandate for XRP operations, aiming to expand crypto payments and loyalty programs. Webus shares spiked 130% on the news before settling around $2.40. The senior equity line of credit will enable Webus to access tranches ranging from $250,000 to $3 million over a 24-month period, pending regulatory approvals. Webus said the funding will support its XRP treasury strategy, including crypto-enabled payments, blockchain-based loyalty programs, and expansion across key markets in North America and Asia-Pacific. Webus Sets $300M Mandate for XRP Treasury The announcement comes on the heels of Webus establishing a Delegated Digital-Asset Management Agreement with a mandate cap of up to $300 million for XRP treasury operations. Shares of Webus initially surged 130% following the news but later retreated, with the stock trading around $2.40 at press time, according to Yahoo Finance. Webus CEO Nan Zheng described the agreement as a strong vote of confidence in the company’s approach, noting that the flexible structure of the credit line allows Webus to raise capital as needed while limiting dilution for existing shareholders. “We believe this will help us accelerate the growth across North America and Asia-Pacific, and strengthen our leadership in crypto-powered premium mobility,” Zheng said. While little is publicly known about Ripple Strategy Holdings, its name suggests a focus on XRP-related investments. The entity is not affiliated with Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP Ledger and XRP token.

Later, on June 11, VivoPower, a publicly listed firm, announced a partnership with the Flare blockchain to generate yield from its XRP holdings. Ripple Drops Cross-Appeal Against SEC to Resolve Case Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed the company will withdraw its cross-appeal against the SEC, adding that the regulator is also expected to drop its own appeal. The announcement followed a U.S. district court decision rejecting a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty and overturn the ruling that classified Ripple’s institutional XRP sales as securities transactions. In her ruling, Judge Analisa Torres noted Ripple’s readiness to “push the boundaries” of the earlier summary judgment, suggesting a risk of future violations. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the firm faced a choice between dropping the appeal or continuing to contest the finding. He emphasized that regardless of the decision, “XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged,” and assured that Ripple’s business operations would continue as usual.

With potential growth of up to 95%, these digital assets could be on the verge of a major breakout. This article uncovers these promising tokens and explores why they might be set to surge in the near future. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Pi Network: Mining Crypto on Your Phone—No Hardware Needed Pi Network is shaking up the cryptocurrency world by making mining accessible to everyone with a smartphone. Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates, this mobile-first platform allows users to mine Pi coins simply by checking in daily on the app. Unlike Bitcoin, which requires specialized hardware and consumes vast amounts of energy, Pi uses an energy-efficient consensus algorithm that doesn't drain your battery or data. By nominating trusted contacts, users create a network of verified members, forming a global trust graph that secures the network without massive computing power. With its user-friendly approach and focus on social cryptocurrency, Pi Network has the potential to democratize digital money. Its innovative use of the Stellar Consensus Protocol allows for secure, efficient transactions. As the project moves towards its open network phase, the ability to transfer mined Pi to the blockchain could increase its appeal. In the current market cycle, where energy efficiency and accessibility are key trends, Pi stands out compared to energy-intensive coins like Bitcoin. While it's still in development and not yet listed on major exchanges, its growing community and unique approach make it an interesting project to watch. Hyperliquid Brings Speed and Savings to Decentralized Trading Hyperliquid is a fresh face in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). It's built to make DeFi applications faster and more efficient. Hyperliquid has its own unique blockchain designed from scratch for speed and scalability. It uses a special system called HyperBFT to ensure transactions are quick and secure.

Groups representing tech firms like Google , Meta, and Mistral are pushing for the EU to delay the Act by years, and they have even got some politicians on their side. Over 40 EU tech groups have lobbied for a pause Passed after intense wrangling among member states last year, the AI Act rolls out its rules in stages. The next major checkpoint is August 2, when obligations for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models kick in. This category covers the likes of Google’s and OpenAI’s foundation models, as well as emerging players like Mistral . From that date, GPAI developers must compile detailed technical documentation, obey EU copyright law, and supply summaries of the data used to train their algorithms. Moreover, before these systems can go live, firms will need to run checks for bias, toxicity and stability. Those models deemed high-impact or posing systemic risk face even stricter duties: they will have to carry out comprehensive risk assessments, adversarial attack tests, report serious incidents to the Commission and disclose how energy-hungry their services are. For many AI outfits, these new demands translate into hefty compliance bills. And that’s just the start. They are also flying blind because the promised guidance to help them hit the new rules’ mark hasn’t appeared. The so-called AI Code of Practice, slated for publication by May 2, never materialized, leaving developers in the dark about how to draft the required paperwork or set up toxicity tests. In an open letter released last Thursday, 45 European tech groups urged the Commission to impose a two‑year “clock‑stop” ahead of August’s deadline, arguing that rushing ahead without clear standards will only sow confusion and possibly stifle innovation in Europe, where teams tackling regulation are generally meaner than their US counterparts. “To address the uncertainty this situation is creating, we urge the Commission to propose a two-year ‘clock-stop’ on the AI Act before key obligations enter into force,” said the open letter . They also want the rules simplified, so startups aren’t driven overseas by red tape. The EU has discretion to deal with the concerns So far, the European Commission has not signaled any intention to shift the August 2 date. Yet EU digital chief Henna Virkkunen has vowed to publish the awaited Code of Practice before next month, acknowledging the scramble firms face. Meanwhile, political heavyweights are chiming in. Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson labeled parts of the AI rulebook “confusing” and asked for a breather, while the tech lobby group CCIA Europe similarly called for a “stop-the-clock” move to grant legal certainty until the missing standards arrive. “A bold ‘stop-the-clock’ intervention is urgently needed to give AI developers and deployers legal certainty, as long as necessary standards remain unavailable or delayed.” CCIA Europe. There’s precedent for such delays. In 2024, Brussels pushed back its Deforestation Regulation by a year; earlier this spring, it fast‑tracked amendments to corporate sustainability directives in under two months. But to pull off a postponement for GPAI obligations, lawmakers would have to act swiftly; the European Parliament’s last plenary before summer recess starts the week of July 7, and any deal needs sealing before the July 10 cutoff. That leaves a tight window, one that will test whether the EU possesses both the will and the agility to pause its AI ambitions without derailing them. Yet tech firms are already concerned that the bloc is overly restrictive when it comes to tech regulations, with firms like Meta and Google complaining that the rules hamper innovation.

Imagine a future where tangible assets, from real estate to precious metals, are seamlessly integrated into the blockchain, offering unprecedented liquidity and transparency. This exciting convergence is precisely what the Real-World Assets (RWA) space promises, and a major player, Hancom With , is now making a significant stride into this arena, focusing on one of the oldest and most trusted forms of wealth: gold. What are Real-World Assets (RWA) and Why Are They Crucial for Digital Assets? Before diving into Hancom With’s latest venture, let’s understand what Real-World Assets (RWA) truly are. Simply put, RWAs are physical or tangible assets — like real estate, commodities, art, or even intellectual property — that are tokenized and brought onto a blockchain. This process transforms illiquid assets into liquid, programmable digital tokens, opening them up to a global, 24/7 market. The significance of RWAs cannot be overstated. They offer: Increased Liquidity: Traditional assets can be difficult and slow to trade. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership and easier transferability. Greater Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear record of ownership and transactions. Enhanced Accessibility: Investors worldwide can access opportunities previously limited by geographical or financial barriers. Reduced Costs: Streamlined processes can cut down on intermediaries and associated fees. This integration of traditional finance with blockchain technology is a pivotal step towards mainstream adoption of digital assets , creating a more robust and inclusive financial ecosystem. Hancom With’s Strategic Move: Diving into the Gold-Backed Stablecoin Market Hancom With , the blockchain arm of South Korean software giant Hancom Group, has officially announced its entry into the burgeoning RWA space . This isn’t just a casual foray; it’s a strategic initiative led by its sister company, Arowana Hub, with a clear focus on gold-backed stablecoins. This move signifies a deep understanding of the market’s demand for stable, reliable digital assets. Hancom Group, with its established reputation in the software industry, brings a layer of corporate credibility and technical expertise to the often volatile crypto market. Their decision to enter the RWA sector, specifically with a gold-backed stablecoin, highlights a commitment to creating practical, utility-driven blockchain solutions that appeal to both crypto natives and traditional investors. Introducing the Arowana Gold Token (AGT): A New Standard for Digital Gold At the heart of Hancom With’s RWA strategy is the Arowana Gold Token (AGT) . This digital asset is designed to be a groundbreaking gold-backed stablecoin , aiming to set new benchmarks for transparency and reliability in the digital gold market. Here’s how AGT plans to achieve this: Feature Description Benefit to Users Chainlink Oracles Utilizes Chainlink’s decentralized oracle networks to accurately track global gold prices in real-time. Ensures the token’s value precisely reflects the underlying gold market, minimizing price discrepancies. Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) Implements a robust Proof-of-Reserves system, verified by a third-party auditor, to confirm full collateral backing. Provides verifiable assurance that every AGT is fully backed by physical gold, enhancing trust and security. Proprietary Platform Arowana Hub has built its own platform to support AGT issuance and related financial services. Offers a dedicated, streamlined ecosystem for AGT management, facilitating ease of use and integration. Closed Beta Testing Set to begin closed beta testing later this month. Indicates a commitment to rigorous testing and refinement before public launch, ensuring stability and functionality. The combination of Chainlink’s industry-leading data feeds and a transparent Proof-of-Reserves system positions the Arowana Gold Token as a highly credible and secure option for those seeking exposure to gold in a digital format. This approach directly addresses common concerns about the backing and transparency of stablecoins. The Promise of a Gold-Backed Stablecoin: Stability Meets Blockchain Innovation Why gold? In times of economic uncertainty, gold has historically served as a reliable store of value and a hedge against inflation. A gold-backed stablecoin like AGT marries this traditional stability with the inherent advantages of blockchain innovation . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins aim to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies or commodities. For investors, a gold-backed stablecoin offers: Inflation Hedge: A digital asset that retains value during inflationary periods. Diversification: A way to diversify crypto portfolios with a less volatile asset. Fractional Ownership: Enables investment in gold without the need to purchase large, physical quantities. Global Accessibility: Tradeable 24/7 on blockchain networks, bypassing traditional banking hours and geographical restrictions. The transparency offered by blockchain technology, coupled with third-party audits, aims to build unparalleled trust in the digital representation of gold. This could significantly broaden the appeal of digital assets to a wider demographic, including institutional investors who prioritize stability and verifiable backing. How This Blockchain Innovation Sets New Standards in the RWA Space The efforts by Hancom With and Arowana Hub represent more than just another stablecoin launch; they embody significant blockchain innovation that could redefine how we interact with physical assets. By creating a robust, audited system for tokenizing gold, they are addressing critical challenges in the RWA space: Trust and Verification: The PoR system with third-party auditing is crucial for building trust. It moves beyond simple claims of backing to provable, verifiable reserves. Real-Time Data Integrity: Integration with Chainlink oracles ensures that the digital token’s value is always synchronized with the real-world asset’s market price, preventing arbitrage opportunities and maintaining peg integrity. Scalability and Services: Building a proprietary platform for issuance and financial services suggests a long-term vision for scaling operations and offering a suite of related products, which is vital for sustained growth in the RWA space . This comprehensive approach positions AGT as a leader in the tokenized gold market and sets a high bar for future RWA projects. It demonstrates how traditional companies can leverage decentralized technologies to create more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial products. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Digital Gold While the prospects for the Arowana Gold Token and the broader RWA space are bright, challenges remain. Regulatory clarity is still evolving globally, and the adoption of tokenized assets by mainstream financial institutions will depend heavily on robust legal frameworks and investor education. Overcoming these hurdles will be key to the widespread success of initiatives like AGT. However, the commitment of established firms like Hancom With signals a growing confidence in the underlying technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. The forthcoming closed beta testing for AGT will be a crucial step in refining the platform and demonstrating its capabilities to potential users and partners. A Glimpse into the Future: What’s Next for Digital Assets? The entry of Hancom With into the gold-backed stablecoin market is a testament to the increasing maturity and utility of blockchain technology. As more traditional assets find their way onto the blockchain, we can expect a seismic shift in how wealth is stored, transferred, and utilized. The Arowana Gold Token is not just a digital representation of gold; it’s a blueprint for the future of finance, where transparency, accessibility, and security are paramount. This pioneering effort could inspire many more such ventures, accelerating the adoption of digital assets and truly blurring the lines between the physical and digital economies. Summary In summary, Hancom With , through Arowana Hub, is making a strategic and significant entry into the Real-World Assets (RWA) sector with its innovative Arowana Gold Token (AGT) . This gold-backed stablecoin leverages Chainlink oracles for real-time price tracking and a robust, third-party-audited Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) system to ensure full collateral backing. By combining the stability of gold with the transparency and efficiency of blockchain innovation , AGT aims to provide a secure and accessible way for investors to engage with digital assets . This initiative not only expands Hancom With’s footprint but also sets a new standard for trust and reliability within the rapidly growing RWA ecosystem, paving the way for a more integrated financial future.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $109,672 as buyers eye the $110,000 mark. BTC’s rally was driven by President Trump’s announcement that the US had struck a trade deal with Vietnam to lower tariffs on exported goods from 46% to 20%. Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Fall To Seven-Year Low Bitcoin (BTC) exchange reserves have dropped below 15% for the first time since 2018, according to data from Glassnode. A drop in Bitcoin supply could indicate an incoming price rally driven by a “supply shock.” A supply shock occurs when strong buyer demand is met with low BTC supply. Falling exchange reserves are typically associated with growing investor confidence and a shift towards long-term holding patterns. During such events, investors transfer their Bitcoin to cold wallets, reducing the liquid supply of the asset. Bitcoin whales often withdraw their assets from exchanges when the market enters an accumulation phase. Over-the-counter (OTC) desks are also facing a tightening supply. These desks facilitate large, private cryptocurrency trades by matching buyers and sellers. However, they depend on maintaining BTC reserves for swift and reliable trade execution. The cumulative balance of BTC held in known OTC addresses is at historic lows. CryptoQuant data showed a 21% decline in OTC address balances linked to miners since January. BlackRock Earns More Annual Fees From Bitcoin ETF Than Flagship S&P 500 Fund BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is earning more in annual fees from its spot Bitcoin ETF than from its flagship S&P 500 fund. NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci stated, “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF has over $75 billion in assets under management (AUM), and has generated $187.2 million in annual fees, $100,000 more than the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). IVV, launched in 2000, is eight times larger than IBIT and holds $624 billion in assets under management (AUM). However, it charges almost nine times less at just 0.03%. Crypto executives were quick to praise the report, with Anthony Pompliano stating, “BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund. Bitcoin has Wall Street's full, undivided attention now.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is eying a move past $110,000 as market sentiment turned bullish after President Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week in the red, dropping 1.09% on Monday and 1.33% on Tuesday to settle at $105,742. However, market sentiment flipped to bullish on Wednesday and BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. The price reached an intraday high of $110,281 during the ongoing session before declining to current levels. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied past $109,000 on Wednesday on the back of the global money supply (M2) reaching a new all-time high above $55 trillion. The price increase was outlined by a spike in derivatives activity, indicating renewed momentum. Open interest (OI) across major exchanges rose by 10% or $3.2 billion, thanks to a significant increase in capital in the market. The price increase was primarily driven by long positions, suggesting investor confidence in further upside. The recent price jump has prompted analyst optimism about an imminent new all-time high. According to Rekt Capital, a record weekly close above $109,000 could put BTC above its final resistance zone, unlocking price discovery and pushing it to new highs. BTC traded in the red the previous weekend, dropping 1.17% on Saturday and plunging below $100,000 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified. The price fell to an intraday low of $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,985. Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66%, crossing the moving averages and $106,000 to settle at $106,137. BTC continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 1.19% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline to slip below $107,000 and settle at $106,980. Source: TradingView BTC recovered despite the overwhelming selling pressure, rising 0.14% on Friday and 0.20% on Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose nearly 1%, crossing $108,000 and settling at $108,350.

While digital assets often march to their own beat, traditional financial markets, especially the Forex market , exert significant influence on global liquidity, investor sentiment, and ultimately, the flow of capital into and out of crypto. This week, attention is squarely on Asia FX , which appears to be treading water, while the US Dollar holds remarkably steady. Why the calm before what could be a storm? The answer lies in two pivotal economic events looming on the horizon: the highly anticipated Trump tax bill developments and the eagerly awaited Nonfarm Payrolls report. Why is Asia FX Treading Water Amidst Global Uncertainty? The currencies across Asia have largely remained subdued, exhibiting minimal movement despite a backdrop of evolving global narratives. This cautious stance by Asia FX isn’t arbitrary; it reflects a wait-and-see approach as markets brace for significant catalysts from the United States. While some regional currencies might see minor fluctuations based on local economic indicators, the overarching trend is one of consolidation. Investors are holding their breath, reluctant to make significant directional bets until there’s greater clarity on key external factors. External Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on global trade and capital flows, making their currencies susceptible to shifts in major economies, particularly the U.S. Risk Aversion: Periods of uncertainty often lead to a flight to safety, which typically benefits the US Dollar , putting pressure on emerging market currencies. Policy Watch: Central banks in Asia are also closely monitoring U.S. economic data and policy decisions, which directly impact their own monetary policy considerations. The Steady Hand of the US Dollar: What’s Keeping it Firm? Despite the various global headwinds, the US Dollar has maintained a remarkably steady footing against a basket of major currencies. This resilience is a testament to its enduring status as a global reserve currency and a safe-haven asset. The dollar’s stability is not merely a reflection of current market conditions but also an anticipation of future economic direction, heavily influenced by upcoming legislative and economic data releases. Several factors contribute to the dollar’s current strength: Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of geopolitical or economic uncertainty, investors often flock to the dollar, viewing it as a secure store of value. Interest Rate Expectations: Anticipation of future interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve continues to provide underlying support for the dollar, as higher rates typically attract foreign capital. Economic Data Focus: The market’s intense focus on U.S. economic data, particularly employment figures and inflation, underpins the dollar’s valuation. Any strong data points tend to reinforce the bullish sentiment for the dollar. This stability in the US Dollar has a ripple effect across the Forex market , influencing everything from commodity prices to the competitiveness of export-oriented nations. Unpacking the Trump Tax Bill: A Game-Changer for the US Economy? One of the primary drivers of market focus is the ongoing development surrounding the Trump tax bill . This proposed legislation, aimed at significant corporate and individual tax cuts, holds the potential to reshape the U.S. economic landscape and, by extension, global financial markets. The market’s current steadiness is partly due to the high expectations surrounding its passage, with investors pricing in the potential for increased corporate profits, capital expenditure, and economic growth. Key aspects of the Trump tax bill and its potential implications include: Corporate Tax Reduction: A substantial cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% (or similar figures) is expected to boost corporate earnings, potentially leading to increased stock buybacks, dividends, and business investment. This could attract more foreign direct investment into the U.S., further strengthening the US Dollar . Repatriation of Overseas Profits: The bill aims to encourage U.S. companies to bring back trillions of dollars held overseas. This influx of capital could create significant demand for the dollar, providing another boost to its value. Individual Tax Cuts: While perhaps less impactful on corporate earnings, individual tax cuts could stimulate consumer spending, contributing to overall economic growth. Market Volatility: Any significant roadblocks or unexpected changes in the bill’s progression could introduce volatility into the markets, affecting both the dollar and global equities. The Forex market is particularly sensitive to these legislative shifts. The market is essentially waiting for concrete signs of the bill’s progress, with each legislative hurdle cleared providing further confidence and potentially leading to a more definitive directional move for the US Dollar and consequently, for Asia FX . Nonfarm Payrolls: The Next Big Economic Barometer? Beyond fiscal policy, the upcoming Nonfarm Payrolls report is arguably the most anticipated piece of economic data this week. This monthly report provides a comprehensive snapshot of the U.S. labor market, including the number of jobs added, the unemployment rate, and average hourly earnings. Its significance cannot be overstated, as it serves as a critical indicator for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Why is the Nonfarm Payrolls report so impactful? Monetary Policy Clues: A strong jobs report, particularly with rising wage growth, often signals a robust economy, increasing the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Higher interest rates typically make a currency more attractive to foreign investors, thus strengthening the US Dollar . Consumer Spending Indicator: Employment and wage growth directly impact consumer confidence and spending, which are major drivers of economic activity. Market Expectations: The market meticulously analyzes every detail of the Nonfarm Payrolls report. Significant deviations from consensus forecasts can trigger sharp movements in currency pairs, bond yields, and equity markets. Impact on Asia FX: A stronger dollar, driven by positive payrolls data and subsequent rate hike expectations, could put renewed downward pressure on Asia FX , making their exports less competitive and potentially leading to capital outflows. Conversely, a weaker report could ease pressure on Asian currencies. Traders and analysts will be dissecting this report for any signs of inflation pressures or shifts in the labor market’s underlying health, which will directly influence the dollar’s trajectory and, by extension, the broader Forex market . Navigating the Global Forex Market: Actionable Insights for Investors Understanding these macro drivers is not just for economists; it’s vital for any investor, including those in the crypto space. The interplay between the Trump tax bill , Nonfarm Payrolls , the strength of the US Dollar , and the reaction of Asia FX creates a complex but navigable landscape. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor U.S. Economic Data Closely: Beyond payrolls, keep an eye on inflation data, retail sales, and manufacturing indices. Strong data generally supports a stronger dollar. Track Legislative Progress: Follow news on the Trump tax bill . Its passage or failure will have significant implications for market sentiment and capital flows. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the dollar’s strength can impact various asset classes, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Consider how traditional market movements might indirectly affect your crypto holdings. Understand Correlation: Recognize that while crypto often operates independently, periods of extreme dollar strength or weakness, or significant global economic shifts, can still influence liquidity and investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Stay Informed on Central Bank Policies: The Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates is paramount. Pay attention to their statements and minutes. The Forex market is a constant ebb and flow, driven by a myriad of factors. Staying informed about these key economic and political developments is paramount for making informed decisions. Conclusion: The Path Forward for Asia FX and the Dollar The current state of Asia FX treading water and the US Dollar holding steady is a classic example of markets pausing before significant data releases. The convergence of the Trump tax bill ‘s legislative journey and the highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls report creates a pivotal moment for global financial markets. Investors are keenly watching for clarity, as the outcomes of these events will likely dictate the short-to-medium term direction for the dollar, influence capital flows, and set the tone for risk appetite across various asset classes, including the crypto market. While the immediate future for Asia FX remains tied to these U.S. developments, the underlying strength of regional economies will eventually play a more dominant role. For now, the spotlight remains firmly on Washington and the economic indicators emanating from there. Understanding these macro currents is essential for anyone looking to navigate the complex, interconnected world of global finance.

According to an earnings report published Friday, Remixpoint’s crypto holdings surged from just $446,500 on March 31, 2024, to $38 million by December 31, 2024. By February 2025, the company had expanded its crypto portfolio to approximately $59.1 million, representing a 13,000% increase in just nine months, as it moves closer to its $65 million investment target. Notably, the company’s diversified cryptocurrency portfolio includes substantial holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. This strategic move, similar to fellow Japanese company Metaplanet, which has been doubling down on Bitcoin , aims to hedge against the declining value of the yen and broaden Remixpoint’s financial assets. Once regarded primarily as a speculative cryptocurrency propelled by retail traders and online communities, Dogecoin is now gaining traction among institutional investors. Remixpoint’s inclusion of DOGE in its portfolio highlights the evolving perception of the cryptocurrency, which has transitioned from a meme coin to a functional digital asset with expanding real-world applications in payments and blockchain-based innovations. This trend extends beyond Remixpoint. Neptune Digital Assets, a publicly traded Canadian blockchain company, purchased approximately 1 million DOGE tokens for $258,000 in December 2024, reinforcing its position in the cryptocurrency market. Elsewhere, last November, Spirit Blockchain Capital acquired Dogecoin Portfolio Holding Corp to expand Dogecoin’s ecosystem and utility. However, the acquisition focused on intellectual property and cash assets rather than direct DOGE holdings on its balance sheet. Similarly, in July 2022, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company had not sold any of its Dogecoin holdings, though the exact amount remains undisclosed. Notably, Tesla began accepting Dogecoin for select merchandise in December 2021, reinforcing Musk’s ongoing support for the cryptocurrency. That said, the surge in interest for DOGE comes amid discussions surrounding the potential approval of Bitwise, 21Shares, and Grayscale Dogecoin ETFs by the SEC. If approved, these ETFs could further strengthen Dogecoin’s presence in financial markets, potentially boosting its price. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.17, reflecting a 7.01% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-03 13:41:39

The case focuses on claims that the USDT issuer improperly sold nearly 40,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in June 2022. The Judge’s Ruling In court documents filed in New York on Monday, Judge Martin Glenn ruled that some aspects of the multibillion-dollar lawsuit had merit. Celsius had accused the stablecoin company of carrying out a “fire sale” of more than 39,500 BTC and applying the proceeds to a debt of $812 million. The now-defunct crypto lender claimed this was done without following agreed-upon procedures, resulting in losses exceeding $4 billion based on current prices. Judge Glenn argued that the alleged verbal permission from former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to liquidate the collateral was “insufficient.” He added that failing to observe a 10-hour grace period for posting collateral could still count as a breach, “oral permission or not.” The judge also said that the digital asset firm’s awareness of Celsius’s insolvency at the time did not give it a legal basis to act independently. However, he dismissed some parts of the lawsuit. For instance, claims against certain Tether entities were dropped due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. Allegations that rely on applying U.S. bankruptcy law outside the country were also dismissed. The judge further decided that Celsius did not prove the defendant had breached its duties under British Virgin Islands (BVI) law regarding good faith and fair dealing. Details of The Case The dispute is centred on a margin call the USDT provider issued during a decline in BTC’s prices three years ago. Celsius says the agreement included a 10-hour window to post additional collateral, but Tether sold the Bitcoin before that period expired. The crypto lender says the respondent’s actions breached their agreement, violated “good faith and fair dealing” under BVI law, and involved fraudulent and preferential transfers that violate the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. According to the filing, the assets were liquidated at an average price of $20,656 per coin, which was below market value. Celsius further alleged that the proceeds were later transferred to the stablecoin operator’s Bitfinex accounts. The transactions also involved U.S.-based staff, accounts, and communications, which it believes gives the case enough ties to be handled in a U.S. court. In August 2024, Tether moved to dismiss the case, arguing the court lacked jurisdictional authority and that the crypto lender’s claims had no legal ground. The company called the lawsuit “baseless” and a “shameless litigation money grab.” CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement that Celsius executives had told his organization to sell the BTC “in order to close out its roughly 815 million USDT position.” He added that the lawsuit was an attempt by the bankrupt firm to shift blame for its mismanagement. Celsius completed its bankruptcy process on January 31, 2024, and is currently repaying its creditors. More recently, its former top executive, Mashinsky, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud.

The 0.382 level, currently sitting near $2.1681, has continued to act as a focal point for consolidation, as highlighted in a recent post by crypto analyst CasiTrades (@CasiTrades). The hourly chart shows a narrowing wedge formation, where the price repeatedly tests the retracement zone and responds with moderate volatility. This consolidation could be laying the groundwork for a decisive move. CasiTrades noted that XRP “continues to respect the 0.382 retracement,” highlighting its significance in the current price structure. Multiple interactions with this level have not yet broken it down, implying the support remains structurally valid. The line marking this retracement has now become the short-term pivot around which bulls and bears are contesting the next move.

Every reaction here reinforces just how significant this level is. The… pic.twitter.com/IwiHoNtzBN — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) July 2, 2025 Resistance at $2.25 Now the Key Breakout Trigger The price recently tested the upper trendline, which sits slightly above the $2.20 zone, and bounced off with notable rejection. However, XRP’s structure still appears bullish in this timeframe, assuming the 0.382 retracement continues to hold. CasiTrades recently highlighted $2.16 to $2.18 as a crucial range for XRP’s consolidation and eventual breakout, and the asset has remained above this range. From a technical standpoint, the market seems to be preparing for a potential move toward $2.25, a level that serves as the next major resistance. XRP fell below this level in June, flipping it from support to resistance . According to the analysis, the confirmation for bullish continuation would come from a clean break above $2.25, followed by a retest of that level as support. Flipping this level back to support would signal market intent for continuation and open the door to higher Fibonacci targets. Key targets include the 0.618 retracement level at $2.3063, aligning with prior rejection zones, and the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $2.6826 as a potential exhaustion point. An interim resistance around $2.45 may emerge before the final move toward $2.6826, depending on momentum strength . Momentum Indicators to Guide Next Confirmation The RSI on the hourly chart is around 47.79 after a spike near 75, showing that momentum has cooled. Key resistance at $2.25 and $2.45 will test XRP’s strength, and CasiTrades maintains that the bullish structure is intact above the 0.382 retracement. Experts have high expectations for XRP in July , and a break and retest of $2.25 could signal a higher move. The asset is currently trading at $2.24, attempting to break that resistance.

On July 3, YZi Labs, the venture capital and incubation firm formerly known as Binance Labs, announced its participation in Digital Asset’s $135 million Series E round, which attracted Wall Street heavyweights like Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, and DTCC. The investment, following Digital Asset’s initial June 24 funding reveal, positions YZi Labs alongside traditional finance’s most influential institutions in backing the Canton Network, a public Layer 1 blockchain seeking to reconcile institutional compliance with decentralized infrastructure. The convergence of companies in the multimillion-dollar funding round represents a strategic alignment between crypto’s builders and TradFi’s gatekeepers. Canton’s configurable privacy model has already processed over $1.5 trillion in monthly tokenized U.S. Treasury repo activity, demonstrating that regulated finance is ready to embrace blockchain, but only on certain terms. You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy hit with class-action lawsuit over $5.9 billion BTC loss The institutional onchain revolution takes shape YZi Labs’ investment in Digital Asset can be seen as a strategic play to participate in the growth of blockchain infrastructure that finally meets Wall Street’s demands. Traditional finance has long viewed public blockchains with skepticism, wary of exposing sensitive transactions to full transparency, while private chains remain isolated and cumbersome. Canton Network’s configurable privacy model changes that equation, allowing institutions to control data visibility without sacrificing interoperability. That’s why YZi Labs, alongside Goldman Sachs and Citadel, sees Canton as the missing link for tokenizing real-world assets at scale. With the $135 million capital injection, the Canton Network plans to accelerate its expansion, focusing on three key areas: infrastructure scalability, faster onboarding for regulated entities, and deeper interoperability between applications. According to the announcement, the network’s roadmap over the next 12 to 18 months includes new live deployments, global market expansion, and more seamless application-level composability. “This investment from YZi Labs reinforces the growing demand for blockchain infrastructure that meets the rigorous standards of global financial markets, Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset, said. “With this new backing, we’re advancing our mission to bring trillions of dollars more in real-world assets on-chain, creating a more connected and efficient financial ecosystem.” YZi Labs’ involvement also signals a strategic pivot under its rebrand from Binance Labs. Since Changpeng Zhao stepped back from Binance’s exchange operations, YZi has doubled down on infrastructure bridging crypto and traditional systems. Its March investment in Plume Network , a modular blockchain for real-world assets, mirrors the Canton playbook: enabling institutions to tokenize everything from carbon credits to private equity. Similarly, backing AI-data startup Vana and token distribution platform Sign earlier this year reveals a pattern: YZi isn’t chasing speculative DeFi trends but funding rails for mass adoption. The firm claims to manage over $10 billion in assets globally.

According to the company, it plans to use ETH as its core treasury asset. Elsewhere, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, a crypto and equities market strategist, joined BitMine Immersion Technologies as Chairman of the Board of Directors last Monday. BitMine also announced a $250 million private placement to support Ethereum accumulation. “The financial services industry and crypto are converging and it really started with stablecoins, which is the ChatGPT of crypto because of its viral adoption by consumers, business banks and now even Visa,” Lee told CNBC. The company also plans to track the value of Ethereum held per share as a performance indicator. “ BitMine can increase the value of ETH held per share by a combination of reinvestment of the company’s cash flows, capital markets activities, and by the change in value of ETH ,” Lee mentioned in his presser. Mega Matrix resume ETH staking with $100K buy On July 2, Mega Matrix Inc. confirmed it had purchased 40 ETH at $2,462 each, an investment of just under $100,000. The company stated the acquisition was meant “to revive its staking operations,” which were suspended in 2024 after regulators questioned the company’s digital asset business model. According to Mega Matrix, the GENIUS Act of 2025 has provided it with “sufficient confidence to resume.” Mega Matrix has opted for a lean setup involving solo staking through Coinbase’s institutional-grade platform, with custody handled by Coinbase Custodian and management through Cactus Wallet.

Hougan quoted a July 2 post from the Ethereum Foundation, writing, “ Inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs will accelerate significantly in the second half of the year .” “The phenomenon of stablecoins and stocks moving around Ethereum is a story that traditional investors can easily understand,” he continued, claiming that the reasoning will open doors for more institutions to buy in on ETH.

While testifying before the Senate Standing Committee on Energy on Thursday, Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan said that the IMF was concerned about creating market distortions. The government had proposed allocating 2,000 megawatts from its 7,000 MW electricity surplus to cryptocurrency mining and other energy-intensive industries at rates of 23-24 Pakistani rupees ($0.08) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). But, the IMF remains skeptical despite surplus power during winter months, cautioning that such incentives resemble tax holidays that have historically undermined market efficiency. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” Irfan told lawmakers, suggesting that the project hasn’t been shelved entirely and is under review by the World Bank and other international partners. The IMF has raised red flags about how the government would transition the subsidized electricity back to market rates and contended that similar initiatives had previously failed to yield results. Pakistan’s Pivot Toward Crypto The development follows Pakistan’s creation of a “National Crypto Council” to oversee the formulation of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and to lure in foreign investors. The newly formed council tapped former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao as strategic advisor. Pakistan’s crypto embrace also includes the announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in May, Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib revealed that the government followed the United States’ example in establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve and is embracing pro-crypto regulatory policies. Saqib promised that the country would “never, ever sell” its holdings of the flagship cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, it’s still unknown how many Bitcoins the country plans to hold, and whether these assets will be bought or acquired via other means.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|IMF,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-03 13:50:01

Here Are 2028 Predictions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/investment-giant-jpmorgan-approaches-stablecoin-market-cautiously-here-are-2028-predictions/,"JPMorgan predicts that the stablecoin market will reach a size of $500 billion by 2028. However, this forecast falls well short of optimistic expectations that the market value could be between $1 and $2 trillion in the same period. JPMorgan: Stablecoin Market Could Reach $500 Billion by 2028, But Expectations Are Overly Optimistic The report published on Thursday by the team led by JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou drew a more cautious growth scenario for the future of the sector. According to the report, the main driver of stablecoin adoption is still crypto-native activities and large-scale payment integration is still limited. “Predictions that the stablecoin universe will grow to $1-2 trillion in a few years seem overly optimistic to us,” it was stated. According to JPMorgan, around 88% of stablecoin demand comes from intra-crypto transactions, such as spot and futures, DeFi collateral, and crypto companies’ reserve assets. In comparison, payments account for only 6%. The bank argues that even in the most optimistic scenario, the market size of stablecoins for payment purposes will show a limited increase. It also said a large-scale capital shift from traditional bank deposits or money market funds to stablecoins was unlikely, citing low yields and difficulties in switching between fiat and crypto. Some institutions are much more optimistic than JPMorgan. For example, Standard Chartered predicts that the supply of stablecoins could increase 10-fold by 2028, reaching $2 trillion, if the GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act, which is expected to be enacted in the US, is passed. Pointing out that this law will bring legitimacy to the sector, Standard Chartered states that this could lead to a large increase in the supply of US-based stablecoins. *This is not investment advice.

Public firms added 245,510 BTC to their balance sheets from January through June, a 375% jump over the 51,653 BTC they bought in the same stretch last year. At the same time, spot ETF issuers purchased 118,424 BTC, leaving them well behind their corporate counterparts. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Near Pain Point Last Seen In October 2024 Public Firm Purchases Smash ETF Buys According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, the 245,510 BTC bought by public companies during H1 2025 is more than four times the 118,424 BTC ETF issuers gathered. That ETF component is 56% lower than the 267,878 BTC they purchased in H1 2024, despite the funds experiencing more robust inflows than they experienced towards the end of 2024. The difference indicates increasingly companies are holding Bitcoin directly instead of relying on exchange‑traded products. More Companies Join Bitcoin Rush Data shows 254 entities now hold Bitcoin, and 141 of those are public companies. That marks big growth from the start of the year, when only 67 firms had BTC, and the end of March, when the number hit 79. Those counts translate to a 140% rise in six months and a nearly 80% gain in three months, underlining how many new players have jumped in. Strategy’s Share Of Acquisition Dips Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) still leads corporate buyers, but its slice of the total has shrunk. In H1 2024, Strategy’s purchase of 37,190 BTC made up 72% of all corporate buys. In the first half of 2025, the Michael Saylor‑led company purchased 135,600 BTC but now accounts for 55% of the total—down from its previous dominance. Firms such as Metaplanet, GameStop and ProCap have stepped into the spotlight, each adding large sums to their Bitcoin holdings. Supply Shock Could Be Coming According to industry commentary, the increase in corporate purchasing in addition to continuing ETF demand could take a bite out of available supply. When the next halving event reduces new Bitcoin issuance, less will flow into the market. Analysts caution that increasing institutional interest and declining supply might produce a significant price response. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming As public firms climb aboard and ETFs keep on buying—though at a reduced rate—the battle for Bitcoin is escalating. Although Strategy’s investments have increased in absolute value, the arrival of new buyers indicates the market is expanding. If that trend continues and reward for miners decreases following the halving, the battle for Bitcoin’s scarce supply could get fiercer. Investors and analysts alike will be paying close attention to how these forces influence the price of Bitcoin in the second half of 2025.

While much of the market remains cautious, a few standout projects are quietly gaining traction beneath the surface. From Web3 infrastructure to AI-driven innovation, these three altcoins are flashing early signs of momentum. If you’re aiming to end the year on a high note, these picks deserve a spot on your radar. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): A Rebound Opportunity Hiding in Plain Sight Source: tradingview NEAR is currently trading between $2.01 and $2.59, showing signs of stabilization after a steep six-month correction of nearly 59%. While bears have dominated recently, the narrowing gap between the 10-day and 100-day moving averages ($2.09 vs. $2.15) signals a potential pivot point. The RSI at 42.65 suggests NEAR is close to entering oversold territory—often a prime zone for accumulation. If bulls can reclaim momentum and push through the $2.94 resistance, it would mark a 14% upside from current highs, and possibly open the door to more aggressive gains. With NEAR’s reputation for scalable Web3 infrastructure, it may not stay at these levels much longer. Kaia (KAIA): Quiet Strength with Explosive Upside Potential Source: tradingview Kaia is slowly building bullish momentum, with its price moving between $0.15 and $0.19—already reflecting a 60% gain over the past month. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are starting to align ($0.19 and $0.17), indicating early signs of trend formation. The RSI around 50 confirms balanced conditions, hinting at room for upside if positive sentiment strengthens. A breakout toward $0.29 would represent an impressive 50% rally from current levels. With fresh capital flows and community buzz rising, KAIA could become one of this year’s most surprising performers. Missing this accumulation phase might be a regret come year-end. FET (Artificial Superintelligence Alliance): Down But Nowhere Near Out Source: tradingview FET currently trades between $0.62 and $0.81 after a 47% correction over the past six months—but such dips often precede powerful comebacks. While the RSI signals neutrality, the setup could flip bullish fast if momentum shifts. A move past the $0.92 resistance would clear the way toward $1.11, offering a potential 37% upside. As AI narratives return to the forefront of crypto hype, FET’s positioning within decentralized superintelligence gives it real staying power. Smart investors might see current price action as a setup—not a setback—for what could be one of the boldest recoveries of the cycle. Conclusion Timing is everything in crypto—and the clock is ticking. NEAR, KAIA, and FET are showing the kind of technical and narrative alignment that often precedes explosive moves. Whether you're betting on scalability, community-driven growth, or AI disruption, each of these altcoins offers a high-upside play for investors willing to act early. Miss them now, and you might be kicking yourself by the time the next bull run takes off. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The news sent its shares up by 6%, now changing hands at 1.17 GBX. According to a press statement published on July 3, Hamak successfully raised gross proceeds of £2.47 million through a placing and subscription round priced at 0.8 pence per share, a 27% discount from the previous close on July 2, 2025. The deal introduced 308.4 million new ordinary shares, representing 68.2% of Hamak’s newly enlarged share capital of 452.1 million shares. Each new share is accompanied by a two-year warrant exercisable in the second year, with a one-year lock-in period. Hamak Gold funding round to finance Bitcoin treasury Per the company’s statement, existing shareholders will receive warrants on equivalent terms, with the cut-off set as the close of business on July 2, the day before the official announcement. The share issuance process faced regulatory limitations, with Hamak unable to admit all the new shares without publishing an FCA-approved prospectus. As a workaround, the 308 million shares were issued to newly appointed directors Nick Thurlow and James Lawrence, who agreed to resell 283 million of those shares to investors at the issue price. The financing round came against the backdrop of an office shuffle, where former Executive Chairman Amara Kamara and Non-Executive Director Niall Young stepped down, and Thurlow and Lawrence took over as executive chairman and executive director, respectively. One of the investors in the fundraising was MBS Global Investments, which subscribed for £100,000. MBS is the investment arm of the Private Office of Sheikh Nayef Bin Eid Al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family. The Qatari investors will see to it that part of the proceeds are used to create a Bitcoin treasury. “ With the injection of additional capital, we are now well-positioned to pursue two core objectives in parallel, maximising our gold exploration opportunities and leading the UK market in bitcoin treasury management as a Main Market-listed company ,” Chair Thurlow said in a statement. Earlier this week, Hamak submitted applications to the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) and the London Stock Exchange for the admission of 308,375,000 new shares to the equity shares (transition) category of the FCA’s Official List. The company expects the shares to begin trading on the main market on or around July 4, 2025. London-registered companies are buying Bitcoin Alongside Hamak, at least nine companies in London have disclosed their intent to purchase digital assets in the past two weeks, taking a similar approach to business intelligence firm Strategy, led by the pro-BTC Michael Saylor in the US. Among these firms is Panther Metals, which recently purchased its first Bitcoin after reporting a £2.2 million loss last year. Panther’s shares have surged over 60% in the last month. Its CEO Darren Hazelwood stated the firm will build up its Bitcoin holdings “quickly,” with a short-term goal of accumulating £4 million worth of the asset. Bluebird Mining Ventures, another natural resources company, raised £2 million in debt to buy Bitcoin and is seeking to secure another £10 million. “The company was on life support before this,” Founder Aidan Bishop remarked, adding that Bluebird had reported a $898,000 loss last year. Vinanz, a company originally formed as a Bitcoin mining operation, announced more Bitcoin acquisitions last week, funded by equity and debt offerings. Its current holdings now total $3.85 million. The market value of Smarter Web Company, a Guildford-based website builder listed on the Aquis Exchange, reportedly surged to £806.2 million in just two months since disclosing its Bitcoin-buying plans in April.

With market sentiment shifting positively, expectations are building for a potential breakout that could take BTC to the $120K range in the near future. BTC Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart Following a healthy pullback to the $106K support level, BTC attracted notable demand, leading to a renewed rally back toward its all-time high at $111K. The ongoing price action reflects solid bullish momentum, likely stemming from sustained accumulation within the $100K–$111K consolidation range. A key bullish signal has also emerged: the 100-day moving average has crossed above the 200-day moving average, forming a Golden Cross, historically associated with longer-term bullish trends. This reinforces the current upward trajectory and investor confidence. However, BTC now faces a decisive test at the $111K ATH. A successful breakout above this psychological and technical barrier could ignite a fresh impulsive leg upward, with the $120K mark as the next major target. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, BTC initially faced rejection at the upper boundary of a descending wedge near $108K, triggering a brief dip to $106K. This move, however, was likely a liquidity sweep, a strategic pullback designed to trap retail sellers and enable smart money to accumulate long positions. Following this, the BTC price broke above the wedge structure and completed a bullish retest, confirming the breakout. The cryptocurrency is now gaining momentum again, eyeing the $111K liquidity pool, where a cluster of stop orders likely resides. This area is of high interest to large players seeking to trigger a buy-side liquidity cascade. If bulls can reclaim this level, a breakout is likely to follow, potentially propelling Bitcoin to new highs around $120K. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan This chart presents the Binance Liquidation Heatmap, which visualizes areas where significant liquidation events are likely to unfold. These zones often act as liquidity magnets, drawing price action toward them. Large market participants, commonly known as whales, strategically target these levels to enter or exit positions efficiently. At present, a notable cluster of liquidation levels sits just above Bitcoin’s all-time high of $111K, suggesting a strong probability that the price may be drawn toward this region. If reached, this could spark a short-squeeze, amplifying upward momentum and potentially pushing BTC to new highs. However, this liquidity cluster also reflects persistent selling pressure around current levels. Sellers remain active, keeping the $111K resistance firm. As such, this threshold stands as a critical decision point. A confirmed breakout above could initiate a powerful bullish continuation, while a failure to breach it may result in another rejection and possible retracement.

The project is backed by institutional investors including Jump and CMT Digital. Today, Cooking.City fully launched, revealing its core mechanisms and points system to better align incentives between traders and developers while creating new ways to participate in on-chain launches. Bringing Back Value Redistribution to Solana Fair Launches Cooking.City is more than just another launchpad. It is a community-first platform focused on value redistribution instead of value extraction. With Referral System, Cooking.City shares platform revenues with users. Referrers earn fee rebates and points based on their invitees’ trading activities. As the only launchpad which hasn’t launched its official token, Cooking.City aims to attract early users through highly-anticipated airdrops, encouraging interaction between traders and quality token launches. Users can check the rules of rewards and point history on the dashboard every day. Top referrers and traders will receive significant reward multipliers to further amplify their future rewards. Cooking Points: A Multi-Layered Incentive System The Cooking Points system is now live. It rewards users who actively engage with the platform across multiple dimensions. Trading on Cooking.City : Higher trading volumes bring more points. And high market cap with healthy trading volume tokens are designated as Michelin Tokens, and trading them can offer bonus points multipliers. Referrals : Users can share referral codes and earn up to 10x points multipliers based on referred users’ trading activity. Social Quests : Liking, commenting, sharing official tweets, or using the #CookingCity tag unlocks additional point rewards. Each user has a personal dashboard that updates daily. Points are retroactively calculated based on activity since launch and will be tied directly to future airdrop events. Conviction Pool: A Capital-based Launch Feature to Signify Good Launch Cooking.City’s Conviction Pool is a new mechanism that holds developers accountable and helps traders to tell quality launches from random ones. Developer Commitment : To opt in, developers can choose to deposit some SOL and set a price that signals their conviction in the token. Soft Price Protection : If the token graduates, the conviction pool will activate. If the price drops to a set level, users can swap their bought tokens into SOL from the conviction pool, acting like an insurance, establishing benchmarks for quality in the market. If the price does not fall below the set level, the developer can claim back the SOL from the conviction pool. This design filters out low-effort launches, protects traders, and signals serious commitment from builders. The Birthplace of Onchain Conviction Cooking.City is creating a marketplace of convictions, allowing builders and investors to actualize and capture their faith through launches and trading. The launchpad is the first step towards its greater on-chain nation, effectively allowing more convicted projects to enter crypto through Cooking.City. The team expects to diversify approaches of asset issuance and capital matchmaking through their evolving launch infrastructure and mechanisms. About Cooking.City Cooking.City is a pioneering platform designed to revolutionize token fair launches. By aligning values between builders, believers, and traders, Cooking.City creates new opportunities to reward quality launches and early support on token projects, encouraging builders and investors to grow together.

Is the all-time high next? How high could the king of the cryptocurrencies go? Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out, has come back to test the breakout, and is now consolidating before the next piece of price action. Could it dip back inside the bull flag? No particular price move can be discarded, and although it makes sense for this upside move to continue, the bulls may run out of steam. $BTC breakout and confirmation Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart reveals the $BTC price breakout and the dip back down to confirm it. However, given that most of the shorter term Stochastic RSI momentum indicators are at or near the top of an overbought condition, it may well be that the price bounces along the top of the bull flag trendline for a while, or as mentioned above, dips back into the flag. All this said, this is a bull flag breakout and it would be more likely for the price to continue upward. At some point, the momentum indicators will need to reset, but this can come in the form of some sideways and downward movement which may not affect the price too much. The next targets for this current move are the higher high at $110,600, and then the all-time high just short of $112,000. Getting above the latter and making a new high should be the final confirmation signal that Bitcoin is heading to the next stage of its upward journey. Bullish daily engulfing candle Source: TradingView The daily chart is looking positive. Yesterday’s daily candle engulfed the previous one by quite some margin, and now a candle has opened well above the 50-day moving average (blue line). At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator is still angled upward, having bounced from the yellow moving average line and the 50.00 level. Current bull flag breakout has big potential upside Source: TradingView The weekly chart above shows the whole of the bull market so far. It can be seen that the price is just emerging from the current bull flag. Although this flag is a lot smaller in scale than the previous falling wedge or the long bull flag that went sideways for much of 2024, the length of the flag pole could translate into a measured move up to $137,000. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is in a bullish condition. Obviously, this does not confirm until the end of the week, but as it stands, the blue fast line is shaping to cross back above the orange slow line. This can signal the upside price momentum needed by the bulls for this next big move. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The Solana ETF $SSK took in $12m on first day, according to Osprey who told Decrypt (we won't see it in data till tonight). That's pretty solid. For context, it took 3mo for $SOLZ to get $12m. Also pre-market volume is $3m (vs 260k for SOLZ), pointing another healthy trading day. https://t.co/ORottKyGXg — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 3, 2025 The fund began trading on Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange at $25.47 per share. The debut performance “blows away” Solana and XRP futures ETFs, according to Balchunas, adding for context, “it took 3mo for $SOLZ to get $12m”. How a crypto staking ETF works Unlike traditional crypto ETFs, SSK enables investors to participate in Solana’s staking mechanism, a process that is typically restricted through traditional brokerage accoutns. The fund deploys approximately 80% of its assets into direct Solana holdings, with more than half of those tokens actively staked to earn blockchain rewards. This staking component is projected to deliver annual yields ranging from 7% to 7.3% for investors. The ETF’s remaining assets consist of international Solana-related products and liquid staking tokens like JitoSOL. SSK’s approval hinged on its legal framework. REX and Osprey structured it as a C-corporation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, helping them circumvent regulatory obstacles that have stalled other cryptocurrency ETFs. This approach requires a qualified custodian rather than the fund issuer to hold underlying assets, with Anchorage Digital serving as both custodian and staking provider. The ETF’s success could signal institutional demand for spot Solana ETFs. The SEC recently requested public input on spot Solana ETF proposals from Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree, with analysts assigning a 95% chance of approval by the end of 2025.

The new rules issued under Volume 6 of the CBB Capital Markets Rulebook, are designed to provide legal clarity and oversight for stablecoin issuers operating in or from Bahrain. Bahrain Unveils Comprehensive Stablecoin Regulations, Marking a First for the Kingdom According to the framework , the offering, issuance, minting, and burning of stablecoins, as well as the custody and reserve asset management associated with them, will now be treated as regulated financial activities. The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has released its new Stablecoin Issuance and Offering (SIO) Module, the country’s first regulatory framework allowing the compliant issuance of stablecoins. Previously, CBB granted Binance subsidiary BPay Global a license to operate as a payment… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 3, 2025 Entities intending to offer such services must obtain a license from the CBB, and no stablecoin activity may occur in or from Bahrain without prior approval. Also, only fully fiat-backed stablecoins pegged to the Bahraini Dinar, the U.S. Dollar, or other fiat currencies are deemed acceptable by the CBB. In addition, CBB emphasized that issuers must maintain a 1:1 reserve ratio, backed by high-quality, liquid assets that meet stringent risk criteria. The framework also noted that issues must fulfill annual audit obligations, and adhere to robust standards on cybersecurity, internal controls, and consumer protection. Under the new module, the CBB also laid out a multi-layered licensing process in which applicants must demonstrate a minimum paid-up capital of BHD 250,000 and satisfy conditions related to shareholder transparency, governance, risk management, and IT system readiness. Notably, the new licensing framework introduces clear operational and prudential requirements such as issuers providing a stablecoin whitepaper and outlining key details of the project and its financial underpinnings. In particular, the regulations enforce a permanent right of redemption for stablecoin holders, prohibit the payment of interest, and require that all reserve assets be subject to external audits and held in segregated accounts. The CBB emphasized that the body retains the authority to reject any stablecoin issuance it deems contrary to the interests of Bahrain’s national economy or the general public. The body further warns that it reserves the right to impose additional capital buffers if the issuer’s activities are deemed to pose heightened risk to the financial system. Bahrain Expands Digital Asset Momentum with Licensing and Institutional Crypto Products Bahrain continues to reinforce its position as a regional crypto hub through regulatory clarity and growing institutional involvement. In April, BPay Global, a subsidiary of Binance, secured a Payment Service Provider license from the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB). Binance expands in the Gulf as BPay Global secures regulatory approval from Bahrain’s central bank for fiat payments. #CryptoRegulation #Fintech https://t.co/xt7sFsxwAW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 10, 2025 The license allows BPay to operate as a regulated entity, offering fiat on- and off-ramps, custodial services, and e-wallet functionality. This development enables Binance users in Bahrain to make fiat deposits and withdrawals via bank transfers and cards directly on the platform. “This license represents a positive step in enhancing Bahrain’s digital payments ecosystem, particularly in its support for the crypto-related sector as well as fiat payment solutions,” said Abdulla Haji, Director of the CBB’s Licensing Directorate. Bahrain’s push toward regulated crypto finance also extends to traditional institutions. In October 2024, the National Bank of Bahrain (NBB) launched the region’s first Bitcoin-linked structured investment product , offering capital-protected exposure to BTC. @NBBOnline has introduced Bitcoin investment product, which will be available “exclusively for accredited investors.” #Bitcoin #NBB #InvestmentFund https://t.co/NlKyXMPaBj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 8, 2024 Developed in collaboration with ARP Digital, co-founded by a former Goldman Sachs partner, the product targets accredited investors seeking controlled exposure to crypto assets. These developments align with wider adoption trends in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). According to Chainalysis, the region received $338.7 billion in on-chain value between July 2023 and June 2024, about 7.5% of global crypto volume. Notably, 93% of this activity came from institutional and professional transactions above $10,000, reflecting a mature and growing market.

If buying interest remains strong, a continued push toward the $2.8K resistance zone appears likely. ETH Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH recently found solid support at the key 100-day moving average near $2K, triggering a surge in buying interest and a shift in momentum. The asset has successfully broken above the pivotal 200-day MA around $2.5K, a level that has repeatedly acted as resistance in recent weeks. This breakout marks a notable bullish development. However, to sustain this move, ETH needs to hold above the 200-day average. If bulls defend this area, the path toward the major resistance at $2.8K becomes more viable. For now, the price is likely to consolidate within the $2.5K–$2.8K corridor until a clear breakout determines the next major direction. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the shorter timeframe, ETH’s price posted a sharp rally after buyers stepped in around the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, reclaiming the previously broken lower boundary of the bullish flag pattern. This recovery has invalidated the prior bearish breakdown, indicating that the move was likely a bear trap. Currently, the cryptocurrency is gaining traction, but it’s approaching a key bearish order block between $2625 and $2670, a zone where sellers may re-emerge. If the buyers can overcome this supply area, a move toward the $2.8K resistance becomes increasingly probable. Conversely, failure to break through could trigger another phase of consolidation or a mild retracement. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum has just marked a significant milestone in Liquid Staking, reaching its highest monthly growth since June. Over the past month alone, staking activity surged by approximately 1 million ETH, an impressive 2.83% increase, setting a new monthly record for Ethereum staking participation. As of July 1, Ethereum achieved a fresh all-time high in Liquid Staking, with 35.56 million ETH now staked. This trend is largely driven by accumulation from institutional entities, including ETFs, large holders, and crypto funds. These participants are increasingly opting to earn yield through Liquid Staking protocols while they wait for long-term price appreciation. This trend reduces the circulating supply and reflects a strong conviction in Ethereum’s future valuation. While a major breakout in ETH’s price has yet to occur, the consistent rise in Liquid Staking and institutional accumulation indicates that Ethereum may be on the brink of a significant upward move.

This could favor a bullish Pi Coin price prediction as its circulating supply is expanding at a slower pace. After this change, the mining rate for Pi currently sits at 0.0030165, resulting in a 0.93% increase. This gives miners an additional incentive to ramp up their efforts to tap into the token’s locked allocation. One of the alternatives they have to increase their output is to lock in their Pi tokens via the mobile app. Depending on the length of the lock-up period, they could boost mining rates by as much as 600%. If miners opt to do this to boost their output, this could dramatically shrink the token’s circulating supply and support a bullish Pi Coin price prediction . Data from PiScan shows that the number of tokens to be released will drop sharply starting on July 11 when 10.5 million PI will be freed up. This represents a nearly 50% drop compared to tomorrow’s unlock of 19.4 million PI. Meanwhile, by the end of this month, on July 31, only 4.9 million PI will be released. Pi Price Prediction: PI Could Rise to $0.60 Again if Supply Expands at a Lower Pace Looking at the 4-hour chart, PI has bounced off a key support at $0.4750 and its decline seems to have decelerated after the widely awaited “Pi Day” event. The protocol launched a staking initiative that will allow Pi holders to rank their favorite apps within the ecosystem by locking up their tokens. However, the fact that this staking program offers zero rewards to investors for doing this could result in low adoption rates. The price has broken a falling wedge setup upon bouncing off this support area and this could favor a bullish Pi Coin price prediction with a first target set at $0.5700. A ‘golden cross’ between the 9-period and 21-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) would confirm this positive outlook. Meanwhile, if the price drops below $0.4750, this bearish breakout could result in a retest of its all-time lows. The impact that this latest increase in Pi’s mining rate will have on its price is still a bit unclear. In contrast, the best crypto presales like SUBBD (SUBBD) seem poised to outperform well-established tokens like PI as investors are pouring thousands of dollars into the project just a few weeks after its launch. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises More Than $700,000 to Launch In Decentralized Content Distribution Platform SUBBD (SUBBD) aims to revolutionize how influencers share their content by introducing a decentralized platform that eliminates unfair bans and allows them to keep a higher share of their earnings.

The project is backed by institutional investors including Jump and CMT Digital. Today, Cooking.City fully launched, revealing its core mechanisms and points system to better align incentives between traders and developers while creating new ways to participate in on-chain launches. Bringing Back Value Redistribution to Solana Fair Launches Cooking.City is more than just another launchpad. It is a community-first platform focused on value redistribution instead of value extraction. With Referral System, Cooking.City shares platform revenues with users. Referrers earn fee rebates and points based on their invitees’ trading activities. As the only launchpad which hasn’t launched its official token, Cooking.City aims to attract early users through highly-anticipated airdrops, encouraging interaction between traders and quality token launches. Users can check the rules of rewards and point history on the dashboard every day. Top referrers and traders will receive significant reward multipliers to further amplify their future rewards. Cooking Points: A Multi-Layered Incentive System The Cooking Points system is now live. It rewards users who actively engage with the platform across multiple dimensions. Trading on Cooking.City : Higher trading volumes bring more points. And high market cap with healthy trading volume tokens are designated as Michelin Tokens, and trading them can offer bonus points multipliers. Referrals : Users can share referral codes and earn up to 10x points multipliers based on referred users’ trading activity. Social Quests : Liking, commenting, sharing official tweets, or using the #CookingCity tag unlocks additional point rewards. Each user has a personal dashboard that updates daily. Points are retroactively calculated based on activity since launch and will be tied directly to future airdrop events. Conviction Pool: A Capital-based Launch Feature to Signify Good Launch Cooking.City’s Conviction Pool is a new mechanism that holds developers accountable and helps traders to tell quality launches from random ones. Developer Commitment : To opt in, developers can choose to deposit some SOL and set a price that signals their conviction in the token. Soft Price Protection : If the token graduates, the conviction pool will activate. If the price drops to a set level, users can swap their bought tokens into SOL from the conviction pool, acting like an insurance, establishing benchmarks for quality in the market. If the price does not fall below the set level, the developer can claim back the SOL from the conviction pool. This design filters out low-effort launches, protects traders, and signals serious commitment from builders. The Birthplace of Onchain Conviction Cooking.City is creating a marketplace of convictions, allowing builders and investors to actualize and capture their faith through launches and trading. The launchpad is the first step towards its greater on-chain nation, effectively allowing more convicted projects to enter crypto through Cooking.City. The team expects to diversify approaches of asset issuance and capital matchmaking through their evolving launch infrastructure and mechanisms. About Cooking.City Cooking.City is a pioneering platform designed to revolutionize token fair launches. By aligning values between builders, believers, and traders, Cooking.City creates new opportunities to reward quality launches and early support on token projects, encouraging builders and investors to grow together.

As investors digested the non-farm payrolls report, the Dow opened more than 100 points higher, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite edging up to fresh all-time highs. The S&P 500 was up nearly 0.5% in early trading, while the Nasdaq Composite had added 0.6%. The gains followed upward momentum in the futures market, where the benchmark S&P 500 hovered near its previous record. The Dow, currently trading at 44,782, is now within striking distance of the 45,000 level, marking a strong run from the 38,000 level it traded at just in April.

According to the report, job gains were strongest in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. The unemployment rate also surprised to the upside, falling to 4.1% versus forecasts of a rise to 4.3%. In May, the U.S. economy had added 144,000 jobs, an upward revision from the previously reported 139,000. At the time, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Nonfarm payrolls report on July 3, 2025 comes just a day after ADP’s latest data that showed private payrolls recorded a 33,000 decline in June. Bets on rate cut falls Amid the payrolls report, bullish bets on odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut in July have dropped, with the CME FedWatch Tool now showing markets are pricing in a 5% chance. On Wednesday, bets for a rate cut by the central bank in July stood at 24%. While the jobs report has catalyzed an upward reaction across equities, investors remain cautious amid focus on President Donald Trump’s tax bill.

The coin currently stands at $109,716, having appreciated 2% over the last 24 hours. The market overall is experiencing an uptick, with nearly all coins in green at the time of writing. Also, looking at both the Market Capitalization and Realized Cap measures, Glassnode found “substantial growth” this cycle. The former surged from $304 billion to $2.13 trillion, and the latter jumped from $400 billion to $955 billion. “Together, they highlight not only the substantial capital inflows into Bitcoin, but also its maturation toward becoming a multi-trillion-dollar asset,” it argues. As $BTC rebounds to $107k, most holders are back into profit. But distribution remains muted – investors are holding through. Realized profits decline, LTH supply hits ATH, and ETF inflows stay strong.

This indicates “the substantial value appreciation” which BTC investors have seen, as well as “the incentive for potential sell-side pressure that may emerge if sentiment shifts.” Source: Glassnode Meanwhile, the average paper gains (losses held by the average market participant) stand at +125%. The report claims this suggests that BTC investors are “sitting on significant profits.” This number is still lower than the +180% profitability seen in March 2024 when the price hit the ATH of $73,000 and December 2024 when it hit $00,000. That said, some $872 million worth is locked in profit daily at this point. This is lower than the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in realized profit seen during the ATHs of $73,000 and $107,000, respectively. Notably, the report highlights, recent drops didn’t “significantly impact investor profitability.” Moreover, valuation frameworks show a positive profitability across holders of all coin ages. Source: Glassnode The market jump comes after several days of consecutive, albeit relatively minor, decreases that followed Israel’s attack on Iran , resulting in casualties and further conflict in the region. Given that geopolitical headlines influence the crypto market, the risk of further downside remains, Glassnode says. However, the decrease in tensions between the two countries helped stabilize market sentiment and fuel price recovery. Moreover, per the analysts, “the market’s ability to hold the Short-Term Holder cost basis during such a volatile and uncertain period is a constructive signal, suggesting that the bulls are still in control, and that underlying momentum may remain skewed to the upside.” You may also like: Crypto Market Enters Holding Pattern and Fatigue Grows, But Will the Bull Stay? The world’s first and most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has remained range-bound recently. This comes as crypto market profit-taking slows, spot volume fades, activity metrics cool, and futures sentiment turns cautious, according to the latest report by blockchain data and intelligence platform Glassnode. Without a notable influx of new demand, upside momentum will remain limited.BTC has been trading in a $100,000–$110,000 range, where it has been consolidating since 8 May. Macro... Investors Brace for Possible Increase in Market Volatility Citing Glassnode data, Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , noted that “Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics continue to showcase the strength of its current market position.” BTC supply in profit rising reinforces “just how bullish recent momentum has been,” Chait says in an email. However, he also warns that elevated levels of profit are often followed by increased market volatility. “Historically, when such a high percentage of supply sits in profit, the chances of profit-taking rise. That, in turn, introduces short-term market movements even when there is a broadly optimistic outlook,” Chait argues. Meanwhile, the Glassnode report found that, despite a surge in profitability, investor behavior shows a strong preference for HODLing. The current price range seems insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking, it noted. Several metrics show this, namely declining realized profits, a downtrend in Liveliness, and Long-Term Holder supply hitting a new ATH. The decline in sell-side pressure can be seen in the total supply held by the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort. It reached a new all-time high of 14.7M BTC. “This underscores that HODLing remains the dominant market behavior amongst investors, with accumulation and maturation flows significantly outweighing distribution pressures,” Glassnode says. Moreover, the behavior of Long-Term Holders further reinforces this argument. After a brief uptick in sell-side pressure into the ATH, this cohort slowed their spending as well. Finally, the Liveliness metric saw significant upticks during the two previous BTC price ATH formations. This suggested that spending activity and profit taking took over the market. Yet, during the latest ATH formation, Liveliness trended downward, reinforcing “that HODLing remains the dominant behavior among investors, and that a range expansion in price may be necessary to incentivize renewed spending activity.” You may also like: Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 3, 2025 The crypto market is up today, after several days of trending mildly downwards.

According to Brazil Journal , C&M Software, a Central Bank-authorized service provider that handles API connections for financial institutions in Brazil, became the entry point for attackers who gained access to multiple bank accounts, including those of banking-as-a-service provider BMP. Federal Police sources confirm that the breach is a massive infiltration of Brazil’s national payment system, with stolen funds immediately routed through cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter desks in an attempt to convert the money into Bitcoin and USDT. Central Bank technicians worked through the night to investigate the incident after C&M was immediately disconnected from the financial system, while multiple crypto service providers blocked suspicious transactions and froze accounts linked to the attack. Infrastructure Breach Exposes Crypto Conversion Network C&M Software confirmed in a statement to Valor Econômico that it was “ a direct victim of criminal action, which included the improper use of customer credentials to attempt to fraudulently access its systems and services. “ Hackers teriam desviado milhões de reais após invadir empresa que conecta instituições financeiras ao Pix https://t.co/K7s94En4OH — Valor Econômico (@valoreconomico) July 2, 2025 The attackers exploited C&M’s role as a messaging gateway for Brazil’s Instant Payment System (PIX), gaining unauthorized access to transfer protocols that connect banks, fintechs, and payment processors to the national financial infrastructure. Immediately after the theft, they began moving the stolen funds to cryptocurrency providers integrated with PIX, attempting to purchase USDT and Bitcoin through exchanges, gateways, and OTC desks. SmartPay CEO Rocelo Lopes noted in a statement released that his company “ detected that there was a problem at 00:18 on June 30, due to the atypical movement on both platforms ” and automatically raised validation filters on USDT and Bitcoin purchases. “ Large sums of money were withheld and, at the same time, the process of returning them to the institutions involved was carried out ,” Lopes explained, adding that many crypto OTC desks denied registration and operations by the hackers. Industry sources have revealed that blockchain monitoring tools detected significant transactions to various cryptocurrency companies, although the exact amount successfully converted to digital assets remains under investigation. However, despite the gravity of the attack, BMP emphasized in its official statement that “ no BMP customer was impacted or had their funds accessed ,” clarifying that the attack “ exclusively involved funds deposited in its reserve account at the Central Bank ” and that the institution “ has sufficient collateral to fully cover the impacted amount. “ Crypto Rails Become Highway for Traditional Financial Crime This attack adds to the growing concern of crypto’s expanding role as an exit ramp for traditional financial crimes, with digital assets providing liquidity and pseudo-anonymity that cash cannot match at scale. Stablecoins have become particularly attractive to illicit networks, with the Financial Action Task Force recently warning that their use by criminal organizations poses growing risks without coordinated global regulation. The FATF has urged governments to tighten crypto AML rules, warning that regulatory gaps still pose risks to global financial security. #FATF #AntiMoneyLaundering https://t.co/s6De83vskd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 27, 2025 The Brazilian heist follows a pattern of major crypto-related thefts this year, including North Korea’s record $1.46 billion ByBit exchange hack and Chinese police uncovering a $136 million laundering network that used digital currencies for cross-border transfers. Global regulators are struggling to keep pace with these hybrid attacks, where traditional banking systems are breached but digital assets provide the escape route. Recent enforcement actions, such as OKX’s $505 million settlement for anti-money laundering violations , have particularly focused on the role of crypto platforms in facilitating illicit fund flows. Looking forward, the Brazilian authorities are taking steps to trace the stolen funds across multiple blockchain networks while coordinating with international partners to freeze assets and identify the perpetrators behind the country’s most significant financial cyberattack.

Technical Analysis Points to Potential $5 Breakout Target SUI currently trades at $3.06 following a successful breakout from a descending wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart. The technical structure suggests the completion of a healthy correction, with strong volume confirmation and Fibonacci retracement support around the $3.00 – $3.30 zone. The asset has reclaimed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $3.0075, establishing clear targets at $3.30 and ultimately the 0.236 level around $3.70. RSI indicators indicate bullish momentum emerging from oversold conditions, while recent signals confirm a shift in momentum toward higher levels. $SUI just snapped back from the 0.786 Fib zone sharp, clean and confident. Despite the correction, the structure never cracked. The trendline held like it was meant to. Healthy pullback, not a breakdown. This bounce could be the higher low that sets the stage. Momentum… pic.twitter.com/AWkO4SKscJ — Marcus Corvinus (@CryptoBull009) July 3, 2025 Even more, long-term analysis reveals a massive symmetrical triangle pattern developing since the asset’s inception. The converging pattern suggests tremendous energy building for an eventual breakout, with analyst projections targeting $10, representing a potential 3.5x gain from current levels. The weekly chart structure shows a successful defense of the ascending trendline support around $2.10-2.20, validating the long-term bullish framework. The technical resilience during recent corrections, combined with strong fundamental catalysts, positions SUI for significant appreciation, with initial targets around $4.00 to $5.00 before potentially extending toward $6.00 or higher. Based on current technical confluence and fundamental momentum, SUI appears positioned for a move toward $4.00-$4.50 in the near term, with potential extension to $5.00-$ 6.00 as developer adoption accelerates. The $10 long-term target remains viable if Sui successfully establishes itself as Solana’s primary Layer-1 competitor through continued ecosystem growth.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A crypto whale who turned $100m with Solana is now betting big on XYZVerse, a $0.0033 memecoin he believes could surge 9,000% in 2025. Table of Contents XYZVerse price forecast: Can it really 30x? Bitcoin continues steady growth Solana fluctuates Conclusion A seasoned cryptocurrency investor, known for making a fortune of $100 million with Solana, has set his sights on a tiny memecoin valued at just $0.003333. He predicts it could soar by 9000%. This bold forecast has caught the attention of many, sparking curiosity about this overlooked digital asset. XYZVerse price forecast: Can it really 30x? XYZVerse is stepping into the memecoin arena at a time when community-driven tokens dominate speculative trading. The explosive rise of coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and engaged communities can deliver outsized returns. Market sentiment also plays a crucial role in XYZVerse’s outlook. As altcoin season looms, investor appetite for lower-cap, high-risk tokens is heating up. With XYZVerse still in presale, it stands to benefit significantly if it secures top-tier exchange listings and keeps community excitement high post-launch. Why XYZVerse stands out right now Strong branding and partnerships — Backed by sports tie-ins and influencer deals, XYZVerse has a broad appeal beyond traditional crypto audiences. Deflationary supply mechanics — A 17.13% token burn aims to ease sell pressure and support price growth. Liquidity and stability focus — With 15% of supply allocated to liquidity, it’s designed for smoother trading post-launch. Community incentives — 10% dedicated to rewards and engagement encourages holding and grassroots promotion. XYZ price outlook is as follows Current presale price: $0.003333 Post-presale target: $0.10 (project’s internal projections) Possible ATH in first weeks: $0.15 – $0.25 (assuming strong FOMO and exchange momentum) 6–12 month potential: $0.20 – $0.40 (with key partnerships and sustained hype) Is a 30x move to $0.10 realistic? A 30x surge from the presale price to $0.10 is within reach, but several factors must align: Major exchange listings — Listings on big CEXs like Binance, KuCoin, or OKX could drive explosive price action on day one. Viral community growth — Memecoins thrive on social buzz. If XYZVerse leverages its sports influencer network well, it can build unstoppable momentum. Bullish market conditions — If Bitcoin and altcoins continue their uptrend, speculative assets like XYZVerse often outperform. XYZVerse has the core ingredients to pull off a massive run. With focused marketing, top-tier exchange listings, and true community buy-in, the $0.10+ target, implying around a 3000% gain from the current price, becomes a serious possibility.

Over the past six months, its price increased by 10.73%. In the last month, it went up by 1.33%, and in the past week, it rose by 1.01%. This steady growth shows ongoing interest in the cryptocurrency. Market indicators are mixed. The Relative Strength Index is at 61.72, nearing overbought levels. The Stochastic value is high at 98.92, suggesting it is overbought. The MACD level is -16.594, indicating possible downward momentum. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $106,235 and $107,244, showing a stable trend. Bitcoin’s nearest resistance level is at $114,326. If it breaks above this, it could reach the second resistance at $123,147. If it falls, it may find support at $96,683, and further down at $87,862. Based on recent data, Bitcoin could continue to grow, but overbought signals might lead to a short-term decline. Watching these levels can help predict its next move. Solana fluctuates Source: TradingView Solana ( SOL ) has experienced some notable price changes recently. In the past week, its price increased by 2.22%, settling within the range of $137.88 to $161.77. However, over the past month, the price has declined by 5.42%, and looking back six months, it has dropped by 28.33%. This mixed performance suggests that while there is short-term growth, the longer-term trend has been downward. Technical indicators provide further insights into SOL’s potential direction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.50, which is neutral, indicating that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 91.70, suggesting that SOL might be overbought in the short term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.3727, pointing to a bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $148.35, slightly below the 100-day average of $150.35, which can be a bearish signal. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $170.18. If SOL breaks above this, it could aim for the second resistance at $194.07. On the downside, the nearest support is at $122.40, with a further support level at $98.51. A move towards the first support level would be a decrease of about 10%, while reaching the first resistance could mean an increase of over 5%. Based on these factors, SOL’s price may continue to fluctuate within these levels in the near future. Conclusion Amid the 2025 bull run, while BTC and SOL perform well, XYZVerse stands out, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 3,000% growth and community-driven success.

They were a declaration that the crypto infrastructure experiment is over. The results are in – and they're compelling enough for one of the world's most successful payment companies to bet big. A clear picture emerges: the future of finance isn't about choosing between traditional payments and crypto. It's about building seamless infrastructure that gives users the benefits of both. Acquisitions Expose Fundamental Problem Stripe's billion-dollar shopping spree reveals something critical about the current state of crypto infrastructure: it's fragmented, and traditional companies are trying to bolt together solutions that were never designed to work as one. Piecemeal solutions create friction. And payments are just one piece of a much larger puzzle. What happens when users want to trade those stablecoins? Tokenize real-world assets? Access decentralized applications? Deploy smart contracts? Stripe's approach – acquiring best-in-class point solutions – will smooth the kind of friction that has prevented crypto from achieving mainstream adoption. Users will hit seams between services, compliance gaps between providers, and the inevitable integration challenges that come with stitching together technologies built by different teams with different architectures. Full-Stack Advantage The companies that will truly capture the crypto opportunity aren't those assembling acquired pieces, but those that have built integrated ecosystems from the ground up. This isn't just about payments—it's about reimagining the entire financial services stack. Consider what comprehensive crypto infrastructure actually requires: compliant exchange capabilities for liquidity, tokenization services for asset digitization, cloud infrastructure for scalable applications, AI-powered tools for risk management and user experience, and custody solutions that work across all these services seamlessly. Each component must be designed with the others in mind. Regulatory compliance can't be an afterthought—it must be baked into the architecture. User experience can't be optimized for one service at the expense of another. Technical standards must be consistent across the platform. Full-Stack Era Demands Native Solutions Ultimately, the future belongs to platforms that understand crypto isn't just better payments—it's a fundamentally different approach to financial services. The transformations emerge when you combine programmable money with programmable assets, intelligent automation, and global infrastructure. The winning platforms will be those that can offer users the full spectrum of financial services within a single, compliant, integrated environment. Users shouldn't need to understand which service handles custody versus trading versus tokenization. They shouldn't face different compliance requirements for different functions. They shouldn't encounter friction when moving between services. This level of integration requires building from the ground up with a complete vision of what digital finance can become. It requires understanding that compliance, user experience, technical architecture, and business model must all align perfectly. The Path Forward The crypto convergence moment has arrived, promising users financial experiences that they don't even recognize as ""crypto."" Instant global settlements will become standard. Programmable payment terms will automate complex business relationships. Cross-border commerce will become as simple as domestic transactions. We're moving toward a world where the benefits of crypto—speed, cost efficiency, global reach—are available without users ever thinking about the underlying technology. That said, the next era won’t be led by traditional finance companies adding crypto features.It will be driven by crypto-native platforms that have solved the crypto integration challenge with a full-stack approach that maintains regulatory compliance and institutional-grade security. The companies that will define the next decade of integrated financial services are those that already offer seamless, integrated experiences across the full spectrum of digital asset services. These companies understand that the future of finance is programmable, global, and always-on—and they've built their entire infrastructure around these principles.",Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-03 15:12:05

Ethereum is still around 45% below its 2021 ATH of $4,850. While ETH investors are now expecting an explosive rally, CryptoQuant analyst gave the expected good news for Etheruem. Ethereum Is Poised for an Explosive Rise! Although Ethereum has still not started the expected rally due to price manipulations by market makers, CryptoQuant analyst said that ETH is preparing for a major rise and is giving bullish signals. At this point, the analyst said that Ethereum broke many records in June, even though the price did not reach the new ATH. “June 2025 was a record-breaking month for Ethereum, even though prices did not reach expected levels due to constant manipulation by Market Makers.” The analyst noted that the amount of ETH held by wallets that do not belong to centralized crypto exchanges (CEX) and have limited Ethereum outflow broke a record in June. According to the data, it broke a historical record in June, reaching 22.7465 million ETH as of June 30. This figure was 16.7281 million ETH in June, which means a massive increase of 35.97 percent. Additionally, these addresses broke a record for purchases made in a single month by accumulating 6.0184 million ETH in June. The analyst noted that another record that ETH achieved in June was in Liquid Staking. According to the data, since June 1, staking activity has increased significantly, with the staking amount increasing from 34.546084M ETH to 35.526482M ETH from June 1 to June 30. “This represents an increase of nearly one million ETH in just one month, breaking a monthly staking record on Ethereum with a growth of 2.83%. This represents an increase of nearly 1 million ETH in just one month and represents the largest single-month increase in Ethereum history. He said that most of the addresses accumulating massive amounts of Ethereum belong to institutional investors, ETFs, and whales, who prefer to earn returns through staking while waiting for significant price appreciation. Finally, the analyst stated that although the price of Ethereum has not exploded yet, institutional investors continue to accumulate and lock up ETH at record levels and ETH may be preparing for a significant rise. *This is not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Franklin Templeton warns corporate crypto treasuries could deepen price crashes if markets turn bearish. Over 130 public firms have adopted Bitcoin reserves, raising billions through premium-priced equity and debt. A falling market-to-NAV ratio risks triggering forced sales, creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral. While the strategy has drawn praise for fueling institutional adoption and boosting company valuations, the firm cautioned that the model’s inherent risks could trigger a destructive feedback loop in bearish conditions. Publicly traded companies have been aggressively raising capital through equity, convertible notes, and other instruments to load up on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana for their balance sheets. 135 Listed Firms Have Adopted Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows 135 listed firms have deployed this playbook in BTC alone, with leaders including Strategy, Metaplanet, Twenty One, SharpLink, Upexi, and Sol Strategies. Inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, firms have raised billions since early 2024 by issuing shares at premiums to net asset value (NAV) and capitalizing on crypto volatility. Franklin Templeton analysts highlighted how the upsides of this approach include the ability to raise capital above NAV, making share issuance accretive even amid price swings. Additionally, for Proof-of-Stake assets like Ethereum and Solana, staking yields can add revenue streams, enhancing company growth when crypto prices rise. Rising markets can further attract investors, fueling a positive feedback loop. The Strategy Treasury Playbook pic.twitter.com/YXXdZmtlIm — Franklin Templeton Digital Assets (@FTDA_US) July 2, 2025 However, the report flagged a significant downside: if the market-to-NAV ratio slips below 1, equity issuance becomes dilutive, undermining investor confidence and stalling capital inflows. Worse, if crypto prices fall sharply, companies might feel pressured to sell holdings to support their stock price, sending crypto prices even lower and deepening investor fear. Such a negative feedback loop could turn a price dip into a self-reinforcing crash. “The corporate crypto treasury model represents a new phase of institutional crypto adoption, but it is not without its risks,” Franklin Templeton wrote. Maintaining a premium to NAV and managing market volatility will be essential to avoid dangerous spirals. More Analysts Voice Concern Over Bitcoin Treasuries The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). To protect investors, he suggested suspending ATM programs if shares trade below 0.95 times NAV for more than 10 consecutive days. Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy. According to Pomerantz, Strategy overstated the benefits of its Bitcoin treasury strategy and downplayed the volatility and risks inherent to large-scale Bitcoin holdings.

Markets remained bullish but volatile throughout the month, while stablecoins became a focal point. On Thursday, July 3, Binance Research published a report outlining key trends from the past month. Most notably, stablecoin volume reached $253.7 billion, as landmark legislation passed the U.S. Senate. The passage of the Genius Act in the Senate was a major catalyst that drove stablecoin adoption. The act brings stablecoins into a regulated framework, prompting more companies to enter the space. Circle’s USDC led the charge, accounting for 79% of net stablecoin issuance in June. At the same time, stablecoin regulation served as a catalyst for growth in other areas. The total crypto market cap rose 2.62% in June, despite volatility caused by the Israel-Iran conflict. Interestingly, Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed altcoins, with its dominance rising to 65%, the highest level since early 2021. Crypto-related firms also saw significant gains, especially those embracing Bitcoin treasury strategies. Several companies saw quadruple-digit returns since adopting Bitcoin, which helped attract new investors. Notably, Japanese firm Metaplanet overtook Strategy as the best-performing Bitcoin play on the stock market.

Net inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs stood at $4.5 billion and $1.16 billion, respectively. Still, traders experienced significant liquidations, highlighting the growing divide between short-term speculators and long-term investors. On June 22, the market saw the largest three-day liquidation event since February, primarily triggered by the escalation of conflict between Israel and Iran.

But my investment in XRP is based on this opinion.” Van Code didn’t offer a timeline to go with his prediction, and he specifically emphasized that he believes it’s okay for people to share their opinions, no matter how big or small. This resonated through the crypto community because XRP is one of the most controversial coins in the crypto industry; some see XRP as a dinosaur doomed to stagnate while others think it’s about to break out .

Notably, the crypto asset has experienced a strong upswing this week, jumping 17% following this year’s positive XRP ETF news. On Thursday, Kelly Stewart, widely known as “Kelly in Vegas,” a popular sports analyst, weighed in on the ongoing debate over XRP’s potential, identifying key indicators that could signal a path to $100. “ If XRP hits $100, there will be signs,” Stewart tweeted in response to a discussion about Kansas State University’s search for new revenue sources. Notably, K-State’s athletic department is looking to generate over $20 million ahead of the 2025-26 academic year, a pivotal period when colleges are expected to begin revenue-sharing with student-athletes. According to a report, the university is exploring multiple strategies to bridge this funding gap, including expanded beer sales, naming rights, and on-field football sponsorships. Stewart’s comment quickly gained traction within both the crypto and sports betting communities, igniting discussions about potential financial opportunities for K-State. “If/when it does, give me a call, and we will make a deal. That goes for anyone out there that might want to showcase their brand at K-State and the 20+ million TV viewers we had this past season,” Shawn Becket, Senior Manager of Business Development for Kansas State Athletics replied. Becket’s statement hinted at the possibility of XRP-powered sponsorships or advertising opportunities at K-State, reinforcing the growing intersection between crypto and sports. If the university were to integrate XRP, it could unlock new revenue streams, particularly given the rapid adoption of digital assets across the sports sector. Kansas State Athletics has already transitioned to an entirely cashless payment system across its venues, including ticket offices, concessions, parking, and merchandise stores. Currently, it accepts credit and debit cards, as well as Apple Pay, but has yet to embrace cryptocurrency payments officially. Meanwhile, across the sports industry, some teams have been integrating cryptocurrency into their business models, with the NBA’s Sacramento Kings and Dallas Mavericks and European soccer powerhouse SL Benfica all embracing BTC, ETH, DOGE, SHIB, and other coins for ticketing and merchandise purchases. Japan’s SBI e-Sports even compensates players in XRP, showcasing the currency’s growing utility. That said, beyond expanding sponsorship partnerships, several factors will further play a crucial role in XRP reaching the $100 milestone. Regulatory clarity in the U.S. remains a key catalyst, as legal battles continue to influence investor sentiment. A favorable outcome could attract institutional investors and bolster market confidence. Additionally, the approval of a spot XRP ETF would significantly increase demand, making the asset more accessible to traditional investors.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING|ASIA|BTC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-03 15:28:04

Fraudsters used social engineering techniques to build trust with victims over time, an approach commonly known as “pig butchering.” This joint effort resulted in the largest-ever crypto seizure by the USSS, totaling approximately $225 million. The USSS investigation targeted sophisticated fraud rings that prey on individuals, luring them into fake cryptocurrency investments. Victims of pig butchering schemes are gradually encouraged to deposit increasing amounts, only to eventually discover their funds have been stolen. The $225 million in question was initially frozen by Tether in 2023, after being linked to pig butchering in a United States Department of Justice investigation. The stolen funds were tied to the perpetrators’ accounts at a non-Kraken centralized exchange. Identifying the victims and returning their funds presented a challenge, requiring significant knowledge of blockchain analytics. In March 2024, we joined several cryptocurrency exchanges in an intensive, weeklong law enforcement sprint. Our compliance and investigative teams provided rapid, real-time responses to crucial information requests and our timely provision of transaction and account information was instrumental in identifying nearly 500 victims. This directly supported the USSS in obtaining the seizure warrant for the unprecedented $225 million confiscation of stolen funds. We remain dedicated to cooperating with law enforcement to safeguard the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Our rapid-response approach and meticulous record-keeping reflect our ongoing commitment to security , transparency and protecting our customers . We also have strict policies and procedures to protect client privacy while supplying data when we have a legal obligation to do so. We continue to actively participate in efforts aimed at identifying and stopping fraud, supporting victim recovery and maintaining trust within the crypto community. “Protecting clients is our highest priority, and we’re proud to have supported efforts leading to this historic recovery of stolen funds. Our rigorous compliance practices, cutting-edge security protocols, and onchain investigative capabilities reflect our deep commitment to safeguarding client assets and preserving confidence in crypto. We will continue to fight fraud and help ensure the crypto ecosystem remains safe and secure for all users,” said David Zacks, Kraken Deputy Chief Compliance Officer. If you believe you are a victim of cryptocurrency fraud, we encourage you to report your case to your local authorities and to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at https://www.ic3.gov/ .

The analyst predicted that it could witness a 150% surge as it looks to grab the liquidity above its current range. PEPE Eyes Rally To $0.000025 In Bid To Grab Liquidity Above In a TradingView post, Crypto Inside shared an accompanying chart in which he predicted that PEPE could jump to as high as $0.000025 following its reclaim of the $0.000010 support zone. He explained that this price surge could occur because there is currently more liquidity above than below. Related Reading: PEPE Eyes 500% Move In Pre-Breakout Retest, Can It Outperform Dogecoin? The chart showed that there is a total sell liquidity of 10,678.659 trillion around this $0.00025 range. Meanwhile, the total buy liquidity for PEPE below its current crucial support zone is 6,827.768 trillion. It is worth mentioning that a rally to $0.000025 will bring the meme coin close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00002825. Crypto Inside touched on the meme coin’s liquidity depth. The analyst stated that the price moves from one liquidity to another and that this is the meme coin’s fuel. He remarked that there is significantly more of this fuel accumulated at the top, alluding to the sell liquidity. The analyst added that PEPE has always been a highly speculative asset, and during prolonged one-sided movements, extremely high funding is formed in it. This, he noted, provokes sharp jumps in price. Crypto Inside also commented on the current PEPE price action. He noted that the meme coin has now reached the largest zone of interest at $00.0000817 and is trying to consolidate there. He remarked that this is a powerful level around which consolidation can be expected before further growth. However, he warned that if the PEPE price falls below it without the possibility of returning, it will be an extremely bearish signal. The Meme Coin’s Narrative Is Still Strong As part of his analysis, Crypto Inside suggested that PEPE’s narrative is still strong, which is why the meme coin still has a chance to reach new highs. He explained that the narrative itself is still important in meme coins and that PEPE is an “eternal meme,” which will live forever. He added that it is the embodiment of meme culture in the world.

He declared that it will definitely not die as a narrative and that there is nothing to worry about. However, he admitted that new meme coins like Fartcoin have stretched liquidity across the market, and many have left PEPE for “new shiny things.” At the time of writing, the PEPE price is trading at around $0.00001056, over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

33767162,[object Object],1751556644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Sees Unusual Mix Of Whale Gains Secured And Realized Losses – What This Means,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whale-gains-and-losses/,"A sudden resurgence of bullish action has taken over the broader market, with Bitcoin rising sharply beyond the $109,000 price mark once again. While BTC has rebounded strongly to key resistance levels, whale investors are sending a complex message with a rise in their realized profits and losses. A Major Internal Shift Brewing For Bitcoin Amidst recent price spikes, Kripto Mevsimi, an author and market expert, revealed a rare trend among Bitcoin whales or large-scale investors. “The final week of June revealed intense, mixed behavior from large Bitcoin holders,” the expert stated. Data from the expert shows that whales are locking in profits and realizing losses at the same time, at a rapid rate. The development is considered an unusual dual dynamic, indicating that a substantial internal recalibration is taking place. After examining the BTC Whale Realized Profit metric, Mevsimi highlighted that over $641 million in gains and over $1.24 billion in losses were realized by new whales . The on-chain expert has flagged the development as a rare combination that signals a major internal shift. Furthermore, it was observed that some late participants gave up, but others, possibly those who had accumulated earlier in the second quarter of this year, locked in profits. However, old whales made $91 million in profits, with very little loss realized. Mevsimi stated that this confluence of capitulation and profit-taking may have marked a local exhaustion point, which might lay the foundation for new market structures in the upcoming weeks. Timing And Behavior Adding Weight To The Development It is interesting to note that this trend continues till the end of June, a month for rebalancing Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs ) and institutional funds portfolios. However, this activity stopped in early July, indicating either a brief equilibrium or a possible turning point. “For now, June’s closing week stands out — not for price action alone, but for what it revealed about underlying flows,” Mevsimi added. According to the expert, such a timing adds weight to the trend, highlighting this wasn’t just noise; instead, it might have been a purposeful shift in position. In the past, local bottoms have frequently coincided with sudden increases in realized losses, particularly from short-term players . Although there is no definite signal, the expert believes it is crucial to pay close attention to how the timing and behavior line up here. Profit-taking might be swelling currently, but Bitcoin continues to eye upside targets, even new all-time highs. Titan of Crypto has outlined a Bull Flag breakout attempt that could result in a significant rally. BTC has also formed a bullish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crossover, indicating upside potential as this move often precedes price spikes . Should BTC breakout from the chart pattern, Titan of Crypto has predicted a surge to the $137,000 milestone by mid-August.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Bull Flag Pattern|bullish MACD crossover|CryptoQuant|ETFs|exchange-traded funds|Kripto Mevsimi|MACD|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|Profit-taking|Titan of Crypto,EN,0,0,AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-03 15:30:44

In a recent post on the X platform, Martinez told his followers that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator, which has predicted every major Bitcoin crash, had flashed again. The indicator, according to Martinez, was warning that a 63% reversal could be in the offing. “The Tom DeMark Sequential just gave a quarterly sell signal. This is a rare warning that has historically preceded brutal drawdowns,” the pundit stated. Martinez noted that the TD Sequential sent a sell signal in 2015, and a 75% Bitcoin drop ensued. In 2018, the same setup saw Bitcoin plummet by over 85%. The TD Sequential indicator is an oscillating trend-following chart overlay indicator that is used to identify short-term trend reversals based on changes in intraday highs and lows. In other words, the indicator sparks when an asset sees an overextended rally and is due for a brutal correction. In this case, the indicator predicts that the BTC price could see a frantic drop from the current level, dropping as much as 63%, to trade hands at around $40,000. Such a move would mark a huge drawdown as Bitcoin has been trading above the psychologically important $100K level for the most part in recent months. Today, BTC topped the $110,000 mark for the first time since June 11 after U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew in roughly $408 million on Wednesday — a sign of investors’ unwavering confidence. Since May 1, these BTC products have registered $9.91 billion in inflows, approximately 20% of their total inflows since launching in January 2024, data from Farside shows.

Investors and crypto enthusiasts have historically flocked to meme coins like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB, captivated by their cultural appeal and explosive price rallies. Now, the fusion of meme culture and artificial intelligence presents a new category of meme coins, offering both viral popularity and genuine technological innovation. With the crypto bull run gaining momentum, investors are looking closely at AI-powered meme coins as the next major opportunity. Future Pepe ($FPEPE) has recently emerged as one of the most compelling projects in this niche. But how does $FPEPE measure up against its peers, and could it truly outpace the meme coin giants? Discover Future Pepe Why Investors Are Bullish on AI-Powered Meme Coins Artificial intelligence has transformed industries globally, from healthcare to finance. The integration of AI into cryptocurrency—particularly meme coins—offers significant benefits: Enhanced Security: AI-driven smart contract scanners can instantly detect scams and vulnerabilities. Market Prediction: AI tools deliver valuable insights and predictive analytics, helping investors make smarter trading decisions. Viral Appeal and Practical Utility: Meme coins powered by AI blend investor appeal with practical, revenue-generating utility. This unique combination significantly differentiates AI meme coins from traditional tokens, positioning them to attract both retail and institutional investors. Comparing AI Meme Coin Leaders: Future Pepe, SHIB, and WIF Let’s compare three popular meme coins that integrate or leverage innovative technology and strong community support: 1. Future Pepe ($FPEPE) Future Pepe is rapidly emerging as a frontrunner, combining viral meme culture with cutting-edge AI innovation. Its revolutionary AI anti-rug technology provides real-time protection against rug pulls and scams, a significant breakthrough for the crypto space. Key Features: AI Anti-Rug Scanner: Proactively identifies and mitigates threats in smart contracts, ensuring investor security. Deflationary Tokenomics: Systematic token burns and reduced circulating supply boost long-term value. Robust Staking Rewards: Holders can earn 20–30% APY, incentivizing holding and reducing market volatility. Audited and Transparent: Verified by Coinsult and SolidProof, enhancing credibility and trust. Future Pepe’s robust and growing community of over 100,000 members further reinforces its position, driving organic growth and adoption. 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu has long transcended meme coin status, expanding into DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and metaverse integrations. Recently, SHIB introduced Shibarium, its Layer-2 solution, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing transaction fees. Key Features: Layer-2 Blockchain (Shibarium): Enhances scalability and drastically reduces transaction costs. ShibaSwap (DEX): A decentralized exchange providing liquidity and staking options. Active Token Burn Mechanism: Reduces circulating supply and supports long-term token appreciation. However, despite these innovations, SHIB has not yet fully integrated advanced AI-driven security tools, leaving a crucial gap compared to Future Pepe. 3. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat leads meme coin culture on the Solana blockchain, benefiting from Solana’s low fees and fast transaction speeds. Its community-centric model has successfully created vibrant engagement and application-level integrations. Key Features: Solana Integration: Quick, low-cost transactions appealing to everyday investors and developers. Community Applications: Numerous community-created apps and games enhance token utility. Deflationary Supply: Regular token burns maintain scarcity and incentivize price appreciation. Yet, WIF, like SHIB, lacks the advanced AI security capabilities and predictive insights that Future Pepe offers. Why Future Pepe Stands Out as the Potential Meme Leader of 2025 Future Pepe’s key advantage lies in its unique and sophisticated AI-driven security framework, directly addressing investor concerns about DeFi scams and rug pulls. This practical utility not only differentiates it from other meme coins but also attracts institutional interest and serious investors, enhancing long-term stability. Analysts predict potential substantial upside for Future Pepe: Moderate scenario: 10–20x returns shortly after major exchange listings. Bullish scenario: 50–100x growth in sustained bullish market conditions. Final Thoughts AI-powered meme coins represent the next phase of crypto evolution, offering genuine innovation coupled with meme-driven virality. Future Pepe ($FPEPE), with its groundbreaking AI anti-rug tech, strong community, and robust tokenomics, is emerging as a leading candidate for significant growth in 2025. While SHIB and WIF continue to perform strongly, Future Pepe’s unique AI integration provides a powerful edge, positioning it to potentially outpace its peers and redefine meme coin investing.

The agreement was disclosed in a press release on Tether’s website on Thursday. The two companies plan to collaborate on a Bitcoin mining pilot project in Brazil, merging renewable energy capabilities with Tether’s digital asset expertise. Adecoagro is a Nasdaq-listed company with major operations in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay that currently manages over 230 megawatts of electrical generation capacity sourced from renewables. Adecoagro to use Tether mining software According to the statement , the pilot project will be launched using Tether’s proprietary Mining OS, a mining site management software. Tether announced that the software will be open-sourced in the coming months. Adecoagro’s company policies on related-party transactions state that its Independent Committee has reviewed and approved the initiative. The company sees this mining project as more than a means of monetizing surplus electricity. It is seeking to diversify its balance sheet with digital assets like Bitcoin. “ We’re excited to explore innovative ways to maximize the value of our renewable energy assets ,” reckoned Mariano Bosch, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Adecoagro. Bosch explained that the partnership could allow the company to stabilize the pricing of energy it currently sells on the spot market while gaining upside exposure to Bitcoin. Speaking on the new MOU, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino talked about the synergy between Adecoagro’s agricultural energy infrastructure and Tether’s portfolio of mining operations. “ This project is another step in our growing commitment to renewable-powered bitcoin mining ,” said Ardoino. “ It highlights the potential to align agricultural energy production with cutting-edge digital infrastructure .” Adecoagro is in the sustainable food and energy production business, but has now promised to assess Bitcoin mining as an alternative source of demand for its existing power generation infrastructure. Using 230 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, a Bitcoin mining operation can deploy thousands of ASIC machines such as the Antminer S19 XP, consuming roughly 3,000 watts. At this scale, the operation could reach a hash rate of approximately 6.9 exahashes per second (EH/s), roughly 1.6% of the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate, which currently stands near 430 EH/s. Given the current mining difficulty and an average block reward of 3.125 BTC post-halving, a setup could mine a full block approximately once every 2 to 3 days. If efficiently managed and powered by low-cost renewable energy, Adecoagro facilities would rank among the world’s largest industrial-scale mining operations. Ardoino believes the USDT parent company will become the biggest bitcoin miner by the end of 2025. Tether recently disclosed it holds more than 100,000 BTC, worth over $10 billion. Tether takes an extra step into Africa with Zanzibar partnership On July 1, Tether also announced a collaboration with the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, located off the coast of Tanzania. The company signed another MOU, this time with the Zanzibar eGovernment Authority, to improve the financial inclusion and blockchain education on the islands. As part of the initiative, Tether plans to work alongside educational institutions in Zanzibar to incorporate blockchain and digital asset knowledge into school and university curricula. This could help citizens add to their knowledge about decentralized technologies and encourage the development of a local digital economy. Tether also intends to integrate its stablecoins, including the US dollar-pegged USDT and gold-backed XAUT, into ZanMalipo, Zanzibar’s government-controlled digital payments platform. Through ZanMalipo, local users can legally engage with digital currencies directly through an official channel. “This MOU with the Zanzibar eGovernment Authority reflects our commitment to advancing financial literacy and sustainable blockchain innovation in Africa,” Ardoino said. The Tether CEO added that by investing in educational initiatives and integrating digital assets into formal systems, the company is helping lay the foundation for a compliant and inclusive financial future.

The electric carmaker’s shares have plunged 34% from their record high, and its second-quarter sales just dropped nearly 14%, missing analyst predictions. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, now back in the White House, is publicly feuding with Elon Musk, escalating political heat on the company from all directions. Still, regular investors are standing by their man. According to The Wall Street Journal , people like Nick Dolya, a 48-year-old living in Winter Park, Florida, are still all-in. Nick says he owns $500,000 in Tesla stock, and this year, instead of selling, he’s been adding more. “I’m not a car junkie, but it’s very safe, and I think it’s one of the best car experiences. It’s kind of like what [the] iPhone was 10 years ago,” Nick said. He, his wife, and his daughter all drive a Model Y. He’s planning to buy a fourth Model Y when his youngest daughter turns 16 next year. His 20-year-old son didn’t get one because of limited chargers near his college campus. Retail buyers double down as institutions pull back Nick says he’s personally convinced 20 people—friends, neighbors, and coworkers—to buy a Model Y. He says it’s not about hype. He thinks half the cars on the road could eventually be Model Y vehicles. And while Elon is getting slammed from both parties in Washington, and his approval numbers are down, none of that seems to be shaking Nick or thousands of others holding the stock. Even with falling delivery numbers, Tesla shares jumped 5% on Wednesday. That came just hours after the company’s disappointing sales report. And it wasn’t Wall Street driving that recovery. It was individual traders. On Interactive Brokers, Tesla was the most actively traded stock during the five days ending Monday. The platform logged 236,826 buy orders, massively outpacing the number of shares sold. The buying frenzy didn’t stop there. Traders also poured into a fund that offers double the exposure to Tesla’s price moves, showing that retail traders are looking to juice their positions even more. They’re not cutting losses, they’re actually chasing them harder. But Wall Street doesn’t share that optimism. Analysts are still warning that Tesla’s valuation is overinflated. Right now, the stock trades at 132 times its trailing 12-month earnings, way above its 10-year average of 125.7. By comparison, companies in the S&P 500 average just 22.2 times earnings. And many experts say that kind of multiple just isn’t sustainable. Analysts lower targets while fans raise bets Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, released a note Wednesday with a valuation model that puts Tesla’s fair value at $258 per share, which is 18% below its current price. Garrett’s firm kept a “hold” rating and slapped a 12-month target of $320 on the stock. Across 54 analysts tracked by FactSet, the average target is $311.12. So while retail investors think they’re buying early, analysts think they’re overpaying. Still, this isn’t a normal stock story. Tesla has more retail support than any of the other top US tech companies, including Apple and Amazon. In FactSet’s breakdown of shareholder types, Tesla has the highest percentage of “other” investors, a category that excludes big institutions and insiders. It’s filled with individuals using trading apps, crypto bros on X, and people betting their future on TSLA. Some say they’ve made serious profits riding the stock’s wild swings. Others are betting long-term, ignoring analyst targets and traditional metrics. The retail crowd has stuck around through every drop and spike, and they don’t seem scared of another one. That belief extends beyond just stock ownership. Elon Musk has used the inflated share price to raise billions of dollars for his other ventures, many of which aren’t making money and probably won’t for a long time. But thanks to Tesla’s performance, he keeps getting more money. Love him or hate him, but Elon really is one of the greatest businessmen alive.

Bitcoin Price Rebounds After Jobs Data Dip,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/best-crypto-to-buy-now-bitcoin-price-rebounds-after-jobs-data-dip,"Market reactions to US government economic reports have always been powerful catalysts for price movements, particularly within the crypto space. From inflation numbers to jobs data, even the most subtle deviation from expectation can send assets into sharp swings. In many cases, these shifts are not immediate. This is why the latest unemployment report was closely watched. Most assumed a negative outcome would trigger a sharp correction, or at the very least a fresh bout of volatility. And yet, even as the report landed with surprising strength, Bitcoin did the unexpected again and dumped. However, its rebound, swift and clean, has now become the centerpiece of speculation as the next leg of upward momentum begins to take shape. Bitcoin Rebounds Strong Despite Surprising Jobs Data June’s employment data turned out to be a major upside surprise. The US added 147,000 jobs , decisively beating the analyst forecast of just 106,000. The unemployment rate also dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, in direct contrast to the anticipated rise to 4.3%. For traditional markets, this would typically signal economic strength. For crypto, however, such clarity often brings chaos. JUST IN: The US 🇺🇸 unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in June 2025 from 4.2% in May, against market expectations of 4.3%. The rate has stayed between 4.0% and 4.2% since May 2024, indicating labor market stability. #unemployment #economy pic.twitter.com/OTHIiIZFoS — Crypto Dives (@MakroDives) July 3, 2025 The moment the figures were published, Bitcoin’s price took a sharp dip. It had been hovering around the $110,000 level before swiftly dropping below $108,900 in what many described as a flash dump. That alone caught retail traders off guard, who had expected the report to bring caution but not immediate selling pressure. The irony is that better-than-expected news still triggered a selloff, reinforcing the unpredictable ways in which crypto reacts to macroeconomic indicators. Yet within minutes, the market reversed course. Buyer volume surged just as rapidly as the dump occurred, pushing Bitcoin right back to its earlier levels. This kind of V-shaped move is often interpreted as a sign of underlying confidence. Some see it as a possible instance of strategic accumulation, where institutions or large players take advantage of momentary retail weakness to secure stronger positions. Regardless of the motive, the rebound above $110,000 has now strengthened the view that Bitcoin remains resilient. This also suggests that support zones are tightening, and with labor market indicators showing consistency, the wider market might interpret this as a green light for continued bullishness. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Projects That May Trend As Investors’ Attention Increases SUBBD With the US unemployment rate dropping unexpectedly, the narrative of job creation and opportunity has taken center stage again. And while most eyes are still on traditional sectors, SUBBD has quietly been building a creator-centric economic layer that may well play a part in the next wave of decentralized employment. SUBBD is not simply a content hosting platform. It is a creator-owned infrastructure designed to ensure that revenue flows back into the hands of those producing the content rather than intermediaries. This changes how influence, information, and income move in digital ecosystems. For creators, this means more than just a place to publish. It offers a financial model where subscriptions, tips, premium content, and micro-communities operate without centralized platforms skimming off the majority. That opens the door to sustainable, independent income at scale. As macroeconomic indicators show a strengthening labor market, projects like SUBBD sit well with this new direction. It turns digital visibility into capital, and it does so on-chain. The user base is evolving from speculative early adopters to real professionals who view blockchain as a tool rather than a trend. It has already been endorsed by top creators like ClayBro and others, adding to its popularity and trust factor. In a market like this, where investor attention is leaning towards tangible utility and user-driven models, SUBBD is positioned at a very strong intersection. If Bitcoin’s rebound is a signal of the next bullish leg, then the creator economy’s expansion may follow suit, and SUBBD could very well be a key player leading that charge. Token 6900 The crypto market has always swung between seriousness and satire. Token 6900 leans hard into the latter, but make no mistake, its timing and structure suggest a deeper understanding of how narratives move this market. With Bitcoin rebounding cleanly from its post-report dip, many believe that the speculative phase may reignite. That creates the perfect backdrop for tokens like 6900, which do not rely on long whitepapers or roadmap jargon, but on raw energy, meme culture, and irony weaponized as community fuel. Token 6900 positions itself as a cultural capsule from the last memecoin cycle. It brings back everything that defined the earlier mania with chaotic graphics, bizarre tone, and absurd web design. And somehow, that chaotic energy is exactly what investors seem to be waiting for. Especially now, as prices begin to climb and fear turns into curiosity again. What makes Token 6900 stand out is its unapologetic approach. It is not trying to please everyone. It is here to cater to the same tribe that made previous degen tokens 100x in weeks. And unlike random meme coins with no storyline, Token 6900 is tapping into a very specific visual and narrative aesthetic that has already proven to work, particularly referencing its loose alignment with SPX 6900 and its deep-cut internet themes. If capital starts rotating back into the higher-risk pockets of crypto, Token 6900 may not just start the degen crypto movement again. It might help shape it. And that makes it worth watching closely. Snorter In the past few months, the demand for accessible trading tools inside messaging apps has quietly exploded. Snorter has emerged as one of the most focused plays on this trend. Built to function directly within Telegram, Snorter combines an AI-powered interface with multi-chain connectivity, allowing users to trade, track, and manage crypto activity without leaving the chat environment. The brilliance of Snorter is in how much it eliminates friction. Users no longer need to toggle between exchanges, wallets, and price trackers. With Snorter, everything happens inside the interface they already use every day. This has huge implications, especially as new investors return to the market following Bitcoin’s resilience. In moments of sharp movement, like the recent flash dip and rebound, fast reaction times become everything and Snorter turns Telegram into a trading terminal that can respond in seconds. More than just speed, it also offers customization. From sniping tools to AI price insights and portfolio monitoring, Snorter is built for users who want more control but less clutter. It bridges casual Telegram users with serious DeFi functions in a way that few projects have done effectively. As crypto gears up for a possible speculative wave, tools like Snorter will likely see more demand. The project does not just benefit from a bullish market — it enhances a trader’s ability to survive one. That positions it as both a product and a utility layer, and it makes Snorter increasingly difficult to ignore. Best Wallet Token As Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels and confidence begins returning to the broader market, investor behavior is shifting with it. The rush is no longer just about finding the next 10x token, but also about equipping oneself with the right tools to navigate whatever cycle comes next. Best Wallet Token stands out here because it does not simply ride on speculative hype. It is backed by infrastructure that is already useful, already adopted, and already ahead of what most wallets today offer. Best Wallet is a high-performance Web3 wallet that supports over 60 blockchains. That level of connectivity matters now more than ever. In a market where cross-chain activity is becoming standard, the ability to seamlessly move, manage, and interact with assets across multiple networks is no longer a premium feature. It is essential. Best Wallet delivers this with a UX that feels familiar but operates on far more advanced rails. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 But the token itself is where the utility deepens. Best Wallet Token is not just a governance piece. It is integrated into access, tiered features, staking incentives, and future rollouts of wallet-native applications. This gives it actual use across a growing product suite, not just abstract value. The project has raised upwards of $13 million already, and could soon be ready to launch in the coming weeks. With investor attention returning and market participants setting up for longer plays, wallets become central again. They are the access point. The control layer. And Best Wallet, with its expanding reach and real-world functionality, may be one of the few built to handle what’s coming next. Conclusion The current market sentiment, paved by Bitcoin’s resilience and reinforced by stronger economic indicators, has created a positive backdrop for high-potential crypto assets. Projects that offer a pathway to emerging user behavior, provide real utility, or tap into renewed investor energy are gaining traction fast. From infrastructure plays to cultural tokens and creator-driven ecosystems, the trend is clear; the market is rewarding relevance and readiness. As momentum builds and capital begins flowing with greater conviction, this may be a prime window to consider assets that are not only built for speculation, but also designed to thrive in the next stage of the cycle.

Over $1.4 billion in transaction volume over the past 24 hours has pushed the meme coin to a 15% gain to start July, and it appears to be driven by more than purely retail flows Whales are core contributors to this accumulation, increasing their holdings by over 5% over the past month to top $7.95 billion, according to Nansen data . Smart money typically moves ahead of the market, placing interest in the month to come as a potential reversal point as PEPE remains 60% below its late-2024 high. The total PEPE supply on exchanges has also dropped to its lowest level in over two years, falling to 246.82 trillion—a 2.66% decline since early July. Pepe supply held on exchanges. Source: Nansen. Fewer tokens on exchanges typically signal a shift toward HODLing, as investors move holdings into self-custody. Pepe Price Analysis: Is This the Start of a Push to $1? The early July surge has pushed Pepe to retest critical support at $0.00001035—the final barrier to confirming the breakout of a 6-month cup and handle pattern. Having completed the corrective ABC phase of a potential Elliott Wave structure, mid-June now stands as a likely local bottom, favoring bullish continuation within the pattern’s broader trend. PEPE / USDT 3-day chart, cup and handle breakout. Source: TradingView, Binance. Momentum indicators tell a similar story: buy pressure is returning. The RSI has sustained a lasting uptrend for the first time since the downtrend forming the handle began, now sitting just below the neutral line at 49 as buyers step back in. The MACD is also flashing bullish signals. While the daily chart has already confirmed a golden cross, the 3-day time frame could soon follow suit, hinting at a potential longer-term uptrend. More so, the MACD en route to cross above the signal line in a potential golden cross. While it has already formed on the 1-day chart, the 3-day time frame points to a longer-term uptrend. Should the PEPE price close above $0.00001035 decisively, the pattern projects a technical target in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002160—a 117% gain from current levels. The coveted $1 target will likely hinge on more sustained long-term growth driven by increased adoption and deflationary measures like token burns, given the meme coin’s current $4.28 billion market cap. However, if it fails, PEPE risks a false breakout and a continuation of its current downtrend. The next key support $0.0000079—aligned with the end of the prior Elliott Wave structure—potentially signaling a deeper correction. This Under-the-Radar Narrative Could Shape the Next Bull Market Winners The last bull run collapsed when the now-bankrupt exchange giant FTX was exposed for misusing customer funds—the narrative of the next bull run will have an emphasis on security and self-storage.

Ethereum Price Indicators Turn Bullish, But Another Token is Preparing for a Bigger Rally",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/eth-to-3500-ethereum-price-indicators-turn-bullish-but-another-token-is-preparing-for-a-bigger-rally/,"Ethereum (ETH) may be eyeing a breakout to $3,500, as recent crypto charts and market sentiment hint at renewed bullish momentum. While ETH remains a staple, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising performer in the DeFi market is generating buzz as the next big cryptocurrency to watch. Phase 5 Presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now over 50% sold out and MUTM is priced at $0.03. More than 12,700 investors have joined the Mutuum Finance presale. The sum of more than $11.5 million has been raised so far. While Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong, it’s Mutuum’s ongoing presale and growing traction that’s fueling whispers of a much bigger rally ahead, one that could outpace even top cryptocurrencies like ETH and SOL in the short term. Ethereum Builds Momentum With Eyes on $3,500 Breakout Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2470, and it is not losing grounds alongside the slowly emerging bullish momentum on the market. Having support at around $2,400, the ETH is currently traversing toward some important resistance levels and analysts are of the view that a clear break above the level of $3,000 may unlock the next leg in the ETH upward where the next stop by the end of the week may be the level of $3,500. On-chain indicators are getting stronger, and accumulation is being boosted, as investor sentiment is better than before after recent network improvements and consistent inflows of ETFs. Though, in the short-term, volatility cannot be excluded, particularly in case ETH managed to fall below the price of $2,370, the bias is shifting towards the upside. However, just as Ethereum prepares to break out, traders are casting their eyes elsewhere, with quicker-moving presale token Mutuum Finance catching the eye of many because of its short-term potential gains. Investor Interest in Mutuum Finance Presale Soars Mutuum Finance is gaining significant momentum in Phase 5 of the presale. The project stands out from others by offering a scalable system of finance with a real-world use case. Investor interest is gaining momentum with the project having raised well over $11.5 million already and having over 12,700 token holders. Introducing a DeFi Lending Model Mutuum Finance introduces a non-custodial liquidity protocol in which users retain their total ownership of assets while they participate in decentralized lending. The project adopts a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to foster increased flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to deliver automated lending without any human intervention and instead, the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model removes middlemen and thus offers a direct link between lenders and borrowers. The model is highly favored by users in dealing with volatile assets where flexibility and tailor-made terms are required. CertiK-Audited with a $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is also operating on the development of the fully collateralized Ethereum-based USD-backed stablecoin. The project incorporates smart contracts that are audited by security company, CertiK. Besides the guarantee of ensuring good maintenance of the code, this audit signifies that the team will be persistent to build a safe protocol DeFi. In order to reinforce this commitment, Mutuum Finance has implemented its Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK through which it has allocated $50,000 in USDT rewards. The program has four levels, critical, major, minor, and low, and makes sure that any level of vulnerabilities are discovered and rewarded. Ethereum may be gearing up for a breakout to $3,500, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to deliver significantly higher returns in the same time frame. With over $11.5 million raised, 12,700+ early backers, and a presale price still at just $0.03, MUTM offers unmatched upside potential heading into 2025. Phase 5 is over 50% sold out, don’t miss your chance to enter before the next price jump.

Analysts see potential for further gains, with Ali Martinez noting striking similarities between PENGU’s current trajectory and PEPE’s past breakout. PENGU’s Rally The Solana-based Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), which saw the light of day towards the end of last year, appears to be among the latest major trends in the meme coin niche. Its price jumped by over 70% in the past seven days, reaching a two-month high of roughly $0.016. PENGU Price, Source: CoinGecko Its market capitalization surpassed $1 billion, making PENGU the eighth-largest in its field and the 94th-biggest in the entire market. As it rose up the crypto ranks, the asset flipped popular meme coins like dogwifhat ( WIF ), FLOKI (FLOKI), Brett (BRETT), and others. Several factors have positively influenced the token’s valuation over the last week. One of the main ones is Canary Capital’s filing with the CBOE to introduce a PENGU ETF. The fund, if it receives the necessary green light, will become the first in America to hold actual NFTs, specifically from the Pudgy Penguins collection, along with the underlying meme token. Another bullish element is Revolut’s decision to make PENGU available on its trading platform. The listing gives Revolut’s multi-million-user base direct access to the coin, boosting its exposure and contributing significantly to its recent rally. The Next PEPE? PENGU’s price increase as of late has led some industry participants to believe that it could repeat the impressive performance of PEPE, which was at the crest of the wave on a couple of occasions last year. One person who spotted a potential similarity between the dynamics of the two meme coins is Ali Martinez. “PENGU is starting to look a lot like PEPE did before it exploded! A daily close above $0.015–$0.017, and this train could be unstoppable,” he said. Shortly after, Martinez chipped in again, foreseeing that PENGU could be on the verge of a massive rally toward $0.044. Such a move would represent a 200% jump from current levels.

The steady rise marks a clear recovery from June’s low of $6.26, supported by a consistent daily trading volume of over $350 million. The upward move coincides with Uniswap v4’s strong adoption, handling billions in trades post-launch, while improving regulatory clarity draws more institutional attention to the protocol’s ecosystem. Source: CoinGecko From Regulatory Clarity to Record Volume: Why Uniswap Is Leading the Next DeFi Wave Uniswap remains one of the most compelling DeFi protocols to watch and buy, thanks to its relentless pace of innovation and growing institutional interest. Institutional investors are also flocking to the protocol. The January 2025 launch of Uniswap v4 marked a turning point. This upgrade completely redesigned the architecture by consolidating liquidity pools into a single PoolManager contract and adding ERC-6909 support. ERC-6909 is a multi-token contract standard, a simplified alternative to ERC-1155. Unlike ERC-1155, ERC-6909 removes callbacks and batching from the interface, making it more efficient. — Bloqarl | Zealynx (@TheBlockChainer) July 26, 2024 The ERC-6909 token standard supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens, offering flexibility. Interestingly, “hooks” now allow developers to inject custom logic into pools, unlocking new layers of automation, risk management, and smart routing in DeFi. The impact has been immediate. According to blockchain data researcher Sean Kennedy, Uniswap v4 has already crossed $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) and processed over $86 billion in trading volume within six months, indicating rapid adoption. UniSwap v4 just surpassed $1B in TVL & over $86B in all-time v4 volume since launching January 31st pic.twitter.com/3k8g3yPPxW — Sean Kennedy (@Sean_Kennedy_) July 1, 2025 Beyond v4, Uniswap is also generating substantial on-chain revenue. As of mid-2025, it consistently ranks among the top fee-generating DeXs, with a 7-day average of approximately $2.3 million in daily fees, according to CryptoFees. It remains the largest DEX by cumulative volume, surpassing $3 trillion in all-time trades across Ethereum and Layer 2 networks, including Arbitrum , Optimism, and Base. Meanwhile, in a major policy shift, the U.S. SEC indicated in early 2025 that some decentralized protocols could be exempt from securities registration , offering regulatory breathing space for Uniswap and potentially sparking a “DeFi Summer 2.0.” For investors, Uniswap is more than just a DEX. It’s the backbone of infrastructure for decentralized finance. Its technical superiority, expanding cross-chain reach, and favorable regulatory developments make it one of the most promising assets in the current crypto cycle. V-Shaped Rebound or Bull Trap? $UNI’s 24% Surge Faces Key Test The $UNI/USDT 1-hour chart presents a classic V-shaped recovery after a pronounced sell-off, now showing signs of near-term bullish exhaustion following its vertical rally. From late June through early July, Uniswap consolidated between $7.00 and $7.30 before a steep sell-off on July 1 drove the price down to $6.26. The subsequent rebound was explosive, as the asset jumped 24% to $7.74 in under 48 hours, forming a near-perfect V-bottom reversal. This suggests strong bullish momentum, likely fueled by short covering and opportunistic buying at oversold levels. Source: TradingView However, the recovery’s sustainability is now in question. The current session’s price ($7.684) sits just below the rally’s high ($7.745), accompanied by declining volume—a sign of fading participation. The MACD (12,26) tells a similar story. While a bullish crossover initially supported the rally, the MACD line (0.108) has now dipped below the signal line (0.148), and the histogram (+0.140) is losing upward momentum. The convergence of weak volume, bearish MACD divergence, and rejection near $7.75 suggests profit-taking or buyer fatigue. A firm close above $7.8 with increasing volume could invalidate bull exhaustion, while a failure to hold $7.6 could open $UNI to a more substantial pullback toward $7.4, where dip buyers may enter. While the V-bottom structure remains technically bullish, the confluence of weak volume, bearish MACD crossover, and rejection at highs warrants caution. Traders should await confirmation at the key levels above or prepare for a pullback to higher-probability support.

These financial institutions pride themselves on navigating complexity and pursuing innovative strategies. They manage trillions across private equity, credit, venture, and real assets. But for all their sophistication in portfolio construction, many still rely on infrastructure better suited for the fax machine era. Investor records are kept in spreadsheets. Capital calls go out over email. Waterfall calculations are done manually. LPs get quarterly PDFs and little else. The technology stack underneath these firms is fragile, opaque, and overdue for a serious upgrade. Blockchain isn’t a speculative detour; it’s a modern financial operating system. And for asset managers, it offers not just an opportunity to modernize fund administration and operations, but also to unlock new frontiers in product offerings to better serve their existing and future client base. Modernizing Fund Infrastructure The average investment firm still relies on a tangle of administrators, custodians, and transfer agents, each working from their own systems and reconciling records by hand during each stage of a fund’s lifecycle: inception, setup, fundraising and onboarding, operations, trading and liquidity, and closing. Because much of this process is manual and bespoke, mistakes happen, delays are common, and transparency is low, while the cost of compliance and administration continues to rise. Blockchain and tokenization solves for these inefficiencies by standardizing workflows across multiple participants. A permissioned ledger, shared between GPs, LPs, fund admins, transfer agents, auditors, and more, can become the single source of truth for investor accounts, capital flows, and transaction history. Instead of fragmented systems, siloed information, and weekly reconciliations, everyone operates from the same data, updated and visible in real time. Smart contracts can automate capital calls, distributions, and even complex waterfall logic, ensuring that the correct payments go to the correct counterparties, instantly and transparently. And the tokenization and interoperability of different asset types can enable automated, instantaneous settlement. No PDFs, wire delays, and human error. These aren’t gimmicks – they’re operational upgrades. Investors can hold digital fund shares, settle redemptions in stablecoins, and track yield accrual in real time. For cash management, it’s a game-changer. For operational teams, it means fewer bottlenecks and cleaner audit trails. Blockchain and tokenization aren’t just about liquidity, but an opportunity to replace a clunky patchwork of systems with a streamlined, programmable foundation for fund operations. The Next Generation of Investment Vehicles If blockchain is already modernizing fund infrastructure, the next frontier is even more exciting: using the technology to build products that couldn’t exist before. Start with tokenized private credit. Just look at Apollo’s tokenized private credit fund , which has moved more than $100 million on-chain and exists simultaneously on multiple blockchains, making it interoperable with digital custody systems. Or, Franklin Templeton’s Benji platform , where tokenized money market funds live across numerous blockchains, allowing its investors to transfer shares peer‑to‑peer with stablecoins, earn intraday yield down to the second, and access tokenized money‑market liquidity. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s tokenized institutional money market fund has already surpassed $2.5 billion AUM a year after its launch. These products offer more than operational improvements; they allow fractional ownership, secondary liquidity, and a radically more accessible wrapper for investors who want exposure to these products without the commitment of a traditional LP structure. The most forward-looking firms are going even further: building entirely new kinds of on-chain products. Take on-chain yield vaults, a relatively new primitive in crypto, which are like a self-executing investment strategy. Companies like Veda Labs are pioneering smart contracts that stake tokenized assets, sell covered calls, lend to protocols, or arbitrage rates across DeFi, allowing institutions like asset managers to offer white-labeled, branded investment strategies that automate execution while embedding compliance and fee logic directly into the protocol. No spreadsheets or intermediaries, just composable, auditable investment products built for digital-native allocators. Instead of relying on opaque NAV calculations, returns can be verified on-chain. Put simply: this is a new category of investment product. More transparent than an ETF, more automated than a hedge fund, and infinitely more programmable than any legacy wrapper. The Time to Build Is Now Asset managers don’t need to abandon what they’re good at. But they do need to modernize how and what they deliver. Blockchain isn’t a threat to private markets; it’s the upgrade private markets have been waiting for. A way to clean up back-office complexity, lower operational risk, and serve clients with products that are faster, smarter, and more productive. The tools are ready. The infrastructure is live. And the first movers have already shown what’s possible. Asset managers who ignore this innovation risk getting left behind – because while others are still sending capital calls by email, the next generation of investment platforms is already being built: on-chain, in real time, and at scale.",Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-03 17:29:01

One name is dominating the conversation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is selling at $0.03 in phase5 of its presale. Buyers who invest at this moment will see 100% returns on investment as soon as the token gets listed. Over $11.5 million has been raised so far, and there are over 12,700 early investors. By the time the presale reaches Phase 6, the token price will be at $0.035, a 16.67% immediate return on any stage 5 investment. As traders hunt for the best crypto to buy in 2025, meme tokens are falling out of favor, replaced by projects with long-term potential and real use cases. With the bull market warming up and June closing in, the smart money is pivoting to top altcoins with fundamentals, and Mutuum Finance is already being called one of the top tokens to buy before June ends. Mutuum Finance Disrupts DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing DeFi lending with a platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. There are also the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the users to agree on terms among themselves. This direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. Long-Term Built, Audited, and Now Backed by $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A rigorous smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most trusted security firms, has confirmed that the codebase meets high standards for transparency and safety, offering assurance to both investors and users. To further shore up its ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an Ethereum-based fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to USD. In contrast to the algorithmic models, which are susceptible to depegging, the current stablecoin is programmed to launch long-lasting liquidity, stability, and dependability to the retail and institutional users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly separating itself from the noise of meme coins by delivering substance, utility, and long-term growth potential. Over $11.5 million raised and 12,700+ early investors prove that serious capital is backing this DeFi disruptor. Phase 5 of the presale is more than halfway sold out at $0.03, giving investors a guaranteed 100% return when MUTM lists at $0.06. CertiK’s audit, a $50,000 Bug Bounty, and a $100,000 token giveaway only add to its credibility and excitement.

As the US Dollar holds steady and the Sterling Rebound gains traction, investors are keenly watching crucial economic indicators like the upcoming Non-Farm Payrolls report. Understanding these shifts in the Forex Market is not just for currency traders; it provides vital context for navigating overall market sentiment, which can influence everything from Bitcoin’s stability to altcoin performance. This deep dive will explore the forces at play, offering insights into effective Currency Trading strategies and what these movements mean for your portfolio. Why is the US Dollar Steadier Now? The US Dollar , often considered a safe-haven asset, has shown remarkable resilience in recent sessions. This steadiness comes despite various global economic uncertainties and shifting monetary policy expectations. Several factors contribute to its current position: Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hike cycle in 2022 and 2023 has maintained a significant interest rate advantage for the US over many other major economies. Higher rates typically attract foreign capital, bolstering demand for the dollar. Global Economic Slowdown Concerns: When global growth prospects dim, investors often flock to the perceived safety and liquidity of US assets, including the dollar. This flight to quality provides a baseline support. Inflation Outlook: While inflation has cooled from its peaks, the Fed’s cautious stance on further rate cuts until clear evidence of sustained disinflation keeps rate expectations relatively high, underpinning the dollar. However, this stability is not absolute. The dollar’s trajectory remains highly sensitive to incoming economic data, particularly labor market reports, which can swiftly alter market expectations for future Fed policy. The Pivotal Role of Non-Farm Payrolls: What to Expect? The Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report is arguably the most anticipated economic data release each month. It provides a comprehensive snapshot of US employment, excluding farm workers, government employees, private household employees, and non-profit organization employees. Its significance stems from its direct influence on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates. Why is NFP so impactful? Inflation Indicator: Strong job growth and rising wages can fuel consumer spending, potentially leading to inflationary pressures. Conversely, a weakening labor market can signal disinflation. Economic Health Barometer: A robust NFP report suggests a healthy economy, encouraging business investment and consumer confidence. A weak report can signal an impending slowdown or recession. Fed Policy Driver: The Federal Reserve closely monitors NFP data to gauge the strength of the labor market, a key component of its dual mandate (maximum employment and price stability). Surprising NFP figures can cause significant shifts in interest rate expectations. Ahead of the release, analysts are scrutinizing various pre-NFP indicators, such as jobless claims and ISM employment sub-indices, to form their projections. A stronger-than-expected report could lead to a stronger dollar as markets price in higher-for-longer interest rates, while a weaker report could trigger dollar selling on increased rate cut expectations. Decoding the Sterling Rebound: A Resilient Comeback? The Sterling Rebound has captured market attention, particularly after a period of significant weakness. The British Pound (GBP) has historically been susceptible to domestic political uncertainty and economic challenges. Its recent bounce reflects a shift in sentiment and specific catalysts: Improved UK Economic Data: Recent economic indicators from the UK, including inflation data and GDP figures, have shown signs of resilience, exceeding some market expectations. This has alleviated immediate recession fears. Bank of England (BoE) Outlook: While the BoE has indicated a cautious approach to rate cuts, some hawkish rhetoric or less dovish commentary than anticipated can provide support for the Pound. Reduced Political Noise: A period of relative political stability compared to previous years can help restore investor confidence in the UK economy. Technical Factors: After a substantial selloff, the Pound might have reached oversold levels, prompting a technical rebound as traders cover short positions. However, the path for Sterling remains challenging. Persistent inflation, the ongoing impact of Brexit, and the delicate balance of fiscal policy continue to pose risks. The rebound’s sustainability will depend on consistent positive economic surprises and a clear policy direction from the Bank of England. Navigating the Forex Market Dynamics: Opportunities and Risks The Forex Market , or foreign exchange market, is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars traded daily. The interplay between the US Dollar and the Sterling Rebound is a prime example of the constant ebb and flow of currency valuations driven by economic fundamentals, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. Key Dynamics to Observe: Interest Rate Differentials: Currencies of countries with higher interest rates tend to attract more investment, leading to appreciation. Economic Performance: Strong economic growth, low unemployment, and stable inflation typically strengthen a country’s currency. Political Stability: Geopolitical tensions or domestic political instability can lead to capital flight and currency depreciation. Trade Balances: A country that exports more than it imports (trade surplus) tends to see its currency strengthen as foreign demand for its goods requires purchasing its currency. For those involved in Currency Trading , understanding these dynamics is paramount. Volatility around major data releases like Non-Farm Payrolls presents both significant opportunities for profit and considerable risks. Prudent risk management, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes, is crucial. Actionable Insights for Currency Trading and Beyond Whether you’re directly involved in Currency Trading or simply monitoring the broader financial landscape to inform your cryptocurrency investments, these insights can be valuable: Stay Informed on Economic Calendars: Mark your calendar for key data releases like NFP, CPI, and central bank meetings. These are primary market movers. Understand Market Expectations: Don’t just look at the actual number; compare it to market consensus. Surprises are what drive volatility. Analyze Central Bank Commentary: The language used by central bankers (Fed, BoE, ECB) provides clues about future monetary policy, which directly impacts currency valuations. Diversify Your Portfolio: While a strong dollar might pressure certain assets, it could also offer opportunities in others. Diversification helps mitigate risks. Risk Management is Key: Especially during periods of high volatility, never risk more than you can afford to lose. Utilize tools like stop-loss orders. The interconnectedness of global markets means that significant shifts in the Forex Market can influence investor appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. A stronger US Dollar , for instance, can sometimes indicate a ‘risk-off’ environment, potentially leading to outflows from more speculative assets. Conversely, a weaker dollar in a ‘risk-on’ environment could see capital flow into crypto. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Global Finance The current steadiness of the US Dollar and the notable Sterling Rebound are significant developments in the global Forex Market , with the impending Non-Farm Payrolls report serving as a critical determinant for future direction. These movements are not isolated events but are intricately linked to broader economic trends, central bank policies, and investor sentiment. For anyone engaged in Currency Trading or simply seeking to understand the macro environment influencing their broader investments, staying attuned to these dynamics is essential. The ability to interpret economic data and anticipate market reactions will be key to navigating the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in these fascinating times for global finance.

47369599,https://thecoinrise.com/north-korean-hackers-use-new-macos-virus-to-steal-crypto-wallets/,1751563833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47369599.jpeg,North Korean Hackers Use New macOS Virus to Steal Crypto Wallets,https://thecoinrise.com/north-korean-hackers-use-new-macos-virus-to-steal-crypto-wallets/,"Security researchers at SentinelLabs have revealed in a recent report that hackers now use a new and dangerous computer virus is targeting crypto companies through Apple devices. Experts have discovered a backdoor tool called NimDoor. A North Korean hacking group utilizes this malicious tool to steal sensitive data, including passwords and cryptocurrency wallet files. The attack is smartly disguised and manages to bypass many built-in macOS security checks. Hackers Use Telegram and Calendly to Lure Crypto Victims The attack begins with a message sent through Telegram, known to be vulnerable to crypto malware . On the messaging app, hackers pretend to be legitimate contacts, then invite the target to a fake meeting scheduled via Calendly, a widely used calendar tool. As part of the setup, the target is asked to download what appears to be a Zoom update. However, instead of updating the video app, the file installs malware that runs quietly in the background. It sidesteps macOS safety checks by disguising itself as a trusted update. The virus is called NimDoor because it was created using the Nim programming language, which is not commonly used in cyberattacks. This makes it harder for Apple’s security system to recognize and block it. Once NimDoor is installed, it starts stealing sensitive data. It collects saved passwords from web browsers, files from Telegram conversations, and crypto wallet credentials. It also sets up a backdoor, allowing hackers to return later and install more malicious software. SentinelLabs’ Warning to Crypto Firms SentinelLabs has warned crypto-related businesses to strengthen their digital safety. Security experts advise firms to block unsigned installer files and only download Zoom updates from official websites. SentinelLabs experts also recommend checking Telegram contact lists for suspicious profiles, particularly those that send unknown files. It was emphasized that these simple checks can prevent attackers from getting in. Part of a Larger Campaign by DPRK Hackers This new malware attack adds to a long list of recent cybercrimes linked to North Korea ’s notorious hacking group. Just last week, Interchain Labs reported that a North Korean developer had been hired unknowingly to work on a major blockchain project. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil forfeiture to seize $7.74 million worth of crypto linked to North Korean IT workers. It was revealed that these workers pretended to be remote employees, earning money illegally. These criminals usually send the money back to North Korea to help the government avoid sanctions and fund its military programs. According to TRM Labs, North Korean-linked groups stole around $1.6 billion from web3 companies in just the first half of 2025. The biggest hit came in February when Bybit lost $1.5 billion in a single breach . This hack event accounted for over 70% of all crypto losses in that period.

Counterpoint Research noted this rebound covers the three months ending June 30, a welcome sign as the tech giant fights to revive its fortunes in its second‑largest market. May promotions drove the iPhone uptick According to Counterpoint, one key factor was a burst of promotions in May. Several Chinese e‑commerce platforms slashed prices on the newest iPhone 16 models, helping spark renewed demand. At roughly the same time, Apple quietly boosted its trade‑in valuations for older iPhones, another nudge that encouraged users to upgrade. Demand for Apple’s iPhone in mainland China is expected to encounter headwinds in the second half of 2025, after sales of the device received a strong boost in recent months on the back of promotions in the world’s biggest smartphone market. “Apple’s price tweak in May was well‑timed and warmly received, landing just before the 618 shopping festival,” said Ethan Qi, associate director at Counterpoint, in a press statement. That annual June sale event routinely sees retailers offering steep markdowns, and Apple’s participation helped it stand out amid the frenzy. Even on Tmall – Alibaba’s subsidiary, there was at least one brand new iPhone 16 listed for about 5,299 yuan, during the June 18 or 618 shopping festival. This was also about $230 below the Apple official listing price of 6,999 yuan. Now, select models of the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch that cost below 6,000 yuan (US$837) are eligible for a subsidy of up to 500 yuan, while as much as 2,000 yuan in discounts cover certain MacBook and Mac computer models, according to Apple’s statement last month. Apple boosted trade‑in offers in China By lifting trade‑in credits , Apple made it more attractive for customers to swap in older handsets. Even if the move seemed small, it likely pushed some fence‑sitters over the edge, swapping in their four or five‑year‑old models for shiny new ones. This uptick will reassure investors who’ve watched Apple’s share price slip around 15% so far this year. A mix of supply‑chain snags, macroeconomic worries, and mounting competition has weighed on the stock, so any sign of recovery in China, a market accounting for well over 20% of global iPhone revenue, is greeted with relief. Yet Apple’s path is anything but clear. US pressure, most notably former President Trump’s flirtations with tariffs and his calls for onshore iPhone production, adds geopolitical risk, while Huawei’s smartphone arm has roared back to life. After being hamstrung by sanctions, Huawei debuted a new flagship late last year featuring a home‑grown chip once thought out of reach as it assumed the “big brother” role in China. The company has taken up market share that once belonged to US tech firms like Nvidia whose advanced chips are under export restrictions. During Q2, Huawei snagged the top spot in China by market share, with its sales up 12% year‑on‑year, Counterpoint reports. Close behind were Vivo and then Apple in third place. “Huawei’s core users are loyal,” said Counterpoint senior analyst Ivan Lam, “and they’re swapping out old handsets for each fresh Huawei release.” Apple’s China rebound, while modest, suggests that clever pricing and timing can still move the needle, at least temporarily. But with local rivals charging hard, any lasting recovery will demand more than seasonal discounts. Analysts thinks that continuous innovation, stronger trade‑in deals, and perhaps deeper local partnerships may be required if Apple hopes to sustain growth in this fiercely competitive arena.

A move above $2.42 could complete a market rotation, if volume confirms the upside push. Ripple ( XRP ) has maintained notable strength in recent price action, even as broader market conditions remain uncertain. The coin is currently trading above major support and has been respecting the 200-day moving average, a key indicator of trend continuation. The presence of confluence with high-value support zones suggests the asset may be poised for another leg upward, provided volume confirms the move. Key technical points Major Support at $2.09: I n confluence with the 200-day moving average and the value area low. Next Resistance at $2.42: Point of Control level acting as resistance within the current volume range. Low Volume Environment: Suggests accumulation phase; breakout requires increased volume for confirmation. XRPUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP has recently respected the $2.09 support level, a region of significance due to its alignment with both the value area low and the 200-day moving average. Holding above this level signals continued bullish structure, especially as price trends upward. Historically, the 200 MA serves as reliable dynamic support, and as long as XRP stays above it, the probability of further upside remains strong. The next logical price target lies at the $2.42 region, which marks the Point of Control within the current high time frame volume profile. A successful move toward this level would represent a full volume profile rotation, consistent with market auction theory. This theory suggests that once price bounces from the value area low and gains strength, a move toward the value area high and POC is likely, provided there’s volume expansion to support it. You might also like: Stablecoins supply crossed $250b on investor optimism: Binance report One key factor to monitor is the current lack of trading volume. While this may seem bearish at first glance, it more likely signals a phase of quiet accumulation at support. A strong rally will need to be supported by a notable influx of volume to confirm bullish conviction and signal the transition from accumulation to expansion. Until the 200-day MA or the $2.09 support is breached, the bullish structure remains intact. Traders should continue to monitor the strength of the trend and be alert for any surge in volume that could initiate the next move higher. What to expect in the coming price action If XRP holds above $2.09 and volume begins to increase, a rotation toward the $2.42 resistance becomes highly probable. Breaching this resistance would mark the beginning of a potential trend acceleration.

But while BTC flirts with resistance, a new opportunity has emerged: MAGACOIN FINANCE — a high-upside presale that’s already racing through its opening chapter. Chapter 1: Two Stages Gone, Stage 3 Goes Live MAGACOIN FINANCE launched quietly — but it didn’t stay under the radar for long. Chapter 1, Stage 1? Sold out. Stage 2? Gone. And now, with Stage 3 officially live , presale demand is heating up as early investors anticipate the next price shift. The structure is simple but powerful: early chapters, limited supply, and a rising price curve that rewards those who move early — a sharp contrast to Bitcoin’s current phase of high liquidity and slower returns. Bitcoin’s Institutional Inflows vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Retail Upside Bitcoin ETFs are pulling in billions. That’s good for long-term adoption — but the chance to multiply capital in early stages? That window is much tighter. MAGACOIN FINANCE is filling that gap. With its narrative-driven appeal , politically themed positioning, and fast-paced stage progression, it’s attracting Bitcoin holders looking to diversify into high-growth altcoin bets while prices are still under the radar.

The investment round was led by fintech-focused Ribbit Capital, while Pantera Capital, one of the leading investment funds in the cryptocurrency space, also participated. In exchange for investment, a 5% stake in the company was transferred, and no cryptocurrency was allocated in the process. TOP founder and CEO Andrew Rogozov stated that the company has raised over $70 million in total funds to date. TOP, which is in the TON blockchain ecosystem with close ties to Telegram, also stands out as the team behind the application’s main wallet, “Telegram Wallet.” The company aims to bring the wallet, which has been available for use in Russia, Asia and other regions via Telegram, to the US and European markets with the new funding. CEO Rogozov pointed out that especially compliance and operational infrastructures bring huge costs in this expansion process and said that the new investment will play a critical role in these areas. Related News: Warning: New Virus Detected That Drains Cryptocurrency Wallets - Here's the Culprit Software and What to Do About It The new investment will be used not only for geographical expansion, but also for the development of TON-based blockchain games and AI projects. The company's long-term vision is to create a comprehensive application ecosystem running on TON. Ribbit Capital and Pantera Capital, which participated in the investment, said they see Telegram’s global user base of over 1 billion as a huge opportunity. “The opportunity to support revolutionary technology and financial products that can reach a billion people is exciting,” said Ryan Barney, partner at Pantera Capital. Telegram sold $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrencies for its TON project in 2018. However, it was forced to halt the project in 2020 following a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of the settlement reached with the SEC, Telegram returned $1.2 billion to investors and paid a fine of $18.5 million. After these developments, Telegram seemingly distanced itself from the project, but the development of technology continued in the background. In 2023, Telegram announced the new version of TON as the official blockchain network, and in the same year, the TOP company was officially established in the United Arab Emirates (Abu Dhabi). *This is not investment advice.

For investors and enthusiasts alike, identifying the next big innovation early can be a game-changer. This is precisely where Binance Alpha steps in, acting as a crucial launchpad for promising, nascent digital assets. Recently, the crypto world buzzed with news: Binance Alpha has officially added MemeCore (M) to its roster, marking a significant milestone for this unique project and the broader ecosystem of early-stage crypto projects . What is Binance Alpha and Why Does It Matter for New Tokens? Binance Alpha isn’t just another listing platform; it’s a dedicated initiative within the expansive Binance Wallet ecosystem designed to spotlight and nurture early-stage crypto projects . Think of it as an exclusive incubator, providing visibility and direct access to a vast user base that might otherwise miss these budding innovations. The core mission of Binance Alpha is to bridge the gap between groundbreaking, yet unproven, crypto ventures and the liquidity and community support they need to thrive. The selection process for projects featured on Binance Alpha is rigorous, focusing on two key pillars: Community Engagement: Projects must demonstrate a strong, active, and organic community. This isn’t just about follower counts; it’s about genuine interaction, developer activity, and a passionate user base. Emerging Market Trends: Binance Alpha keeps its finger on the pulse of the crypto market, identifying sectors and technologies poised for significant growth. Whether it’s DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, or new blockchain infrastructure, projects that align with future trends are prioritized. This strategic approach ensures that only projects with true potential and a solid foundation make it onto the platform, offering a curated experience for users seeking high-growth opportunities. For early-stage crypto projects , being selected by Binance Alpha is a stamp of credibility and a gateway to a global audience. Decoding MemeCore (M): More Than Just a Meme? The recent addition of MemeCore (M) to Binance Alpha has certainly turned heads. While its name suggests a connection to the often-volatile world of meme coins, a closer look reveals a project aiming for something more substantial. According to Binance’s official X post, MemeCore (M) stood out due to its compelling community engagement and alignment with emerging market dynamics. What exactly makes MemeCore (M) noteworthy? While specific details about its utility or underlying technology might be sparse at this early stage (as is common with early-stage crypto projects ), its selection by Binance Alpha indicates a strong belief in its foundational premise and potential for growth. Typically, projects like MemeCore (M) often leverage: Decentralized Community Governance: Empowering holders to shape the project’s future, fostering a sense of ownership. Innovative Tokenomics: Mechanisms designed to reward long-term holders and encourage active participation within its ecosystem. Unique Use Cases: Beyond mere speculation, perhaps integrating with social platforms, gaming, or content creation, offering real utility. The ‘M’ in MemeCore (M) could represent a new paradigm for community-driven tokens, aiming to blend the viral appeal of memes with sustainable utility and a robust ecosystem. Its presence on Binance Alpha offers it a significant legitimacy boost, opening it up to a global audience looking for the next big thing in crypto. Why Are Early-Stage Crypto Projects So Exciting (and Risky)? The allure of early-stage crypto projects is undeniable. These are the ventures that promise exponential returns, the chance to get in on the ground floor before mainstream adoption takes hold. However, with high reward often comes high risk. Platforms like Binance Alpha aim to mitigate some of this risk by performing initial vetting, but it’s crucial for investors to understand the landscape. Benefits of Investing in Early-Stage Projects: High Growth Potential: The possibility of significant price appreciation if the project gains traction and achieves its roadmap goals. Community Influence: Often, early investors and community members have a greater voice in the project’s direction and development. Innovation Exposure: Being part of cutting-edge technological advancements and disruptive ideas in the blockchain space. Challenges and Risks: Volatility: Prices can fluctuate wildly due to low liquidity, market sentiment, and speculative trading. Project Failure: Many early-stage crypto projects do not survive due to technical issues, lack of adoption, funding challenges, or market shifts. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape can impact project viability and legality, leading to unforeseen hurdles. Information Asymmetry: Less public information and track record compared to established assets, requiring deeper due diligence. Binance Alpha ‘s role here is to act as a filter, presenting projects that have cleared a certain hurdle, but comprehensive due diligence remains paramount for any investor considering these opportunities, including MemeCore (M) . How Does Alpha Facilitate Seamless On-Chain Trading? One of the standout features of Binance Alpha is its direct integration with the broader Binance Wallet and Exchange ecosystem, specifically facilitating on-chain trading . This isn’t just about listing a token; it’s about creating a smooth, efficient pathway for users to interact with these new assets directly on the blockchain. What does ‘facilitates on-chain trading ‘ truly mean for the user? Direct Wallet Integration: Users can trade tokens like MemeCore (M) directly from their Binance Wallet , removing the need for complex transfers to external decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This simplifies the process significantly, especially for those new to decentralized finance. Reduced Friction: By integrating on-chain trading capabilities, Binance Alpha minimizes the steps and potential errors associated with moving funds between different platforms. This enhances the user experience and encourages participation in these nascent markets. Enhanced Security: While users are still interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain, the integration within the trusted Binance ecosystem provides an added layer of confidence and accessibility, leveraging Binance’s robust security infrastructure. This direct access to on-chain trading for early-stage crypto projects is a game-changer, democratizing access to opportunities that were once primarily reserved for more technically proficient or adventurous traders. It aligns with Binance’s vision of making crypto accessible to everyone. Your Gateway to Innovation: The Role of Binance Wallet The centrality of Binance Wallet in the Binance Alpha initiative cannot be overstated. It serves as the primary interface for users to discover, research, and engage with these new listings, including MemeCore (M) . The seamless integration means that users don’t need to navigate multiple platforms; everything is consolidated within their familiar Binance Wallet environment. Consider the user journey: Feature Benefit for Users Integrated Discovery Easily find promising early-stage crypto projects directly within the wallet interface, curated by Binance Alpha . Direct Trading Execute on-chain trading actions without ever leaving the secure environment of the Binance Wallet . Unified Experience Manage portfolio, explore new assets, and trade from a single, trusted application, simplifying crypto participation. This holistic approach by Binance Wallet aims to lower the barrier to entry for users interested in the cutting edge of crypto, making it simpler and safer to explore the potential of projects like MemeCore (M) and other emerging assets. It transforms the wallet from a mere storage solution into a dynamic portal for crypto innovation. The Future of Early-Stage Crypto Projects on Binance Alpha The addition of MemeCore (M) to Binance Alpha is more than just a new listing; it’s a testament to Binance’s ongoing commitment to fostering innovation within the crypto space. By providing a curated platform for early-stage crypto projects and facilitating direct on-chain trading through the intuitive Binance Wallet , Binance Alpha is setting a new standard for how promising digital assets gain visibility and adoption. While the journey for any new crypto project is fraught with challenges, being selected by Binance Alpha offers a significant boost in legitimacy and access to a massive user base. For those looking to dive into the next wave of crypto innovation, keeping an eye on Binance Alpha and its selected projects, like MemeCore (M) , could prove to be a truly rewarding endeavor. As the crypto market continues to mature, platforms like Binance Alpha will play an increasingly vital role in connecting groundbreaking ideas with the capital and community needed to bring them to fruition, shaping the future of decentralized finance and beyond.

Ilham became a person of interest over his alleged involvement in the ZKasino exit scam, which swallowed a whopping $30 million. According to a red notice shared by ZachXBT on X, Ilham has been arrested by the authorities in the UAE, who then contacted the Netherlands to inform them of the arrest. He will reportedly be extradited to the country where he will face criminal charges. The ZKasino project he was involved in was marketed as a decentralized gambling platform and raised over $30 million in presale funds last year. However, it failed to deliver, and the team allegedly resorted to diverting investor funds. Update: Ildar Ilham aka @XBT_Prometheus (founder of @WhiteRock_Fi ) was arrested by UAE law enforcement for his involvement in the $30M Zkasino exit scam. He will be extradited to the Netherlands next for the criminal case. pic.twitter.com/h5FZhUBiDg — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) July 3, 2025 Ildar’s arrest is the latest in connection with the ZKasino scam Ildar’s arrest comes months after Elham Nourzai, another key figure linked to the plot, was nabbed by Dutch authorities last year in April. Nourzai was later released, after which the stolen funds suddenly started getting laundered on-chain via networks like ZkSync, Starknet, Ethereum, and Solana. Many of those who fell victim to the scam expressed satisfaction at Ildar’s arrest in the comment section of the post . ZachXBT first made the connection when he revealed a link between at least one team member from the $30M ZKasino exit scam and the WhiteRock project by tracing on-chain transactions linking both projects and a personal email address. Does Ildar’s connection to WhiteRock make it a scam? According to ZachXBT, WhiteRock (WHITE) burst onto the scene late last year, complete with a number of large red flags that did not go unnoticed. The on-chain investigator highlighted some of those red flags, including an anonymous team with no history, fake partnerships, and many side wallets funded via instant exchanges. The sleuth was able to find Ildar’s connection to WhiteRock by reaching out to an influencer who was paid via a WhiteRock marketing wallet. ZachXBT also found that the wallet had a clear commingling of funds with stolen ZKasino bounty. ZachXBT commingling of funds with stolen ZKasino bounty. Source: ZachXBT There were also several transactions between late February and early March 2025 in which ZKasino funds were transferred to an instant exchange, with WhiteRock wallets receiving similar quantities from other instant exchanges via XMR. Despite its shady prospects, WhiteRock has yet to pull a rug, but ZachXBT believes that Ildar’s connection with the project, as well as the project’s history with names like ZKasino, means there is a high possibility that it will eventually happen. In a proactive push to get ahead of the potential rug pull, the crypto sleuth has called on MEXC and Gate.io to consider delisting WHITE and conduct enhanced due diligence on the team.

Yes, they’re fast and decentralised, but their inherent volatility has kept them just outside the mainstream. These days, though, something is changing. You’ve probably noticed it yourself. Crypto is no longer a niche financial sector populated by traders and maximalists; it’s cropping up in day-to-day payments, entertainment, business infrastructure and more. So why is this change occurring? One word: stablecoins. Far from being flashy tokens that ride the bear and bull markets, these coins do exactly what they say they do. Namely, their value doesn’t budge. Stablecoins Explained (And Why They Matter) So, what are stablecoins? Put simply, they’re digital currencies pegged to a “stable” real-world asset, usually fiat currencies like the US dollar. Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI) are among the most widely used . While Bitcoin and Ethereum can rise or fall by 10% in an afternoon, stablecoins are engineered to hold their value steady. This stability comes from collateralization. A stablecoin is either backed by cash, short-term government debt, or crypto overcollateralization. You can think of them as the monetary equivalent of a ballast, used to anchor a ship that might otherwise capsize on rough seas. Why has this had such a transformative effect? Because stability is exactly what’s required to push crypto from speculative asset to everyday utility. Supporting Digital Entertainment In the UK, digital payments are already second nature. Contactless cards, Apple Pay, bank-to-bank transfers via Faster Payments — most consumers expect speed and ease. But crypto? It’s still a bit clunky. Convert to fiat, send to your bank, pay the fees, wait. This is where stablecoins are slotting in. They behave like cash in your crypto wallet, without the volatility or the need to off-ramp into sterling before spending. This shift is already visible in several digital-first sectors, with online casino gaming serving as a prime example. Traditionally, digital casinos were playable only with bankwire or bank card options, which meant gamers would have to wait up to five working days before seeing their winnings hit their accounts. Then, forward-thinking brands expanded their accepted payments to include digital wallets and pre-payment cards. Wildz Casino , for instance, offers fiat options like VISA, Skrill Neteller and several location-specific methods to properly cater to its users. In the years since, crypto casinos and gambling platforms have emerged, but until stablecoins came along, they lacked a degree of legitimacy — irrespective of the gaming authority awarding their operational licenses. Stablecoins provide a happy medium: allowing players to deposit in digital currency without being exposed to price swings. A user can deposit £100 worth of USDC and tomorrow it will still be worth £100. That’s the kind of dependability that operators and regulators alike can get behind. It simplifies accounting, aids legislative checks and removes the ambiguity that surrounds crypto price volatility. Revolutionising Payroll and Cross-Border Payments Stablecoins aren’t just turning up in gaming wallets. They’re quietly transforming another cornerstone of financial life: wages. Freelancers, remote workers and gig economy contractors in the UK and beyond are increasingly being paid in stablecoins. Why? Because it’s quicker, cheaper and often more reliable than conventional banking, especially for cross-border jobs. Companies like Bitwage, Noah and Circle allow businesses to pay staff in USDC or other stablecoins, bypassing the delays and fees associated with international bank transfers. Circle has already bridged transactions worth over $850 billion (around £627 billion) between fiat currencies and supported blockchains since 2018. For British freelancers dealing with clients abroad, these innovations can be transformative. No waiting three to five working days. No intermediary banks taking a slice. Just digital, dollar-pegged money, directly in your wallet — and ready to convert to pounds when needed. What This Means for Crypto Enthusiasts If you’ve been in the crypto space for a while, you’ll be familiar with the discourse: are stablecoins just fiat currencies dressed up in a digital asset costume? The truth is, stablecoins aren’t presenting as a replacement for fully decentralised assets like BTC or ETH. Rather, they offer a workable compromise, a way for crypto to function in the real world, without need to sacrifice its core mechanics. For UK investors and enthusiasts , there’s real opportunity here — you can swap, save, send or spend digital assets with stability.

Federal Reserve interest rate cuts might come later than expected, but Wall Street is still optimistic. On Thursday, June 3, the Dow Jones closed higher by 344 points, or 0.77%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.83% in a a shortened session ahead of Friday’s market close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.02%. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq reached record levels, as investor optimism boosted the market. NVIDIA was one of the stronger performers, rising 1.3% and reaching its all-time high. The rally put NVIDIA close to replacing Apple as the most valuable company in the world. The stock achieved a significant rally after a strong Q1 earnings report, showing that the chipmaker was not as affected by U.S. sanctions on China as many traders expected. You might also like: Retail traders dumped $258m in Nvidia stock: Will they buy Bitcoin instead? Strong labor market boosts the economy Traders were focusing on the June jobs report, which showed that the labor market remained more resilient than expected. The data revealed a 147,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, beating the forecast of 106,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, even as economists expected it to rise to 4.3%. A strong labor market has shown that the anticipated tariff-related damage to the economy has not materialized. Despite the potential disruptive effects of U.S. punitive tariffs on its trading partners, employers mostly stayed the course. Notably, businesses managed to avoid layoffs, hoping that the tariffs would be temporary. High employment likely means that the Federal Reserve won’t be under as much pressure to lower interest rates, even if inflation decreases. This is usually bad news for growth stocks, which tend to thrive in a low-interest rate environment. Still, the prospect of a robust economy and stronger-than-expected economic growth was enough to boost sentiment.

No more lengthy KYC procedures, delayed withdrawals, or centralized control. Thanks to blockchain technology, bettors now have the freedom to wager anonymously, instantly, and across multiple chains. But with so many cryptocurrencies available, which ones are best suited for the world of decentralized gambling? From the battle-tested Bitcoin to lightning-fast altcoins, here are the top crypto picks fueling the next generation of trustless betting. 1. Bitcoin (BTC): The OG That Still Dominates Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto betting. Despite its relatively slower transaction times and higher fees compared to newer chains, BTC is universally accepted across virtually every decentralized and centralized gambling platform. Its primary appeal is security and liquidity. For high-stakes players and whales, Bitcoin offers unmatched trust, deep market depth, and ease of conversion. It also continues to expand in Web3-native casinos that support fast deposits and withdrawals via Layer 2 integrations or wrapped BTC tokens. 2. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) For Predictable Play Stablecoins are rapidly becoming the preferred choice for everyday bettors. USDT (Tether) leads the pack thanks to its wide availability and robust liquidity, followed closely by USDC. With their value pegged to the US dollar rate, these tokens offer price stability which makes them ideal for players who don’t want market swings affecting their betting capital. Most decentralized casinos and sportsbooks including Dexsport now accept stablecoins across multiple chains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Tron, Polygon, etc.), enabling frictionless betting with near-zero volatility. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Powering Smart Bets Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized applications—including many of today’s most innovative gambling platforms. From on-chain sportsbooks to provably fair dice games, ETH is the fuel that powers trustless betting. With smart contracts at its core, Ethereum enables features like automated payouts, fair game logic, and transparent results. Though it can suffer from network congestion and gas fees, Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base) are rapidly improving transaction speed and affordability. 4. Tron (TRX): Fast, Cheap, and Gaining Ground Tron has quietly become a powerhouse in the crypto gambling space. Known for its ultra-low fees and high throughput, TRX is widely used in decentralized casino games and lottery-style applications. Its ecosystem supports a wide array of dApps and betting platforms, particularly in markets where low-cost transactions are essential. Tron’s native support for stablecoins like USDT also makes it a strong contender for cost-effective play. 5. BNB (Binance Coin): A Utility Giant with Casino Reach Binance’s BNB token has moved far beyond its exchange origins. Today, BNB powers one of the most active smart contract networks (BNB Chain), and countless decentralized casinos and betting platforms are built on it. BNB is often used for fast, low-fee wagers and in-house rewards on Web3 gambling platforms. Its compatibility with BEP-20 stablecoins also adds to its versatility, making it a favorite among cost-conscious bettors. Bonus: Dexsport – A True Home for Multi-Chain Bettors Looking to use these coins on a platform built for decentralized betting? Dexsport offers one of the best Web3 sportsbooks and casinos in 2025.

BTCO's 0.25% expense ratio is less competitive versus some peers, and its higher post-waiver fee at launch likely deterred long-term investors. Despite its small size, BTCO functions effectively as a Bitcoin ETF proxy, but cheaper and more established alternatives remain more attractive for most investors. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) getting increasingly gobbled up by the iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) and Bitcoin Treasury companies like Strategy ( MSTR )( STRF ), not every US-listed Bitcoin ETF has benefited from the same type of inflows as the market leader. In this article, we'll look at the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) relative to peers. 12 Month Holdings Trend, BTCO (TheBlock) The fund's BTC holdings have fallen year to date while the broader US-based Bitcoin ETF segment has seen year to date inflows of over 21% measured in BTC. Is there a reason why the fund has lagged the rest of the market in AUM growth over the last 6 months? I think yes. Bitcoin Capital Flows and Provider AUM As of June 27th, the capital flow story for Bitcoin continues to be incredibly impressive in 2025. As of article submission, the digital asset sector is working on 11 consecutive weeks of positive net flows into investment products. Bitcoin's month to date investment product net flow as of June 27th was $4.6 billion. Year date net flow came in at nearly $15 million through the first half of 2025: Asset (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin $4,604 $14,925 $159,399 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) $1,432 $2,859 $14,614 Multi-asset -$17.3 $58 $6,814 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $8.3 $91 $1,328 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $21.2 $219 $1,184 Total $6,059 $17,776 $184,414 BTC Dominance 76.0% 84.0% 86.4% Bitcoin is clearly benefiting from demand through capital flows with 76% of digital asset net flow month to date and 84% share year to date. These are impressive numbers. It isn't just a Bitcoin story though, this is very much a BlackRock ( BLK ) story as well. When we break down the capital flows by provider, it's quite clear there is a dominant product provider in the market. The iShares funds account for 77% of the month to date flows and a staggering 96% of digital asset investment demand year to date. Provider (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM iShares $4,651 $17,053 $78,605 Grayscale $74 -$1,652 $29,892 Fidelity $355 $249 $21,516 ARK 21 Shrs $97 $75 $5,018 Bitwise $227 -$59 $4,511 ProShares $90 $526 $4,101 21Shares AG $18 -$200 $3,750 CoinShares XBT -$57 -$269 $3,446 Other $605 $2,055 $33,575 Total $6,059 $17,776 $184,414 Source: CoinShares/Bloomberg, as of June 27th, 2025 Invesco's share of the digital asset investment space is so small that CoinShares doesn't even break it out in the company's digital asset fund flow reports. When we assess BTC AUM as a percent of total issuer AUM, Invesco's Bitcoin holdings are a rounding error while iShares has 1% of total AUM in Bitcoin: Billions (as of Q1-25) Total AUM Bitcoin ETF BTC % Invesco $1,845 $0.44 0.02% iShares $4,303 $46.60 1.08% Sources: Invesco, YCharts This kind of dominance is hard to overcome if you're a competitor like Invesco and it begs the obvious question; why? BTCO Fund Details Like the other spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the United States, BTCO launched in mid-January 2024. For the sake of comparison, the table below shows fund details for the following Bitcoin ETFs: WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ) Franklin Bitcoin ETF ( EZBC ) CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF ( BRRR ) Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) What each of these funds have in common is that they are the bottom 6 US-listed Bitcoin ETFs in the market in terms of assets under management: Fund Details BTCO BTCW EZBC BRRR BITB HODL Issuer Invesco WisdomTree Franklin Templeton Investments Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC Bitwise Investments VanEck Expense Ratio 0.25% 0.25% 0.19% 0.00% 0.20% 0.00% AUM $569.35M $169.44M $564.43M $641.00M $4.30B $1.72B Source: Seeking Alpha For me, the biggest standout difference between these funds is the expense ratios. At 0.25%, BTCO is on the expensive side relative to the selected funds above. But by itself, that doesn't necessarily explain the lack of interest in BTCO. For instance, BITB appears to be a significant outlier in this table. At a 0.20% expense ratio, that fund is closer to BTCO than a fund like BRRR yet has the largest AUM in our sample by far. In my view, there are two key reasons for this. First, Bitwise Investments is a crypto-native asset manager. This is not an issuer that touches traditional index ETFs and even has a digital asset fund that offers exposure to tokens like Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). Thus, I think Bitwise has benefited from crypto trustworthiness to a larger degree than each of the other issuers shows. Also, BITB uses part of its management fee to fund Bitcoin development. The other issuer that has committed to such an action is VanEck - so it's likely not surprising to see each of these two funds with the two largest AUMs of the bottom 6 funds. Still, this doesn't explain why BTCO has performed so badly against a fund like IBIT. I suspect the original roll out of these funds has been a factor. Consider this screenshot from my Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) from January 2024 : Original expense ratios (Seeking Alpha/IntoTheBlock) Back in January 2024 when these funds originally launched, BTCO would have had one of the higher post-waiver fees in the market at 0.39%. Even though there was a 0.00% waiver on the first $1 billion in AUM or for 6 months, investors looking for long term solutions likely balked at BTCO due to the fee after waiver. BRRR also had a high post-waiver fee and has a very similar AUM to that of BTCO today. Fund Performance Ultimately, what likely matters most for potential BTCO investors is how the fund actually performs compared to the products in the market. So far, there is virtually no difference between these funds based on total return over the last year: Data by YCharts We can see the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) is the obvious laggard of the bunch above. That is entirely due to the fund's egregious 1.5% expense ratio. But short of choosing to minimize third party custodian risk to Coinbase ( COIN ) through FBTC, there is very little difference between these products. Closing Thoughts For investors looking for a simple way to get Bitcoin exposure through the ETF wrapper, BTCO will work perfectly fine. Is it the cheapest fund? No. Is it the biggest by AUM? No. In fact, it's one of the smallest by AUM and that is likely due to some combination of the fund's current 0.25% expense ratio relative to slightly cheaper alternatives today and the fact that the product launched with one of the higher post-waiver fees in the market. The lack of early adoption is perhaps haunting AUM growth today. But, again, purely as a Bitcoin proxy, it'll likely work just as well as the other funds that rely on Coinbase for custody.",BTCO,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-03 17:48:10

Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications has stagnated, with the charts showing that it is moving sideways. Recent news: Algorand Foundation- TVL is not correlated with price performance Algorand researchers tested whether TVL could predict a crypto’s performance. After analyzing over 300 cryptocurrencies from 2023 to 2024, they did not find any outperformance, regardless of how the data was adjusted for known issues. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is dropping from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s correction, which saw Bitcoin drop below $99,000. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10?

Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025?

Algorand historic price sentiment ALGO price chart by CoinGecko Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June. It crossed into July, trading at $0.18.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-03 17:50:24

In a significant move that could reshape the landscape of digital assets, Bahrain has stepped forward, becoming a pioneer in the realm of Bahrain stablecoin regulation . This bold initiative by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) marks a pivotal moment, signaling a clear intent to embrace the future of finance with caution and foresight. What is the CBB Regulatory Framework and Why Does It Matter? The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has officially unveiled its new Stablecoin Issuance and Offering (SIO) Module. This isn’t just another set of rules; it’s a comprehensive CBB regulatory framework designed to govern the entire lifecycle of stablecoins within its jurisdiction. This framework covers everything from the initial issuance to the ongoing offering of these digital assets, aiming to provide clarity, security, and integrity to a rapidly expanding market. Why is this significant? For years, stablecoins have operated in a gray area in many parts of the world. While they offer the promise of bridging traditional finance with the crypto world, their stability relies heavily on the underlying assets backing them and the transparency of their operations. Bahrain’s framework seeks to address these concerns head-on by: Ensuring Asset Backing: Mandating that stablecoins are fully backed by reserves held in segregated accounts. Promoting Transparency: Requiring regular audits and public disclosures of reserve holdings. Protecting Consumers: Establishing clear guidelines for consumer protection and dispute resolution. Fostering Innovation: Providing a secure environment for financial institutions and fintech companies to explore stablecoin use cases. Unpacking Stablecoin Issuance: What Does This Mean for the Market? The new SIO Module sets stringent requirements for any entity wishing to engage in stablecoin issuance in Bahrain. This move is crucial for building trust and attracting legitimate players to the market. Imagine a world where every stablecoin you interact with is backed by transparent, verifiable assets – that’s the vision Bahrain is working towards. Key aspects for stablecoin issuers under this framework include: Licensing Requirements: Entities must obtain a specific license from the CBB. Operational Resilience: Robust IT systems, cybersecurity measures, and business continuity plans are mandatory. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) Compliance: Strict adherence to global standards to prevent illicit activities. Governance and Risk Management: Comprehensive frameworks to manage operational, financial, and technological risks. This level of oversight aims to prevent the types of failures seen in less regulated environments, thereby boosting confidence in stablecoins as a reliable form of digital currency for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Bahrain’s Vision: Leading Middle East Crypto Innovation? Bahrain has consistently positioned itself as a forward-thinking financial hub, and this latest move reinforces its ambition to lead in the digital economy. The decision to grant a payment service provider license to BPay Global, a Binance-affiliated company, prior to this framework, highlights a strategic approach. It suggests that Bahrain is not just reacting to the rise of crypto but actively shaping its integration into the national financial system. This proactive stance could make Bahrain a magnet for crypto businesses looking for a regulated and supportive environment in the Middle East crypto landscape. It provides a blueprint for other nations in the region and beyond, demonstrating how a central bank can facilitate innovation while mitigating risks. This isn’t just about stablecoins; it’s about establishing Bahrain as a key player in the broader digital asset ecosystem. The Broader Landscape: Digital Asset Regulation on the Rise? Bahrain’s initiative is part of a growing global trend towards more structured digital asset regulation . From the European Union’s MiCA framework to various proposals in the United States and Asia, regulators worldwide are grappling with how to oversee cryptocurrencies effectively. Bahrain’s SIO Module offers a specific model for stablecoins, which are often seen as a less volatile entry point into the crypto economy compared to speculative assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The clear rules around stablecoins could pave the way for their wider adoption in mainstream financial services. This could mean more efficient cross-border payments, new lending opportunities, and even potential use in central bank digital currency (CBDC) explorations. The focus on regulation signals a maturing industry where legitimate businesses can thrive, pushing out bad actors and building a more resilient financial future. Key Aspects of Bahrain’s SIO Module To summarize the core components of this groundbreaking framework, consider the following: Aspect Description Implication Scope Issuance and Offering of Stablecoins in Bahrain Comprehensive oversight from creation to distribution Backing 1:1 reserves in segregated accounts Ensures stability and liquidity; reduces risk of collapse Transparency Regular audits, public disclosures of reserves Builds trust and accountability with users and regulators Licensing Mandatory CBB license for issuers Ensures only qualified and compliant entities operate Compliance Strict AML/CTF and consumer protection rules Mitigates financial crime risks and safeguards users What are the Benefits and Challenges Ahead? The benefits of Bahrain’s proactive stance are manifold. It provides legal certainty, fosters investor confidence, and can attract significant foreign investment into its digital economy. For consumers, it means greater protection when using stablecoins. For businesses, it offers a clear path to innovate within a defined regulatory perimeter. This clarity is a powerful catalyst for growth. However, challenges remain. The rapid pace of technological change means regulators must be agile and willing to adapt. Ensuring effective enforcement, staying ahead of new risks, and maintaining a balance between innovation and control will be crucial. The success of this framework will depend on its practical implementation and its ability to evolve with the market. A Compelling Future for Digital Assets in Bahrain Bahrain’s launch of its stablecoin regulatory framework is more than just a local policy change; it’s a powerful statement to the global financial community. By taking a leadership position in establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuance and offering, the Central Bank of Bahrain is not only safeguarding its financial system but also creating an attractive environment for digital asset innovation. This forward-thinking approach positions Bahrain as a beacon for responsible crypto adoption, promising a more secure and integrated future for digital finance.

47371268,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/institutional-inflows-quietly-building-in-btc-metrics-suggest-breakout-risk,1751565267,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/47371268.jpeg,Institutional Inflows Quietly Building in BTC: Metrics Suggest Breakout Risk,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/institutional-inflows-quietly-building-in-btc-metrics-suggest-breakout-risk,"In the shadows of subdued retail interest and choppy price action, a silent force is gathering momentum in Bitcoin's corner. Institutional inflows are quietly but steadily building beneath the surface. While traditional on-chain metrics may fail to capture the full extent of this movement, multiple signs suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) may be gearing up for a breakout. This analysis, provided by Outset PR , a crypto-focused communications firm, takes a closer look at the disconnect between on-chain stagnation and off-chain accumulation. Like the firm’s approach to data-led PR strategy, the story unfolding in Bitcoin is one of latent buildup, not headline-making moves—at least, not yet. ETF Inflows Speak Louder Than Charts The most compelling evidence of institutional appetite comes not from blockchain data, but from regulated investment vehicles. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively drawn in nearly $4 billion in June 2025 alone, underscoring growing demand from asset managers, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. Among them, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become a behemoth, managing over $75 billion in BTC holdings, and frequently ranking in the top 10 most traded ETFs. Source: blackrock This surge in the ETF is a structural shift in how institutions access Bitcoin: through compliant, familiar channels that allow deep-pocketed investors to gain exposure without custody risk. And because ETF flows happen off-chain, they don’t leave a trail in traditional blockchain metrics like exchange balances or whale movements. Corporate Treasuries Quietly Stack Sats Corporations aren’t staying on the sidelines either. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continues its relentless BTC accumulation, purchasing 4,980 BTC worth over $531 million in late June. This brings its total to an eye-watering 597,325 BTC, cementing its role as a strategic vault for the digital asset. Across the Atlantic, a quiet trend is unfolding in London: small- to mid-cap companies are turning to Bitcoin to revive investor interest. At least nine UK-listed firms have recently disclosed BTC holdings or plans to acquire the asset, echoing MicroStrategy’s playbook for shareholder value creation. Off-Chain Activity Skews On-Chain Readings While blockchain data shows modest exchange outflows and flat miner sales, the real story lies off-chain. Institutional buyers favor over-the-counter (OTC) desks and ETF vehicles, both of which obscure their footprints. As a result, analysts relying solely on on-chain metrics may miss the quiet accumulation underway. This divergence between visible metrics and institutional activity suggests a structural inefficiency in how crypto markets are currently interpreted. It also hints at latent demand pressure—the kind that doesn’t move prices immediately, but builds a coiled-spring setup. BTC Technical Setup Points to a Breakout Risk Bitcoin is currently trading around $107,700, consolidating in a tight band between $104,000 and $110,000. But beneath this calm lies a setup loaded with breakout potential. Source: tradingview According to technical analysts, clearing the $114,000 resistance level could unleash a rally of up to 25%, pushing BTC into the $140,000+ territory. Key resistance awaits at $114,000, and the next challenge will be surpassing the $123,000 mark. Support is solid just above $95,000. This setup hints at a possible upward movement. The 10-day and 100-day averages are aligned, suggesting steadiness. The RSI at 41 indicates it's not overbought, leaving room to climb. Overall, Bitcoin's path seems cautiously optimistic with room to test higher boundaries.

Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent price action may appear muted on the surface, but a powerful narrative is quietly unfolding. Institutional capital is flowing in—stealthily, steadily, and structurally. It’s not being broadcast on-chain or hyped in headlines, but it’s there in the numbers: ETF flows, corporate balance sheets, and growing regulatory clarity. With supply thinning and macro conditions tilting in favor of risk-on bets, the stage is set. The breakout may not come with fanfare, but when it does, those watching the metrics behind the curtain won’t be surprised. Outset PR, with its proprietary content analytics and performance media selection, understands how unseen trends become tomorrow’s headlines.

47371483,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=759829,1751565316,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47371483.jpeg,SlowMist discovers malicious code in GitHub’s 'Solana-pumpfun-bot',https://www.cryptopolitan.com/slowmist-solana-pumpfun-bot-on-github-theft/,"SlowMist has brought to light that the widely used open-source project “Solana-pumpfun-bot” on the GitHub platform has code that steals crypto from its users’ wallets. The investigation began on July 2, 2025. A victim contacted the SlowMist security team to seek assistance in analyzing the reasons for the theft of his wallet assets. The incident was caused by his use of an open-source project hosted on GitHub the day before, where the encrypted assets were stolen. SlowMist states that stolen funds are being transferred to the FixedFloat exchange. The project author is the main suspect To pull the attack off, the hacker pretended to be an official open-source project (solana-pumpfun-bot) to get people to download and run malicious code. A suspicious dependent package named “crypto-layout-utils” was found to have been removed from the official NPM source throughout the inquiry. The hacker subsequently uploaded a malicious version of the software in place of the original download URL. It sent sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server after searching the victim’s PC for wallet-related files. The investigation also found that the project author is suspected of controlling multiple GitHub accounts. They were used to fork malicious projects, distribute malicious programs, and artificially inflate the project’s popularity. Multiple fork projects with similar malicious behavior were identified, some of which used another malicious package, “bs58-encrypt-utils”. The entire attack chain involves several GitHub accounts working together. This expanded the scope of dissemination, enhanced credibility, and is extremely deceptive. At the same time, this attack used both social engineering and technical means, and it is difficult to defend against it fully within an organization. The malicious activity is believed to have started on June 12, 2025. This is when the attacker created the malicious package “bs58-encrypt-utils”. Crypto hacking hasn’t advanced much; they’ve become more cunning According to Slowmist, crypto hacking techniques haven’t advanced much, but they’ve become far more cunning. SlowMist’s head of operations, Lisa, said in the firm’s Q2 MistTrack Stolen Fund Analysis report that although it didn’t see an advancement in hacking techniques, the scams have become more sophisticated . There is a rise in fake browser extensions, tampered hardware wallets, and social engineering attacks. “We’re seeing a clear shift from purely on-chain attacks to off-chain entry points — browser extensions, social media accounts, authentication flows, and user behavior are all becoming common attack surfaces,” said Lisa. Causes of theft in Q2 of 2025 | Source: SlowMist For instance, attackers guide users to visit well-known, commonly used websites like Notion or Zoom. When the user attempts to download software from these official sites, the files delivered have already been maliciously replaced. Another way is when hackers send users a compromised cold wallet. They tell their victims they have won a free device under a “lottery draw” or tell them their existing device was compromised and they needed to transfer their assets. Even better, hackers have introduced fake websites. The final hit is usually manipulation. “Attackers know phrases like ‘risky signature detected’ can trigger panic, prompting users to take hasty actions. Once that emotional state is triggered, it’s much easier to manipulate them into doing things they normally wouldn’t — like clicking links or sharing sensitive information,” Lisa said. Other attacks used hacking methods that took advantage of EIP-7702 , which was added in the most recent version of Ethereum Pectra. Another attack took over the accounts of several WeChat users and targeted them. According to SlowMist, Ethereum led all ecosystems in security losses in the first half of 2025, with DeFi platforms losing around $470 million.

With millions of users entering the space each year, the need for simplified, intelligent, and collaborative trading solutions is more urgent than ever. While traditional trading methods still appeal to seasoned experts, most users are looking for smarter, more accessible ways to engage with the market. That’s where KuCoin’s Next-Gen Copy Trading system comes in. Launched as part of KuCoin’s ongoing mission to democratize crypto trading, this upgraded copy trading experience does more than just allow users to follow others—it turns trading into a connected, transparent, and performance-driven ecosystem. Combined with the powerful Supernova Program, KuCoin is giving traders of all levels the tools and incentives to learn, earn, and lead. The Copy Trading Revolution: Why It’s Gaining Traction Copy trading isn’t new, but it’s never been more relevant. In a market where thousands of tokens move in real-time and global news can impact prices within minutes, even skilled traders struggle to keep up. For beginners, the pressure is even greater. With no clear starting point, many give up or, worse, lose money before finding their footing. Copy trading changes that. It allows users to mirror the trades of experienced professionals automatically. Rather than guessing when to buy or sell, followers simply choose a lead trader whose strategy aligns with their goals. Their account then replicates the lead trader’s positions in real time. The Benefits Are Clear: • Passive participation without intensive research• Real-time learning by observing professionals• Diversification by following multiple traders• Reduced emotional stress, thanks to automation In fact, according to data from Market Research, the global copy trading volume exceeds $1.4 trillion, underscoring its substantial market presence, a figure expected to increase as the feature becomes more sophisticated and trusted. KuCoin’s Approach: Building Smarter Infrastructure While many exchanges offer copy trading as an add-on, KuCoin has taken it further, rebuilding the experience from the ground up. Instead of offering a simple follow-and-copy tool, KuCoin’s system includes advanced architecture, trader monetization features, and a community-driven model that rewards performance and participation. Here’s what makes KuCoin’s Next-Gen Copy Trading system stand out: 1. Follow and Lead at the Same Time Traditionally, users had to choose a lane, either following trades or becoming a lead trader. KuCoin eliminates that limitation. With its dual-role design, users can simultaneously copy others while building their own audience of followers. This is particularly valuable for intermediate traders: they can learn from pros while sharing their own trades with others, and earning for it. 2. Sub-Accounts for Strategy Isolation One of the biggest risks in copy trading is when multiple strategies overlap in a shared portfolio. KuCoin solves this with dedicated sub-accounts. Each trader you follow gets their own isolated strategy environment. Your funds, positions, and risk settings stay separate. The result? Cleaner performance tracking, reduced strategy interference, and better risk management. 3. No Barriers to Entry for Lead Traders KuCoin is opening the doors for a new class of traders. Unlike other platforms that require months of performance history or elite status, any KYC-verified user can become a lead trader. This levels the playing field and allows promising, previously undiscovered traders to build a following and earn based on skill, not status. 4. Precision Tools for Smarter Trading KuCoin equips both followers and leaders with advanced trading tools, including: • Market and limit orders• Partial close capabilities• Custom stop-losses• Adjustable leverage These tools give users pro-level control over how trades are executed and managed something rarely seen in retail copy trading systems. 5. Daily Profit Sharing Most platforms pay out profits weekly or bi-weekly. KuCoin does it daily.

47371559,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73337,1751565591,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 8 Crypto Sportsbooks to Bet Any Sports Worldwide,https://timestabloid.com/top-8-crypto-sportsbooks-to-bet-any-sports-worldwide/,"If you want to bet any sports — no matter where you live or what you follow — you need a sportsbook that actually gives you full access. Some sites cut off markets based on location, licensing, or payment method. Others quietly block things like esports, smaller leagues, or prop bets without any notice. You may be able to deposit, but once you’re in, the limits start to show. That’s where crypto-based sportsbooks change the game. These platforms are built to give players global access, flexible betting markets, and full control over how — and where — they play. Whether you’re into UFC undercards, regional football leagues, or niche simulations, being able to bet any sports means choosing a site that won’t restrict you once the bet slip opens. How to Spot a Sportsbook That Lets You Bet Any Sports Not every site that looks big on the surface actually gives you full access under the hood. Some sportsbooks quietly limit what events you can see, which leagues you’re allowed to bet on, or even what your deposit method allows you to do. Here’s how to know a sportsbook truly lets you bet any sports — without restrictions or fine print that gets in the way. They List Every Sport — Not Just the Popular Ones Real full-access sportsbooks go beyond football, basketball, and tennis. You’ll see markets for esports, fight nights, amateur leagues, and even simulations. If the sports menu is slim, your betting options will be too. The Cashier Supports Crypto A crypto-supported cashier is usually a strong sign of fewer restrictions. Coins like BTC, ETH, and USDT don’t rely on banks or regional payment rails, which means the site is probably built to serve a global player base — without filtering based on location. No Geoblocking or IP Filters in the Sportsbook Some platforms allow registration but limit what you can bet on once your IP is detected. A sportsbook that truly lets you bet any sports won’t change your access based on where you log in from. Props and Live Bets Are Available If a book disables live odds, player props, or alternate spreads, it’s a sign that the platform might be restricted by regulation or internal limits. Full-access sites keep these markets active at all times, for all users. Bonuses Don’t Exclude Sports Check the terms on any promotion. If it says “only valid on football” or excludes esports and live bets, that’s a sign the sportsbook is shaping what you’re allowed to bet on. Real full-access platforms don’t force you into narrow promo rules. Why Crypto Makes It Easier to Bet Any Sports One of the biggest reasons offshore sportsbooks can offer full access is simple: crypto. Using digital currencies like Bitcoin , Ethereum, and USDT removes the barriers that traditional payment systems often create. No banks, no card networks, and no national blocks on who can deposit or where funds can be sent. With crypto, sportsbooks don’t have to filter users by country or restrict betting menus to comply with banking policies. That opens the door to more sports, more leagues, and more flexibility. You’re not limited by what your payment method allows or what your region restricts — you just deposit, play, and cash out. Most crypto-first platforms are also built to be globally accessible. They accept VPNs, don’t require local IDs, and rarely limit your sportsbook view based on IP. That means you can bet any sports, from anywhere, without worrying about being quietly filtered out of certain matches or markets. If you’re looking for true market access — esports, niche leagues, in-play props, and everything in between — crypto isn’t just an option, it’s the key.

Tips for Finding Sportsbooks That Don’t Block Markets It’s easy for a sportsbook to look global on the surface but quietly restrict what you can actually bet on. Whether it’s limited league access, country-specific blocks, or payout rules tied to your deposit method, some platforms aren’t as open as they claim. Here’s how to spot the difference before you sign up. Watch for Missing Markets If a sportsbook only shows major leagues — like the Premier League, NFL, or NBA — and skips esports, smaller tournaments, or live props, that’s usually a bad sign. A truly open platform will show you full coverage without filters based on location or popularity. Check the Fine Print Terms and conditions usually reveal more than the homepage. Look for anything that says “not available in your country” or “restricted markets.” Bonus rules can also expose limits — if a promotion is only valid on select sports, that may reflect wider platform restrictions. Use a VPN to Test Visibility Before you create an account, open the site using a VPN and browse the sportsbook. If the menu changes depending on where you’re logging in from, odds are it’s geo-restricted. A platform that lets you bet any sports won’t adjust based on your IP. Use Crypto to Skip Regional Filters Many restrictions are tied to fiat payment systems. Signing up and depositing with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another coin can often give you access that wouldn’t be available with traditional banking. Crypto sportsbooks are typically more open by design. Avoid Platforms That Hide Market Details If a sportsbook forces you to create an account just to see available markets — or doesn’t show full sports lists up front — it might be masking limited access. Reputable platforms are transparent about what’s available to all users. Conclusion If your goal is to bet any sports — across leagues, formats, and borders — you need more than a standard sportsbook. You need one that stays open: open to all users, all markets, and all types of bets. That means no geo-blocking, no filtered menus, and no fine print that gets in the way. The platforms in this list offer exactly that. They support crypto, give access to global events, and keep the full sportsbook available — regardless of where you’re logging in from. Whether you’re placing a live bet on a UFC undercard or backing an underdog in a regional league, they give you the access you need. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1.

While Ethereum continues to anchor Layer-1 investor sentiment, several emerging assets are now appearing in top-tier forecast roundups — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of them. Once seen as a fringe meme project, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being watched more closely by analysts tracking early-stage traction , political relevance, and evolving community dynamics. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction Across Q3 Analyst Forecasts Without relying on traditional hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured analyst attention for its: Ideological positioning within political cycles Community-driven growth across platforms Unique narrative appeal compared to typical meme tokens Analysts covering XRP and ETH forecasts are beginning to include MAGACOIN FINANCE as a secondary contender in their early Q3 growth lists — not because of tokenomics alone, but due to the wider social signals it’s generating . This kind of inclusion is rare for newer altcoins, and highlights a growing openness to crypto projects that align with political sentiment and digital activism. XRP in Focus: July 2025 Marks a Key Turning Point According to updated analyst reports, XRP could face a defining moment in Q3. Regulatory clarity, ongoing ETF speculation, and strategic positioning among fintech firms are driving attention back to Ripple’s core use case. Analysts are watching closely for whether XRP can maintain its current momentum or consolidate further through July. But alongside the traditional coverage, the discussion is subtly shifting. Some analysts are expanding their forecast lists to include rising alternatives that blend cultural momentum with crypto-native values — which is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. Ethereum and the Layer-1 Landscape in July Ethereum remains a foundational player with consistent inflows and strong network engagement, but mid-2025 trends show a slowdown in relative upside. Layer-2 scaling projects and political tokens are starting to draw more attention, particularly from traders looking for culturally relevant assets with room to grow. This broadening of the altcoin narrative is now benefiting MAGACOIN FINANCE. Q3 Outlook: Legacy Coins Meet Narrative Disruption With XRP and Ethereum both facing pivotal months in July, analysts agree that the market may open space for projects delivering something different. MAGACOIN FINANCE doesn’t compete directly on infrastructure or speed — it stands apart through identity, ideology, and attention. As more traders seek early-stage narratives ahead of broader market expansion, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing signs of sticking power. Whether it ultimately rivals XRP or Ethereum is yet to be seen — but its name is now part of the conversation.

The renowned New York-based law firm, Pomerantz LLP, has initiated a class-action suit, alleging that the company misled investors regarding the profitability and inherent risks of its aggressive Bitcoin strategy . This legal challenge could have profound implications for MicroStrategy and serve as a crucial reminder for all investors in the volatile digital asset space. What’s Behind the MicroStrategy Investor Lawsuit ? The lawsuit, filed in Virginia by Pomerantz LLP, casts a spotlight on MicroStrategy’s public statements and disclosures concerning its substantial Bitcoin holdings. The core of the complaint revolves around accusations that MicroStrategy provided investors with a skewed perception of its Bitcoin strategy’s profitability while simultaneously downplaying the significant risks associated with such a concentrated bet on a highly volatile asset. This isn’t just about market fluctuations; it’s about the transparency and accuracy of information provided to those who entrusted their capital to the company. The legal action specifically targets investors who acquired MicroStrategy securities between April 2024 and April 2025. This timeframe is critical as it covers a period where Bitcoin experienced notable price swings, and new accounting rules began to shed more light on the financial impact of crypto holdings on corporate balance sheets. Understanding the Allegations: Misleading Bitcoin Strategy ? The plaintiffs allege that MicroStrategy’s communications regarding its Bitcoin strategy were deceptive. While MicroStrategy has long championed Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, the lawsuit suggests that the company failed to adequately convey the full extent of the risks involved. A key piece of evidence cited in the complaint is the staggering $5.9 billion in Q1 unrealized losses under new accounting rules. This figure, while not representing actual cash losses until assets are sold, highlights the significant paper losses incurred during a period of market downturns. For many, MicroStrategy became synonymous with institutional Bitcoin adoption. Its CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, often portraying it as a superior asset to traditional currencies. However, the lawsuit questions whether this enthusiasm translated into a sufficiently cautious and transparent representation of the strategy’s potential downsides to investors. The Role of Pomerantz LLP in Investor Protection Pomerantz LLP is a well-established name in the realm of class-action litigation, particularly known for representing investors in securities fraud cases. Their involvement signals a serious legal challenge for MicroStrategy. Law firms like Pomerantz play a vital role in holding companies accountable for their representations to the public, ensuring that investors have access to accurate and complete information when making investment decisions. The firm’s decision to pursue this class-action lawsuit indicates that they believe there is a strong basis to argue that MicroStrategy’s actions caused financial harm to its investors. This legal avenue allows a large group of individuals who may have suffered similar losses due to alleged misconduct to collectively seek redress. Navigating Unrealized Losses : A Deeper Dive The mention of $5.9 billion in Q1 unrealized losses is a critical component of the lawsuit. It’s important to understand what this means: Unrealized vs. Realized Losses: An unrealized loss occurs when an asset’s market value drops below its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. A realized loss occurs only after the asset is sold at a loss. New Accounting Rules: Recent accounting rule changes (like FASB’s ASC 825) require companies to report crypto assets at fair value, leading to more transparent, albeit volatile, reporting of gains and losses on their balance sheets. This means fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price are now more directly reflected in a company’s financial statements, even if the assets haven’t been sold. Impact on Investors: While unrealized losses don’t immediately affect cash flow, they can significantly impact a company’s reported earnings and net worth, potentially influencing investor confidence and stock price. The lawsuit argues that investors were not adequately prepared for or informed about the potential scale of such fluctuations. What This Class-Action Lawsuit Means for Investors and the Market This class-action lawsuit is more than just a legal battle; it’s a test case for how publicly traded companies manage and communicate their exposure to volatile digital assets. For MicroStrategy, a negative outcome could lead to substantial financial penalties and reputational damage. For the broader cryptocurrency market, it underscores the need for clear disclosure and responsible corporate governance when integrating digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. For Affected Investors: If you invested in MicroStrategy securities between April 2024 and April 2025 and believe you were harmed by misleading information, Pomerantz LLP has set a deadline of July 15 for investors to join the case. This offers an opportunity for individuals to potentially recover losses through collective legal action. This lawsuit highlights the inherent risks in the crypto space and the importance of due diligence for investors. While the allure of high returns is strong, understanding the full spectrum of potential downsides and relying on transparent corporate communications is paramount. A Compelling Summary The class-action lawsuit filed by Pomerantz LLP against MicroStrategy represents a significant challenge to the company’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Allegations of misleading investors and downplaying risks, particularly in light of substantial unrealized losses, underscore the complexities and potential pitfalls of corporate exposure to volatile digital assets. As the legal proceedings unfold, the outcome will not only impact MicroStrategy but also set a precedent for transparency and accountability in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments. Investors are urged to stay informed and understand their rights in this developing situation.

On June 30, 2025, FUNToken (FUN) trades at $0.01000. This seemingly modest figure conceals an extraordinary 174.78% surge over the past twelve months. With $108.18M in market cap and $31.72M in daily volume, this isn't just another gaming token riding the Web3 wave. Behind FUNToken's steady climb lies a calculated scarcity play that could rewrite the rules of token economics. When 77% of 21,500 CoinMarketCap voters signal bullish sentiment, the question isn't whether FUNToken will move. It's how far its fixed 10.81 billion supply and aggressive Buy-and-Burn strategy can propel it toward the coveted $0.10 milestone by December 2025. Market Snapshot & Sentiment FUNToken's current position tells a story of controlled momentum rather than speculative frenzy. At $0.01000 per token, the project commands a $108.18M market cap with $31.72M in 24-hour trading activity. This translates to a healthy 29.28% volume-to-market capitalisation ratio, signalling genuine liquidity rather than artificial pumping. The mathematical beauty lies in its simplicity: 10.81 billion tokens exist, all in circulation, with zero possibility of dilution. Community conviction runs deeper than surface metrics suggest. CoinMarketCap's polling reveals 77% bullish sentiment from over 21,500 participants. Social momentum builds across platforms. Recent X activity from Trader Rai captures the market mood perfectly: ""$FUN at a tiny price, big opportunity! The calm before the ignition?"" This sentiment echoes throughout trading circles as investors recognize the setup's potential. Scarcity Through Buy-and-Burn FUNToken's secret weapon isn't flashy marketing or celebrity endorsements. It's a pure mathematical inevitability driven by scarcity creation. The Buy-and-Burn mechanism operates like a precision instrument, systematically removing tokens from circulation using revenue generated from Web3 gaming operations. Q2 2025 witnessed the elimination of 25 million tokens. This isn't theoretical tokenomics. It's verified reality. CertiK's Q2 2025 audit delivers the ultimate reassurance: ""No new tokens will be created."" Period. No emergency minting, no developer backdoors, no supply inflation surprises. The 10.81 billion token ceiling remains absolute, meaning every burned token represents a permanent reduction in the available supply. Historical precedent supports the effectiveness of this strategy. Binance Coin's systematic burns correlated directly with price appreciation. This demonstrates that supply reduction, combined with growing demand, creates upward price pressure. FUNToken's approach mirrors this success formula while adding Web3 gaming revenue as the burn funding mechanism. With Etherscan recording 1.3 million transactions over the past week, network activity continues generating the revenue that fuels further burns. Scarcity Impact Breakdown: ● Immutable Supply Cap: 10.81 billion FUN tokens, permanently fixed● Active Burn Program: 25 million tokens eliminated across Q2 2025● Security Validation: CertiK audit confirms zero vulnerabilities● Revenue-Driven Burns: Gaming ecosystem profits fund token destruction Supporting Data: Fundamentals and Comparisons Beyond the scarcity narrative, FUNToken's technical indicators paint a picture of controlled strength rather than speculative excess. The current price holds comfortably above the 50-day moving average at $0.0098. The RSI reading of 53.88 suggests neutral momentum with significant upside room before entering overbought territory. More telling is the Average Directional Index (ADX) at 58.33. This indicates a strong trend that supports sustained bullish pressure. This isn't momentum built on hype. Fundamental improvements support its structural movement. The exponential MA5 at $0.010004 generates a clear buy signal, reinforcing the strength of the technical setup. A competitive analysis reveals that FUNToken is undervalued relative to its sector peers. While SAND commands a $1.2 billion market cap and GALA reaches $800 million, FUNToken's $108.18M valuation suggests massive catch-up potential. Market analysts project a $0.09 to $0.15 trading range for Q4 2025, assuming current burn rates and adoption trends continue. Historical context adds weight to these projections. FUNToken's 2017 peak of $0.34 demonstrates the token's capability for significant appreciation when market conditions align. Indicator Value Implication RSI(14) 53.88 Neutral, growth potential ADX(14) 58.33 Strong bullish trend 50-Day MA $0.0098 Price above, bullish MA5 (Exponential) $0.010004 Buy signal Roadmap Connection: Growth Catalysts FUNToken's 2025-2026 roadmap reads like a masterclass in strategic planning. Each milestone is designed to amplify the scarcity effect while expanding utility. The Q3 2025 FUN Wallet launch targets 50,000 initial users, aiming to create a streamlined onboarding experience that will accelerate token adoption and generate additional burn revenue. Q4's mobile wallet represents the real game-changer. It features 5% APY staking rewards and gamification elements designed to attract 200,000 downloads. This isn't just user acquisition. It's ecosystem expansion that creates multiple revenue streams feeding the burn mechanism. The Q1 2026 Global FUN Gaming Summit aims for 50,000 attendees, positioning FUNToken as the definitive Web3 gaming token while fostering partnerships that could exponentially expand the ecosystem. Milestone Timeline Impact FUN Wallet (Web) Q3 2025 Streamlines onboarding, boosts burns Mobile Wallet Launch Q4 2025 Adds staking, gamification Global Gaming Summit Q1 2026 Enhances partnerships, adoption Market Sentiment: Community Momentum FUNToken’s community is a vital strength. The Telegram bot has grown to over 105,000 users (12% weekly increase), and the group exceeds 95,000 members (15% daily active), per FUNToken Telegram . CoinMarketCap’s 77% bullish sentiment, based on 21,500 votes, underscores this support. A Telegram comment, “$FUN’s burns and gaming utility are key strengths,” verified by Telemetr, captures the community’s view. On X, FUNToken trends with 65,000+ followers, with posts like “$FUN’s setup looks solid toward 10¢” gaining traction. Community Engagement Metrics: ● Telegram Bot Users: 105,000+ with 12% weekly expansion● Main Group Members: 95,000+ maintaining 15% daily activity● X Platform Growth: 65,000+ followers, trending mentions● Market Sentiment: 77% bullish across 21,500 CoinMarketCap votes The Path Forward FUNToken's journey toward $0.10 represents the logical outcome of converging fundamental strengths. The fixed 10.81 billion token supply creates an immutable scarcity ceiling while the Buy-and-Burn program systematically reduces available tokens. Technical indicators support continued strength with RSI neutrality providing upside room and ADX confirming trend persistence. Roadmap execution adds the catalyst element with Q3's FUN Wallet and Q4's mobile application positioned to drive adoption while generating burn revenue. Community engagement, exceeding 105,000 Telegram users, provides the social foundation for sustained growth.

Recent developments suggest potential upward movements for two major coins. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) show promising technical improvements. Delve into the factors contributing to this buildup and discover which assets are poised for growth. This analysis is provided by Outset PR , a data-led communications firm that applies the same strategic clarity to market insights as it does to high-performance PR campaigns. Ethereum Price Dips Yet Hints at Potential Rebound Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently moving between $2284 and $2625. Though recent months have shown a slide of nearly 27%, there are signs it could stabilize. The nearest resistance is just below $2750—breaking through could spur optimism. Support around $2070 should help prevent further drops. The current RSI suggests it's not yet considered oversold, indicating room for recovery. If Ethereum gains momentum, it could push toward the second resistance level near $3090, marking an impressive potential rally. Despite past dips, short-term price movements show slight gains. With indicators like the MACD signaling less bearish pressure, a more significant bounce could see Ethereum grow by a substantial double-digit percentage. Solana Price Bounces Back: Potential for Growth? Source: tradingview Solana's price is holding steady between the high $130s and the low $160s. It recently bounced back by over 3% in the past week, showing some short-term resilience. If Solana breaks the $170 resistance, it could surge toward $194, a potential climb of about 20%. However, it still hovers below its 100-day moving average, hinting at a cautious market. The coin's RSI indicates it's not overbought or oversold, while its MACD is improving, suggesting that it might soon gather momentum. While there has been a slight decline over the past month, the positive weekly change hints at possible growth if market conditions improve.

Tether , the company behind the stablecoin Tether ( USDT ) and a major player in the crypto industry, has revealed a memorandum of understanding that will see them use renewable energy to mine Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to an announcement , Bitcoin mining is increasingly becoming a key tool in monetizing surplus energy. The benefits also include helping stabilize power grids and advancing the adoption of decentralized networks. Bitcoin mining and BTC long term value Partnering with Tether will allow the South American agribusiness company to explore innovative ways to maximize the use of its renewable energy assets. “This project opens the door to stabilizing a portion of the energy we currently sell on the spot market, locking in pricing, while also gaining exposure to the upside potential of bitcoin,” said Mariano Bosch, co-founder and chief executive officer of Adecoagro.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Bluntz, tells his 322,200 followers on social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance ( BTC .D) metric is flashing a bearish divergence, setting the stage for alts to outperform the flagship crypto asset. A bearish divergence occurs when the price is recording higher highs and higher lows while an indicator such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recording lower highs. The RSI indicator is a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions. “The three-day BTC dominance bear divergence ended up rolling into a weekly bear divergence, too.

Next up, the trader says that the Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin Bonk ( BONK ) may more than double in price after breaking out of a descending trendline on the five-day chart. “Really not too sure about ATHs, but pretty confident BONK is going at least 100-130% higher.” Source: Bluntz/X He also says that alts similar to BONK are starting to enter uptrends as well. “BONK ecosystem coins going pretty crazy right now to be honest… Can’t be long BONK ecosystem without being long BONK to be honest.” BONK is trading for $0.00001614 at time of writing, up 9.7% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the trader says Useless Coin ( USELESS ), a SOL-based memecoin, could hit the level around $0.50 as it remains in a strong uptrend. “USELESS dips still getting bought up every day constantly despite already being up big. $500 million market cap looks within reach.” Source: Bluntz/X USELESS is trading for $0.248 at time of writing, down 7.6% in the last 24 hours.

Investors are eagerly watching for signs of a breakout. This article explores the underlying factors and examines whether SOL is on the verge of a major upward trend, highlighting which other cryptocurrencies might also be poised for growth. This analysis is provided by Outset PR , a crypto communications firm known for applying data-driven strategy to media execution. Just as Outset aligns storytelling with market conditions, their market insight brings the same clarity to crypto trends. Solana Price Bounces Back: Potential for Growth? Source: tradingview Solana's price is holding steady between the high $130s and the low $160s. It recently bounced back by over 3% in the past week, showing some short-term resilience. If Solana breaks the $170 resistance, it could surge toward $194, a potential climb of about 20%. However, it still hovers below its 100-day moving average, hinting at a cautious market. The coin's RSI indicates it's not overbought or oversold, while its MACD is improving, suggesting that it might soon gather momentum. While there has been a slight decline over the past month, the positive weekly change hints at possible growth if market conditions improve.

Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets.

Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Conclusion Solana's recent surge in trading volume signals a potential major move for SOL.

Monitoring these trends will help determine Solana's next steps and its impact on the market. Clarity in uncertain markets is valuable, and Outset PR applies that same principle to its work in crypto communications. By combining real-time analytics, performance-based targeting, and proprietary traffic tech, the firm helps clients get visibility where it matters most.

In a significant development that underscores its commitment to global expansion and regulatory compliance, global crypto exchange Bitstamp Singapore has officially secured a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This achievement is not just a regulatory nod; it’s a strategic springboard for Bitstamp’s ambitious expansion into the vibrant Asia-Pacific (APAC) crypto market, solidifying its commitment to regulated and secure digital asset services. What Does the MPI License Mean for Bitstamp Singapore? For any cryptocurrency exchange, operating within clear regulatory frameworks is paramount for fostering trust and ensuring sustainable growth. The Major Payment Institution (MPI) license, granted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is one of the most comprehensive and sought-after licenses in the financial technology sector. For Bitstamp Singapore , securing this license signifies a monumental step, enabling it to offer regulated digital payment token (DPT) services in one of the world’s leading financial hubs. What does this MPI license crypto approval truly entail? It means Bitstamp can now: Offer Regulated Services: Provide DPT services, including spot trading, custody, and potentially other offerings, under MAS’s stringent oversight. Enhance Trust and Security: Operate with a stamp of approval from a highly respected financial regulator, instilling greater confidence among institutional and retail clients. Broaden Service Offerings: Potentially expand its product suite in Singapore, catering to a wider range of financial needs within the digital asset space. Strengthen Compliance: Adhere to robust anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures, consumer protection, and cybersecurity standards set by MAS. This license positions Bitstamp as a trusted and compliant player in the highly competitive Singaporean market, a crucial factor for attracting both retail users and institutional capital. Navigating MAS Crypto Regulation: A Deep Dive Singapore has long been recognized globally for its forward-thinking yet robust regulatory approach to financial services. The MAS crypto regulation framework is no exception, striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding financial stability and consumer interests. For crypto exchanges, obtaining a license from MAS is often seen as a badge of honor, signifying adherence to some of the highest operational and compliance standards worldwide. MAS’s regulatory philosophy emphasizes: Risk Management: Strict requirements for managing technology risks, operational resilience, and cybersecurity. Consumer Protection: Measures to ensure fair dealing, proper disclosure of risks, and handling of customer complaints. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & CFT: Comprehensive frameworks to prevent illicit financial activities, requiring exchanges to implement robust due diligence and transaction monitoring systems. Market Integrity: Rules aimed at preventing market manipulation and ensuring fair and orderly trading. The rigorous application process and ongoing supervision by MAS ensure that licensed entities like Bitstamp operate with integrity and transparency. This stringent environment, while challenging for applicants, ultimately benefits users by providing a safer and more reliable ecosystem for engaging with digital assets. Bitstamp’s success in navigating this complex regulatory landscape highlights its operational maturity and dedication to best practices. Bitstamp’s Strategic Move into the APAC Crypto Market The Asia-Pacific region represents a colossal opportunity for cryptocurrency businesses. With a rapidly growing population, increasing digital adoption, and a burgeoning middle class, the APAC crypto market is a hotbed of innovation and demand. Countries like Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Australia are at the forefront of digital asset adoption, presenting immense potential for expansion. Bitstamp’s decision to prioritize Singapore for its MPI license is highly strategic. Singapore serves as a gateway to the broader APAC region due to its: Financial Hub Status: A well-established global financial center with strong infrastructure and connectivity. Pro-Innovation Stance: A regulatory environment that encourages fintech innovation while maintaining strong oversight. Diverse Talent Pool: Access to skilled professionals in finance, technology, and compliance. This license allows Bitstamp to deepen its presence in a key market, offering localized services and building stronger relationships with regional partners and users. It’s a foundational step that could pave the way for further expansion into other APAC jurisdictions, leveraging Singapore’s reputation as a launchpad for regional growth. Bitstamp aims to capture a significant share of this dynamic market by providing secure, compliant, and user-friendly services tailored to regional needs. The Ripple Effect of the Robinhood Bitstamp Acquisition The news of Bitstamp securing its Singapore MPI license comes on the heels of another significant development: its acquisition by Robinhood, the U.S.-based trading platform known for democratizing access to financial markets. The Robinhood Bitstamp acquisition is a powerful synergy that brings together Robinhood’s vast user base and technological prowess with Bitstamp’s deep expertise in crypto exchange operations and global regulatory compliance. This acquisition is expected to have several positive ripple effects: Enhanced Resources: Robinhood’s financial backing and technological resources can accelerate Bitstamp’s product development and global expansion initiatives. Broader Reach: Bitstamp gains access to Robinhood’s extensive user base, potentially onboarding more users into regulated crypto services globally. Regulatory Acumen: Bitstamp’s long-standing experience in navigating complex global regulations, including this latest MPI license, complements Robinhood’s efforts to expand its crypto offerings internationally. Strategic Alignment: Both companies share a vision of making financial markets more accessible, and this combined strength can drive innovation in the digital asset space. The acquisition empowers Bitstamp to pursue ambitious regulatory goals, like the Singapore MPI license, with greater confidence and resources, ultimately benefiting users who seek reliable and regulated crypto services on a global scale. Benefits for Users and the Broader Ecosystem Bitstamp’s latest regulatory achievement in Singapore is not just a corporate win; it has tangible benefits for both individual users and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. For users in Singapore and potentially the broader APAC crypto market , this means access to a highly reputable exchange operating under stringent regulatory oversight. This translates to: Increased Security: Enhanced protection of assets and personal data due to MAS’s robust cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements. Consumer Confidence: Greater trust in the platform, knowing it operates within a clear legal framework designed to protect investors. Reliable Services: Expectation of stable and compliant services, reducing risks associated with unregulated platforms. Market Legitimacy: The entry of more regulated players like Bitstamp contributes to the overall legitimacy and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. For the ecosystem, it sets a precedent for responsible growth. As more established exchanges pursue and obtain licenses in key jurisdictions, it encourages a more mature and secure global crypto landscape, fostering innovation within a compliant framework. Challenges and the Road Ahead While securing the MPI license is a significant victory, the journey for Bitstamp in Singapore and the broader APAC region is just beginning. The cryptocurrency market remains highly dynamic and competitive. Bitstamp will need to continually adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes, fierce competition from established local players, and the inherent volatility of digital assets. Building brand recognition and trust in diverse APAC markets, each with its unique cultural and regulatory nuances, will also be a key challenge. However, with the backing of Robinhood and a clear commitment to regulatory compliance, Bitstamp is well-positioned to navigate these complexities. Its focus on security, user experience, and adherence to global standards will be critical in carving out a dominant presence in this promising region. A New Era of Regulated Crypto Expansion Bitstamp’s successful acquisition of the Major Payment Institution license in Singapore marks a truly transformative moment for the exchange and a significant step forward for regulated cryptocurrency services globally. This strategic move, bolstered by the recent Robinhood Bitstamp acquisition, not only solidifies Bitstamp’s position as a leading compliant exchange but also unlocks immense potential for growth within the dynamic APAC crypto market . It underscores the growing importance of regulatory adherence in the digital asset space, promising a more secure and trustworthy environment for investors and innovators alike. As the crypto world continues to mature, Bitstamp’s proactive approach to compliance in key jurisdictions like Singapore sets a powerful example for the industry’s future.

This initiative comes as stablecoins experience rapid growth and lawmakers move forward with efforts to oversee the asset class. The Company’s Offering In a press release dated July 3, the crypto-friendly bank revealed that it had officially become “the first bank globally to directly support Ripple USD.” AMINA announced that it will initially only provide custody and trading services for RLUSD. The bank’s offering will target institutional clients and professional investors seeking compliant stablecoin options. It also disclosed plans to expand its services in the coming months. “At AMINA Bank, we are committed to integrating cutting-edge products so that our clients may best navigate and adopt digital assets in their day-to-day activities,” said Myles Harrison, the company’s Chief Product Officer. Referring to RLUSD as “one of the most anticipated digital assets in the market,” Harrison highlighted Ripple’s focus on transparency and compliance. He said these qualities make the company a strong partner in AMINA’s ongoing efforts to expand institutional-grade digital asset services. Ripple’s stablecoin is backed by a segregated reserve of cash and cash equivalents, including U.S. Treasuries, and operates under the oversight of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The token currently has a circulating supply of $430 million. The firm also recently revealed that it has applied for a U.S. banking license to enhance trust in its dollar-pegged crypto asset. If approved, the permit would place the company under federal oversight, adding another layer of regulatory security. This development comes amid growing demand from institutions for stablecoins that operate within a supervised framework. Lawmakers in the United States are advancing the GENIUS Act, which would establish national guidelines for stablecoin regulation. AMINA Bank’s Crypto Efforts Earlier this year, the Swiss bank took steps to support stablecoin adoption by removing custody fees for its USD Coin (USDC) Rewards Account clients. The program applies to hot and cold wallets and offers a 0.2% quarterly interest rate to clients who maintain an average balance of 10,000 USDC or more. The financial institutions also later announced plans to roll out support for EURC, Circle’s euro-backed stablecoin. Customers using EURC can earn interest across both wallet types, following the same reward structure.

ADA, ETH, and SOL are drawing attention as accumulation patterns emerge. These essential metrics offer insights into potential gains, suggesting that certain coins might be poised for a significant upward movement. Discover which digital assets show promising signs of growth. This analysis is presented by Outset PR, a data-driven crypto communications agency known for pairing high-touch strategy with performance metrics. Cardano's Battle: Will ADA Break Through or Stay Stuck? Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between the mid-fifty cents range. It's facing challenges just below sixty-three cents, which is acting as a barrier. Prices might drop to fifty cents if this resistance holds. Lately, Cardano's value has dropped over a third in the last six months, showing a tough journey. However, if ADA can break through the sixty-three cents mark, it could aim for seventy cents, a potential jump of around 15%. The market's mood is not overly excited, but if momentum picks up, Cardano might have a chance to climb. Keep an eye on these price points; they are crucial for ADA’s next move. Ethereum Price Dips Yet Hints at Potential Rebound Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently moving between $2284 and $2625. Though recent months have shown a slide of nearly 27%, there are signs it could stabilize. The nearest resistance is just below $2750—breaking through could spur optimism. Support around $2070 should help prevent further drops. The current RSI suggests it's not yet considered oversold, indicating room for recovery. If Ethereum gains momentum, it could push toward the second resistance level near $3090, marking an impressive potential rally. Despite past dips, short-term price movements show slight gains. With indicators like the MACD signaling less bearish pressure, a more significant bounce could see Ethereum grow by a substantial double-digit percentage. Solana Price Bounces Back: Potential for Growth? Source: tradingview Solana's price is holding steady between the high $130s and the low $160s. It recently bounced back by over 3% in the past week, showing some short-term resilience. If Solana breaks the $170 resistance, it could surge toward $194, a potential climb of about 20%. However, it still hovers below its 100-day moving average, hinting at a cautious market. The coin's RSI indicates it's not overbought or oversold, while its MACD is improving, suggesting that it might soon gather momentum. While there has been a slight decline over the past month, the positive weekly change hints at possible growth if market conditions improve.
