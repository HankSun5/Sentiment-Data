Analyst Predicts Breakout Beyond $2,100",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-rally-incoming-analyst-predicts-breakout-beyond-2100/,"Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, is getting a lot of attention right now. Some experts who watch the market closely think its price could go above $2,100 soon. They’ve been looking at how Ethereum’s price has been moving and see patterns that suggest it might be heading up. Related Reading: Shiba Inu ETF Proposal—Could This Be SHIB’s Breakout Moment? Short-Term Signs Point Upward One analyst, Crypto Patel, shared his thoughts on the social media platform X. He pointed out a setup on the Ethereum chart that looks promising for a price increase. Patel said Ethereum made a strong move upwards, which changed the way the market is structured. This happened after the price reacted to a level he had already identified as a good place for buyers to step in. #Ethereum Prints Bullish Displacement – Swing High Liquidity in Sight$ETH Price respecting bullish POI with clear displacement on tap. Currently testing mitigation block post-retest.

This area is called a mitigation block, and it often shows strong buying interest from big investors. The idea is that these investors use this zone to adjust their previous orders before continuing to push the price in a certain direction. Patel suggests that buying in this upper part of the mitigation zone lines up with how these big players often operate. The target price Patel mentioned is $2,128. This level is what’s known as a swing high liquidity zone. These zones often have a lot of stop-loss orders and pending buy orders clustered together. If the price moves into this area, it could trigger those orders and cause a sharp move, allowing investors to profit before the price possibly changes direction. Patel set a stop-loss for this trade at $2,027, just below the mitigation block. This helps limit potential losses if his prediction is wrong. Long-Term Pattern Looks Familiar Another analyst, TimeFreedomROB, also posted on X. He compared Ethereum’s current weekly price pattern to what happened between 2018 and 2020. His chart shows Ethereum breaking below an ascending triangle pattern, which is similar to how it broke below a descending triangle before its big recovery in 2020. Back then, Ethereum’s price hit a low point and then soared from under $100 to almost $4,800. #ETH 1W Price is showing the Same type of Break below support as last Cycle 👀 Will Price Recover Rapidly Like Last Time? 📈 pic.twitter.com/uoIDTd5w8L — TimeFreedom ®️0️⃣🅱️ ⚡ (@TimeFreedomROB) March 25, 2025 Currently, Ethereum is trading near $2,060. It recently dropped below the $2,300 mark and tested a lower trendline around $1800. This area also lines up with price levels where there was a lot of demand in previous years.

The analyst’s chart suggests this could be the final dip before a significant price increase, similar to what happened in past cycles. The area between $1,800 and $2,000 has acted as a strong support level in the past. For Ethereum’s price to confirm a return to an upward trend on the weekly chart, it needs to climb back above the $2,200 to $2,400 range. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,064. Over the last week, it has gained 6%. Its total market value is $250 billion, and the amount of Ethereum traded in the last 24 hours is $11.71 billion. These analysts are presenting scenarios based on how Ethereum’s price has behaved in the past, but it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market can be unpredictable.

42450446,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143577,1743032406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Justice Served: T3 Freezes Massive $9M in Crypto Stolen from Bybit Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/t3-freezes-bybit-hack-funds/,"In a significant win for the crypto space and a stark warning to cybercriminals, the T3 Financial Crime Unit has acted swiftly to freeze over $9 million in digital assets linked to the recent Bybit Exchange security breach. This decisive action highlights the increasing sophistication and collaborative efforts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to combat illicit activities and safeguard user funds. Let’s dive into how this unfolded and what it means for the future of cryptocurrency security . What’s the Buzz About the Bybit Hack and the $9 Million Asset Freeze? If you’ve been following the crypto news, you’ve likely heard about the recent hack targeting the Bybit Exchange. While details of the exploit are still emerging, the immediate aftermath saw a substantial amount of digital assets siphoned off. This is where the T3 Financial Crime Unit stepped in. But who exactly is T3, and how did they manage to pull off such a significant asset freeze ? The T3 Financial Crime Unit isn’t your average watchdog. It’s a powerful collaboration, a trifecta of expertise combining the strengths of: TRON DAO : Known for its decentralized blockchain platform, TRON DAO brings its technological prowess and community-driven approach to the table. Tether : The issuer of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether’s involvement underscores the critical role stablecoins play in the crypto ecosystem and their commitment to security. TRM Labs : A leader in blockchain intelligence, TRM Labs provides the cutting-edge technology and investigative tools necessary to trace and track illicit crypto flows. This powerhouse partnership was specifically formed to tackle financial crime within the digital asset space, and their recent success in the Bybit hack case is a testament to their effectiveness. Decoding the $9M Crypto Asset Freeze: How Did They Do It? Freezing digital assets in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency might sound like trying to catch smoke, but T3’s operation demonstrates that it’s increasingly possible. Here’s a simplified look at the process: Rapid Response & Identification: Following the report of the crypto hack on Bybit, T3’s team sprang into action. TRM Labs’ blockchain analytics tools are crucial here, allowing for the rapid tracing of the stolen funds as they move across different wallets and exchanges. Collaboration with Exchanges and Authorities: Freezing assets isn’t a solo act. It requires close cooperation with cryptocurrency exchanges (like Bybit in this case) and potentially regulatory bodies. T3 leverages its network and established relationships to coordinate these actions. Smart Contract and Wallet Freezing Mechanisms: Depending on the nature of the assets and the blockchain involved, various technical mechanisms can be employed to freeze funds. This might involve working with smart contract developers or engaging with exchanges to freeze accounts associated with the illicit transactions. Legal Framework and Compliance: While the crypto space is still navigating regulatory landscapes, established legal frameworks related to asset recovery and financial crime are utilized to legitimize and enforce these freezes. The $9 million freeze isn’t just a number; it represents a significant portion of the stolen funds potentially recovered, preventing further laundering or use by the perpetrators of the Bybit hack . Why is this Asset Freeze a Big Deal for Cryptocurrency? This successful stolen funds recovery operation carries weight beyond just the monetary value. It sends several powerful messages across the crypto ecosystem: Enhanced Security Perception: For users and potential investors, this action reinforces the idea that the crypto space is not a lawless Wild West. Proactive measures are being taken to protect users and their assets. Deterrent to Cybercriminals: The news of swift asset freezes can act as a significant deterrent to would-be hackers. It demonstrates that illicit gains are not easily attainable and that there are consequences. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Successful recovery operations contribute to the growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies. It shows that the industry is maturing and taking security and user protection seriously, which is crucial for attracting mainstream adoption. Industry Collaboration is Key: The T3 unit exemplifies the power of collaboration. TRON DAO, Tether, and TRM Labs, each with their unique expertise, working together achieve far more than they could individually. This model of industry-led security initiatives is likely to become more prevalent. In essence, this asset freeze is a victory for the good guys in crypto, showcasing that security and accountability are becoming increasingly paramount. Are There Challenges in Crypto Asset Recovery? Absolutely. While the T3’s success is commendable, it’s important to acknowledge that stolen funds recovery in cryptocurrency is not always straightforward. Significant challenges remain: Challenge Description Decentralization and Anonymity The very features that make crypto attractive – decentralization and pseudonymity – can also hinder asset recovery. Tracing funds across multiple blockchains and anonymous wallets is technically complex. Jurisdictional Issues Cryptocurrency transactions are often borderless, making jurisdictional issues a major hurdle. Coordinating legal processes across different countries to freeze and recover assets can be lengthy and complicated. Technical Sophistication of Hackers Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics. They employ sophisticated techniques to obfuscate transactions, use mixers and tumblers, and move funds across various exchanges to complicate tracking. Regulatory Uncertainty The evolving regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies adds another layer of complexity. Lack of clear and consistent global regulations can impede cross-border asset recovery efforts. Despite these challenges, the T3 Financial Crime Unit’s achievement offers a beacon of hope and demonstrates that progress is being made in overcoming these obstacles. Looking Ahead: What Can We Learn from This Crypto Security Win? The successful freezing of assets linked to the Bybit hack provides valuable lessons and actionable insights for the crypto community: Proactive Security Measures are Essential: Exchanges and crypto platforms must prioritize robust security measures, including regular audits, advanced threat detection systems, and strong KYC/AML protocols to prevent hacks in the first place. Collaboration is Crucial: The T3 model highlights the importance of industry-wide collaboration. Sharing intelligence, resources, and expertise is vital to effectively combat crypto crime. Blockchain Analytics is a Game Changer: Tools like those provided by TRM Labs are becoming increasingly indispensable for tracing illicit crypto transactions and enabling asset recovery. User Awareness and Education: Users also have a role to play in cryptocurrency security . Practicing safe storage habits, being vigilant against phishing scams, and choosing reputable exchanges are all important steps. Conclusion: A Strong Message for a Safer Crypto Future The swift and decisive action by the T3 Financial Crime Unit to freeze over $9 million in assets linked to the Bybit hack is more than just a financial recovery; it’s a powerful statement. It signals a maturing cryptocurrency ecosystem that is actively fighting back against cybercrime, prioritizing user protection, and building a more secure and trustworthy digital asset space. This victory, while significant, is just one step in the ongoing battle for cryptocurrency security . Continued innovation, collaboration, and vigilance are crucial to stay ahead of evolving threats and ensure a safer future for all participants in the crypto revolution.

Speaking from the Oval Office, the president made his remarks during an event where he also introduced a new 25% duty on automobile imports. The comments come as part of a broader effort by the president to reshape trade relations with China, following the 20% levies he has already imposed on Chinese goods. The president predicted that he could secure at least an outline of a deal for TikTok by next week. However, he added that if an agreement is not reached, he would extend the deadline. “We’re going to have a form of a deal, but if it’s not finished, it’s not a big deal. We’ll just extend it,” Trump said, “I have the right to have the deal and to extend it if I want.” His remarks show that he’ll go one step ahead to complete the negotiations. He added, “We have a lot of interest in TikTok.” Trump speaking about the TikTok deal at the Oval Office. Source: Bloomberg Trump also mentioned that there are various ways to acquire TikTok, and he wants to find the one that’s best for the US. He clarified that China will ‘possibly’ have to play a role in it, such as in the form of an approval. He said, “I think they’ll do that. Maybe I’ll give them a little reduction in Tariffs or something, to get it done.” Trump thinks that’s justified, and probably a good offer, because “every point in Tariffs is worth more money than TikTok.” There was a time when Trump wanted to ban TikTok. However, the app helped him reach younger voters and helped him with the 2024 election campaign. This turned the President into a major supporter of the app. TikTok’s recent past in the US was troubled but now it appears that Trump will go to any lengths to change that for good. Negotiations have been underway with four unnamed bidders Under a law signed last year by President Joe Biden, ByteDance Ltd.—TikTok’s Chinese parent company—was required to sell the US operations of the app by January 19. TikTok briefly paused its service earlier this year, but a full shutdown was narrowly avoided when Trump signed an executive order delaying the law’s enforcement by 90 days, extending the deadline to April 5. Earlier this month, Trump confirmed that negotiations were underway with four potential bidders for TikTok. Although he did not name all the parties, publicly known bidders include a group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, another group featuring tech entrepreneur Jesse Tinsley and YouTube star MrBeast, and a merger offer by San Francisco-based Perplexity AI. In addition, Oracle Corp. is weighing a proposal that would see it provide security assurances and take a small stake in a new American entity while possibly allowing ByteDance to retain TikTok’s influential algorithm. Any final deal would need the approval of not only Trump but also ByteDance and the Chinese government. Allowing ByteDance to keep the algorithm might smooth the way for Chinese approval; however, it could risk noncompliance with the divestiture law.

The calm waters of the crypto market might be about to get choppy. Leading research firm K33 Research is sounding the alarm, predicting a potential surge in crypto volatility as we approach April 2nd. Why is this date circled in red on the crypto calendar? It’s the day former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his tariff plans, a move analysts are dubbing “Liberation Day.” Why is Trump’s Tariff Announcement Triggering Crypto Volatility Fears? While Bitcoin has shown resilience, climbing nearly 5% in the past week, and U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are enjoying a wave of inflows, raking in a hefty $896.6 million in just eight days, a sense of unease lingers in the trading community. According to insights from The Block, traders are treading cautiously, and for good reason. The potential catalyst for this looming market uncertainty ? Trump’s tariff announcement. K33 Research analysts pinpoint Trump’s stance as the critical factor. Here’s a breakdown of how different approaches could impact the crypto sphere: Softer Tone = Potential Price Lift: If Trump adopts a less aggressive stance on tariffs than anticipated, it could inject optimism into the broader markets, including crypto. This could be seen as a signal of reduced economic tension, potentially leading to a positive price movement for cryptocurrencies. Ambiguity or Hardline Approach = Sharp Swings: Conversely, if Trump’s announcement is vague or leans towards a hardline tariff policy, brace yourselves. History suggests that such pronouncements can trigger significant market turbulence. Think back to past tariff-related sell-offs – the crypto market could experience similar sharp downward swings. Decoding the Market Sentiment Amidst Trump Tariff Announcement To truly understand the current market pulse, let’s delve deeper into the factors contributing to this cautious optimism mixed with underlying anxiety: Bitcoin’s Recent Gains and ETF Inflows: A Sign of Strength? Bitcoin’s recent price surge and the continued positive flows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are undeniably positive indicators. These inflows suggest sustained institutional interest and growing mainstream adoption. However, seasoned traders know that in the volatile world of crypto, past performance is not always a predictor of future outcomes. The market’s reaction to the Trump tariff announcement could easily overshadow these positive trends. Trader Caution: Reading Between the Lines The reported trader caution is a crucial signal. It indicates that despite the positive momentum, a significant segment of the market anticipates potential headwinds. This caution is likely rooted in the understanding of how macroeconomic factors, such as tariff policies, can ripple through all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Experienced traders are adept at anticipating and reacting to such macro-driven risks. Navigating the Impending Crypto Volatility: Key Strategies So, how can crypto investors and traders prepare for this potential wave of crypto volatility ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to Trump’s tariff announcement. Reputable financial news sources and crypto market analysis platforms will be invaluable in providing real-time updates and expert interpretations. Risk Management is Paramount: Now is the time to review and potentially tighten your risk management strategies. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocation, setting stop-loss orders, and being prepared to reduce exposure if market conditions warrant it. Diversification: While Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency, diversification across different crypto assets can help mitigate risk. Explore established altcoins and consider spreading your investments to reduce the impact of volatility in any single asset. Cash is King (Optional): In times of heightened uncertainty, holding a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins or fiat currency can provide a safety net. This allows you to capitalize on potential buying opportunities if prices dip sharply. Understand Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment indicators. Crypto fear and greed indices and social media sentiment analysis can provide clues about the prevailing market mood and potential shifts in momentum. The Road Ahead: Beyond the Tariff Announcement The Trump tariff announcement is just one piece of the puzzle in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. While it presents a potential near-term volatility trigger, the long-term trajectory of the crypto market is shaped by a multitude of factors, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the inherent volatility of this exciting asset class. The coming days could be pivotal for the crypto market. Whether Trump’s announcement unleashes a storm of volatility or proves to be a non-event remains to be seen. However, being prepared, staying informed, and having a robust risk management strategy in place are essential for weathering any potential market turbulence and positioning yourself for long-term success in the crypto space. Conclusion: Brace for Potential Swings in the Crypto Market The crypto market stands at a potential crossroads. K33 Research’s warning about impending crypto volatility related to Trump’s tariff announcement is a timely reminder of the external factors that can significantly influence digital assets. While positive undercurrents like Bitcoin ETF inflows exist, the shadow of political and economic uncertainty looms large.

Following the latest surge, the price appears strong, advancing bullish on the day. The past months have been rough and tough for most meme coins as they dropped heavily to their multi-month lows. This came as a result of wide correction, but they recently found a solid ground. Meanwhile, Pepe mounted support two weeks ago and started to show signs of recovery, although it was less significant due to low volatility. This led to a serious squeeze throughout last week and closed at a loss. However, this week has been interesting for Pepe and other top meme coins as they find their way back into buying mode after struggling with volatility since they rebounded over the past weeks. This bearish break may last long if the bulls show strong commitment in the coming days. Failure to commit strongly might bring an end to the latest surge. This may trigger a new sell order capable of rolling the price back before breaking down the current monthly low. If the bulls defend the monthly low well, we may see a fresh increase with a new bullish pattern. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The current surge is targeted at the $0.0000108 resistance. If the price increases above this resistance, a higher level to consider for a test would be $0.0000127 and potentially $0.0000148. Resuming the downtrend, the $0.000007 and $0.000006 levels might pose a threat before reclaiming the monthly low of $0.00000522. Losing it could send the price to a low of $0.000004 in the near term.

The token has surged more than 16% in the past week and is presently hovering at $0.00000915 after breaking through the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. This may be an indication that the trend is developing a bullish reversal which may lead to a Pepe coin rally. Pepe Coin Rally Continues as Price Approaches $0.0000100 Level Top meme coin PEPE could remove a zero from its price amid the Pepe coin rally, which saw a sharp 13% rise in 24 hours. The token reached $0.00000906, breaking a major technical resistance at the 50-day EMA. The RSI has climbed to 58, reflecting a rise in bullish momentum. The price action also shows a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band. This move aligns with increased market activity and expanding volatility. According to analyst Satori , if the current indicators continue to trend upwards, the recently broken resistance level could solidify as a new support zone. Source: X Similarly, experts revealed that the top meme coin is positioned for a potential explosion, urging investors to accumulate now or risk missing out on substantial gains. With PEPE holding strong support and outperforming other meme coins, analysts believe it could see a 100% surge PEPE Futures Market Shows Strong Trader Interest PEPE futures open interest surged to $324 million, the highest since February 2, 2025. This marks a sharp increase from earlier levels in March when it stood at $166 million. A rising open interest indicates more active futures positions. It reflects a growing interest in the top meme coin among derivatives traders during the ongoing Pepe coin rally. Source: Coinglass Additionally, data from Nansen shows PEPE exchange reserves dropped by 0.73% over the past week. The current level stands at 240.7 trillion tokens held on exchanges. This movement suggests investors are withdrawing their holdings from exchanges. Reduced reserves often point to long-term holding behavior and lower short-term sell pressure. Next Resistance Levels and Technical Outlook The next price resistance is at $0.00001094. If broken, the PEPE Coin rally may test $0.00001180, a level that previously acted as a support zone. PEPE price rebound began after hitting $0.000005895 on March 10, matching its August 2023 low. Since then, it has steadily gained, supported by technical strength and investor positioning during the Pepe coin rally. Moreover, a recent analysis shows that Pepe Coin is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal signal indicating a breakout. Analysts suggest that a confirmed move above the $0.0000075 neckline could trigger a sharp surge, with some even predicting a 40x meme coin rally . At press time, Pepe coin price was up 5.59% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.000008430. Its 24-hour trading volume had surged by 96.50% to reach $1 billion, while the market cap climbed by 5.60% to $3.54 billion.

Though it remains bearish despite the latest surge. In the last leg down, Shiba managed to stay above the psychological $0.00001 level after breaking through several support levels since the start of the year. While the sell-off seemed to have temporarily cooled off, the price increased as it showed strength on the daily chart. This started after bouncing back above the mentioned psychological level two weeks back. The bounce produced a substantial gain in the past week and briefly changed the trading landscape, while the trend remains bearish on the daily chart. Looking back from where it started to drop at $0.000034 in December, Shiba still maintains a swing low trend. As we can see, the latest bounce is considered a retracement of the short-term bearish. The drag down will likely continue if the bulls fail to sustain momentum. If not, more surges could bring a bigger recovery before the bears step back. Currently, they are taking a break, and from the look of things, they will likely release pressure again. It will be too early to say the bulls are back in the market. Shiba’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Right now, Shib aims to test a nearby resistance level at $0.0000173. A rejection there may bring selling back in the market, but if it pushes higher, the next resistance to watch above it is $0.000019, followed by the $0.0000223 level. On the daily chart, there’s support for Shiba at $0.0000138, $0.0000123 and the $0.0000109 level marked as the current monthly low. If the price breaks below it, a new low may surface at the $0.000009 level.

Regulatory Dynamics Shape Adoption: Clear regulations foster trust and attract investment, but overly stringent policies risk stifling innovation, especially in emerging markets. Technological Innovations Push Boundaries: Advances in cryptography, smart contracts, and AI are addressing scalability, security, and efficiency challenges, expanding possibilities in the digital economy. Crypto Promotes Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies provide access to financial tools for the unbanked, empowering individuals while transforming global workforce dynamics. Challenges Remain Critical: Security risks, environmental concerns, and market saturation are ongoing hurdles that require innovative solutions to sustain crypto’s growth. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology transforms the way we live, and cryptocurrency is one of those innovations that feels like it’s reshaping the future right before our eyes. From decentralised finance to blockchain-powered solutions, the digital economy is evolving at an incredible pace. It’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore—it’s about the vast ecosystem driving change across industries. Understanding the forces behind this dynamic world has been both exciting and eye-opening for me. The blend of technology, economics, and community-driven innovation creates an environment full of potential. Whether it’s the promise of financial inclusion or the push for greater transparency, crypto’s impact is undeniable. Exploring these forces isn’t just about staying informed; it’s about grasping the opportunities and challenges shaping tomorrow. Analysing The Core Components Of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency operates within an intricate framework that’s both fascinating and transformative. I’ve always found breaking down its core elements helps in making sense of its revolutionary potential. Understanding Blockchain Technology Blockchain technology forms the backbone of cryptocurrency. It’s a secure, immutable ledger that records transactions across a distributed network. I’m amazed by how it eliminates intermediaries, ensuring transparency and accountability. Experts, like Andreas Antonopoulos, call it the “internet of money” for good reason. Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash. This structure ensures that altering data in one block would require changing all subsequent blocks. It fosters trust, especially in a decentralised system where no central authority exists. Its robustness excites me. Transactions are verified using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. The absence of centralised verification speeds up processes and reduces costs. Blockchain, beyond finance, impacts healthcare, supply chains, and even voting systems. Role Of Decentralisation In Cryptocurrencies Decentralisation defines cryptocurrencies and differentiates them from traditional currencies. By distributing control across a global network, it removes reliance on central authorities. I’ve seen how this feature empowers individuals in regions with unstable economies. Nodes within the network validate transactions, preventing centralised control or censorship. Vitalik Buterin describes decentralisation as “a key to resistance against systemic corruption.” This aligns with cryptocurrency’s foundational ethos of financial sovereignty. Users hold private keys, ensuring only they control their funds. Peer-to-peer transactions reduce inefficiencies, increasing inclusivity. I believe decentralisation drives trust, making cryptocurrencies attractive to those seeking alternatives to traditional banking. Examining Tokenisation And Crypto Assets Tokenisation transforms real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents ownership or usage rights, enhancing liquidity and accessibility. I’m intrigued by how it democratises ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate in high-value assets. Crypto assets can be utility tokens, security tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Utility tokens power ecosystems, while security tokens represent investments. NFTs are unique and bring digital art and collectibles into mainstream markets. This diversity is thrilling. Tokenisation ensures transparency through blockchain-based verification. Regulators like the FCA are moving to clarify frameworks, which could spur adoption. I view crypto assets as symbols of the paradigm shift in how we perceive, trade, and store value. Exploring Market Trends Shaping Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are evolving rapidly, bringing fresh opportunities and challenges. With dynamic forces influencing the market, it’s clear that understanding key trends is crucial to navigating this digital economy effectively. Volatility And Price Mechanics Price volatility defines the crypto market, driven by speculators, investor sentiment, and rapid news cycles. I’ve noticed that significant events, like regulatory announcements or technological updates, can cause sharp price swings. Supply mechanics also play a crucial role. Cryptos like Bitcoin, with a capped supply of 21 million, exhibit scarcity value, amplifying demand during market upswings. Low liquidity often exacerbates volatility, especially for emerging altcoins. Adoption By Businesses And Consumers Business and consumer adoption is redefining cryptocurrencies’ practical uses. I’ve seen global firms like Tesla accept Bitcoin for payments, showcasing their legitimacy. Payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard are integrating crypto transactions, simplifying cross-border payments. Consumers are also warming to using crypto-backed cards for everyday purchases. DeFi platforms allow earning and borrowing, making crypto an economic alternative. These examples highlight growing trust in crypto products. Key Investment Trends In The Crypto Space Investment trends in crypto have shifted towards institutional participation. According to Bloomberg, over £40 billion flowed into crypto hedge funds and ETFs in 2023 alone. I’ve personally observed rising interest in utility-driven projects like Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, reducing transaction costs. NFTs and metaverse assets are gaining traction, offering new digital ownership pathways. Staking and earning opportunities through Proof-of-Stake networks also attract a growing investor base. Investigating Regulatory And Legal Dynamics Governments and agencies are continually shaping the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. I find this part of the digital economy fascinating, as it establishes how innovation and governance coexist. Government Policies Across The Globe Global regulatory efforts aim for consistency to protect investors and economies. The IMF has stressed the importance of coordinated frameworks, warning against naming crypto as legal tender due to risks for emerging markets. I think these moves balance innovation with financial stability. In countries like Japan and Switzerland, regulators classify cryptocurrencies distinctly to integrate them within their financial systems. Meanwhile, India and China continue imposing strict bans, focusing on reducing risks like illicit financing. These varying stances define the global crypto policies today. Challenges Of Compliance And Legal Frameworks Crypto firms face challenges adapting to diverse regulations worldwide. Regular shifts in the legal framework demand constant re-evaluation of compliance strategies. I often hear industry leaders expressing frustration over uncertainties in enforcement, especially across borders. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC in the US have differing views on crypto as securities or commodities. This overlapping jurisdiction adds layers of complexity for innovation. Trustworthy industry voices, like Coinbase’s CEO, advocate clearer rules for fostering growth. Impact Of Regulations On Crypto Adoption I think regulations play a key role in mainstream crypto adoption. Clarity in rules encourages institutional investors while reducing market volatility. For example, US guidelines have attracted firms looking to legitimise crypto operations within a safe, regulated framework. However, excess restrictions could stifle innovation. Emerging economies rely on crypto for financial inclusion but risk exclusion due to heavy-handed policies. Striking the right balance can create trust, enabling more users to embrace crypto securely and confidently. Understanding Technological Innovations In Crypto Technological advances in the crypto space are reshaping the digital economy. I find it fascinating how these developments are addressing challenges like scalability and expanding possibilities for decentralised finance (DeFi) and blockchain networking. Emerging Cryptographic Protocols Cryptographic protocols ensure secure, efficient communication in blockchain systems. Zero-knowledge proofs, for example, let parties verify transactions without revealing sensitive data. Innovations in quantum-resistant algorithms are also emerging to counter future threats from quantum computing. Chainlink’s verifiable random function (VRF) stands out for generating tamper-proof randomness in blockchain processes. Role Of AI And Machine Learning In Crypto AI and machine learning are transforming crypto trading and security. Algorithms predict price trends, enabling data-driven decisions. I’ve seen machine learning help prevent fraud by detecting unusual transaction patterns. AI also optimises blockchain management by automating tasks like resource allocation. OpenAI’s insights on blockchain scalability showcase AI’s potential in improving decentralised networks. Advancements In Smart Contracts And DeFi Smart contracts have taken digital agreements to the next level. Platforms like Ethereum and Solana enable programmable agreements that execute automatically. DeFi boosts financial inclusion through innovations like yield farming and decentralised lending. High-level automation in protocols like Aave has impressed me with its efficiency in offering secure, accessible, and interest-based crypto loans. Social And Cultural Impacts Of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are reshaping societies and challenging cultural norms. They empower individuals, promote global inclusion, and redefine value exchange in the digital age. Democratising Finance For The Unbanked Cryptocurrencies open access to financial tools for people without bank accounts. Over 1.4 billion adults globally remain unbanked, according to the World Bank. With just an internet connection, anyone can send or receive money, borrow, or save. This fosters inclusion and economic participation. Blockchain-based microloans are transforming lives in developing countries. Platforms like Celo let users access lending markets without credit histories. This bypasses traditional institutions, offering hope to those once excluded. I see this as a powerful force for empowerment. The Influence Of Cryptocurrencies On Workforce Dynamics Cryptocurrencies are altering workforce structures by introducing borderless payments. Freelancers now secure payments in Bitcoin or Ethereum, cutting delays from traditional transfers. This flexibility encourages cross-border collaboration, especially for remote workers. Start-ups in the blockchain space are thriving. Many hire employees through token compensation schemes instead of salaries, aligning interests. I’ve noticed friends joining crypto firms because they value transparency and shared growth potential. It’s a revolutionary change. Crypto Communities And Global Collaboration Crypto communities unite people across countries, fostering innovation. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) like MakerDAO govern assets globally, enabling democratic participation. Leaders like Vitalik Buterin cite them as crypto’s cultural backbone. Social media amplifies collaboration among enthusiasts. Platforms like Twitter and Reddit host thriving crypto discussions. From coding to marketing ideas, these communities build ecosystems together. I feel inspired witnessing this collective, borderless teamwork grow. Challenges And Risks In The Crypto Economy The crypto economy has brought significant opportunities, but it isn’t without its challenges. From security issues to environmental concerns, these risks must be addressed to sustain its evolution. Addressing Security Threats And Fraud Security issues are a major worry in the crypto market. Crypto Ponzi schemes, ICO scams, and thefts often target inexperienced investors. I’ve seen friends fall victim to phishing attacks, losing their funds. Experts recommend using hardware wallets and two-factor authentication for protection. Transparency in transactions and blockchain tracking tools, like CipherTrace, can help authorities tackle money laundering and fraud effectively. Navigating Environmental Concerns Of Mining Crypto mining’s energy consumption harms the environment. Bitcoin alone uses more energy annually than some countries. I know developers shifting to Proof-of-Stake systems to reduce energy needs, like Ethereum did. Renewable energy sources could make mining sustainable. Reports suggest miners are exploring green solutions, cutting emissions in the process. Governments are also scrutinising environmental impacts to encourage eco-friendly crypto practices. Managing The Impact Of Market Saturation The growing number of cryptocurrencies has led to market saturation. Over 10,000 tokens now compete for investor attention, diluting value and confusing users. I’ve invested in lesser-known coins only to see poor returns. Experts often advise focusing on projects with strong use cases. Decentralised finance (DeFi) and established tokens offer better stability. Staying informed is key to avoiding unreliable or short-lived crypto projects. Conclusion: Navigating The Future Of The Digital Economy The crypto landscape is evolving at a breathtaking pace, reshaping how we perceive value, ownership, and financial systems. It’s clear that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology hold immense potential to drive transparency, inclusion, and innovation across industries. As we navigate this dynamic space, balancing technological advancements with regulatory clarity will be essential to unlocking its full potential. By embracing the opportunities while addressing the challenges, we can foster a digital economy that’s more equitable, efficient, and sustainable for everyone. The journey ahead is both exciting and complex, but with the right focus, the transformative power of cryptocurrency can truly redefine our global economy.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-26 23:59:59

For instance, the ONDO market cap has recently decreased by 12%, despite the initiative’s expansion into real-world asset tokenization with partners like Mastercard. Conversely, the cryptocurrency community has noted an Aptos (APT) price surge following Bitwise’s ETF application. Yet, perhaps the most captivating development is from BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its new Ambassador Program offers every blockchain enthusiast a chance at leadership, exclusive perks, and a firsthand experience of Web3 innovations. Given BlockDAG’s impressive growth—rising 2,380% in value—this program is seen as an opportunity to join one of the most promising ventures in the current market. Market Cap of Ondo Finance Falls Despite Forward-Looking Strategies At present, the ONDO market cap is about $3.25 billion, showing a 12% reduction over the last day. This decline comes in stark contrast to the company’s ambitious plans in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Ondo Finance has recently teamed up with Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN) to integrate its Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries Fund (OUSG). This collaboration marks a significant step toward the broader acceptance of tokenized assets. Despite recent price fluctuations, these strategic partnerships highlight Ondo’s dedication to merging conventional financial systems with decentralized technologies, setting up the ONDO market cap for potential future growth as more traditional assets become tokenized. Aptos (APT) Price Surge Following Bitwise’s ETF Proposal Aptos (APT) saw a significant price increase of about 12% on March 5, 2025, subsequent to Bitwise Asset Management’s application for a cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). This Aptos (APT) price surge signifies a growing institutional interest in this digital asset. The ETF intends to offer regulated access to APT, enhancing its appeal in the broader market. Prior to this move, Bitwise had established an Aptos trust in Delaware, indicating a strategy to enlarge its cryptocurrency investment options. The recent Aptos (APT) price surge mirrors the market’s optimistic reaction to these developments. Exploring BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program: A Path to Engagement and Rewards BlockDAG offers blockchain enthusiasts a unique opportunity to not just observe but actively influence the market. The Ambassador Program by BlockDAG goes beyond merely promoting the project—it’s a platform to gain firsthand Web3 experience, connect globally, and engage with the core team of the project. Participants in the program receive updates directly, attend workshops, and collaborate with peers who are equally passionate. To join, applicants simply complete an online form, and upon acceptance, can immediately start contributing. This initiative is central to fostering community engagement, which is vital to BlockDAG’s expansive goals. More than just participation, being an ambassador comes with tangible rewards. Participants earn BDAG coins, gain access to exclusive events, and receive unique merchandise. Active ambassadors can ascend to leadership roles, increasing their influence within the community and gaining prominence at significant blockchain events. With over $206 million gathered from the BlockDAG coin presale and BDAG’s price increase from $0.001 to $0.0248 through multiple batches, many regard this period as the best time to buy crypto. An expanding community enhances the project’s strength, pushing it toward a $600 million presale target. BlockDAG continues to progress rapidly. Having sold 18.8 billion BDAG and with projections of substantial returns for early participants, the success of the Ambassador Program is instrumental in this growth. As the ecosystem evolves, buying crypto now means joining a dynamic movement poised to make a significant impact. Final Thoughts on Ondo, Aptos & BlockDAG’s Future Which cryptocurrency stands out as the best to purchase? Ondo Finance is pushing forward with its strategy for tokenizing real-world assets, though the ONDO market cap fluctuates with market reactions to its latest initiatives. Meanwhile, the Aptos (APT) price surge after Bitwise’s ETF application highlights increasing institutional interest, though its future potential is still forming. BlockDAG distinguishes itself with considerable momentum. Its Ambassador Program offers more than community engagement—it’s a gateway to leadership, exclusive benefits, and early involvement in one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency projects.

Pseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse tells his 266,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks crypto is still bearish and the latest rally will probably lead to another leg down. According to the analyst, the current bounce has not changed the bearish market structure of crypto. “Bearish still on the high time frame until proven otherwise. I can’t see any reason why this isn’t a relief rally and markets won’t continue to suck the next few months. Chart is still broken.” Elaborating on his bearish stance on crypto, the trader says on the instant messaging platform Telegram that the downtrend will likely persist unless Bitcoin ( BTC ) flips a key price area into support. “I think we are at the part where the correction can be, as I said the other day, one that is more through time than through price. I will be looking at how FARTCOIN, HYPE, PEPE, ENA and BERA continue to trade. Being that it is a Bitcoin dominance macro trend, there is no reason to assume that changes, and any success in alts is going to come down to if BTC can turn this $90,000-$93,000 level into support.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $87,813.

The Avalanche (AVAX) price rally has picked up pace, with technical indicators and funding data hinting at more room to climb. At the same time, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has surged after a massive 1 billion token burn, reinforcing long-term efforts to reduce supply. But while both tokens ride current trends, one project is creating its own. BlockDAG (BDAG) has its Keynote 3 release set for March 28, and speculation is high—updates on exchange listings, new strategic partnerships, and even major rewards for early holders are expected. The Keynote 3 could be the mega event that cements BDAG as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Traders Eye Gains as Avalanche Price Rally Continues The Avalanche (AVAX) price rally showed continued strength on Monday, with the token climbing over 7% and trading above $21. Recent price action broke a descending trendline, and AVAX is now targeting resistance levels at $24.99 and potentially $30. On-chain indicators support the bullish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index is trending above 50, and a bullish MACD crossover appeared last week. Coinglass data further reinforces positive momentum, as AVAX’s long-to-short ratio hit 1.18—its highest in more than a month. As funding rates turn positive, the Avalanche (AVAX) price rally may still have room to run in the near term. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges Following 1B Token Burn The Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate saw a dramatic 8,470% increase after an anonymous wallet removed 1 billion SHIB tokens from circulation in a single transaction. Recorded by the community tracker Shibburn, this burn took place at 14:55 UTC and was valued at approximately $13,050. Etherscan data suggests the same wallet has conducted multiple similar burns, including two additional 1 billion SHIB transactions since August 2024. In total, over 1.004 billion SHIB were burned across 14 transactions within 24 hours. This sharp rise in the Shiba Inu burn rate reflects ongoing efforts to reduce supply and support long-term value. 2 Days Until BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Drops! Could This Be BDAG’s Plot Twist? BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 is almost here, and the excitement is hard to ignore. March 28 is shaping up to be a milestone moment. The project’s earlier keynotes already proved its flair for high-impact reveals—Keynote 1 lit up Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing, while Keynote 2 went viral for its unique, moon-themed video. Now, the third Keynote brings Hollywood-level production into the mix, raising expectations for something even bigger. Anticipation isn’t limited to visuals or theatrics—it’s tied directly to what this could unlock for the coin itself. Plenty of chatter surrounds what might drop. Some expect a confirmed mainnet launch date. Others are betting on centralised exchange listings or sizable rewards for early holders. These types of announcements often drive a shift in market perception—and with BDAG already up 2,380% since its presale began, the stakes feel higher than ever. Confidence in the project has grown steadily, and momentum continues to build as each presale batch sells out. For a growing number of analysts and crypto followers, BlockDAG is becoming a top crypto to buy in 2025 . Now priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, BDAG is attracting attention from both early adopters and latecomers. The limited window before Keynote 3 is creating urgency, not hype. As demand increases and supply tightens, the value proposition becomes harder to ignore. For holders, this moment marks a shift—from potential to pressure, from build-up to breakout. Final Takeaways The Avalanche price rally continues to hold market interest, especially as traders watch for a breakout above key resistance. Meanwhile, the sudden spike in the Shiba Inu burn rate has reignited talk about its deflationary model and long-term value prospects. But while both have their eyes on incremental gains, BlockDAG is staring down a potentially game-changing moment. Keynote 3 drops in just days, and the clock is ticking. If even half the rumors—such as updates on exchange listings, bigger partnerships, and exclusive holder rewards—prove true, BDAG’s $0.0248 price would quickly become a thing of the past as its value will jump. Among the top cryptos to buy in 2025, BDAG is racing ahead.

42451870,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=30115,1743033645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,The Future of Finance: How Crypto and Blockchain are Revolutionising the Financial World,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/the-future-of-finance-how-crypto-and-blockchain-are-revolutionising-the-financial-world/,"Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are revolutionising finance by enabling decentralised, secure, and transparent transactions without intermediaries. Blockchain’s key applications include facilitating cross-border payments, smart contracts, and decentralised finance (DeFi), which improve efficiency and reduce costs. Cryptocurrencies offer financial access to the unbanked, fostering global inclusion while also lowering transaction fees for individuals and businesses. Significant challenges to adoption include regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and public mistrust, though strides are being made to address these concerns. The future of finance includes mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, innovative blockchain advancements, and balanced regulations from governments and central banks. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and nowhere is this more evident than in finance. Over the past decade, crypto and blockchain have gone from niche concepts to transformative forces, reshaping how we think about money, transactions and trust. It’s incredible to see how these innovations are breaking barriers and creating opportunities that felt impossible just a few years ago. For me, what stands out most is the sense of empowerment these technologies bring. Blockchain’s transparency and decentralisation offer a refreshing alternative to traditional systems, while cryptocurrencies are opening doors to financial inclusion for millions. It’s not just about disrupting the old ways—it’s about building something better, more accessible and more secure. This evolution isn’t just exciting; it’s redefining the rules of the game, and I can’t wait to see where it takes us next. Understanding the Basics of Crypto and Blockchain Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have redefined how we think about financial systems. Their innovative features make them compelling tools for creating a decentralised and secure future. What Is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is digital money built on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies, it operates independently of governments or central banks. Bitcoin and Ethereum are popular examples. I find its transparency fascinating; every user can verify transactions, fostering trust in the system. How Does Blockchain Technology Work? Blockchain is a shared digital ledger that records transactions in blocks. Each block is linked to the previous one using cryptography, ensuring data can’t be altered. It’s efficient and secure. Developers I’ve spoken to praise its decentralised nature, which empowers users by removing intermediaries. Key Differences Between Traditional Finance and Blockchain Finance Traditional finance relies on centralised institutions, such as banks, to verify and process transactions. Blockchain finance eliminates middlemen by enabling peer-to-peer exchanges. It also operates 24/7, unlike banks with limited hours. I appreciate that it grants financial access globally, even to the unbanked. Exploring the Benefits of Cryptocurrency in Finance Enhanced Security and Transparency Cryptocurrency uses blockchain to secure transactions with immutable records. Each entry is tamper-proof, which builds trust in the system. Cryptographic techniques shield identities, reducing fraud risks. Public ledgers allow anyone to verify transactions, ensuring transparency. Lower Transaction Costs Crypto eliminates intermediaries like banks, cutting transaction fees. When I’ve sent payments abroad using Bitcoin, it was faster and cheaper than traditional methods. For small businesses, this is a game-changer. Blockchain’s efficiency means fewer charges for transfers, even across borders. Accessibility for the Unbanked Blockchain opens access to financial tools for the unbanked. People without traditional bank accounts can store, send, or receive funds via mobile wallets. I’ve seen how crypto empowers communities by offering global financial inclusion. It’s a step towards equal economic opportunities. Revolutionising Industries with Blockchain Technology Blockchain is reshaping industries with its transparency and efficiency. From cross-border payments to automation and decentralised finance (DeFi), its potential is vast. I’ve seen how it’s already transforming some sectors, and the future looks promising. Transforming Cross-Border Payments Blockchain is streamlining international transactions. I’ve noticed how blockchain eliminates intermediaries like SWIFT, cutting costs and delays. According to the World Bank, traditional cross-border remittance fees average 6.3%, but blockchain reduces them to nearly zero. Payments settle almost instantly, which is crucial for businesses and migrants supporting families abroad. Ripple, for instance, uses blockchain to connect banks, offering real-time global transactions. It’s a change I find incredible compared to dealing with outdated systems. Smart Contracts and Automation Smart contracts automate processes securely. These self-executing contracts reduce paperwork and eliminate disputes by enforcing terms automatically. Ethereum’s blockchain made smart contracts mainstream, and I’ve seen them in use for insurance claims, supply chains, and property deals. They save time and reduce human error. For example, companies like Slock.it use them to manage rental contracts efficiently. The potential for transparency and cost-cutting in industries is unmatched. It’s like having a neutral referee overseeing transactions. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and Its Applications DeFi is creating financial tools without banks. It enables borrowing, lending, and trading through blockchain-powered platforms. I’ve used platforms like Aave, which let users earn interest or secure loans within minutes. DeFi removes centralised control, making finance accessible to everyone. As reported by DeFi Pulse, this sector holds over £39 billion in assets, growing rapidly. Start-ups and individuals benefit from this new, trustless system. I believe DeFi could define future finance, making it fairer and more inclusive globally. Challenges Facing Crypto and Blockchain Adoption Crypto and blockchain are reshaping finance, but several obstacles slow widespread adoption. From regulatory uncertainties to concerns over scalability and trust, these challenges need solutions for full potential realisation. Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance Issues Undefined rules around cryptocurrencies make global operations tough. Countries label them differently, as securities, currencies, or commodities, leading to confusion. I’ve seen businesses hesitate to invest due to unclear legal landscapes. Regulatory clarity would boost confidence, as highlighted by leading financial experts. Scalability and Energy Concerns Blockchain struggles with processing speed, limiting use. Bitcoin handles 7 transactions per second compared to Visa’s 24,000. The energy use of proof-of-work systems also raises flags. My experience with Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake shows steps towards improving efficiency while reducing impact. Public Perception and Trust Barriers Mistrust in crypto stems from scams and market volatility. Many still link it to criminal activities despite advancements. When I first started using blockchain apps, scepticism from peers was common. Mainstream adoption requires transparency and education to break these barriers, as experts frequently suggest. Predictions for the Future of Crypto and Blockchain Blockchain and cryptocurrency are reshaping finance. I see their potential to drive innovation, boost global inclusion, and transform industries further. Here’s what’s next: Mainstream Adoption of Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies are becoming widely accepted by businesses and individuals. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) add an exciting dimension, even though they differ from decentralised crypto. Experts believe DeFi platforms and NFTs will continue accelerating adoption globally. Major companies like Tesla and PayPal already accept Bitcoin. This trend seems unstoppable as crypto payments become part of everyday life. I’ve noticed how small businesses in my circle are exploring crypto-friendly transactions, which signals a broader move towards its normalisation. New Innovations in Blockchain Technology Blockchain innovation isn’t slowing down. From scaling solutions like Ethereum’s Layer 2 updates to interoperability projects such as Polkadot, developers are creating efficient systems. These advancements might solve previous bottlenecks like high fees and slow networks. Its applications across voting systems, healthcare data storage, and supply chain transparency amaze me. Seeing energy-efficient consensus protocols like Proof of Stake rise gives hope for sustainable progress. Even friends in tech are excited about pioneering breakthroughs. The Role of Governments and Central Banks in Crypto Regulation Governments now realise crypto regulation is critical as adoption grows. China’s digital yuan and the European Central Bank’s digital euro are examples of how central banks shape future finance. Clear policies offering protection without stifling freedom can balance crypto evolution. Authorities will seek to prevent misuse without halting innovation. Conversations with legal experts reassure me that collaboration between regulators and crypto developers will define fair frameworks. It’s encouraging to see this dialogue narrowing the gap between control and innovation. Conclusion Crypto and blockchain have already begun reshaping the financial world, offering solutions that challenge traditional systems. Their potential to drive innovation, enhance inclusivity, and streamline processes is undeniable. While hurdles like regulation and scalability remain, these technologies are evolving rapidly, with promising advancements on the horizon. As adoption grows and more industries embrace decentralisation, the financial landscape will continue to transform. I believe the future of finance lies in finding the balance between innovation and regulation, unlocking opportunities for a fairer, more accessible global economy.

Buckle up, because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is gearing up for a series of crucial roundtables that could significantly shape the digital asset landscape. If you’re invested in cryptocurrencies, pay attention – this is information you absolutely need to know! What’s Happening with SEC Crypto Regulation? The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, a dedicated team focused on the burgeoning world of digital assets, has announced four pivotal industry roundtables. These aren’t just casual chats; they are structured discussions designed to gather insights and perspectives from industry experts, stakeholders, and the public. The aim? To better understand and ultimately regulate the rapidly evolving crypto space. Eleanor Terrett, a well-known name in financial journalism, broke the news on X, sparking immediate interest and anticipation within the crypto community. Why are Crypto Regulation Roundtables Important? Think of these roundtables as open forums where the SEC can directly engage with the crypto industry. This proactive approach is vital for several reasons: Direct Dialogue: It fosters direct communication between regulators and those being regulated. This two-way street allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and innovations within the crypto world. Informed Policy Making: By hearing directly from industry participants, the SEC can make more informed decisions when crafting regulations. This helps to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach that might stifle innovation. Transparency: Public roundtables offer a level of transparency, allowing the crypto community and the general public to understand the SEC’s concerns and the issues being discussed. Industry Input: These discussions provide a platform for the crypto industry to voice their concerns, challenges, and suggestions directly to the regulators. In essence, these roundtables are a critical step towards creating a regulatory framework that is both effective in protecting investors and conducive to innovation in the digital asset space. Breaking Down the Crypto Regulation Roundtable Schedule Let’s take a closer look at the schedule and the specific topics each roundtable will address: Date Topic Focus Area April 11 Crypto Trading Regulation and oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges, trading platforms, and market manipulation. April 25 Custody Secure storage and safeguarding of digital assets, addressing concerns around investor protection and asset security. May 12 Tokenization Legal and regulatory implications of tokenizing real-world assets, including securities laws and potential benefits and risks. June 6 DeFi’s Role in the U.S. Financial Landscape Examining the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, its impact on traditional finance, and potential regulatory approaches. Crypto Trading Roundtable: What’s on the Agenda? The first roundtable on April 11th will tackle crypto trading . This is a hot topic as the way cryptocurrencies are bought, sold, and exchanged is fundamental to the entire ecosystem. Expect discussions around: Exchange Regulation: Should crypto exchanges be regulated like traditional securities exchanges? What specific rules should apply? Market Manipulation: How can regulators combat market manipulation in the often volatile crypto markets? What tools and surveillance are needed?

This roundtable is crucial for setting the stage for fairer and more transparent crypto trading practices. Custody Roundtable: Securing Your Digital Assets Next up is the custody roundtable on April 25th. Crypto custody – the safe storage of digital assets – is a major concern for both institutional and retail investors. Key questions likely to be addressed include: Qualified Custodians: What standards should be required for entities holding large amounts of crypto assets? Should traditional financial institutions play a larger role in crypto custody ? Security Protocols: What are the best practices for securing digital assets against theft and hacking? How can regulatory frameworks encourage robust security measures? Liability and Insurance: Who is liable if custodied crypto assets are lost or stolen?

Tokenization has the potential to revolutionize various industries, and this roundtable is crucial for understanding its regulatory needs. DeFi Regulation Roundtable: Navigating the Decentralized Frontier Finally, on June 6th, the SEC will delve into DeFi regulation and DeFi’s role in the U.S. financial landscape . DeFi , or decentralized finance, is arguably the most disruptive force in the crypto space, aiming to recreate traditional financial services in a decentralized, permissionless manner. Expect discussions on: Regulatory Perimeter: How can regulators effectively oversee DeFi protocols and platforms given their decentralized nature? Where does regulation fit in a world without intermediaries? Smart Contract Risks: What are the risks associated with smart contracts that underpin DeFi ? How can vulnerabilities be addressed and investor protection ensured? Financial Stability: Could DeFi pose systemic risks to the broader financial system? What measures are needed to maintain financial stability in the face of DeFi growth?

Mind of Pepe and Arctic Pablo Coin are two meme coins that have captured attention with their unique concepts. Mind of Pepe combines AI integration with meme culture, offering automated insights through its self-evolving agent. Arctic Pablo Coin takes a storytelling approach, weaving an adventurous narrative into its presale phases while providing staking opportunities. Yet, among these, Dragoin ($DDGN) truly stands out by going beyond mere concepts. With practical features like Play-to-Earn gaming, staking, and a deflationary burn mechanism, Dragoin delivers real value, making it a sensible early investment in the meme coin market. Mind of Pepe: Revolutionizing Meme Coins with AI Integration Mind of Pepe ($MIND) launched its presale on January 13, 2025, introducing an innovative blend of meme culture and artificial intelligence. Specifically, this Ethereum-based token features a self-evolving AI agent designed to analyze real-time crypto market data, engage with social media platforms, and provide strategic insights to its community. Furthermore, the presale consists of 70 stages, starting at a price of $0.00310100 in Stage 1 and incrementally increasing to $0.00382150 by Stage 70. Consequently, the project quickly gained traction, raising over $3.5 million within two days of the presale launch. By February 14, 2025, MIND of Pepe had already surpassed the $6 million milestone, reflecting strong investor interest. In terms of allocation, the token distribution includes 25% for AI agent development, 30% for project growth, 20% for marketing, 15% for rewards, and 10% for exchange listings. Therefore, this strategic distribution aims to enhance the token’s utility and value over time. Arctic Pablo Coin: An Adventurous Narrative with High-Yield Potential Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) distinguishes itself through a narrative-driven presale, following the fictional journey of Arctic Pablo, an explorer uncovering hidden treasures. Notably, each presale phase represents a unique location in Pablo’s adventure, adding an immersive element to the investment experience. As of March 25, 2025, the presale has reached its 16th phase, “Crystal Cove,” with the token priced at $0.000083. As a result, the project has raised over $2 million to date, indicating robust community support. Moreover, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale, reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Additionally, investors can participate in a staking program offering a 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), with staked coins vested for a two-month period from the launch date. Significantly, the projected listing price is $0.008, suggesting a potential return on investment of approximately 9,552.41% from the current phase to the listing. Redefining Meme Coins: Dragoin’s Practical Utility Sets It Apart Dragoin ($DDGN) breaks the mold of typical meme coins by offering real-world utility and meaningful community involvement. Unlike many meme coins that thrive solely on hype, Dragoin brings practical features that give it lasting value and purpose. One standout aspect of Dragoin is its Play-to-Earn gaming platform, where users control their own dragons, take on challenges, and earn $DDGN tokens. As a result, this gaming ecosystem isn’t just for fun—it creates a continuous incentive for users to engage and hold tokens, driving demand and strengthening the community. In addition, Dragoin’s staking capability allows holders to lock their tokens and earn rewards. This not only encourages long-term investment but also reduces the circulating supply, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. Furthermore, Dragoin’s commitment to decentralization is evident in its governance model. With a renounced smart contract, no single entity holds control, promoting transparency and community trust. Moreover, one of Dragoin’s most strategic moves is its burn mechanism, where unsold tokens from the presale are permanently removed from circulation. As a result, this scarcity model directly supports price stability and creates an urgency for early investment. Consequently, investors seeking more than just short-lived hype will find Dragoin’s blend of utility and community focus appealing. By prioritizing long-term value and real user engagement, Dragoin makes a solid case as a smart early investment. It’s not just about holding a coin—it’s about being part of an ecosystem that rewards active participation and community trust. The Future of Meme Coins Lies in Practical Utility As meme coins continue to evolve, the focus is shifting from mere hype to genuine utility. Mind of Pepe and Arctic Pablo Coin both offer unique concepts that set them apart from traditional meme coins. Mind of Pepe leverages AI-driven insights, while Arctic Pablo Coin blends storytelling with staking opportunities. However, Dragoin ($DDGN) takes it a step further by integrating real-world value through Play-to-Earn gaming, secure staking, and a robust burn mechanism that drives scarcity. This thoughtful approach not only enhances user engagement but also makes Dragoin a more sustainable choice in the meme coin space.

The firm suggests that the market has not yet decided whether Bitcoin will break out from these levels or be rejected. MakroVision also raises a broader question about Bitcoin’s position in the overall market cycle. “Are we still in a bull market or have we entered a transition phase?” the firm asked in its latest market update. Its main reports examine macroeconomic correlations, historical patterns, and potential scenarios for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.

However, although the 24-hour change saw the coin pump over 10%, analysts say the setup does not look like it could take the coin higher. This is because investors' confidence is still low from the bearish hit that dropped the price below a 5-month low. But with the rising number of investors in the crypto market in the last few months, if the Dogecoin price does not reflect a long-term surge, where is the money going? Why The Dogecoin Price Is Seeing A Growth Delay While Dogecoin remains the biggest meme coin in the world, its price action in the last few months has not been impressive. Many analysts have tried to analyze why Dogecoin's price has continued to find new lows. Still, the only logical conclusion has been that investors are losing confidence in the coin. One of the top factors that drove the Dogecoin price to its ATH in 2021 is the Elon Musk Influence and its many promises. However, while there were different sentiments and speculations, the promise to add Dogecoin as a payment option for Tesla effectively drove the price higher. Four years after the Dogecoin price ATH of $0.7375, the price continues to struggle under $0.4850. The recent 10% price surge increased the coin from a $0.1847 low. This has continued to cast a shadow on the future of the Dogecoin price, causing a sharp drop in investors' interest. Analysts still believe the Dogecoin price could recover with some significant change to the ecosystem; for example, the final implementation as a Tesla payment method could add more strength to investors' confidence.

Leading crypto exchange TruBit has announced a groundbreaking partnership with DeFi lending protocol Morpho. This collaboration is set to introduce a novel DeFi earn product, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) usability and the innovative world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Are you ready to explore how this powerful alliance could reshape crypto earning opportunities in the region? What is DeFi Earn and Why is it a Game Changer? DeFi Earn , at its core, refers to earning yield or interest on your cryptocurrency holdings through decentralized finance protocols.

This new offering from TruBit and Morpho aims to simplify access to these complex DeFi mechanisms, making it user-friendly even for those new to the crypto space. Here’s why DeFi earn is creating waves: Higher Yield Potential: DeFi platforms often offer significantly higher annual percentage yields (APYs) compared to traditional savings or fixed deposits. Transparency and Control: Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, offering transparency. Users typically retain control of their assets in non-custodial wallets. Financial Inclusion: DeFi can provide access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked populations, particularly relevant in regions like Latin America. Innovation and Growth: The DeFi space is constantly evolving, with new protocols and earning strategies emerging regularly.

For those keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency and tech landscape, understanding where major players are placing their bets is crucial. And here’s a fascinating development: Amazon’s Alexa Fund, initially focused on voice technology, is now making a bold pivot towards the booming field of AI startups . This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a significant expansion signaling where Amazon sees the future of tech heading. Let’s dive into what this exciting shift means for the AI ecosystem and beyond. Why is Amazon’s Alexa Fund Now Targeting AI Startups? Launched in 2015, the Alexa Fund was originally conceived to fuel innovation in voice-first technologies, aligning perfectly with the rise of Alexa and voice assistants. However, the tech world doesn’t stand still. The monumental advancements in large language models and generative AI have created a paradigm shift. Amazon, recognizing this transformative wave, is strategically repositioning the Alexa Fund to capitalize on this new frontier. With Amazon itself launching Gen AI-powered Alexa+ and a suite of multimodal AI models, it’s a natural progression for their investment arm to follow suit. Paul Bernard, the leader of the Alexa Fund , articulated this evolution in a recent blog post. He explained that while the Fund’s core mission has always been about pushing technological boundaries, the “rapid developments in AI present an inflection point”. This inflection point allows the Fund to embrace cutting-edge AI investment while staying true to its original goal of fostering innovation. The Fund is now actively seeking to invest in startups that are pioneering: AI-enabled Hardware : The next generation of devices infused with artificial intelligence. Smart Agents : Intelligent assistants that go beyond voice commands, anticipating user needs and acting proactively. Generative Media : Startups creating novel forms of content using AI. Emerging AI Architectures : Companies developing the foundational technologies that will power future AI breakthroughs. To get a clearer picture of this evolving strategy, Bitcoin World had an exclusive conversation with Paul Bernard, diving deep into the renewed mission and recent investments of the Alexa Fund . What Kind of AI Startups is the Alexa Fund Investing In? The Alexa Fund isn’t just talking the talk; they’re walking the walk with concrete investments in promising AI startups . Recently, they’ve added four new companies to their portfolio, each tackling unique challenges and opportunities within the AI space: NinjaTech AI : Imagine an AI Swiss Army knife. NinjaTech AI is developing an all-encompassing AI platform. Their chatbot is not just about text; it can generate code, conjure images and videos, conduct in-depth research, and even manage your schedule. Think of it as a supercharged AI assistant, similar to Quora’s Poe, offering access to a range of powerful models from OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, Google, and Deepseek. Notably, Amazon highlights that NinjaTech AI’s infrastructure is built on AWS, showcasing synergy within the Amazon ecosystem. Hedra : For the creatives out there, Hedra is an AI media company that’s making waves in content generation. Their studio empowers users to create stunning visuals, audio, and video using AI . With the recent launch of Character-3 AI , Hedra is pushing the boundaries of AI -driven content creation. Having already secured $10 million in funding last year from prominent investors like a16z Games Speedrun, Abstract, and Index Ventures, Hedra is a startup to watch. Ario : Balancing family life can be chaotic. Ario steps in as an AI -powered family management app designed to bring order to scheduling and task management. One of its standout features is a “school email decoder” that intelligently extracts events and action items from school communications. Paul Bernard from the Alexa Fund praised Ario’s ability to understand the personal context behind tasks, a crucial element for effective family organization. While other startups like Hearth Display and Maple are also tackling family schedule management, Ario’s AI -driven approach offers a fresh perspective. HeyBoss : If you’re online in tech circles, you’ve likely encountered the buzz around “vibe coding.” HeyBoss is a startup firmly in this space, enabling users to create websites, apps, games, and prototypes simply by describing their vision. This low-code/no-code approach is gaining momentum, with companies like Cursor, Lovable, Replit, and Bolt.new also innovating in this area. HeyBoss democratizes development, making it accessible to a wider range of creators. What are the Strategic Benefits for Amazon? For Amazon, AI investment in these startups isn’t purely altruistic; it’s a strategic move with multiple layers of benefits. These startups become invaluable proving grounds for Amazon’s extensive cloud and AI stack. Many gain early access to private APIs and SDKs, essentially becoming living laboratories for Amazon’s technologies. Furthermore, Amazon provides these startups with access to senior executives and opportunities within Amazon Business, fostering a symbiotic relationship. This strategy mirrors a broader trend in the tech industry. Major players in AI are actively funding promising startups to expand their ecosystems and drive innovation. OpenAI’s startup fund, for example, has backed numerous ventures across healthcare, robotics, edtech, and creative tools. Anthropic has partnered with Menlo Ventures to create an investment vehicle, and Google has recently invested in companies like Glance and Toonsutra, offering them access to their AI models. The Future of AI Investment and Innovation Amazon’s redoubled focus on AI startups through the Alexa Fund is a clear indicator of the immense potential and transformative power of artificial intelligence. By strategically funding and nurturing these early-stage companies, Amazon is not only expanding its own ecosystem but also contributing to the broader advancement of AI technologies. This wave of AI investment from tech giants signals a dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape, promising exciting innovations and applications in the years to come. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the underlying technologies driving AI , such as decentralized computing and data management, may find increasing synergy and relevance as AI continues its exponential growth. The convergence of AI and blockchain could unlock entirely new paradigms, and Amazon’s proactive stance in AI investment positions them at the forefront of this technological revolution.

When incidents occur, how platforms respond can significantly impact user confidence and the future of the ecosystem. Recently, Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX), faced a challenging situation involving its JELLY perpetual futures market. Following evidence of suspicious market activity, Hyperliquid made a decisive move: delisting JELLY and, more importantly, pledging to compensate affected users. This article dives deep into the Hyperliquid compensation plan, the details surrounding the JELLY incident, and what it all means for the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Happened with the JELLY Incident on Hyperliquid? To understand the gravity of Hyperliquid’s decision, let’s break down the sequence of events that led to the JELLY incident : * Suspicious Activity Detected : Hyperliquid’s monitoring systems flagged unusual trading patterns in the JELLY perpetual futures market. * Massive Short Position: A trader opened an extraordinarily large short position of 430 million JELLY tokens. This is a highly leveraged bet that the price of JELLY would decrease significantly. * Liquidation and Margin Withdrawal: The trader strategically liquidated a smaller portion (30 million JELLY) of their position, seemingly to manipulate the market and then withdrew a substantial margin of 2.76 million USDC. * Forced Liquidation: This initial activity triggered a cascading effect, leading to the liquidation of a massive 398 million JELLY tokens from other traders’ positions. * Price Skyrocket & Losses: As the market reacted, the price of JELLY unexpectedly surged. This price spike caused significant unrealized losses on the Hyperliquid liquidation address, exceeding $10 million. * Liquidation at Profit: Interestingly, the Hyperliquid liquidation address managed to close out the JELLY short position at $0.0095, ultimately making a profit of around $700,000 despite the earlier losses. This suggests a complex and potentially manipulative trading strategy was at play. This chain of events highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets and the potential for sophisticated trading strategies to exploit vulnerabilities, even on advanced platforms like Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid’s Response: Prioritizing User Compensation In the wake of the JELLY incident , Hyperliquid’s response has been swift and user-centric. Here’s a look at their key actions: * Immediate Delisting: Recognizing the ongoing risks and potential for further manipulation, Hyperliquid acted decisively by delisting the JELLY perpetual futures market. This was done through a validator vote, showcasing a degree of on-chain governance. * Investigation and Transparency: Hyperliquid launched an investigation into the suspicious market activity to understand the full extent of the manipulation and identify the responsible parties. * Commitment to Compensation: Crucially, Hyperliquid announced its commitment to compensate users who suffered losses due to the incident, excluding those involved in the suspicious activity. This pledge is a significant step towards restoring user trust. * Hyper Foundation Backing: The compensation will be provided by the Hyper Foundation, indicating a strong financial backing and commitment to making users whole. * Details to Follow: Hyperliquid has promised to release further details on the compensation method soon, assuring users that a fair and equitable process will be implemented. This proactive approach to Hyperliquid compensation demonstrates a commitment to user protection that is crucial for the long-term health and credibility of DeFi platforms. Addressing Crypto Exchange Centralization Concerns The JELLY incident has reignited discussions around crypto exchange centralization , even within the DeFi space. While Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange, certain aspects of its operation have come under scrutiny: * Validator Vote for Delisting: The decision to delist JELLY through a validator vote, while showcasing on-chain governance, also raises questions about the level of centralization within the validator set and their influence on market decisions. Is this truly decentralized if a small group can make such impactful changes? * Risk Management and Monitoring: While Hyperliquid detected the suspicious activity, questions arise about the effectiveness of risk management systems in preventing such incidents in the first place. Can DeFi platforms be truly resilient against sophisticated market manipulation tactics? * Transparency of Operations: Critics argue that more transparency is needed regarding Hyperliquid’s operational processes, including its risk management protocols and the decision-making processes of its validators. Greater transparency can foster trust and allow users to better assess the risks involved. These concerns are not unique to Hyperliquid but are pertinent to the broader DeFi ecosystem. The balance between decentralization, efficiency, and security remains a critical challenge. DeFi Risk Management: Lessons from the JELLY Incident The JELLY incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent DeFi risk management challenges in decentralized finance. Here are some key takeaways: * Market Manipulation is a Real Threat: Even in supposedly decentralized environments, sophisticated actors can attempt to manipulate markets for their gain. Robust monitoring and risk management systems are essential. * Liquidity and Volatility: The incident highlights the interplay between liquidity and volatility in crypto markets. Low liquidity pairs can be particularly susceptible to manipulation, and rapid price swings can amplify losses. * Importance of Audits and Security: While not directly related to smart contract vulnerabilities in this case, the incident underscores the ongoing need for rigorous audits and security measures to protect DeFi platforms and users. * User Education is Crucial: Users need to be aware of the risks associated with trading volatile and less liquid assets, and understand the mechanics of leverage and liquidation. * Platform Responsibility: DeFi platforms have a responsibility to implement robust risk management systems, provide transparent information, and act decisively to protect users when incidents occur, as Hyperliquid is demonstrating with its compensation plan. Rebuilding User Trust in DeFi Incidents like the JELLY situation can erode user trust in DeFi platforms. Hyperliquid’s proactive approach to Hyperliquid compensation is a vital step in rebuilding that trust. Here’s why their response is important for fostering user confidence: * Demonstrates Accountability: By taking responsibility and offering compensation, Hyperliquid shows that it values its users and is accountable for events on its platform, even when caused by external actors. * Sets a Precedent: This action sets a positive precedent for other DeFi platforms facing similar challenges. It signals that user protection should be a top priority. * Encourages Responsible Platform Behavior: Knowing that they may be held responsible for user losses due to market manipulation incentivizes platforms to invest in better security and risk management. * Strengthens DeFi’s Reputation: By addressing issues transparently and fairly, the DeFi sector as a whole can build a stronger reputation for reliability and user-centricity. owever, rebuilding user trust is an ongoing process. Hyperliquid needs to follow through on its compensation promise and provide clear details on the process. Furthermore, continued efforts to enhance security, transparency, and risk management are essential for the entire DeFi space to thrive. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users What can crypto users learn from the JELLY incident and Hyperliquid’s response? * Diversify Your Holdings: Avoid concentrating your portfolio in highly volatile or low-liquidity assets. Diversification can mitigate risk. * Understand Leverage and Risk: If you trade leveraged products, fully understand the risks of liquidation and potential losses. Use leverage responsibly. * Choose Platforms Wisely: Research DeFi platforms thoroughly. Look for platforms with robust security measures, transparent risk management practices, and a track record of user support. * Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments in the crypto space. Understanding market dynamics and platform responses to incidents can help you make informed decisions. * Engage with Communities: Participate in platform communities and discussions. Sharing information and experiences can help identify potential risks and best practices. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users Conclusion: A Critical Moment for Hyperliquid and DeFi The Hyperliquid compensation plan in response to the JELLY incident is a significant development. It showcases a commitment to user protection and a willingness to address the challenges inherent in decentralized finance. While questions about crypto exchange centralization and DeFi risk management remain, Hyperliquid’s decisive action provides a glimmer of hope and a potential roadmap for other platforms facing similar crises. The success of the compensation process and Hyperliquid’s ongoing efforts to enhance security and transparency will be crucial in determining whether this incident ultimately strengthens or weakens user trust in the platform and the broader DeFi ecosystem. This is a critical moment for Hyperliquid and a valuable learning opportunity for the entire crypto space.

BNB Chain introduced a $100 million liquidity fund with the aim to increase decentralized finance capabilities and attract users back through the platform. Investors now focus on Remittix because they consider it to be the contemporary implementation of XRP. Through its $0.0734 pre-sale phase Remittix earned $14.1 million as it pursued remittances as its core business following the goal of cutting down worldwide fees affecting millions of people. This part reveals the growing strength of Solana alongside BNB Chain and Remittix in this time period. Solana’s Price Prediction on Speed and Ecosystem Expansion Solana initiated a rapid cost increase which aggregated to nearly $145 while maintaining a $4 trillion daily transaction volume. Solana has become a magnet for developers building DeFi and NFT projects because of its feature of quick settlements coupled with low fees. Social activity on the network now runs against the initial network problems that caused diminishing support. Rapid increase of Solana: Coingecko The aggregator data suggests users are partially returning to network functions although intermittent performance setbacks remain potential risks according to critics statements. The Solana price prediction depends on a loyal user base if they continue steady performance which will enable them to take some market share back from competing chains. The rally potential of institutional participants remains unclear since their new disclaimers could limit further price increases until DeFi usage expands. The future success of Solana's dominance depends on continuous positive data reports from aggregator sources regarding DeFi transactions. BNB Chain Launches $100M Liquidity Boost The Binance chain's $100 million liquidity program serves to intensify DeFi dApps because stakeholders feared user adoption growth was slowing down. The network has managed success because of low transaction fees and big exchange user counts yet its connection to centralized systems creates potential regulatory issues. Binance demonstrates their commitment to maintain BNB as a top network choice through this new funding initiative despite existing competitor networks recorded in aggregator data . Efficient dApp adoption and stable yield generation through this program could help BNB Chain match the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies. Some investors experience regulatory concerns that threaten their investments because the chain needs to establish clear protocols for this liquidity strategy to sustain a substantial price increase. Why Investors Are Flocking to Remittix, the “New XRP” New XRP nowadays typically references Remittix (RTX) because market participants have shifted their attention from Solana price prediction and BNB coverage. Through its successful presale funds of $14 million at $0.0734 Remittix provides PayFi solutions for the remittance services operating in the $190 trillion market. Remittix connects with DeFi users while drawing both unbanked families and unbanked people and freelancers through its speedy cost-effective swapping system. The initiative diverges from common superficial or failing development methods which neglect real cost-saving solutions. Expert opinions conclude that agent partnerships alongside user-pleasing applications and appropriate licensing must exist for attracting mainstream customers. Remittix financial advantages extend to every demographic group thus luring both institutional investors along with regular holders to the platform. In order to protect new crypto tokens from rug pulls a three-year liquidity lock combined with renounced post-presale contracts should be applied. Analysis indicates that the future success of Remittix depends on maintaining evidence of rising user interest from aggregator sources because experts believe the coin demonstrates better promise through fast problem-solving aimed at real user needs. Those intrigued can review the presale at Remittix and track official updates at Linktree . Practical Solutions vs. Legacy Networks: The Battle for Relevance Solana’s rocket-like price prediction and BNB Chain’s $100 million liquidity program emphasize altcoins striving for user growth and DeFi relevance.The market considers Remittix to be a fresh variant of XRP because its simple solution for daily financial transfer meets the requirements of international customers who currently face expensive wire transfer charges. The three methods provide separate benefits with Solana enhancing dApp operation while BNB allocates funds for DeFi liquidity growth and Remittix delivers direct payment reductions for wires. The market demonstrates its categorical preference for utility-driven coins combined with steady user attraction yet no project bears an absolute guarantee of success. Real financial integration could make Remittix surpass older cross-border solutions because of the failing hype-based ventures. The success of Remittix in local currency solutions could establish ""New XRP"" status which sets the platform for future bull runs in 2025.

The remaining 6.4% said they weren’t sure, the report stated. Percentage of trust that Argentines have in Milei after the Libra scandal. Source: Zuban Córdoba This was the first time the question was asked within a Zuban Córdoba poll. However, several other metrics, such as Milei’s image and the national management approval rating, have plummeted considerably in recent months. The latter of those metrics, for example, fell from 47.3% in November to 41.6% in March. “Fifty-eight percent disapprove of Javier Milei’s management. Negativity increases slowly but steadily and seems to find no ceiling,” Zuban Córdoba said. “The change in tone and evaluation of the government is consolidating as more and more problematic fronts appear on the political agenda.” Zuban Córdoba conducted its study between March 12 and March 14, and the sample size of 1,600 participants had a confidence level of 95% and a sampling error of 2.45%. Another survey from the University of San Andrés conducted between March 11-20 with 1,020 respondents found that Milei’s approval rating dropped to 45%. However, not all polls paint the same picture of President Milei. Data collected from Morning Consult between Feb. 27 and March 5 indicates that Milei still possessed a 62.4% approval rating after the Libra scandal. Related: LIBRA memecoin orchestrators named as defendants in US class-action suit Milei has distanced himself from Libra since the scandal, arguing he didn’t “promote” the LIBRA token in a controversial Feb. 14 X post — as fraud lawsuits filed against him allege — and instead merely “spread the word” about it. The Libra (LIBRA) token soared to a $4.6 billion market cap shortly after Milei’s X post before tanking nearly 94% over the next few hours. Argentina’s opposition party called for Milei’s impeachment but has had limited success thus far. President Milei’s party still in lead as election looms The controversy comes as the next Argentine election is set to take place on Oct. 26. Despite the negative results, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party is still most likely to take out the next Argentine election, with 36.7% in favor of the libertarian party, while Unión por la Patria comes in next at 32.5%. However, only 43% of Argentine respondents believe that Milei — an economist prior to taking office — has sufficiently controlled inflation, while 63% of those polled oppose Milei’s efforts to secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund.

XRP, currently priced at $2.39, is set for a 300% rally to $7.17, driven by increasing adoption in cross-border payments. Cardano (ADA), now at $0.71. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding strong bullish momentum, positioning itself as top performers for explosive growth in the coming months. The project is in phase 3 of its presale priced at $0.02. Over 80% of the presale has been sold out meaning it won’t stay long before it concludes. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $4.9 million with over 6900 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 4, the price will jump 25% to $0.025. MUTM could be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. Ripple and Cardano: Strong Performers for 2025’s Bull Run The price of Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) is set to jump substantially by 2025 because growing organizations worldwide are adopting their systems as well as broadening their ecosystems. XRP is expected to climb 300% to achieve a value of $7.17 in the next few years because its capabilities in international transactions will drive its growing influence in financial services. Continued network upgrades and expanding DeFi applications drive Cardano (ADA) toward a 5x price jump from its current value of $0.71 until it reaches $4. These undertakings host solid base fundamentals that lead to practical use cases because they create strong investment options for the long term. The crypto market watches Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as analysts expect explosive growth due to its rising market presence alongside two other dominant altcoins. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A Secure and Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance establishes its security foundation through the launch of an entirely collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization requirement in this model eliminates volatility risks that break algorithmic stablecoins due to their instability. The platform establishes investor confidence by employing multiple auditing activities on smart contracts together with financially transparent systems to repair DeFi lending platform vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance emphasizes sustainability and security thus establishing itself as an excellent option for investors making long-term decisions. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives The initial supporters of Mutuum Finance can benefit from multiple enticing rewards which offer both generous giveaways of $100,000 awarded through $10,000 MUTM token distributions to ten winners alongside a referral program that rewards its users for new investor acquisitions. The referral system of Mutuum Finance motivates users to recruit new investors while providing rewards to these referrals. Users who join early receive privileged access to future staking pools and they obtain governance privileges while receiving first access to platform upgrade updates. The incentives provided by Mutuum Finance motivate users to join initially while developing better long-term retention of token holders. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as a DeFi leader, with $4.8 million raised and 6,600+ investors onboard. Its hybrid lending model and strong fundamentals set it up for explosive growth. With a 200% return potential, the presale is selling out fast. Don’t miss out join now before prices rise.

According to crypto analyst (basictradingtv), the meme coin is playing out a trend of rounding bottom patterns and parabolic rallies, which have always sent its price to all-time highs. The current setup suggests that Dogecoin’s ongoing recovery from its March low may not just be a temporary bounce, but there’s a 100% chance it is the beginning of a much larger parabolic rally. Dogecoin Trading In A Familiar Cycle: 100% Chance Of Rally At the core of the bullish forecast is the recurrence of a well-known price pattern, the rounding bottom. Dogecoin is known for trading in multi-year cycles that start with a gradual bottoming formation, eventually leading to explosive rallies. This pattern, visible on longer-term charts, has formed again over the past several months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Activity Levels Crash To 4-Month Lows, Does This Spell Doom For The Meme Coin? As shown in the monthly candlestick timeframe chart below, the rounding bottom played out during the time period between Dogecoin’s all-time high in 2021, the bear market in 2022, and the recovery phase in late 2024. The recovery led to Dogecoin pushing to new highs since 2021, which was probably the start of the parabolic rally phase. However, this time around, the anticipated parabolic rally was temporarily interrupted by a strong resistance zone. After reaching highs around $0.48 in December 2024, Dogecoin saw a rejection that has seen its price going on a correction path until it reached $0.1477 in early March. But rather than breaking below, this level acted as a solid support. Since then, the price rebounded slightly and has recovered to $0.2 at the time of writing. With this in mind, the analyst predicted that the bullish cycle is intact, with the parabolic leg of the pattern expected to unfold anytime soon. Monthly Candle Needs To Close Above Support Right now, the most important step is for Dogecoin to close its monthly candlestick for March above the key support level established during the recent market correction. If this is successful, it will certify 100% that a bullish parabolic rally will follow. The analyst also pointed out two important levels for Dogecoin in the coming weeks and months: $0.15 and $0.5. The $0.15 level was tested during Dogecoin’s sharp pullback earlier this month, when the price dipped to as low as $0.1477. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters Order Block Zone That Could Trigger Rally To ATHs $0.15 now acts as the support level that should not be broken. The longer Dogecoin tests this support level, the longer the delay for the parabolic rally. Fortunately, the recovery from that zone has added technical strength to the argument that buyers are going to step in at that level. Meanwhile, $0.5 is identified as the primary resistance target ahead. Breaking through that resistance will confirm the start of a full-fledged parabolic rally, similar to the one that sent Dogecoin to its all-time high in 2021. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2052, up by 10.8% in the past 24 hours.

BTC Bull Token and Best Wallet Token have both managed to capture attention with their unique approaches. BTC Bull Token offers rewards based on Bitcoin milestones, while Best Wallet Token integrates practical utility within a multi-asset management platform. Yet, it’s Dragoin that truly stands out by blending gaming and crypto in a way that feels natural and rewarding. With its Telegram mini-game, Dragoin doesn’t just promise returns—it lets players earn tokens through immersive gameplay. BTC Bull Token: Riding the Bitcoin Wave BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) launched in early 2025, aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s success. Notably, the token’s primary attraction is its innovative mechanism: holders receive Bitcoin airdrops when BTC reaches specific price milestones, with the first reward set at $150,000. Consequently, this unique approach attracted significant investor interest, raising over $4 million during its presale phase. Starting at a presale price of $0.002425, BTCBULL has experienced impressive growth as Bitcoin recently surged to $87,000. Furthermore, token burns at various price points also reduce the supply, creating potential for increased value. As a result, the community-driven nature and the excitement around Bitcoin’s future prospects have fueled the token’s popularity. Therefore, early investors have already seen their holdings appreciate significantly, with projections indicating further gains as Bitcoin climbs higher. Best Wallet Token: Empowering Crypto Management Best Wallet Token ($BEST) launched in 2023 as the native utility token for the Best Wallet ecosystem, which facilitates seamless management of digital assets across multiple blockchains. Notably, with features like reduced transaction fees, staking rewards, and early access to token presales, $BEST quickly became popular, attracting over 250,000 active users. Moreover, the presale raised more than $11.3 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Initially priced at $0.0225, $BEST has appreciated to $0.02445 as of March 26, 2025, marking an 8.67% increase. Additionally, the token’s success is driven by its integration within the Best Wallet app, which supports thousands of cryptocurrencies, making it one of the most versatile wallets available. Dragoin’s Telegram Mini-Game Pays Investors to Play Dragoin’s Telegram mini-game is more than just entertainment—it’s an opportunity to boost your token holdings while having fun. Specifically designed with both casual and dedicated gamers in mind, the game combines excitement with real rewards, making it a favorite among Dragoin investors. As players control their own dragon, they take on challenges and missions that keep them engaged while earning $DDGN tokens as they progress. Whether you’re aiming to build a strong token reserve or simply enjoy gaming, the mini-game offers a perfect blend of strategy and enjoyment. From the moment Dragoin hit the scene, it promised more than just another meme coin—it aimed to build a community that’s both engaged and rewarded. In fact, the mini-game is at the heart of that vision. Notably, what sets it apart is its instant reward system. Unlike typical investments, where returns take time, players can start multiplying their tokens right after joining. Consequently, as Dragoin’s value continues to grow, these earned tokens become even more valuable, giving early adopters an edge. For presale buyers, the game is an especially enticing feature. Instead of just holding onto tokens and waiting for market movements, players can actively increase their holdings by participating in this interactive experience. Furthermore, the sense of accomplishment that comes with earning tokens through skillful gameplay makes the process not only rewarding but genuinely enjoyable. Ultimately, Dragoin has made it clear—being part of its community means more than just holding coins. It means playing, earning, and thriving together. Play, Earn, and Thrive: The Future of Crypto Engagement Crypto investors are no longer content with passive holding—they want interactive experiences and tangible rewards. BTC Bull Token brings a strategic approach with its Bitcoin milestone airdrops, while Best Wallet Token enhances asset management with practical features. However, Dragoin takes things to the next level by turning token earning into a gamified adventure. Its Telegram mini-game allows users to grow their holdings while actively enjoying a fantasy-inspired experience. This engaging approach makes Dragoin more than just a meme coin—it’s a dynamic community space where gameplay meets real financial opportunity.

You’re not alone. Deepfakes are no longer just a futuristic worry; they’re a present danger, costing companies millions and posing serious national security risks. But there’s a beacon of hope in the fight against this emerging threat: GetReal. This startup, armed with $18 million in funding and a client list that speaks volumes, claims to have cracked the code on AI deepfakes . Let’s dive into how GetReal is revolutionizing deepfake detection and safeguarding our digital world. Funding Fuels the Fight Against AI Deepfakes GetReal, co-founded by Dr. Hany Farid, a pioneer in deepfake detection technology, has successfully raised $17.5 million in Series A equity funding. This significant investment, led by Forgepoint Capital, with participation from Ballistic Ventures, Evolution Equity, and K2 Access Fund, will propel GetReal’s research and development, expand its team, and accelerate business development. This financial backing underscores the urgency and importance of addressing the growing threat of AI deepfakes . The funding coincides with the launch of GetReal’s groundbreaking forensics platform as a service. This platform offers: Web Interface: User-friendly access to deepfake analysis tools. API: Seamless integration for automated media analysis. Media Analysis-as-a-Service: Scalable solution for various organizational needs. Key features of GetReal’s platform include: Threat Exposure Dashboard: Provides a comprehensive overview of potential deepfake risks. “Inspect” Tool: Specifically designed to protect high-profile executives from impersonation attacks. “Protect” Tool: Screens media content to proactively identify and block deepfakes. “Respond” Service: Offers in-depth analysis by GetReal’s expert human teams for complex cases. The Brains Behind the Breakthrough in Deepfake Detection GetReal’s origins are deeply rooted in expertise. Incubated at Ballistic Ventures since 2022, the startup emerged from stealth mode in June 2024. Ballistic’s founder, Ted Schlein, also serves as GetReal’s chairman and co-founder, highlighting the venture capital firm’s strong belief in GetReal’s mission. Adding to this powerhouse team is CEO Matt Moynahan, a seasoned cybersecurity veteran with decades of experience leading companies like Symantec and Forcepoint. He emphasizes the critical gap GetReal is filling in the cyber forensics landscape, stating, “If you think cybersecurity has a shortage of people, get ready for forensics.” However, the true linchpin is co-founder Dr. Hany Farid. A renowned academic from UC Berkeley, Farid has spent years pioneering techniques for identifying manipulated digital images, long before AI deepfakes became a mainstream concern. Moynahan aptly describes GetReal’s core offering as “Hany as a service,” explaining how they’ve transformed Farid’s deep expertise into a scalable, cloud-based platform. Farid himself notes the fascinating blend of cutting-edge technology and timeless principles in their approach: “There are techniques we developed 20 years ago that still work today,” showcasing the enduring foundation of their deepfake detection methods. Strategic Backing and Real-World Validation for AI Forensics The Series A funding round isn’t just about the amount raised; it’s about the strategic investors involved. Cisco Investments, Capital One Ventures, and In-Q-Tel (linked to the CIA) are among the backers, signaling strong industry and government interest in GetReal’s AI forensics capabilities. Alberto Yépez of Forgepoint Capital points out that regulated industries, particularly financial institutions, are proactively seeking solutions like GetReal’s due to board-level concerns about deepfake impersonations, especially after instances of CEO voice impersonations. Notable clients like John Deere and Visa further validate the platform’s real-world effectiveness. While GetReal’s current focus is on audio, video, and image deepfake detection , the recent incident involving The Atlantic’s editor being mistakenly added to a Signal group chat planning a military attack highlights the emerging threat of text-based impersonations. Farid acknowledges that text is a “different beast” but confirms that expanding to address all forms of deepfake and impersonation threats is a long-term goal. Is GetReal the Ultimate Weapon Against AI Deepfakes? GetReal’s emergence with significant funding, a stellar team, and an impressive client roster strongly suggests they are a leading contender in the fight against AI deepfakes . Their platform, built on decades of expertise and cutting-edge technology, offers a comprehensive suite of tools for detection and response. However, the battle against deepfakes is constantly evolving. Here’s a quick look at the landscape: Pros of GetReal Challenges for Deepfake Detection Expert-led technology with proven methods. Deepfake technology is rapidly advancing. Strong funding and strategic partnerships. Detecting text-based deepfakes is a new frontier. Comprehensive platform with various tools and services. The ‘fun’ deepfake apps contribute to the problem. Addresses a critical gap in cyber forensics talent. Phishing tactics are becoming more sophisticated. While GetReal appears to have made significant strides in deepfake detection , the ongoing arms race between deepfake creators and detection technology means continuous innovation and adaptation are crucial. The $18 million investment and the caliber of clients and investors signal a powerful vote of confidence in GetReal’s approach. Whether they have definitively “cracked the code” remains to be seen, but they are undoubtedly a formidable force in safeguarding the digital realm from the insidious threat of AI deepfakes .

Here is the summary of the detailed interview and the most important points to know. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) explained that the company chose Abu Dhabi as its home base due to its regulatory environment and strategic location rather than its financing needs. According to CZ, the UAE’s compliance framework provides Binance with a stable foundation for global expansion. CZ acknowledged that the memecoin ecosystem is growing, attributing the rise to community-driven imagination. However, he warned that memecoins carry high risks, indicating a need for user education and clear risk warnings. Referring to US President Donald Trump’s memecoin launch, CZ explained that most celebrity coins are launched by third parties for publicity purposes, and urged public figures to focus on long-term, value-driven projects instead. Binance aims to maintain a balanced market where institutional investors do not disproportionately benefit individual users. CZ stated that the exchange should not act as a gatekeeper, but instead promote transparency. He encouraged projects to disclose their token locking mechanisms and leverage third-party smart contracts to increase trust. Looking forward, CZ expressed optimism about the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) as the future of the industry. Related News: According to Onchain Data, the Founder of this Altcoin Starts Selling Again CZ assessed the industry’s transition from requiring a private blockchain for token issuance to the widespread adoption of the ERC-20 standard. He believes that despite the lowering of technical barriers, community consensus remains the primary driver of value. He urged the crypto space to move beyond financial speculation and explore real-world applications such as government authentication and decentralized science (DeSci). While CZ admitted to missing out on an early Ethereum investment, he acknowledged ETH’s fundamental role in DeFi. However, he noted that Ethereum’s real problem lies not in its technology, but in its lack of innovation at the application layer. CZ, who recently evaluated the legal troubles he has experienced, shared that his four-month prison sentence has reshaped his perspective on life. Underlining the importance of family and health, CZ stated that he lost six kilos during his time in prison but is physically healthier. He noted that the biggest challenge is coping with the uncertainty of the situation. CZ introduced Giggle Academy, an educational initiative that aims to address global learning inequalities through gamified experiences. The project aims to equip users with job-related skills, such as AI data annotation, to improve employment opportunities around the world. *This is not investment advice.

Investors actively looking for the best crypto to buy for 2025 want projects with innovative features and utility which serve practical purposes. There is a new Defi payment token that has begun to divert investor attention from XRP price predictions as it presents solutions for important problems for both businesses and individuals throughout the global remittance framework. The crypto market shows an increasing need for effective solutions to manage cross-border payments. XRP maintains its financial institution partnerships but faces slower market acceptance which enables emerging projects to find new grounds for innovation.

This unexpected shoutout, highlighted by Chainlink’s Communications Director Chris Barrett on X (formerly Twitter), has sparked considerable interest and speculation within the crypto community. Let’s dive into why this mention is noteworthy and what it could signify for the future of Chainlink and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Why is the World Liberty Financial and Chainlink Mention at the DC Blockchain Summit Significant? The DC Blockchain Summit is a prominent event that brings together policymakers, industry leaders, and innovators in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. It serves as a platform for discussions, announcements, and networking, shaping the regulatory and developmental trajectory of the industry. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Zach Witkoff, choosing this stage to recognize Chainlink is significant for several reasons: Legitimacy and Mainstream Attention: World Liberty Financial’s association with the Trump family brings a level of mainstream attention and political relevance to the DeFi space. Their public acknowledgment of Chainlink at such a summit can be interpreted as a nod towards the growing acceptance and importance of decentralized technologies within traditional financial and political circles. Validation for Chainlink: For Chainlink, a project focused on providing secure and reliable data to smart contracts, this shoutout serves as further validation of its crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem. It highlights Chainlink’s growing recognition beyond the core crypto community and into more traditional finance adjacent sectors. Potential for Collaboration: While just a ‘shoutout’ for now, this public acknowledgment could hint at potential future collaborations or integrations between World Liberty Financial and Chainlink. For a DeFi project like World Liberty Financial, leveraging Chainlink’s oracle services could be instrumental in enhancing the security, reliability, and functionality of their platform. Broader DeFi Implications: This event underscores the increasing maturity and interconnectedness of the DeFi space. It signals a move towards greater collaboration and recognition between different projects, potentially fostering a more robust and integrated decentralized financial ecosystem. Chris Barrett’s X post, further amplified by Zach Witkoff’s repost, quickly circulated within the crypto community, igniting discussions on social media platforms and crypto forums. The brevity of the initial communication leaves room for interpretation and fuels speculation about the nature of this acknowledgment. What is Chainlink and Why Does it Matter in DeFi? Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that plays a pivotal role in the functionality and security of smart contracts, particularly within the DeFi space. In simple terms, oracles are bridges that connect blockchains to the real world, enabling smart contracts to access external data, APIs, and payment systems. Here’s why Chainlink is crucial: Bridging the Data Gap: Blockchains, by design, are isolated environments. Smart contracts operating on blockchains cannot inherently access data from the outside world. Chainlink solves this by providing a secure and reliable way for smart contracts to receive external data feeds. Ensuring Data Integrity and Security: Chainlink’s decentralized nature is key. Instead of relying on a single point of failure, Chainlink uses a network of independent node operators to source and verify data. This decentralized approach enhances the security and reliability of the data provided to smart contracts, mitigating risks like data manipulation or single points of failure. Enabling Complex Smart Contracts: Many sophisticated DeFi applications rely heavily on real-world data. Price feeds for decentralized exchanges, weather data for insurance contracts, and random number generation for gaming platforms are just a few examples. Chainlink empowers the creation of these complex and data-driven smart contracts, expanding the possibilities of DeFi. Variety of Services: Beyond price feeds, Chainlink offers a suite of decentralized services, including Proof of Reserve (PoR) to verify the collateralization of assets, Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for provably fair randomness, and Keepers for automating smart contract functions. In essence, Chainlink is the infrastructure that enables smart contracts to interact with the real world in a secure and trustworthy manner, making it an indispensable component of the growing DeFi ecosystem. Its importance is reflected in its widespread adoption across numerous DeFi protocols and its recognition by projects like World Liberty Financial. World Liberty Financial: Trump Family’s Foray into DeFi? World Liberty Financial has garnered attention primarily due to its co-founder, Zach Witkoff, and its reported connection to the Trump family. While details about the project are still emerging, its association with such a prominent political family immediately places it under a spotlight. Here’s what we know and what it implies: Trump Family Ties: Reports suggest that World Liberty Financial is linked to the Trump family, although the exact nature and extent of this connection are not fully transparent. This association inevitably brings a certain level of political and public interest to the project. DeFi Ambitions: World Liberty Financial is positioned as a DeFi project, indicating its aim to operate within the decentralized finance space. This likely involves leveraging blockchain technology to offer financial services in a decentralized and potentially more accessible manner. Limited Public Information: As of now, detailed information about World Liberty Financial’s specific products, services, and roadmap is relatively scarce. Their website and public communications are still developing, leaving many aspects of their project shrouded in some mystery. Speculation and Scrutiny: Given the Trump family connection and the nascent stage of the project, World Liberty Financial is subject to both significant speculation and scrutiny. The crypto community and the broader public are keenly watching to see how this project evolves and what impact it might have. The involvement of individuals connected to prominent political figures in the DeFi space is a developing trend. It could signal a bridging of traditional political and financial spheres with the decentralized world of crypto. However, it also raises questions about regulatory implications, transparency, and the potential for political influence within the ostensibly decentralized realm of DeFi. What Does This Mean for the Future of Chainlink and DeFi? The Chainlink shoutout from World Liberty Financial at the DC Blockchain Summit, while seemingly a minor event, could have broader implications for both Chainlink and the DeFi sector as a whole. Here are some potential takeaways: Increased Institutional Interest in Chainlink: Recognition from a project with political connections like World Liberty Financial might attract further attention from institutional investors and traditional financial entities towards Chainlink. This could lead to increased adoption of Chainlink’s services in more mainstream financial applications. Growing Convergence of Traditional Finance and DeFi: This event may be another indicator of the increasing convergence between traditional finance and decentralized finance. As projects like World Liberty Financial, with links to established political and financial networks, enter the DeFi space, it could accelerate the integration of these two worlds. Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased mainstream and political attention on DeFi, partly driven by projects like World Liberty Financial, could also lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Policymakers may become more focused on understanding and regulating the DeFi space as it gains prominence in traditional circles. Potential for Mass Adoption of DeFi: Ultimately, events like these, which bring DeFi into the broader public consciousness, can contribute to the gradual mass adoption of decentralized finance. As more people become aware of and potentially interact with DeFi through projects with familiar connections, the path to wider adoption could be paved. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial’s public acknowledgment of Chainlink at the DC Blockchain Summit is more than just a casual mention. It’s a noteworthy event that highlights the evolving landscape of DeFi, the increasing recognition of Chainlink’s vital role, and the potential for greater convergence between the crypto world and traditional finance. As the DeFi space continues to mature and attract attention from diverse sectors, such seemingly small events can serve as significant markers of broader industry trends and future directions.

42454093,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143597,1743038417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Suspicious Funds Unveiled: OKX & Binance Wallets Linked to Hyperliquid JELLY Attack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/okx-binance-hyperliquid-jelly-attack/,"The crypto sphere is buzzing with the latest developments in the Hyperliquid JELLY attack saga. On-chain data has unveiled a potentially significant piece of the puzzle: the funds utilized to orchestrate the JELLY short position attack on Hyperliquid originated from prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, OKX and Binance. This revelation, initially reported by LookOnChain via X (formerly Twitter), throws a new light on the incident and prompts crucial questions about exchange security and the flow of funds in decentralized finance (DeFi). What We Know About the Hyperliquid JELLY Attack and Fund Withdrawal For those unfamiliar, the Hyperliquid JELLY attack involved exploiting vulnerabilities in the platform to open substantial short positions in JELLY, a relatively new cryptocurrency. This maneuver reportedly caused price fluctuations and raised concerns within the Hyperliquid community. Now, LookOnChain’s findings suggest that the capital fueling this attack was traced back to withdrawals from two of the largest centralized exchanges in the world: OKX and Binance. Here’s a breakdown of the key details: On-chain Investigation: LookOnChain, a reputable blockchain analytics firm, conducted an investigation into the flow of funds related to the Hyperliquid JELLY attack. Exchange Identification: Their analysis pointed towards OKX and Binance as the source of the funds used to execute the attack. Withdrawal Confirmation: Data indicates that the attacker withdrew cryptocurrency from these exchanges prior to initiating the JELLY short positions on Hyperliquid. Rumor Debunking: The news indirectly addresses earlier rumors suggesting Binance’s direct involvement as the orchestrator of the JELLY incident. While funds were withdrawn from Binance, this doesn’t automatically imply Binance’s complicity, but rather highlights the exchange as a platform used for fund movement. To visualize the flow, consider this simplified representation: Why is the Origin of Funds in the Hyperliquid JELLY Attack Important for Crypto Security? Understanding where the attack funds originated is critical for several reasons, particularly concerning crypto security and the overall integrity of the digital asset ecosystem: Exchange Security Protocols: The fact that funds could be withdrawn from major exchanges like OKX and Binance and then used for a market manipulation attack raises questions about Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. Were there any red flags missed? Can exchange security measures be further strengthened to prevent such incidents? Traceability of Funds: This incident underscores the importance of blockchain analytics in tracing illicit activities. The ability to follow the flow of funds on the blockchain is a crucial tool for investigations and for deterring malicious actors. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Vulnerabilities: While the funds originated from centralized exchanges, the attack targeted a DeFi platform, Hyperliquid. This highlights the interconnectedness of CeFi and DeFi and the potential for vulnerabilities in one area to impact the other. Crypto security needs to be robust across both centralized and decentralized platforms. Market Manipulation Concerns: The JELLY attack is a stark reminder of the risks of market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space, especially for newer and less liquid tokens. Understanding the source of funds helps in analyzing the motives and scale of such attacks. Binance and OKX Under Scrutiny: What Does This Mean for Exchange Reputation? While the report doesn’t directly implicate Binance or OKX in orchestrating the attack, the revelation that attacker funds were withdrawn from these platforms inevitably puts them under scrutiny. Does this tarnish their reputation? Not necessarily, but it does raise pertinent questions: Enhanced Monitoring: Will Binance and OKX enhance their transaction monitoring systems to detect and prevent suspicious withdrawal patterns that could precede market manipulation attempts? User Accountability: Should exchanges implement stricter measures to ensure user accountability and deter the use of their platforms for illicit activities, even if indirectly? Transparency and Cooperation: Will these exchanges cooperate with investigations into the Hyperliquid JELLY attack and share information to help identify the perpetrators? Transparency in such situations is crucial for maintaining user trust and demonstrating a commitment to crypto security . Fund Withdrawal and the Future of Crypto Investigations The fund withdrawal from OKX and Binance, as revealed by on-chain analysis, sets a precedent for future cryptocurrency investigations. It demonstrates the power of blockchain forensics in uncovering the origins of illicit funds and tracking their movement. This capability is increasingly vital as the crypto space matures and faces more sophisticated forms of attacks and financial crimes. Here are some potential implications for the future: Increased Reliance on On-Chain Analytics: Expect to see a greater reliance on on-chain analytics tools and firms like LookOnChain to investigate crypto-related incidents and provide crucial insights into fund flows. Collaboration Between Exchanges and Analytics Firms: Closer collaboration between cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain analytics firms could become more common to proactively identify and mitigate risks related to money laundering and market manipulation. Regulatory Scrutiny: Incidents like the Hyperliquid JELLY attack, and the subsequent tracing of funds to major exchanges, might attract further regulatory scrutiny on exchanges and their security measures. Advancements in Crypto Security Technology: The need for more advanced crypto security technologies, both for exchanges and DeFi platforms, will become even more pressing to stay ahead of evolving attack vectors. Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Users Learn? This incident offers valuable lessons for crypto users and the wider industry: Diversification of Exchange Usage: Consider diversifying your cryptocurrency holdings across multiple reputable exchanges to mitigate risks associated with any single platform. Stay Informed About Crypto Security Practices: Keep yourself updated on the latest crypto security best practices, including secure wallet management and being cautious of new and unaudited DeFi platforms. Support On-Chain Transparency: Advocate for greater transparency and on-chain data availability within the crypto ecosystem, as it is crucial for accountability and security. Exercise Caution with New Tokens: Be particularly cautious when trading newly launched or low-liquidity tokens, as they can be more susceptible to market manipulation. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The revelation that funds used in the Hyperliquid JELLY attack were withdrawn from OKX and Binance serves as a potent reminder of the ongoing challenges in crypto security . While it doesn’t confirm any wrongdoing by these exchanges, it underscores the need for continuous vigilance, enhanced security protocols, and greater transparency across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The ability to trace funds is a powerful tool, but proactive measures and industry-wide collaboration are essential to prevent future incidents and foster a safer environment for all participants.

This streamlines the advertising process and potentially opens up new avenues for businesses and creators to reach their target audiences within Telegram. Exclusive Withdrawal Method for Creators and Developers: For those building bots, creating content, or developing within the Telegram ecosystem, TON serves as the primary method for withdrawing earnings. This is a game-changer, offering a potentially faster and more efficient way to access revenue compared to traditional banking systems, especially for a global user base. Trading Telegram Assets via TON-based NFTs: Ever wanted to own a unique Telegram username? Or perhaps send a digital gift that truly stands out? TON underpins the trading of Telegram assets like usernames and digital gifts through NFTs . This introduces a new layer of digital ownership and scarcity within Telegram, leveraging the booming NFT space. Backbone for Telegram Mini Apps: Those engaging and interactive Telegram Mini Apps , used by hundreds of millions, are built entirely on TON. This signifies a massive scale of operation and trust in TON’s infrastructure to support a significant portion of Telegram’s user activity. Decoding the Technology: Why TON Blockchain is Telegram’s Choice Durov didn’t just randomly pick a blockchain. He specifically emphasized TON’s scalability as a crucial factor. In a world where blockchain networks often struggle with transaction speeds and high fees, TON stands out. But what makes the TON blockchain so special, and why is it the ideal fit for Telegram’s ambitious plans? Sharding for Scalability: TON utilizes a technique called sharding. Imagine dividing a massive database into smaller, more manageable parts. Sharding does something similar for the blockchain, allowing it to process transactions in parallel across multiple shards (sub-blockchains). This dramatically increases throughput and allows TON to handle a significantly larger volume of transactions compared to blockchains without sharding. Designed for Billions of Transactions: Durov explicitly mentioned TON’s potential to support billions of transactions. This isn’t just marketing hype; it’s a testament to TON’s architecture, which is built from the ground up to handle massive scale, aligning perfectly with Telegram’s ever-growing user base and transaction demands. Real Fundamental Value: In a crypto landscape often filled with projects lacking tangible utility, Durov boldly stated that TON is “one of the few blockchains with real fundamental value.” This endorsement from a tech leader like Durov carries significant weight and suggests that TON isn’t just about speculation; it’s about providing real-world utility and infrastructure. The choice of TON underscores Telegram’s commitment to building a robust and scalable in-app economy that can accommodate its massive global user base. It’s not just about adding crypto features; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how transactions and interactions happen within the platform. Pavel Durov’s Vision: A Decentralized Future for Telegram? Pavel Durov ‘s endorsement of TON goes beyond just technological integration; it hints at a broader vision for Telegram’s future. By embracing blockchain technology and decentralization, Telegram could be positioning itself as a leader in the next evolution of social platforms. What could this vision entail? Empowering Creators and Users: By using TON for payments and withdrawals, Telegram potentially empowers creators and users with more control over their earnings and digital assets. Decentralized systems can often reduce reliance on intermediaries and potentially lower fees, benefiting both creators and users. Building a Web3 Ecosystem within Telegram: The integration of NFTs and Mini Apps on TON suggests Telegram is building a mini-Web3 ecosystem within its platform. This could attract developers and entrepreneurs looking to leverage Telegram’s massive user base to build decentralized applications and services. Future Decentralization of Telegram Infrastructure? While not explicitly stated, the deep integration with TON raises questions about the potential for further decentralization of Telegram’s infrastructure in the future. Could we see aspects of Telegram itself, beyond just the in-app economy, becoming more decentralized and community-driven? Durov’s statements suggest a long-term commitment to TON and a belief in the power of blockchain to enhance Telegram’s ecosystem. This could mark a turning point, not just for Telegram, but for how social platforms integrate with cryptocurrency technologies. Streamlining Transactions: Telegram Crypto Payments Powered by TON One of the most immediate and impactful applications of TON is in Telegram crypto payments . The shift to TON for Telegram Ads payments and creator withdrawals is more than just a technical upgrade; it represents a fundamental shift in how value is exchanged within the Telegram ecosystem. Let’s explore the benefits and implications: Feature Traditional Systems TON-Powered Telegram Payments Payment Method for Telegram Ads Credit Cards, Bank Transfers, etc. TON Withdrawal Method for Creators Bank Transfers, Payment Processors TON Transaction Speed Varies, can be slow Potentially Faster Transaction Fees Can be higher Potentially Lower Accessibility May have geographical limitations Potentially more globally accessible By embracing TON for crypto payments, Telegram is potentially offering a more efficient, cost-effective, and globally accessible payment infrastructure. This is particularly beneficial for creators and businesses operating in regions with limited access to traditional financial systems. Scaling for the Future: Can TON Scalability Handle Telegram’s Growth? The question on everyone’s mind is: Can TON scalability truly handle the demands of Telegram’s massive and ever-growing user base? Durov’s confidence is reassuring, but let’s delve deeper into the technical aspects of TON’s scalability and its potential limitations: Theoretical Limits of Sharding: While sharding significantly enhances scalability, it’s not a silver bullet. There are theoretical limits to how much a blockchain can scale, even with sharding. However, TON’s architecture is designed to push these limits further than many other blockchains. Real-World Performance Under Load: The true test of scalability is real-world performance under heavy load. As Telegram’s in-app economy grows and transaction volumes increase, TON’s network will be continuously tested. Ongoing monitoring and optimization will be crucial to ensure smooth performance. Future Upgrades and Developments: Blockchain technology is constantly evolving. TON, like other blockchains, will likely undergo continuous upgrades and improvements to further enhance its scalability and performance over time. Staying adaptable and innovative is key to maintaining long-term scalability. While challenges may arise, TON’s sharding architecture and focus on scalability position it well to handle Telegram’s future growth. The integration is a bold bet on the future of blockchain technology and its ability to support mainstream applications at scale. Conclusion: Telegram and TON – A Powerful Partnership for the Future Pavel Durov’s announcement is a clear signal: TON is not just a side project; it’s the engine driving Telegram’s in-app economy and potentially shaping its future trajectory. From revolutionizing Telegram crypto payments to powering Telegram in-app economy , TON’s scalability and utility are being put to the test on a massive scale. Pavel Durov ‘s vision of a decentralized and efficient platform is taking shape, leveraging the power of the TON blockchain . This partnership is one to watch closely, as it could set a new precedent for how social platforms integrate with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, unlocking a world of possibilities for users, creators, and the entire crypto ecosystem.

While investors are still scratching their heads over Slerf’s accidental $10 million burn and Goatseus Maximus’ AI-fueled rise, another project is silently stacking massive gains for its community— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . In a market where volatility is the norm and headlines move prices, BTFD Coin has raised over $6.41 million, sold more than 72 billion tokens, and is serving up a limited-time 100% bonus for anyone brave enough to buy the dip. The presale is sitting at Stage 15 out of 16, and with the price currently at $0.0002, it’s only going up from here. LAUNCH100 is the code everyone’s using to double their BTFD coins—but heads up, this wild bonus ends March 30. Let’s dig into why BTFD’s presale may be the best play in town right now, while Slerf and GOAT deliver their own (kinda bizarre) headlines among the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Built for Bulls, Ready to Charge Imagine getting in on a meme coin that’s not just vibes and volatility, but backed by utility, rewards, and one of the most relatable mottos in all of crypto: Buy The Dip . That’s BTFD Coin for you. But this isn’t just some internet meme dressed up as the top new meme coin to join today. It’s a community-powered ecosystem with staking, a P2E game that’s already live, and the heart of it all—the Bulls Squad. Let’s talk about this squad. Baby Bull leads with memes and momentum. Raging Bull fuels the visuals. Nerdy Bull’s building the tech, and People’s Bull? He’s out here making sure every new buyer feels like they’re in on something real. This isn’t some random Telegram group—this is a movement of 11,600+ holders, all chasing opportunity instead of fearing dips. And that P2E game? It’s not just hype—it’s live and paying out. Users can now jump into the BTFD Bull Run Game, climb levels, invite friends, and earn real BTFD tokens while playing. Combine that with staking that’s delivering a solid 90% APY, and you’ve got a token that pays you for holding and playing. Literally. Then there’s the presale. Stage 15 is where things are cooking. The current price is $0.0002, but once it hits $0.0006 at launch, that’s a 200% ROI just from getting in now. Let’s put that in perspective. Drop $1000 today at $0.0002, and you’ll get 5 million tokens. Use the LAUNCH100 bonus code , and that turns into 10 million tokens instantly. Once BTFD hits $0.0006, those 10 million coins? They’re worth $6000. Oh, and don’t miss this—March 30 is the deadline for that 100% bonus. This isn’t one of those “limited time” deals that stick around forever. After March 30, LAUNCH100 is gone. Hey Bulls, this one’s for you: 100% BONUS CODE: LAUNCH100 – Buy now and your tokens get doubled. That’s right—twice the tokens, zero extra cost. But you gotta act fast. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus: Step 1: Head to the BTFD Presale Step 2: Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, whatever works for you) Step 3: Enter LAUNCH100 in the bonus code field and hit “Apply” Step 4: Choose your purchase amount and click “Buy Now” Step 5: Confirm everything in your wallet, and boom—you just doubled your stack Remember: LAUNCH100 must be entered in ALL CAPS. Don’t miss that. Oh, and if you’ve got friends in the game, bring ‘em in. BTFD’s referral program is giving away 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens for the top 20 referrers each month. If your code makes the top list by month’s end, you’re getting some serious rewards. The competition resets at 12:01 UTC on the 1st of every month. Bottom line? BTFD is more than a meme coin presale —it’s a moment. A chance to lock in value while everyone else waits for the next crash to “maybe” buy. You don’t need to wait for dips when you’re buying at dip prices right now. Slerf (SLERF) – The $10M Mistake That Created a Meme Legend SLERF was already a playful sloth on the Solana blockchain, but it made waves after its developer accidentally burned $10 million in presale funds. Yep, just—poof—gone. Instead of tanking, the price spiked, and SLERF became a legend overnight. Now trading at around $0.068174, with a market cap of $34.35 million, SLERF’s community is all-in on chaos and comedy. Still, with only ~500 million tokens circulating, volatility is a constant. SLERF’s wild start is great if you’re into high-risk, high-reward bets—but if you’re looking for stability and a guaranteed bonus? BTFD is a safer bet with real utility. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) – From Meme to Meme Religion? GOAT’s origin is about as bizarre as it gets. An AI called “Terminal of Truths” tweeted about a “GOAT singularity,” and boom—someone launched a meme coin to match the vibe. With a total supply of 1 billion and a circulating supply of ~999.99 million, GOAT is now trading at $0.0638 with a market cap of $63.82 million. Its AI-backed cult following and lore-filled community called the “Gospel of Goatse” give it a unique twist. But with an all-time high of $1.35, it’s down massively. It could rebound—or it could stay weird. Either way, GOAT is fascinating, but again, it doesn’t hold a candle to BTFD’s reward-packed presale and live ecosystem. Conclusion – Time to Charge with the Bulls Crypto’s wild. We get it. Some days, it feels like you need divine intervention or AI prophecies just to make sense of the madness. But based on what we’re seeing—from market trends to community momentum— BTFD Coin stands out as the most solid, value-packed project among the top new meme coins to join today. The presale is real. The P2E game is live. The staking is juicy. The LAUNCH100 bonus ends March 30. Miss it, and you’re leaving 100% of your gains on the table. This is your shot to be part of something where utility meets meme, and community meets conviction. Don’t just scroll and think “maybe later.” Join the BTFD Coin presale right now—before Stage 16 hits and the bonus disappears! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What is BTFD Coin’s LAUNCH100 Bonus? It’s a limited-time offer where buyers get 100% extra BTFD tokens during Stage 15 by entering the code LAUNCH100. It ends on March 30. How do I buy BTFD Coin in the presale? Visit the BTFD site, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in the bonus field, and confirm the purchase. What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins? BTFD isn’t just hype. It’s got a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, Ethereum security, and a presale with real rewards. Is Slerf a good investment? SLERF is high-risk with unpredictable moves. It gained fame from an accidental $10M burn but lacks core utilities like staking or gaming. What’s the story behind Goatseus Maximus? GOAT was born from an AI’s meme prophecy. It has a loyal fanbase, but no staking or presale bonus—unlike BTFD.

The current market situation has brought renewed speculation about which promising tokens such as Remittix would offer investment returns like Pepe Coin's projected 2024 rise and Shiba Inu's historic 2021 performance. Let us find out why analysts think Remittix is the best crypto to buy in 2025. Is Pepe Coin Dead Or Still Riding the Meme Coin Wave The meme coin Pepe Coin uses nostalgic branding combined with viral promotional activities to build a strong community base among speculators. The price of Pepe stands at $0.00000912 while showing a 22% weekly gain through speculative trader interest seeking risky investment opportunities. The market momentum of Pepe Coin shows signs of deceleration since investors are moving toward initiatives that present better fundamental values. The key market insights indicate that despite the RSI standing at 50, which is neutral, other short-term technical indicators like MACD and moving averages are indicating a 'buy', albeit in spite of long-term moving averages still indicating some bearish pressure. Additionally, open interest has increased by 8.47%, indicative of increased trader activity. If PEPE is able to break past the resistance zone at $0.00000980 , it may target $0.000011 levels in the forthcoming weeks. However, the meme coin market remains unpredictable, even though the bulls appear to be in control, with the long-term direction of PEPE not yet clear, the next few days will be crucial in knowing whether the coin is actually ready for a significant breakout Pepe faces sustainability risks as a speculative asset because it must prove its ability to move past hype-based trading while developing practical applications which Remittix demonstrates successfully. Can Shiba Inu Soar In 2025; Or Is The Hype Over? Shiba Inu remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies available today with its reputation of building life-changing wealth for early adopters. Currently trading at under $0.000016, SHIB has seen a calm after being characterized by extreme volatility in the first part of this year. Its fan base keeps expanding with ecosystem initiatives like Shibarium a Layer-2 infrastructure with the objective of enhancing scalability and reducing transaction fees which has helped maintain investor demand for the token. Market forecasts indicate that Shiba Inu may experience a steady increase to $0.000025 by the end of 2025 if adoption of its ecosystem speeds up. Nevertheless, as SHIB matures, its growth potential might be capped against newer entrants in the market with new concepts and innovative technologies such as Remittix. Others believe Shiba Inu is set for an explosive 12x surge as its ecosystem team supports a bullish call, with upside potential for a 1,137% rise that will leave the meme currency smashing through levels to hit $0.0001833. Analysts See A Safe Path to Exponential Gains Following Remittix Aggressive Presale Success Through its presale Remittix has established a digital finance revolution that has already delivered more than 300% return on investment to its early investors. The crypto market adopted an exceptional positive stance toward the Defi project because of its promising potential to break into 2025’s top altcoins list. The DeFi coin, RTX, powers Remittix’s PayFi technology that makes international fund transfers easier for users. Blockchain technology allows the platform to offer fast and cost-effective money transfers that modernize global money transfer processes with transactions occurring in mere minutes. The smart contract safety of Remittix has been completely tested by BlockSAFU for maximum reliability. Through rigorous testing the platform achieves both reliability and robustness which brings stakeholders full security assurance. Those who join now with prices below 10 cents at $0.0734 have exceptional chances to take part in this revolutionary shift. Potential investors should seize this opportune period to buy Remittix tokens because the presale currently promises to produce substantive financial yield. Analysts think Remittix will yield up to 30x returns on investment when it eventually lists on top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Bybit thus making Remittix a noteworthy competitor in the crypto industry.

42454841,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143617,1743039605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Crypto Bills Update: Congress Nears Landmark Vote on Stablecoins & FIT 21,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/congress-crypto-stablecoin-bills/,"Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto landscape? Washington D.C. is buzzing with activity as Congress edges closer to making decisive moves on crypto bills and stablecoin bills . For crypto enthusiasts, investors, and industry players, this is a moment to watch closely. The future of digital assets in the US could be defined in the coming days as lawmakers work to establish a clear regulatory framework. Let’s dive into the details of these potentially groundbreaking developments. What’s the Buzz Around Crypto Bills in Congress? The momentum is building on Capitol Hill. Rep. French Hill, a key figure in these discussions, has indicated that a revised version of the highly anticipated FIT 21 bill will be unveiled within days. This is not just another piece of legislation; FIT 21 , or the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, is designed to create a comprehensive market structure for the crypto industry. Think of it as a blueprint for how digital assets will be governed in the US. But what exactly does FIT 21 aim to achieve? Expanding CFTC Oversight: One of the core goals of FIT 21 is to broaden the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This would mean the CFTC would have a greater role in overseeing the crypto market, particularly concerning digital commodities. Defining the SEC’s Role: Equally important is clarifying the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. The bill seeks to delineate where the SEC’s regulatory perimeter ends and where the CFTC’s begins, aiming to eliminate the ambiguity that has plagued the industry. Clarity for Crypto Businesses: For crypto businesses operating in the US, this clarity is paramount. A well-defined regulatory landscape can foster innovation, encourage investment, and provide a stable environment for growth, reducing the fear of inadvertently crossing regulatory lines. Rep. Hill’s announcement signals that lawmakers are serious about advancing crypto regulation . The revised draft likely incorporates feedback and revisions from previous discussions, suggesting a collaborative effort to create a workable framework. Stablecoin Bills: Are We Nearing a Breakthrough? Parallel to the FIT 21 developments, significant progress is also being made on stablecoin bills . Rep. Bryan Steil has confirmed that the text of the House stablecoin bill is imminent, with a markup expected shortly after its introduction. This is a crucial step towards regulating stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. Why are stablecoin bills so important? Systemic Risk Mitigation: Stablecoins have grown exponentially in popularity and market capitalization. Their widespread use means that their stability (or instability) can have broader implications for the financial system. Regulation aims to mitigate potential systemic risks. Consumer Protection: Ensuring that stablecoins are backed by adequate reserves and operate transparently is crucial for consumer protection. Regulations can establish standards for reserves, auditing, and disclosure. Payment Innovation: Stablecoin bills can pave the way for the responsible innovation of stablecoins as payment mechanisms. Clear rules can encourage adoption while safeguarding against misuse. The fact that both House and Senate versions of the stablecoin bill are reportedly about 80% aligned is a very encouraging sign. This level of consensus suggests a strong bipartisan push to get stablecoin regulation across the finish line. Unified digital asset regulation appears to be a shared goal, transcending partisan lines. The Push for Unified Digital Asset Regulation The overarching narrative here is the drive towards unified digital asset regulation . Lawmakers are recognizing the need for a cohesive and comprehensive approach to governing cryptocurrencies and related technologies. Fragmented or conflicting regulations could stifle innovation and create unnecessary compliance burdens. A unified framework, on the other hand, can provide: Benefit Description Clarity and Certainty Businesses and investors gain a clear understanding of the rules of the game, reducing uncertainty and fostering confidence. Reduced Compliance Costs A unified framework can streamline compliance, making it less costly and complex for businesses to operate within the regulatory perimeter.

These cryptocurrencies are catching the eyes of investors with promising growth signals. Dive into the analysis of why Cardano could hit $2 and XRP might reach $5 soon. Discover the key factors driving this expected upward movement. Cardano Shows Strong Long-Term Momentum Despite Recent Lull During the past month, Cardano experienced a minor dip of 0.26% despite a healthy weekly gain of 9.56%. Over the half-year period, a striking increase of 91.04% highlights notable investor interest and a period of significant upward movement. These figures reveal a coin that has built momentum over time, even though recent short-term performance appears subdued. Currently, Cardano trades within a range of $0.44 to $0.88 with a nearby resistance at $1.15 and support at $0.25. Indicators such as an RSI of 52.06 and a near-neutral Awesome Oscillator suggest a balanced market with a slight tilt toward bulls. Trading strategies could focus on buying within this range and monitoring moves toward key resistance levels for potential exits. XRP Market Insights: Past Trends and Current Price Dynamics XRP price declined by 4.45% over the past month, while a staggering 316.93% gain over six months underscores a strong long-term rally. A weekly increase of 7.74% hints at periodic momentum despite recent pullbacks. Historical performance shows volatility with significant upward movements punctuating shorter-term dips. The data highlights potential strength when examined across different periods, reflecting both short-term fluctuations and a robust long-term recovery signal. Current levels show a trading range from $1.60 to $2.88, with support near $1.06 and resistance at $3.61, followed by a secondary resistance at $4.89. Bulls and bears appear relatively balanced, with no clear trend dominating. Traders may look to buy near support and sell at resistance if bulls can push the price higher while monitoring key indicator signals. Conclusion ADA shows strong potential to reach the $2 mark. XRP is also demonstrating signs that it could soon hit $5. Both coins are exhibiting bullish trends. Investors are closely watching the market for a potential breakout. The sustained momentum could lead to significant gains for both ADA and XRP. The current market indicators suggest promising times ahead for these cryptocurrencies.

42455244,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143619,1743040259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Warning: Bitget CEO Exposes Hyperliquid FTX Threat After JELLY Incident,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitget-ceo-hyperliquid-ftx-threat/,"Is history about to repeat itself in the volatile world of cryptocurrency exchanges? The crypto community is buzzing after Bitget CEO Gracy Chen issued a stark warning about decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid. Chen publicly stated that Hyperliquid’s handling of a recent incident, known as the JELLY incident, bears an uncanny resemblance to the events leading up to the colossal FTX collapse. Could Hyperliquid be the next domino to fall in the crypto space? Let’s dive into the details of this developing crypto exchange controversy and understand what’s at stake for crypto users. Why is Bitget CEO Gracy Chen Sounding the Alarm on Hyperliquid? The core of the issue stems from what Bitget CEO Gracy Chen describes as Hyperliquid’s “immature, unethical, and unprofessional” response to the JELLY incident. In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Chen didn’t mince words, suggesting that Hyperliquid’s actions not only caused financial losses for users but also severely damaged the exchange’s credibility. This is a significant accusation, especially considering Hyperliquid markets itself as an innovative decentralized exchange. Here’s a breakdown of Chen’s key concerns: Immature Handling of JELLY Incident: Chen criticized Hyperliquid’s approach to resolving the JELLY incident, implying a lack of transparency and user-centric solutions. User Losses: She highlighted that Hyperliquid’s actions resulted in tangible financial losses for users, a critical breach of trust in the crypto exchange environment. Damaged Credibility: According to Chen, the incident has significantly eroded Hyperliquid’s credibility, questioning its reliability and trustworthiness as a DEX platform. FTX 2.0 Potential: The most alarming aspect of Chen’s statement is the direct comparison to FTX, suggesting that the JELLY incident could be a precursor to a larger crisis at Hyperliquid, mirroring the catastrophic downfall of FTX. Chen’s commentary raises serious questions about the operational standards and user protection mechanisms within the decentralized exchange sector, particularly when compared to regulated centralized exchanges. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) vs. Centralized Exchange (CEX): Are User Funds Really Safer? The rise of decentralized exchange DEX platforms was largely fueled by the desire for greater user control and transparency, contrasting sharply with the opaque nature of some centralized exchanges. DEXs, in theory, eliminate the need for intermediaries, allowing users to trade directly from their wallets. However, Chen’s critique throws a spotlight on the potential pitfalls even within the DEX space. Let’s compare DEXs and CEXs in light of this controversy: Feature Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Centralized Exchange (CEX) Custody of Funds Users retain control of their private keys and funds. Users deposit funds into the exchange’s custody. Transparency Transactions are typically recorded on a public blockchain. Transparency can vary; some CEXs are less transparent about their operations. Regulation & Compliance Often operates with less regulatory oversight. Subject to regulations and KYC/AML compliance. Risk of Incidents Smart contract vulnerabilities, protocol risks, operational immaturity. Exchange hacks, mismanagement, regulatory risks. User Protection User protection mechanisms can be less defined and harder to enforce. Often have established customer support and some level of regulatory protection (depending on jurisdiction). Chen’s statement suggests that while DEXs offer the promise of decentralization, they are not immune to operational failures and user harm. Her comparison of Hyperliquid to “offshore centralized exchanges that facilitate illegal activities without KYC/AML” is particularly damning. It implies that Hyperliquid, despite being a DEX, might be exhibiting similar risky behaviors and lack of accountability that contributed to the FTX debacle. The JELLY Incident Crypto: What Actually Happened? To understand the gravity of the JELLY incident crypto controversy, it’s crucial to know what transpired. While specific details of the JELLY incident require further investigation and official statements from Hyperliquid, the core issue seems to revolve around a significant operational or technical glitch that led to user losses. Based on available information and Chen’s comments, the JELLY incident likely involved: A Technical Issue: Potentially a smart contract vulnerability, a platform bug, or an exploit that affected trading or asset management on Hyperliquid. User Losses: This technical issue resulted in direct financial losses for users who were trading or holding assets on the platform at the time of the incident. Hyperliquid’s Response: Chen’s criticism focuses on how Hyperliquid handled the aftermath – allegedly in an “immature, unethical, and unprofessional” manner, suggesting a lack of adequate communication, compensation, or resolution for affected users. The lack of detailed public information about the JELLY incident itself further fuels concerns about transparency and user protection within the DEX space. A robust and transparent response to such incidents is crucial for maintaining user trust and the long-term viability of any crypto exchange, whether centralized or decentralized. Hyperliquid FTX: Is History Repeating Itself? The most alarming takeaway from Bitget CEO’s statement is the direct comparison of Hyperliquid FTX . The collapse of FTX sent shockwaves through the crypto industry, exposing the dangers of centralized control, lack of transparency, and alleged fraudulent activities. Chen drawing parallels between Hyperliquid and FTX is a serious accusation that warrants attention and scrutiny. Why is the FTX comparison so potent and concerning? Sudden and Unexpected Collapse: FTX’s downfall was rapid and largely unexpected by many, highlighting how quickly trust can erode in the crypto space. User Fund Mismanagement: Allegations of FTX mismanaging and misusing user funds were central to its collapse, leading to massive user losses. Lack of Transparency and Accountability: FTX was criticized for its opaque operations and lack of accountability, contributing to the crisis. Industry-Wide Contagion: The FTX collapse had ripple effects across the crypto market, impacting numerous projects and investors. If Hyperliquid is indeed exhibiting similar patterns of questionable practices or inadequate user protection, as suggested by Chen, the potential for a similar catastrophic outcome cannot be dismissed lightly. The crypto community remembers the lessons of FTX, and any hint of history repeating itself is bound to trigger alarm bells. Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself in the DEX Era This crypto exchange controversy serves as a crucial reminder for all crypto users, especially those venturing into the world of decentralized exchanges. While DEXs offer exciting possibilities, they also come with inherent risks. Here are some actionable insights to protect yourself: Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research any DEX platform before using it. Understand its operational model, security measures, and community reputation. Risk Diversification: Don’t put all your crypto assets on a single platform, especially a relatively new or less established DEX. Diversify across multiple platforms and cold storage solutions. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and developments related to the DEX platforms you use. Follow industry experts and monitor social media for any red flags or user concerns. Understand Smart Contract Risks: Be aware that DEXs rely on smart contracts, which can have vulnerabilities. Opt for platforms with audited and well-vetted smart contracts. Prioritize Transparency: Favor DEXs that are transparent about their operations, incident response protocols, and user protection mechanisms. The evolving landscape of crypto exchanges demands vigilance and informed decision-making. The Hyperliquid situation, highlighted by Bitget CEO Gracy Chen, underscores the importance of critical evaluation and risk management, even within the decentralized realm. Conclusion: A Stark Warning for the DEX Future? Bitget CEO Gracy Chen’s shocking allegations against Hyperliquid have ignited a crucial conversation about the state of decentralized exchanges and user safety. The comparison to FTX is a grave warning, urging both users and the industry to take a closer look at the operational practices and accountability mechanisms within the DEX sector. While decentralization offers numerous benefits, it doesn’t inherently guarantee safety or immunity from failures. The JELLY incident and its aftermath serve as a potent reminder that robust security, transparency, and user-centric responses are paramount for the sustained growth and trust in the decentralized crypto ecosystem. The crypto community will be watching closely to see how Hyperliquid responds to these serious accusations and what steps the broader DEX industry takes to ensure user protection and prevent potential “FTX 2.0” scenarios.

A glance at the charts reveals that crypto price today exhibits dour sentiments with BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP in bleed mode. Crypto Price Today: Top Coins Suffers Are In The Red According to CoinMarketCap data , flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has dipped by nearly 2% today to trade at $87,000, quelling enthusiasm for a run toward $90K. Bitcoin’s decline is pulling other assets underwater with the largest altcoin Ethereum down by 3.1% at just above $2,000. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has shed nearly 4% as it exchanges hands at $2.36. The asset has failed to rally following the dismissal of the Ripple SEC Case, wallowing at 38.27% from its all-time high of $3.84. Furthermore, Solana (SOL) has lost 5% of its value as it trades at $137. The sixth-largest token has erased previous gains despite rising institutional interest from Polymarket enabling SOL deposits and BlackRock’s BUIDL fund launching on the network. On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) is bleeding at $0.7, after shedding nearly 5% of its market capitalization in the correction. Predictions for ADA to $10 seem far off for the ninth-largest cryptocurrency with daily trading volumes of under $1 billion confirming widespread optimism. Chainlink (LINK) trades at $15.19 with a respectable 1.68% decline for the asset. Daily trading volumes of over 12% are signaling a potential upswing for LINK price in the near future. Memecoins Are Recording Impressive Gains While the rest of the market is bleeding memecoins are bucking the trend to notch upswing. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has surged by nearly 4% as it seeks to eliminate a zero from its present price. Dogecoin (DOGE) continues its upward trend, climbing by 2% to trade at $0.1945 on the heels of a Dogecoin Reserve . DOGE’s daily trading volume is matching the enthusiasm of price predictions touting the memecoin to embark on a strong rally. The biggest gainer of the lot is PEPE with its near 7% spike over the last day. The memecoin has a daily trading volume of $1 billion, a 96% jump over the last day as it eyes an increase in its market value. Despite the rallies, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood says memecoins will lose value in the coming days. However, the memecoin rally was unable to stop the global market capitalization for crypto price today from sliding by 2% to settle at $2.84 trillion.

According to Rector, the SEC Commissioners will hold a vote on March 27 to finalize their decision to end the appeal against Ripple. He stated that an official announcement would follow soon after. This development comes after the SEC agreed to dismiss its appeal against Ripple, marking a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The image attached to the Rector’s post showed a Sunshine Act notice for a closed SEC meeting scheduled for March 27, 2025. While the official agenda of this meeting has not been disclosed, the timing suggests it could include discussions related to the Ripple case. According to Rector, the first hearing to confirm Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair will happen the same day.

Over the years, the case has seen multiple notable rulings, including Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 decision that XRP was not a security in secondary sales and the August 2024 ruling that imposed a $125 million penalty on the company. The SEC’s subsequent appeal attempts have not changed any of these rulings, and the regulator’s decision to drop the appeal follows recent dismissals of other crypto-related lawsuits and investigations. This dismissal would mark a major victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry, and the results could be a notable precedent for digital asset regulation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The SEC Meeting and Possible Announcement The SEC’s Sunshine Act notice confirms that a closed meeting will occur on March 27, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. ET. While the notice does not specify the topics under discussion, Rector and others in the cryptocurrency community speculate that the formal vote to end the Ripple appeal could be included. If the vote occurs as expected, an official announcement could follow. This dismissal is a major step toward the future. It coincides with the confirmation hearing of Paul Atkins, the man Donald Trump has nominated to bring the SEC into a new era of proper regulatory practices. The timing of this meeting, combined with the recent lawsuit dismissals , raises expectations that the Ripple lawsuit’s resolution could be confirmed soon.

The House of Representatives just released its version, following the Senate’s recent approval of a similar bill. New Bill to Align House and Senate Efforts This new legislation will set rules for how companies can create and use digital tokens backed by the U.S. dollar, marking a major step in bringing more oversight and clarity to the growing crypto industry. Steil explained that the new version of the bill will help align the House and Senate’s efforts, making the two versions more similar and easier to work with. The Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) “is a strong continuation of our work on digital assets in the last Congress,” Hill said in a statement. Rep Emmer Reintroduces Securities Clarity Act Besides, on Wednesday, Rep. Emmer reintroduced his Securities Clarity Act , aiming to clarify how crypto assets fit into securities law. “Until we have a clear definition of what is a commodity and what is a security, American innovation will continue to suffer. Our legislation will help provide these answers and allow American investors to fully participate in digital asset technology without sacrificing consumer protections,” Congressman Tom Emmer noted. As the conference came to an end, the Senate held a second vote to overturn the IRS’ 2024 rule on DeFi brokers, after both the Senate and House passed the resolution before. The vote passed with 70 Senators in favor and 28 against. Amanda Tuminelli, Executive Director of the DeFi Education Fund, thanked the bipartisan lawmakers who supported the resolution, pointing out the negative effects of the IRS’ rule on the DeFi industry. French Hill to Release Revised FIT 21 Bill Shortly At the DC Blockchain Summit on Wednesday, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill also mentioned that a revised version of the market structure bill is almost ready, following work from his committee last year. The bill, called FIT 21 (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act), passed the House last year with support from 71 Democrats, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Hill plans to release a revised draft in the next few weeks, after receiving “technical assistance.” The market structure bill from last year aimed to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more control over crypto markets, especially bitcoin, and clarify the SEC’s role. Passing the market structure bill is more challenging than the stablecoin legislation due to its complexity. When FIT 21 passed the House, it was influenced by opposition to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler and former President Joe Biden, leading to some compromises. However, now, with a different political landscape, those compromises may no longer be needed. Stablecoin Regulation Picking Up The Senate Banking Committee recently advanced the bipartisan GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a framework for regulating stablecoins and determining when issuers fall under state or federal oversight. Some Democrats voiced concerns and sought changes, but they were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, in the House, Republicans, led by Rep. Bryan Steil, introduced the STABLE Act in February to regulate stablecoins.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 01:57:31

The global markets are on edge as former President Donald Trump is set to make a significant announcement regarding auto tariffs tonight at 8 p.m. UTC. While it might seem distant from the world of digital currencies, this move could send ripples through the entire financial ecosystem, potentially creating both challenges and opportunities for the crypto market. Let’s dive into what this Trump trade policy shift means and how it could affect your crypto portfolio. Why Auto Tariffs Matter to Crypto: Understanding the Economic Uncertainty At first glance, auto tariffs might seem like they only concern the automotive industry. However, in today’s interconnected global economy, such decisions have far-reaching consequences. Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, designed to protect domestic industries. But they can also: Increase Consumer Prices: Tariffs can lead to higher prices for imported cars and potentially domestically produced cars as well, contributing to inflation. Spark Trade Wars: Imposing tariffs can provoke retaliatory measures from other countries, escalating into full-blown trade wars. This creates global trade tensions and economic instability. Impact Global Growth: Trade wars disrupt supply chains, reduce international trade, and can slow down global economic growth. Currency Fluctuations: Tariffs can influence currency exchange rates, impacting the value of the US dollar and other currencies, which in turn can affect crypto prices. For the crypto market, which often thrives on economic uncertainty crypto and volatility, these broader economic shifts are crucial to watch. When traditional markets face turbulence, investors sometimes look to alternative assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as hedges. Decoding Trump’s Auto Tariff Announcement: What to Expect? While the exact details of President Trump’s announcement are still under wraps, the anticipation itself is causing jitters in financial markets. Here’s what we can anticipate and consider: Scope of Tariffs: Will these tariffs be targeted at specific countries, or will they be broad-based? The scope will determine the extent of the impact. Tariff Rates: The percentage of tariffs imposed will directly influence the price increases and the level of trade disruption. Retaliation Risk: We need to assess the likelihood and potential scale of retaliatory tariffs from other nations. This could amplify global trade tensions . Market Reaction: How will stock markets, bond markets, and currency markets react immediately after the announcement? This initial reaction can give us clues about the potential impact on crypto. Navigating Market Volatility Crypto: Opportunities and Challenges The expected market volatility crypto markets might experience due to the tariff announcement presents a double-edged sword. Here’s a breakdown of potential scenarios: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Impact Opportunities Challenges Increased Economic Uncertainty Investors may seek safe-haven assets, potentially driving capital into Bitcoin and other established cryptocurrencies. Potential for price appreciation in major cryptocurrencies. Increased trading volume and market activity. Altcoins might experience higher volatility and increased risk. Regulatory uncertainty could be amplified during economic turmoil. Stock Market Downturn If auto tariffs trigger a significant stock market correction, some investors might diversify into crypto as an alternative investment. Opportunity to buy crypto at potentially lower prices if a market dip occurs. Increased awareness of crypto as a non-correlated asset. Broader market panic could temporarily drag down all asset classes, including crypto. Liquidity issues might arise in highly volatile conditions. Dollar Weakness Tariffs could weaken the US dollar if they negatively impact the US economy. A weaker dollar can historically be positive for Bitcoin. Bitcoin, often seen as an alternative to fiat currencies, could become more attractive. Dollar-pegged stablecoins might see increased scrutiny. Importing goods and services using crypto might become more expensive if the dollar weakens significantly against other currencies. Actionable Insights: Preparing Your Crypto Strategy Given the impending announcement and potential market volatility crypto could face, here are some actionable steps for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to the tariff announcement and its immediate aftermath. Monitor market reactions across different asset classes. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and potentially other asset classes can help mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Consider reducing leverage and setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital during periods of high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that short-term market fluctuations are common. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your crypto investments. Explore Stablecoins: In times of uncertainty, stablecoins pegged to stronger currencies (other than USD if it weakens) could offer a temporary safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. The Bottom Line: Navigating the Trade Winds in Crypto President Trump’s auto tariff announcement is more than just trade policy; it’s a potential catalyst for economic shifts that can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. By understanding the potential consequences of this Trump trade policy and preparing for increased market volatility crypto markets might experience, you can navigate these uncertain times strategically. Whether it presents opportunities for growth or challenges to overcome, staying informed and adaptable is key in the ever-evolving world of crypto.

Over the past week, the Pi Coin sentiment collapsed after a 90% price drop, triggering concerns about trust and engagement. In more positive news, Chainlink shows breakout potential, supported by bullish technical indicators and rising trading volumes. Yet all eyes are on BlockDAG (BDAG) , as explosive presale momentum drives the project closer to an ambitious $600 million presale goal. With over $206.5 million raised and growing BDAG demand, BlockDAG is doing more than keeping up—it’s surging ahead and solidifying its position as the best crypto to buy now. Pi Coin Sentiment Deteriorates as Market Confidence Wavers The spotlight is back on Pi Network but for all the wrong reasons. In just 24 hours, Pi coin sentiment worsened due to a staggering 90% drop in Pi’s value, sparking debate across the crypto space. The sharp drop appears linked to a wave of bot activity and spam, raising serious concerns about the project’s social credibility and underlying engagement metrics. The unexpected turn in Pi coin sentiment has raised concerns about the authenticity of Pi Network’s community support. With user trust under pressure and organic activity declining, the incident has cast a shadow over the project’s credibility. As speculation continues, it remains unclear how quickly Pi coin sentiment can recover from this reputational setback. Chainlink Technical Analysis Suggests Potential $24 Breakout Recent Chainlink technical analysis indicates growing bullish momentum as LINK trades near the $19 mark. Analysts point to strong support at $17.75 and resistance at $19.98. A successful breakout above this resistance could set the stage for a rally toward the $24 target, especially if market sentiment remains favorable. The analysis also highlights rising trading volume and improving RSI levels, which reinforce the bullish outlook. While short-term volatility remains, Chainlink’s technical analysis suggests the project is gearing up for a key move. Continued strength above support levels may confirm upward momentum in the coming weeks. BlockDAG’s Presale Surge Puts $600M Target in Striking Distance BlockDAG is racing toward its ambitious $600 million presale target, and it’s not just hype, it’s measurable momentum. With over $206.5 million raised and 18.9 billion BDAG coins sold, the numbers speak for themselves. The presale’s steady climb shows no signs of slowing, fueled by consistent batch sellouts and growing public interest. Not to mention, demand for BDAG coins is through the roof. Over 700,000 users are actively mining BDAG on its mobile mining tools, while more than 170,000 unique holders have bought BDAG coins. These figures show BlockDAG’s wide adoption and reflect the trust crypto enthusiasts have in the BlockDAG ecosystem and its growth. As the demand for BDAG grows and more people join the project, the presale keeps getting bigger. BDAG holders now anticipate its upcoming Mainnet launch and 10 centralized exchange listings, while BlockDAG’s momentum feels unstoppable. What sets BlockDAG apart is its balance between traction and forward visibility. Analysts are now projecting a $1 price in 2025, a jump that would reflect both its growing ecosystem and scalable architecture. With over 200 dApps to be developed under its Hackathon partnership and a clear roadmap in place to expand its ecosystem, BlockDAG’s price outlook is backed by substance. BlockDAG checks every box: real user adoption, consistent presale growth, and a realistic path to major market milestones. The $600 million goal isn’t just within reach—it’s becoming a matter of how soon. The Bottom Line The dramatic drop in Pi Coin sentiment has cast doubt on the project’s community strength, highlighting the risks of hype without sustained engagement. In contrast, the Chainlink technical analysis points to a potential breakout, signaling an opportunity if key resistance levels are broken. Both stories reflect the volatility that continues to define crypto. But one project is breaking through the noise. BlockDAG’s record-breaking presale, surging adoption, and steady progress toward its $600 million goal make it a standout crypto in 2025. BlockDAG has raised $206.5 million in presale and momentum is building across due to its fast-growing holder base. This isn’t hype, it’s execution at scale, and that’s what makes it the best crypto to buy now .

In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Elizabeth, who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, said, “Nobody is safe, not even the chairman of the Federal Reserve,” and warned that Trump’s interpretation of executive power means “all the power belongs to the king.” Elizabeth made the statement in Washington, D.C., just hours after Powell met with Treasury and Fed officials on the inflation trajectory. She accused Trump of overstepping legal limits to fire officials from independent agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Elizabeth helped set up after the 2008 crash. “If he can just mow through every civil servant,” she said, “it’s a form of lawlessness.” She believes the president’s actions violate federal law. Warren hits Powell’s record and calls out Musk’s mass firings Elizabeth reminded Bloomberg that she had opposed Powell’s reappointment by former president Joe Biden, pointing to Powell’s support for loosening financial rules. She accused Powell of siding with Wall Street interests and warned that deregulating the banking sector would eventually hurt everyday people. Still, she said she supported the Fed’s independence and that of agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Inspectors General, who have all been targeted under Trump’s return to power. During the same interview, Elizabeth called out Trump and Elon Musk for firing massive numbers of federal workers and terminating government contracts. She called it “lawlessness” and said it could destabilize the system designed to protect both markets and workers. She added that cutting rules that protect investors would wreck confidence in U.S. markets, saying, “The reason our stock market is so valuable is in part because it has level, transparent rules that are strictly enforced.” She also targeted Paul Atkins, who Trump wants to install as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Elizabeth blamed Paul for voting in favor of weaker regulations before the financial crash of 2008 and said he hadn’t learned anything since then. “He had the chance to have 20-20 hindsight,” she said. “He has 20-zero hindsight.” Elizabeth, one of the Senate’s most outspoken progressives, also took aim at Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for backing down on a procedural move that could have blocked a Republican spending bill earlier this month. That bill kept the government open, but many Democrats wanted to use the moment to push back against Musk’s federal firings. Elizabeth said: “I think there’s a moment when you stand and fight. We cannot avoid this fight, because Donald Trump and Elon Musk, truly they want to take this country over for just a handful of people and they want even more wealth and power to go to them while everybody else has to pay for it.” Bostic cuts forecast as tariffs drag inflation outlook While the political fights played out in Washington, Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, appeared on Monday in a Bloomberg interview and lowered his rate-cut forecast. Earlier this year, Raphael had expected two rate cuts in 2025. Now he’s predicting just one, citing Trump’s tariffs as the key reason. “I moved to one mainly because I think we’re going to see inflation be very bumpy and not move dramatically and in a clear way to the 2% target,” he said. Raphael now expects inflation to settle around the Fed’s 2% target sometime in early 2027, which is even later than the Fed’s own projection in September 2024, when officials thought 2026 was more realistic. This adjustment aligns with the Fed’s most recent forecast, issued last week. Despite Raphael’s cautious tone, the Fed still says it sees a half-point rate cut coming this year, which would mean two reductions of 25 basis points. But that number is just the median. A closer look shows that more officials now expect either one cut or none at all next year. Trump demands immediate rate cuts as Powell hesitates Trump, meanwhile, wants rate cuts now. During a Cabinet meeting at the White House this week, he said, “Generally, prices are coming down, and energy prices are coming down, and I hope the Fed lowers interest rates, and then you get to see interest rates coming down.” Last week, he also posted online that the Fed should start slashing now before his new tariffs kick in on April 2. Those tariffs are already affecting the Fed’s inflation models, according to Jerome Powell, who acknowledged that rising trade costs are being considered in their economic forecasts. But the Fed isn’t moving just yet. Officials are still waiting for more data, even though investors are growing restless. The Fed’s latest inflation report showed slower price increases for both consumer and producer goods in February, but deeper numbers suggest the central bank’s 2% inflation goal could be delayed. The biggest problem is Trump’s trade policy, which throws uncertainty into every model Powell’s team is working with. Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer for Global Fixed Income at BlackRock, said on Wednesday, “Uncertainty was a highlight of the statement.” He explained that both the market and the Fed are stuck in limbo and need time to figure out what to do next. Powell told reporters that the Fed has to stick with earlier projections for now, saying, “There is a level of inertia” until more clarity emerges. But time might be running out, especially if Trump’s tariff policies escalate through the summer. There’s also concern that the Fed might cut rates for the wrong reason — not because inflation is easing, but because growth is slowing and the job market is weakening. That would signal weakness, not strength, and investors may not like what comes next. Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday: “Everybody wants two cuts, three cuts, four cuts. You don’t want any cuts. You want earnings growth. You want a strong economy. Be careful what you wish for.” Even though Powell has held a more hawkish line, markets still priced in three rate cuts by the end of this year, up from two. That shift was reported by Bloomberg, based on traders reacting to the latest projections. But Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, warned that none of it might play out as expected. He said the Fed’s forecast models — especially the dot plot — haven’t exactly nailed it over the last five years. “The ‘dot plot’ and [the Fed’s] projections have not been super reliable over the last five years,” he said. He pointed to political chaos and economic confusion as reasons not to trust the numbers. “When the path forward is so unclear,” Ross said, “you just take it with a grain of salt, go back to basics, and focus on the drivers of either the individual equities or the sectors in the market that you own. In this case, thinking about things like earnings and long rates, rather than what the Fed is doing at the short end of the curve.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Recent data reveals a noteworthy shift in the digital asset landscape. As cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gain popularity, global banks are seemingly adjusting their strategies, leading to a decrease in their direct cryptocurrency holdings. Let’s dive into this intriguing development and understand what it means for the future of finance and crypto. Why are Global Banks’ Crypto Holdings Declining? The ETF Effect The primary driver behind this shift appears to be the rise of crypto ETFs impact . These investment vehicles offer a regulated and perhaps more palatable way for institutional investors, including banks, to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. Instead of managing the complexities and security risks associated with direct spot cryptocurrency holdings , banks can now invest in ETFs that track the performance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Consider these points to understand the ETF effect: Ease of Access: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through existing brokerage accounts. This simplifies the investment process for banks accustomed to traditional financial instruments. Regulatory Comfort: Regulated ETFs provide a layer of compliance and oversight that might be more comfortable for risk-averse institutions like banks, especially compared to the often-murky waters of direct crypto custody. Diversification within Crypto: Crypto ETFs can offer diversified exposure to the crypto market, reducing the risk associated with holding individual cryptocurrencies. Liquidity: ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing banks to easily buy and sell their crypto exposure as needed, which might be less straightforward with direct cryptocurrency holdings. The Numbers Speak: A Snapshot of Banks’ Crypto Holdings Decline According to a CoinDesk report, citing data from the Basel Committee crypto on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the numbers clearly illustrate this downward trend. In the second quarter of 2024, an estimated 29 banks worldwide held $368.3 billion in cryptocurrencies. While this figure might seem substantial, it’s crucial to look at it in context. The proportion of spot cryptocurrency holdings within these banks’ overall assets is currently less than 3%. This figure represents a significant decline when compared to earlier periods, although specific historical data for direct comparison within the article is limited. To put this in perspective, let’s consider the BCBS’s recommendation: BCBS Recommendation: Back in December 2022, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision advised that banks’ spot cryptocurrency holdings should ideally not exceed 2% of their total assets. Current Status: While the current proportion is “less than 3%”, it’s important to note that it’s still slightly above the recommended threshold from 2022. However, the direction of travel is clearly downwards, indicating banks are actively managing their direct crypto exposure. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and Regulatory Influence The Basel Committee crypto on Banking Supervision plays a pivotal role in setting global standards for the regulation of banks. Their recommendations, although not legally binding in every jurisdiction, carry significant weight and influence how global banks crypto approach digital assets. Key aspects of BCBS’s influence include: Risk Management Framework: BCBS provides guidelines for banks to assess and manage the risks associated with crypto assets. This framework encourages a cautious approach, particularly towards volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Capital Requirements: The committee’s recommendations often include guidelines on capital requirements for banks holding crypto assets. Higher capital requirements can make holding certain crypto assets less attractive from a capital efficiency perspective. Promoting Stability: BCBS’s primary objective is to enhance financial stability globally. Their cautious stance on direct banks crypto holdings decline reflects a broader concern about the potential risks that cryptocurrencies could pose to the traditional banking system. Guidance Evolution: It’s important to note that the regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated with traditional finance, BCBS’s guidance and recommendations are likely to adapt as well. What Does This Trend Mean for the Future of Crypto and Banks? The observed banks crypto holdings decline , coupled with the rise of crypto ETFs, signals an evolving trend in how traditional financial institutions are engaging with the cryptocurrency space. It’s not necessarily a retreat from crypto, but rather a strategic shift towards potentially less risky and more regulatory-compliant avenues for exposure. Here’s a look at the potential implications: Mainstream Adoption via ETFs: Crypto ETFs could become a primary vehicle for mainstream and institutional crypto adoption, channeling investment through regulated and familiar structures. Shift in Bank Strategy: Banks might focus more on offering crypto-related services, such as custody solutions for ETFs or advisory services, rather than directly holding large amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Regulatory Clarity and Growth: As regulations surrounding crypto ETFs and digital assets become clearer globally, we could see further growth in these regulated crypto investment products. Continued Bank Interest in Blockchain: While direct crypto holdings might decrease, banks’ interest in blockchain technology and its applications is likely to remain strong, as they explore use cases beyond just cryptocurrency investments. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto-Banking Landscape The data indicating a decline in global banks crypto direct holdings is a significant development, highlighting the dynamic interplay between traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. The surge in popularity of crypto ETFs impact appears to be a key catalyst, offering banks a different, potentially more palatable route to participate in the crypto space. As the regulatory landscape continues to mature and crypto ETFs gain further traction, it will be fascinating to observe how banks crypto holdings decline trend evolves and shapes the future of institutional crypto adoption. This isn’t necessarily a bearish signal for crypto; instead, it may represent a strategic recalibration as banks navigate the complexities and opportunities presented by digital assets in a rapidly changing financial world.

While fluctuations are inevitable, some altcoins are breaking barriers with real-world applications and cutting-edge innovations. Qubetics (TICS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Gala (GALA) are at the forefront, making waves with major updates. Arbitrum DAO is debating whether to withdraw funding from its Gaming Catalyst Program due to concerns over transparency. Meanwhile, Gala Games has introduced staking for its native token, giving its 1.5 million users a new way to engage with the ecosystem. These moves could reshape their respective communities, but one project is standing out for its ability to solve long-standing issues in blockchain utility—Qubetics. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another crypto token; it’s a powerful force in Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization. By transforming physical assets into digital tokens, Qubetics unlocks liquidity, broadens market accessibility, and simplifies asset ownership. Qubetics: Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is revolutionizing asset ownership by digitizing real-world assets on the blockchain. This means that traditionally illiquid assets, such as luxury real estate, can be fractionally owned, bought, or sold in a seamless, borderless manner. For decades, investing in high-value assets required substantial capital and extensive legal processes. Qubetics eliminates these barriers by allowing asset tokenization. For instance, instead of needing millions to own a stake in a prime real estate property, a user can buy fractional tokens that represent small portions of the property’s value. With a presale price of $0.1300 and a projected ROI of 669% at $1, Qubetics is rapidly gaining traction among enterprises, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts who recognize its long-term potential. With over $15.5 million raised, more than 503 million $TICS tokens sold, and 23,800+ token holders already on board, this is no ordinary presale. Currently in its 27th stage, the price is still accessible, but every phase sees an increase, meaning those who act now are locking in the lowest possible cost before the token hits the open market, one of the best altcoins to invest in now. What a $1,000 Investment Looks Like Right Now At the current crypto presale price of $0.1300, a $1,000 investment secures 7,692 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics hits $1, that $1,000 turns into $7,692. At $5 per $TICS, the same investment skyrockets to $38,460, and if Qubetics reaches $10, the value explodes to $76,920. With over 503 million tokens already sold, every passing stage sees an increase in price, reducing the potential returns for those who hesitate. Qubetics isn’t waiting for mainstream adoption—it’s building the infrastructure that will drive it. Blockchain interoperability isn’t a future dream; it’s happening now. Those securing $TICS at this stage are positioning themselves for what could be one of the most explosive blockchain transformations of the decade. Arbitrum (ARB): Governance & Security Challenges Arbitrum, a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is facing governance and security concerns. The Arbitrum DAO is debating whether to withdraw funding from its Gaming Catalyst Program, which allocated 225 million ARB tokens to support Web3 gaming. Transparency concerns have led to calls for reallocating the funds to one of the best altcoins to invest in now. On March 10, 2025, a vulnerability in Arbitrum’s signature verification system led to unauthorized transactions and a loss of $140,000. The issue has been addressed, but it highlights the importance of ongoing security enhancements. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even established blockchain networks must continuously evolve to stay ahead of potential threats. Gala (GALA): Staking & User Engagement Gala Games is taking a major step forward in its blockchain gaming ecosystem with the introduction of staking options for GALA tokens. With over 1.5 million active players and 21 developed games, this new feature is set to reshape how participants interact with the platform. By allowing token holders to lock up their assets in exchange for rewards, staking is expected to drive higher demand for GALA by reducing its circulating supply one of the best altcoins to invest in now. This move also strengthens user engagement by encouraging long-term holding, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and robust token economy. As more players and developers recognize the benefits of staking, Gala Games continues to solidify its position as a leader in blockchain gaming, ensuring a thriving ecosystem that benefits both gamers and token holders alike. Analyst projections for GALA vary. CoinCodex predicts a potential rise to $0.63998 by April 2025, while Changelly suggests a possible 1.1% decrease by March 26, 2025. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, Gala’s commitment to expansion remains strong. Conclusion Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Gala are shaping the crypto market in distinct ways. While Arbitrum navigates governance and security challenges, and Gala introduces new staking mechanisms, Qubetics is forging a future where real-world assets seamlessly integrate with blockchain technology. For those seeking the best altcoins to invest in now , staying informed on these evolving projects could unlock exciting opportunities. With Qubetics’ presale gaining momentum, Arbitrum refining its governance, and Gala enhancing its staking ecosystem, these three altcoins remain pivotal players in the crypto space.

42456336,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143644,1743042049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: Crypto Firms Demand DOJ Clarity on Money Transmitter Rules,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-firms-doj-clarity-rules/,"Is the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) casting a shadow over the future of crypto innovation? Over 30 leading crypto firms are raising serious concerns about the DOJ’s interpretation of money transmitter rules, arguing it could stifle development and push innovation overseas. Let’s dive into why these companies are ringing alarm bells and what it means for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). Why are Crypto Firms Calling for DOJ Clarity on Money Transmitter Rules? At the heart of the issue is Section 1960, a statute designed to combat illegal money transmitting. While its original intent is clear, crypto firms argue that the DOJ is applying an overly broad interpretation, particularly in cases like the recent Tornado Cash sanctions. This broad interpretation, spearheaded by the DOJ, is seen as a significant departure from established FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) guidelines, creating a murky legal landscape for developers, especially those working on non-custodial software. Here’s a breakdown of the key concerns: Threat to Non-Custodial Software: The DOJ’s stance is perceived as a direct threat to developers of non-custodial software. Non-custodial software is crucial for DeFi, empowering users to maintain control of their own digital assets. If developers are deemed money transmitters simply for creating and distributing this software, it could severely hamper innovation. Bypassing FinCEN Guidance: FinCEN is the primary regulatory body for money transmission in the U.S. The crypto industry feels the DOJ is bypassing FinCEN’s more nuanced approach, creating regulatory confusion and uncertainty. Legal Uncertainty and Innovation Chill: The lack of legal clarity is creating a chilling effect. Firms are hesitant to invest and innovate in the U.S. when the legal boundaries are unclear and potentially punitive. This could lead to an exodus of crypto talent and development to more welcoming jurisdictions. In a strongly worded letter to Congress, spearheaded by the DeFi Education Fund, these crypto firms are urging lawmakers to step in and provide much-needed clarification. They are seeking a clear legislative intent that explicitly protects U.S.-based crypto and DeFi development from overly aggressive interpretations of money transmitter laws. The Tornado Cash Case: A Lightning Rod for Concerns The Tornado Cash saga is a prime example of why the industry is so concerned. Tornado Cash, a decentralized privacy tool, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department, with implications extending to developers who contributed to its code. The DOJ’s approach in this case has been interpreted by many as equating software code with money transmission itself. This is a dangerous precedent, according to industry experts, as it could criminalize the very act of writing and sharing open-source code. What are the Potential Ramifications of Vague DOJ Money Transmitter Rules? The consequences of the DOJ’s broad interpretation of DOJ money transmitter rules could be far-reaching and detrimental to the U.S. crypto industry. Let’s consider some potential outcomes: Ramification Description Innovation Stifled Fear of prosecution could discourage developers from building and deploying innovative DeFi applications and non-custodial tools within the U.S. Brain Drain Crypto talent and businesses may relocate to countries with clearer and more favorable regulatory frameworks, diminishing the U.S.’s position in the global crypto landscape. Reduced Competitiveness U.S.-based crypto firms could become less competitive compared to their international counterparts operating in more innovation-friendly environments. Hindered DeFi Growth The development and adoption of DeFi, a sector with immense potential for financial inclusion and innovation, could be significantly hampered. The Call for Action: Seeking Legislative Solutions for Legal Clarity The crypto industry’s plea is clear: they need Congress to step in and provide legal clarity . This isn’t just about protecting crypto firms ; it’s about fostering innovation, ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in technological advancement, and allowing the responsible growth of the digital asset ecosystem. The letter to Congress is a proactive step, urging lawmakers to: Clarify Legislative Intent: Explicitly define the scope of Section 1960 to ensure it doesn’t inadvertently target software developers and non-custodial technology providers. Reinforce FinCEN’s Role: Reaffirm FinCEN as the primary regulatory authority for money transmission within the crypto space, ensuring a consistent and expert-led approach. Promote Innovation-Friendly Regulation: Develop a regulatory framework that balances consumer protection and compliance with the need to encourage innovation and technological progress in the crypto sector. What’s Next? The Path to Regulatory Certainty for Crypto and DeFi The coming months will be crucial. Will Congress heed the call from crypto firms and take action to provide the necessary legal clarity ? The response will not only shape the future of the U.S. crypto industry but also send a powerful message about the nation’s commitment to innovation and technological leadership. The industry is watching closely, hoping for a positive resolution that fosters growth and ensures the U.S. remains at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. The demand for DOJ money transmitter rules clarification is not just about compliance; it’s about creating an environment where innovation can flourish, where developers feel safe to build, and where the U.S. can harness the transformative potential of crypto and DeFi.

Bitcoin Accumulation Rises Among Whales In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a notable increase in BTC whale activity. He shared the following chart showing that 48 new wallets now hold 100 or more BTC. A surge in whale accumulation often signals rising confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The leading digital asset has climbed over 15% from its March 10 low of approximately $76,600. As of writing, BTC is trading in the high $80,000s. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surge Fueled by $32B in Open Interest—Here’s What Could Happen Next Renewed optimism around BTC’s price trajectory stems from several recent macroeconomic developments, including cooler than expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data for February and reports of US President Donald Trump adopting a softer stance on retaliatory tariffs scheduled to go into effect from April 2. On-chain intelligence firm Arkham reported long-dormant BTC whales becoming active again. In an X post, the firm highlighted how a wallet that held $3 million worth of BTC in 2017, recently became active after 8 years, with its holdings now valued at close to $250 million. Fellow crypto analyst Crypto Rover shared the following chart, illustrating a sharp rise in whale accumulation since late 2024. It is worth noting that the data excludes wallets tied to non-US exchanges and US Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Is BTC Eyeing A New Record High? Several crypto analysts believe BTC may have already bottomed out this cycle and entered a new bullish phase, potentially setting the stage for a fresh all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Pattern Returns – Is A Massive Uptrend Imminent? Noted crypto entrepreneur and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently suggested that BTC ‘probably’ hit this cycle’s bottom during the March 10 dip to $76,600. Hayes added that while bottom may be in for BTC, stocks could still face further downside. Momentum indicators – such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – also appear bullish. Bitcoin’s daily RSI recently broke out of a multi-month downtrend, fuelling hopes of sustained upward momentum. Additionally, Martinez projected that BTC could surge to $112,000 if it decisively breaks the $94,000 resistance level. However, a drop below $76,000 could open the door to a deeper decline, potentially falling to $58,000. Moreover, in their latest investor memo, digital asset management firm Bitwise hinted that on a risk-adjusted basis, now could be an opportune time to buy BTC. As of press time, BTC is trading at $88,069, up 1% in the last 24 hours.

42456727,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143655,1743042646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Leak: Chinese AI Censorship Machine Exposed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chinese-ai-censorship-machine-exposed/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and digital freedom, the specter of censorship looms large. Imagine a world where even the subtlest dissent is flagged, where algorithms decide what you can and cannot see. This isn’t a dystopian fantasy; it’s the reality emerging from a massive data leak exposing China’s sophisticated AI Censorship Machine . Bitcoin World’s exclusive investigation reveals how China is supercharging its censorship capabilities using advanced AI, raising profound questions about digital rights and the future of online freedom globally. Are we on the brink of a new era of AI-powered authoritarianism? Let’s dive into the shocking details. Unveiling the Chinese AI Censorship Machine: A Data Leak Revelation A recently leaked database, uncovered by security researcher NetAskari and analyzed by Bitcoin World, paints a chilling picture of China’s escalating efforts to control online narratives. This isn’t just about blocking keywords like ‘Tiananmen Square’; it’s a leap into a new era of AI powered censorship . The data exposes a system trained on a staggering 133,000 examples of content deemed ‘sensitive’ by the Chinese government. What kind of content triggers these alarms? Social Unrest Indicators: Complaints about poverty, corruption, and labor disputes are flagged as ‘highest priority’. Political Satire: Even subtle jokes or historical analogies targeting current political figures are instantly flagged. Taiwan and Military Matters: Any mention of Taiwan politics, military movements, or weaponry is heavily scrutinized. Public Protests Triggers: Issues like pollution and food safety scandals, known to spark public demonstrations, are closely monitored. This isn’t just keyword filtering; this is a sophisticated LLM censorship China system designed to understand context and nuance, making it far more effective than traditional methods. Xiao Qiang, a UC Berkeley researcher specializing in Chinese censorship, confirms this, stating it’s “clear evidence” of the Chinese government using LLMs to enhance repression. He emphasizes the increased “efficiency and granularity of state-led information control” compared to human-labor-intensive methods. How Does This AI Censorship Machine Work? The leaked data reveals a system eerily similar to prompting ChatGPT. It tasks an unnamed Large Language Model (LLM) to assess content for sensitivity related to ‘politics, social life, and the military.’ Content deemed sensitive is flagged as ‘highest priority.’ The system’s creators are clearly leveraging the power of AI to automate and refine censorship at an unprecedented scale. Key Features of the AI Censorship System: Feature Description LLM Powered Utilizes a Large Language Model for content analysis, moving beyond simple keyword filtering. Extensive Training Data Trained on 133,000 examples of ‘sensitive’ content, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Prioritization Ranks flagged content by priority, focusing on ‘highest priority’ items for immediate action. Proactive Detection Aims to detect subtle dissent and nuanced criticism, not just blatant violations. The system’s goal, according to the data, is for ‘public opinion work’ – a term experts identify as Chinese government jargon for censorship and propaganda. Michael Caster from Article 19 explains this ‘public opinion work’ is managed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), with the aim of enforcing government narratives online and eliminating dissenting voices. President Xi Jinping himself has called the internet the “frontline” of this ‘public opinion work.’ Examples of Censored Content: Glimpse into the Database Bitcoin World analyzed representative samples from the 133,000 data points, revealing the breadth of content targeted by this Chinese AI Censorship system. These examples provide a stark look at what the Chinese government deems unacceptable for public consumption: Rural Poverty: Posts lamenting the decline of rural Chinese towns and the struggles of remaining residents. Local Corruption: Complaints from business owners about police extortion and corruption. CCP Corruption: News reports about Communist Party officials expelled for corruption and ‘superstitions’. Taiwan Military Analysis: Commentary on Taiwan’s military capabilities and Chinese military developments. Subtle Political Criticism: Anecdotes using idioms to indirectly criticize power dynamics and political transitions. The sheer volume of mentions of ‘Taiwan’ (台湾) – over 15,000 times – highlights the extreme sensitivity surrounding this topic. Even subtle forms of dissent, like using idioms to comment on power transitions, are targeted, demonstrating the system’s sophistication and reach. The Broader Implications: AI Censorship Globally This leak isn’t just about China. It’s a warning sign for digital freedom worldwide. The adoption of AI Censorship Machine technology by authoritarian regimes is accelerating. OpenAI itself reported catching Chinese entities using LLMs to track and smear dissidents. This trend signifies a dangerous shift towards more efficient and pervasive digital repression. Key Takeaways: Escalating AI Repression: Authoritarian governments are rapidly adopting AI to enhance censorship and surveillance. Beyond Keyword Blocking: AI-powered censorship is far more sophisticated, capable of understanding context and nuance. Global Implications: This technology could be exported and adopted by other regimes, further shrinking digital freedom. Urgent Need for Scrutiny: We must critically examine the ethical and human rights implications of AI-driven censorship. The Future of Digital Freedom: Fighting Back Against AI Censorship As China AI Surveillance capabilities grow, so too must our vigilance and efforts to protect digital freedom. Understanding how these AI censorship systems operate is the first step. Supporting organizations that fight for online freedom and privacy is crucial. The fight for a free and open internet is becoming increasingly complex, but it’s a fight we cannot afford to lose. This data leak serves as a stark reminder: the battle for online freedom is ongoing, and the stakes are higher than ever. The rise of AI-powered censorship demands our attention, our action, and our unwavering commitment to a free and open digital world.

Aljarrah and Farina pointed to rising credit card defaults, tightening lending standards, and increasing living costs as indicators of a weakening financial system. Aljarrah highlighted a trend among the wealthy, moving capital into tangible assets such as gold, silver, and natural resources. He argued that fiat currencies are deliberately devalued, forcing individuals to liquidate assets. The Role of Blockchain in the New Financial System They examined the relationship between stablecoins and CBDCs, proposing a future where a two-tier banking system incorporates asset-backed digital currencies pegged to real-world commodities. They emphasized the importance of XRP and XLM in this two-tier monetary system , referencing documents from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding trust bridges , which could play a role in this transition. According to them, the existing system collapses while a new digital framework is being constructed. Digital assets like XRP and XLM, including gold and silver, will play critical roles in this transition. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This comes just a day after the company revealed its Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Gamestop To Raise $1.3B Through Convertible Notes The company plans to issue $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes, targeting qualified institutional buyers, with a five-year maturity. It also granted the initial purchasers a 13-day option to buy up to an additional $200 million in notes, bringing the potential total raise to $1.5 billion. The notes will carry a 0% coupon and will mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier. GameStop plans to use the funds raised from the offering for general corporate purposes, including buying bitcoin in line with its Investment Policy. GME Follows MSTR’s Strategy With this move, GameStop joins companies like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), Semler Scientific (SMLR), Marathon Digital (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT), which have also issued convertible debt to fund bitcoin purchases. Michael Saylor initiated a poll on X, asking how much bitcoin GameStop needs to buy to gain respect from Bitcoiners. 1B at least pic.twitter.com/SBsT1b8fxZ — Alex (@AlexesNakamoto) March 26, 2025 GME Stock Dips 8% However, GameStop (GME) stock dropped over 8% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company revealed plans to raise funds for Bitcoin. This follows a 12% surge in GameStop shares just a day earlier when the company announced that its board had unanimously approved adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserve assets. Concerns about potential share dilution could have led to the drop. However, like MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy boosted MSTR, GameStop’s move could drive long-term growth for its stock. Bitcoin has bounced back from its earlier lows, rising to $87,000 after briefly dipping to $86,000. GameStop’s planned Bitcoin investment follows reports from CNBC a month earlier that the company was exploring cryptocurrency. The interest in crypto was further fueled by CEO Ryan Cohen’s post with MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, who holds over 447,000 Bitcoins. Wall Street Skeptical Over The Move While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin bet has boosted its stock by 84% over the past year, Wall Street remains skeptical about GameStop’s move.

The SEC’s decision not to challenge the 2023 ruling by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres brings much-needed clarity to the question of whether XRP should be classified as a security. Judge’s Ruling on XRP Sales Judge Torres had previously ruled that Ripple’s “programmatic sales” of XRP on secondary exchanges did not violate securities laws. However, the direct sale of XRP to institutional investors was found to be in violation of securities regulations. With the SEC choosing not to appeal, this ruling stands as a key precedent in the cryptocurrency space. Settlement Details: SEC Returns $75 Million As part of the settlement, the SEC has agreed to return $75 million of the $125 million fine originally imposed on Ripple by a New York judge in 2022, leaving $50 million to settle the case. Ripple’s Future Sales to Institutional Investors Amid the excitement, one user on X (formerly Twitter) commented that the lifting of the SEC’s injunction would now allow Ripple to sell directly to institutional investors. The user said that while Ripple would still need to adhere to securities laws, it would no longer be required to go through over-the-counter (OTC) desks and could sell directly to entities like hedge funds or private equity firms. Clarification from Former SEC Attorney However, former SEC attorney Marc Fagel clarified that while the injunction is lifted, the original ruling that Ripple’s sales to institutional investors violated the law still stands. I haven't gone back to revisit the order. But to the extent any future sales are sold in similar fashion as the institutional sales described in the order, they would continue to pose problems under Section 5 (at least if the SEC were still invested in the case). — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 25, 2025 Fagel explained that while the SEC will no longer pursue enforcement of the case, Ripple’s sales to institutional investors may still face legal challenges under Section 5 of the Securities Act if they are conducted in a similar manner as before. Impact on Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity Product When asked about the impact on Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, Fagel responded that the ruling would likely alleviate some of the restrictions Ripple faced, particularly regarding how it could sell XRP. However, he warned that if Ripple were to resume sales in the same manner as those deemed illegal, it could still face legal issues, though the SEC would no longer actively pursue enforcement.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 02:55:14

Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence said in a March 26 post to X that the trader attempted to manipulate the system to profit from price movements, withdrawing collateral before Hyperliquid’s liquidation system could catch up. The trader opened three accounts within five minutes of each other, two with $2.15 million and $1.9 million long positions, and the third a $4.1 million short, to cancel out the long positions , according to Arkham in a post-mortem report. “This allowed him to build up leverage in an attempt to drain funds from Hyperliquid,” Arkham said. Source: Arkham When the price of Jelly pumped by over 400%, the $4 million short position entered liquidation, but the open short didn’t liquidate immediately because it was too large and instead passed to the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP), which is supposed to liquidate the position. At the same time, the trader withdrew collateral from the other two accounts while having a “7-figure positive PnL to withdraw from,” Arkham said. However, the “exploiter” quickly hit a wall when the accounts, which still had millions in unrealized profit and loss, were restricted to reduce-only orders, forcing them to sell the tokens in the first account on the market to recoup some of the funds. Source: Arkham Hyperliquid eventually closed the Jelly token market at a price of 0.0095, the same price as the trader’s short trade, which “zeroed out all floating PnL on the first two exploiter accounts.” In total, Arkham says the trader withdrew $6.26 million, but at least $1 million is still in the accounts. “Assuming he can withdraw this at some point in the future, his actions on Hyperliquid have cost him a total of $4,000. If he is unable to, he faces a loss of almost $1 million,” the blockchain analytics firm said. Hyperliquid has since delisted perpetual futures tied to the JELLY token , citing evidence of suspicious market activity. Other traders have been using similar tactics This isn’t the first time Hyperliquid has had issues like this. On March 14, Hyperliquid increased margin requirements for traders after its liquidity pool lost millions of dollars during a massive Ether ( ETH ) liquidation.

F. Sharapov Russian Economic Society and a Doctor of Economics. Russian Economist: Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Talk ‘Like Laying Landmines’ Katasonov said he was concerned about the need for Russia “to take a cautious approach” to the idea of “creating a crypto reserve.” Valentin Katasonov, the Chairman of the S. F. Sharapov Russian Economic Society. (Source: Ministerstvo Idey/YouTube/Screenshot) The economist used an allegory to explain his point of view, equating creating a national crypto reserve to “laying landmines” in Russia. Katasonov claimed that cryptoassets were “not fully fledged” forms of “money,” but “rather speculative tools that can pose threats to the economy.” “[Talk about creating strategic crypto reserves] is way of inflating bubbles. If the bubble bursts, everything will be fine as long as the economy holds up. But, regardless, there will still be many victims.” Katasonov Stores selling Russian products have spread across China, and now Moscow is seizing on the interest with a plan for a major expansion of its own https://t.co/QYYmkpu6rv — Bloomberg (@business) March 26, 2025 Economist: ‘Russian Crypto Advocates Are Fifth Columnists’ Katasonov hit out at crypto advocates who call for the “introduction of tokens” into “the official economic system.” He called them “fifth columnists,” and suggested they intended to “undermine the country’s economic security.” A Central Bank office building in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Dzasohovich [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The economist also cast doubt on other countries’ plans to launch strategic Bitcoin reserves. He noted that “while some countries, such as the United States, are considering creating Bitcoin (BTC) reserves,” the process was “still far from practical implementation.” Katasonov concluded that “no country” in the world has yet “had a successful experience launching official crypto reserves.” Some critics may point to the example of El Salvador, whose government embarked on a bullish program of Bitcoin buying in 2021. However, in recent months, the question of El Salvador’s BTC-purchasing has come under the spotlight of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which disaproves of the nation’s Bitcoin pivot.

Think again! Recent data has revealed a surprising reality: the vast majority of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading actually happens outside of U.S. borders. Let’s dive into this eye-opening data and explore why the global stage is stealing the spotlight when it comes to crypto. The Shocking Numbers: US Exchanges Play a Smaller Role Than You Think According to a recent report from Unfolded, powered by data from Kaiko, the numbers are quite stark. Only a small fraction of global Ethereum trading and Bitcoin trading volume originates from exchanges based in the United States. Specifically: Ethereum (ETH) Trading: A mere 8.6% of global ETH trading volume occurs on U.S. exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) Trading: Slightly higher, but still surprisingly low, at 11.5% of global BTC trading volume on U.S. platforms. These figures paint a clear picture: the crypto market is truly global, and the lion’s share of activity is happening elsewhere. But where exactly, and why is this the case? Where is the Real Crypto Action Happening? Exploring Global Markets If the U.S. isn’t the primary hub for crypto exchanges , then where is all the trading volume concentrated? The data suggests a much more distributed landscape, with significant activity in regions like: Asia: Exchanges in Asia, particularly in countries like South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong, have historically been major players in the crypto space. Their early adoption and large tech-savvy populations contribute to substantial trading volumes. Europe: European exchanges are also gaining prominence, with regions like Eastern Europe and countries with favorable crypto regulations attracting significant trading activity. Emerging Markets: Countries in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia are increasingly embracing cryptocurrencies as alternative financial tools, leading to growing trading volumes in these regions. This global distribution highlights the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency market itself. Unlike traditional finance, which is often centered around major financial hubs like New York or London, crypto operates on a worldwide stage. Why Are US Exchanges Losing Ground in Crypto Trading? Several factors contribute to the relatively smaller share of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading volume on US exchanges . Let’s break down some key reasons: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States remains somewhat unclear and fragmented. This uncertainty can create hurdles for crypto exchanges operating in the US, potentially driving some trading activity to more favorably regulated jurisdictions. Stringent Compliance Requirements: U.S. regulations are known to be rigorous, requiring significant compliance efforts and costs for crypto exchanges . These stringent requirements can make it more challenging and expensive to operate in the U.S. compared to some other regions. Global Crypto Adoption: Cryptocurrency adoption is a global phenomenon. Many regions outside the U.S. have seen rapid crypto adoption, driven by factors like limited access to traditional banking, high inflation, and a desire for alternative financial systems. This organic growth in global adoption naturally leads to higher trading volumes outside of the US. Competition from International Exchanges: International crypto exchanges have become increasingly sophisticated and competitive, offering a wide range of services and often lower fees. This intense global competition can draw trading volume away from US-based platforms. Benefits of a Globally Distributed Crypto Market While the smaller share of US exchange volume might seem surprising, a globally distributed crypto exchanges market actually offers several benefits: Increased Resilience: Decentralization is a core tenet of crypto. A globally distributed trading market reduces reliance on any single jurisdiction, making the overall crypto ecosystem more resilient to regional regulatory changes or economic shocks. Wider Access to Crypto: With trading activity spread across various regions, individuals around the world have greater access to cryptocurrencies. This broader accessibility promotes financial inclusion and empowers individuals globally. Innovation and Competition: Global competition among crypto exchanges fosters innovation and drives improvements in services, security, and user experience. This competitive environment ultimately benefits crypto users worldwide. Reduced Regulatory Risk: Diversification across multiple jurisdictions can help mitigate regulatory risks. If one region imposes restrictive regulations, the global market can continue to function, albeit with potential shifts in trading volume. Challenges of a Globally Distributed Crypto Market Of course, a decentralized global market also presents certain challenges: Regulatory Fragmentation: The lack of harmonized global regulations can create complexities for crypto exchanges operating across multiple jurisdictions. Navigating diverse regulatory frameworks can be challenging and costly. Enforcement Issues: Cross-border enforcement of regulations and combating illicit activities in a globally distributed market can be more complex than in a centralized system. Market Fragmentation: While global distribution is beneficial, excessive fragmentation could potentially lead to liquidity issues or price discrepancies across different exchanges. However, arbitrage opportunities often help to mitigate these discrepancies. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this data, and how can you use this information? Diversify Your Exchange Usage: Don’t limit yourself to only US-based crypto exchanges . Explore reputable international platforms to potentially access a wider range of assets, features, and potentially lower fees. Stay Informed About Global Crypto Trends: Keep an eye on developments in global crypto markets , not just the US. Understanding global adoption patterns and regulatory trends can provide valuable insights into the future of crypto. Consider Regulatory Differences: Be aware of the regulatory landscape in different jurisdictions if you are trading on international crypto exchanges . Understand the compliance requirements and potential risks associated with each platform. Conclusion: The Global Crypto Revolution is Here The data is clear: the cryptocurrency market is a truly global phenomenon, with the majority of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading volume happening outside of the United States. This stunning revelation underscores the decentralized and international nature of crypto. While US exchanges remain important players, the future of crypto trading is undoubtedly global, offering both exciting opportunities and unique challenges. Embracing this global perspective is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

A flurry of factors appears to be affecting the investors’ sentiment, with recent trends and analysis indicating towards further slip ahead to about $0.6. However, despite that, experts remained bullish on the long-term trajectory of Pi Coin. Pi Network Price Slips 3%: What Lies Ahead? Pi price today was down around 3% and exchanged hands at $0.79, while its volume for the last 24 hours increased by 33% to $327 million. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour low of $0.77 from yesterday, indicating the gloomy sentiment hovering in the market. Notably, an article highlighted the key reasons behind the latest Pi price dip . Amid this, market watchers anticipate a further fall ahead, with some experts predicting a slump to even $0.6. However, despite that, the market watchers remained bullish, hinting at a potential breakout ahead. Will Pi Coin Slip To $0.6? A flurry of market experts anticipates a further dip in Pi Network price due to massive token unlocks ahead. According to PiScan data, a total of 105.96 million Pi will be unlocked over the next 30 days, worth around $85 million at the current price. The daily average unlock is around 3.5 million coins. This heavy influx could significantly dampen the investors’ sentiment. Besides, a lack of clarity from the Pi Core Team has further fueled concerns. On the other hand, the lack of major listings on leading crypto exchanges like Binance, which many were anticipating, has weighed on the sentiment. Besides, looking ahead to the next 12 months, 1.6 billion Pi Coins are set to be unlocked, with an average of 129 million per month. This trend is expected to continue until May 2028, with minimal changes. To mitigate this potential price drop, Pi enthusiasts are urging the Pi Core Team to implement measures to reduce circulation, such as burning mechanisms or smart contract features. Expert Predicts Dip To $0.6: What’s Next For Pi Network? Analyst bullstraders7 on TradingView noted that Pi Network price risks falling to $0.61 or even $0.6 in the coming days. This has further dampened the market sentiment, especially with soaring anticipation over a robust rally in Pi price. However, another expert Coinvo sees this latest dip as a buying opportunity. He said that “Pi RSI divergence” is signaling towards a “massive buy signal.” Besides, he also noted that the current “Fibonacci zone” could push the crypto to a new high ahead. Source: Coinvo, X Considering this analysis, Pi Network price could hit a new high in the coming days. However, a recent Pi Coin price prediction hints at a potential drop to $0.54 by next month. Having said that, investors should exercise due diligence before putting their bets into the market.

He made it clear that cars built within the country will not be affected, saying there’s “absolutely no tariff” for them. He signed the new trade order inside the Oval Office. According to a report from CNBC, Trump formalized the tariffs through a presidential proclamation. His longtime aide, Will Scharf, told reporters at the White House that the new rule includes foreign-made light trucks too, and stacks on top of all existing duties. “Over $100 billion of new annual revenue” is what Scharf claimed this move will generate for the U.S. Trump adds pressure on auto supply chains with parts enforcement Trump didn’t offer many specifics about how it’ll work, especially considering most vehicles today are built from thousands of individual parts sourced from several different countries. Still, he told reporters the government would launch “very strong policing” to monitor which components trigger the tariffs. That means federal agents will have to track exactly which parts are foreign and where they come from—no easy task in a system where even a single sedan might carry pieces from 20 different countries. The move instantly drew backlash from Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded within hours, saying the European Union would continue pursuing negotiations but wouldn’t roll over. “Tariffs are taxes — bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the US and the European Union,” she said in a formal statement Wednesday. As expected, the stock market didn’t sit still. After-hours trading saw shares of General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis all drop about 5%. All three companies have some manufacturing capacity outside the U.S., even though they assemble a lot of cars within it too. Trump didn’t throw them under the bus completely. He offered GM, Ford, and Stellantis a one-month exemption from the new 25% tariff—for imports from Mexico and Canada only—if their cars qualify under the rules in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. That deal replaces the old NAFTA structure and has stricter guidelines around regional production. The waiver is set to expire at the end of April. The announcement didn’t come out of nowhere. Trump already warned on Monday during a Cabinet meeting that auto tariffs were on the way. “We’ll be announcing that fairly soon over the next few days, probably, and then April 2 comes, that’ll be reciprocal tariffs,” he said earlier this week. The plan is part of what Trump calls his “reciprocal tariff” policy. It targets countries that impose high duties on U.S. goods but expect low barriers coming into the American market. Business executives say these surprise rollouts have made it impossible to plan ahead. Trump’s trade decisions change fast, and sometimes without notice. Even companies that support American manufacturing say they don’t know how to prepare anymore. Musk left out of decision, Tesla parts still vulnerable One person not involved in the decision was Elon Musk. Trump confirmed that himself Wednesday, telling reporters Musk “may have a conflict” and had “never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever.” Musk is Trump’s top advisor for federal operations, but this time he had no input. Musk’s involvement with the administration goes deeper than just advice. He donated $290 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign and currently leads the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is supposed to reduce federal spending and downsize bloated agencies. Even with that power, Musk didn’t weigh in on the car tariffs, according to Trump. That didn’t stop Tesla from getting a spotlight moment this month. Trump turned the White House’s South Lawn into a temporary Tesla display, ordering five of the company’s electric vehicles to be delivered so he could walk around and inspect them. Afterward, he posted on Truth Social that he was planning to buy one himself to “support Elon” and his companies. During the walkthrough, Trump called the designs “beautiful” and pointed at the sharp, stainless-steel Cybertruck. When asked whether Tesla would benefit from the new import penalties, Trump said the effect would likely be “net neutral or they may be good.” He pointed out that Tesla has major factories in Fremont, California and Austin, Texas, and repeated that “anybody that has plants in the United States — it’s going to be good for them.” But Tesla doesn’t build everything at home. The company recently wrote to the U.S. Trade Representative warning that “even with aggressive localization” of production, certain vehicle components are “difficult or impossible to source within the United States.” The list of imported parts includes suspension systems, brake assemblies, glass, panels, printed circuit boards, and other electrical gear. A lot of these still come from Canada, Mexico, and China. Tesla isn’t the only one with that problem, but their international parts footprint puts them in a tough spot. And while the tariffs don’t directly mention Tesla, any imported part can trigger a tax. The policing that Trump promised would mean border checks could flag individual parts even if the final car is assembled in Texas. There’s also a bigger fight happening in the electric vehicle market. More automakers are building EVs now than ever before, squeezing Tesla’s dominance. But not everyone gets to play in the American sandbox. BYD, the top electric vehicle manufacturer in China, still hasn’t been allowed to sell its cars in the U.S. With Trump in office and tariffs being thrown around like darts, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.

He drew attention to Tokentus Investment AG, a German venture capital firm actively educating its audience about XRP through detailed videos. His post contrasted the firm’s efforts with U.S. media platforms that “pretend it doesn’t exist,” fueling ongoing debates about how XRP is presented to investors globally. German financial news educating their audience on XRP while @cnbc tries to pretend it doesn't exist. We see you @SquawkCNBC @andrewrsorkin @BeckyQuick @JoeSquawk pic.twitter.com/4IsGidFT0W — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) March 24, 2025 Tokentus Investment AG’s Educational Efforts Tokentus Investment AG has consistently shared insights on XRP through its YouTube channel, covering topics ranging from regulatory status to price movements. In one of its latest videos, the firm reiterated that XRP does not classify as a security, addressing a long-standing debate that has shaped perceptions of the asset. The discussion also explored the differences between cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets, explaining that while a tokenized stock would inherently be considered a security, XRP does not fall into the same category. By clarifying these distinctions, Tokentus aims to equip investors with a clearer understanding of XRP’s role in the financial landscape. Tokentus’s Support for XRP Beyond regulatory topics, Tokentus has continually provided detailed market insights into XRP’s price trends. CEO Oliver Michel previously examined historical data to assess the asset’s growth potential. He pointed to the asset’s 4,300% surge from 2014 to 2017, suggesting that while such extreme growth is less likely this time, a significant rally remains possible. Based on historical patterns and broader market trends, he projected that the asset could rise by 2,000% , potentially reaching $8-$10. The CEO also previously discussed XRP’s role as the world reserve bridge currency , and he has big expectations for the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Media Coverage Disparities in the U.S. and Germany The community has long debated how the asset is portrayed in media, and Tokentus’s videos have reignited this conversation. Digital Asset Investor’s remarks suggested that German firms are actively educating investors about the asset, whereas major U.S. financial media outlets appear to downplay its significance. This view is shared by other community members, with some calling out Bitcoin maximalists. While this perspective continues to gain traction, it is worth noting that U.S. financial networks such as CNBC, Bloomberg, and FOX have covered the asset and related events, particularly legal battles involving Ripple and the SEC. High-profile interviews, including those with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, have been featured in mainstream media platforms like 60 Minutes , though not to the level that some supporters would like.

Yeah, the meme coin market never sleeps. Every week, something goes viral, communities get louder, and gains get crazier. But while most of the action feels like it’s already passed, there’s one rare moment when you’re early—really early. That moment is now. Right in the middle of this meme coin madness, BTFD Coin is throwing down an offer that’s tough to ignore—especially for anyone still chasing that 1000x dream. Its 90% APY staking, wild play-to-earn ecosystem, and an active Bulls Squad community are already turning heads. But the real kicker? A limited-time 2x token bonus through the LAUNCH100 code that ends March 30. It’s no wonder BTFD is turning heads as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week . Let’s break down why this presale stands out, and take a look at three other trending picks—CAT, APU, and NPC—bringing their own flavor to the meme coin scene. BTFD Coin: 2x Tokens, 90% APY, and Just One Stage Left Here’s the deal— BTFD Coin is in Stage 15, and things are heating up fast. The current price is just $0.0002, and over $6.41 million has already been raised from more than 11,600 holders. More than 72 billion tokens have been snapped up, and only one stage remains before BTFD hits exchanges at $0.0006. If you’re hunting for one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week, this is your window—because it’s closing fast. But what’s grabbing attention more than anything? Staking. At 90% APY. That’s not a typo. This isn’t your typical “stake and hope” situation either—investors are already mapping out their passive income. Let’s say you toss in $5,000 worth of BTFD at the current price of $0.0002. That nets you 25 million tokens. If you stake those tokens at 90% APY, you’re earning 22.5 million extra tokens annually. That’s real, tangible growth—especially if BTFD hits its $0.0006 listing price or the projected moon price of $0.006. At the moon price, that $5,000 could balloon into $150,000. That’s the kind of ROI that puts BTFD squarely on the map as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week. And don’t forget the limited-time LAUNCH100 bonus. Until March 30, every token you buy will be doubled—no catch. Just enter the code LAUNCH100 at checkout. So your 25 million tokens? Now they become 50 million. That’s double the stake, double the rewards, and way more room to run when BTFD gets listed. How to buy BTFD Coins? Start by setting up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Then, head to the BTFD presale page , connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 code, and complete your purchase. After the presale ends, you’ll claim your BTFD tokens—and that’s when the staking, earning, and moon-chasing really begins. This is one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week, and the window is closing fast. One more stage, one more shot. The question is—are you in? Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BTFD Coin offers a rare mix of meme culture, real utility, massive staking returns, and an epic bonus that doubles your tokens. Combine that with a moon price prediction of $0.006 and a vibrant Bulls Squad backing the movement—this isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a full-blown opportunity. Simon’s Cat (CAT): From Animated Fame to Meme Chain Fame You’ve probably seen the iconic white cat batting at everything in sight on YouTube. Simon’s Cat, the British animated sensation, has clawed its way into the crypto world with a fully licensed meme token. This isn’t just another knockoff—CAT has full IP rights and the backing of a global fanbase that’s already watched the brand rack up over 1.6 billion views online. CAT combines nostalgia, cuteness, and meme culture in one smooth purr. And because it’s based on an internationally beloved character, the community is vast and highly engaged. This coin has the kind of brand recognition that most meme tokens could only dream of—and that gives it staying power in a space filled with short-lived hype. Why did this coin make it to this list? CAT stands out because it’s not just a meme, it’s a brand with global appeal. Backed by the real creators of Simon’s Cat, this token has the meme market’s attention, plus built-in credibility. That combo makes it a solid choice in this week’s roundup. Apu Apustaja (APU): The Purest Meme on the Chain Let’s take a break from the usual chaotic meme coins and talk about something… wholesome. Apu Apustaja is the softer, more innocent cousin of Pepe—a meme that rose from imageboard origins to become a symbol of hope and sweetness in a rough digital world. And now it’s a token. APU is all about community and positive vibes. This little frog is designed to push back against toxic crypto culture and deliver something that feels human again. Instead of aggression or hype, APU thrives on humor, kindness, and inclusivity. It’s meme coin energy without the toxicity. Why did this coin make it to this list? APU makes the cut because it brings heart to the meme coin world. The community is loyal, the message is strong, and the brand is genuinely different. If you’re tired of edgelord memes and soulless pumps, APU is a refreshing shift in tone. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Where Memes Meet NFTs If there’s one meme that defines the chaotic energy of 2020s internet culture, it’s “I support the current thing.” That’s exactly where Non-Playable Coin (NPC) draws its fuel. But it goes a step further by merging ERC20 and ERC1155 standards to create something new: Meme Fungible Tokens (MFTs). Yup, that means NPCs can be traded as both tokens and NFTs. This coin is pioneering the crossover between meme investing and NFT flexibility. And because it leans so hard into social commentary, the project naturally grabs attention from creators and traders alike. It’s satirical, it’s flexible, and it’s hella tradable. Why did this coin make it to this list? NPC brings a tech-forward angle to the meme game. By blending NFT utility with viral meme aesthetics, it carves out a unique spot in the market. It’s more than a joke—it’s a hybrid of culture and code, and that deserves a spotlight. Conclusion: The Clock Is Ticking—Don’t Miss This Wave There are a lot of meme coins out there, but only one is offering 2x tokens, 90% APY staking, and a community that’s locked in for the long haul. BTFD Coin is the standout among the best meme coin presales to buy this week, and it’s racing toward launch. Just one stage remains. The presale price is still low at $0.0002—but it won’t be for long. When the listing hits at $0.0006—or the forecasted moon price of $0.006—the ROI speaks for itself. There’s only a few days left to use the LAUNCH100 code and double your token stack. Whether you’re new to crypto or hunting your next 100x, BTFD is the moment. The other meme coins—CAT, APU, and NPC—each bring their own brand of magic, but BTFD Coin is the only one giving you a chance to stack tokens and earn big before the bull run begins. Join the BTFD Coin presale now . Stake big. Earn bigger. Ride the bull. FAQs How do I use the LAUNCH100 bonus code for BTFD Coin? Go to the presale page, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps, input your amount, and complete the transaction to get 2x tokens. What makes BTFD Coin one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week? It’s the only coin offering 90% APY staking, a live play-to-earn game, a growing Bulls Squad community, and a limited 2x token bonus that ends March 30. Is staking with BTFD really 90% APY? Yes. BTFD offers a real 90% APY staking model. The earlier you stake, the more you earn. When will BTFD Coin be listed on exchanges? After the final presale stage ends. The projected listing price is $0.0006, and the moon price prediction is $0.006.

While most people are still sleeping on the wild potential of presale tokens, Cheems just exploded by 23%—sending waves across the meme market—and Sudeng (HIPPO) rolled out a jaw-dropping $1 million airdrop to energize its Telegram-based trading bot and token launchpad. The meme coin market is heating up—but not all opportunities are created equal. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Unlike high-volatility assets like CHEEMS or tokens ruled by dev drama like HIPPO, BTFD offers something rare: stability at entry, community-driven momentum, and a clear path to massive ROI. BTFD’s presale is currently in Stage 15, priced at just $0.0002, with a 100% bonus (yes, 2x tokens) available using code LAUNCH100—until March 30. With the presale heading into its final stage before launch at $0.0006, BTFD is looking like a generational chance for wealth creation through timing, conviction, and FOMO-worthy perks. Keep reading to break down how BTFD Coin could be the best new meme coin for significant returns, plus a look at CHEEMS and Sudeng’s big moves this week. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Can This Referral Program Turn You Into a Crypto Magnet? Why are savvy traders ditching short-term pumps and throwing $2,000 or more into a meme coin presale? Because BTFD Coin isn’t just a project—it’s a movement. This Ethereum-based token launched its P2E game on January 1, 2025, and has been gaining unstoppable traction ever since. Right now, we’re in Stage 15 of the presale, and here’s what’s wild: BTFD started at just $0.000004, and today it’s $0.0002. At launch, it’ll list for $0.0006. That’s a 200% return baked in. But if the price hits the projected moon target of $0.006, we’re talking a massive 2900% ROI. Now imagine this: You invest $2,000 today in Stage 15 using the LAUNCH100 bonus code. You’d snag 10 million $BTFD tokens at $0.0002—and get another 10 million FREE. That’s 20 million tokens total. If BTFD hits just $0.0006, you walk away with $12,000. If it hits $0.006? That’s a life-changing $120,000 from just $2K. That’s not hopium. That’s math. But that’s not the only juicy piece. BTFD’s referral program is making waves. Share your unique referral code after connecting your wallet on the official BTFD site , and when someone buys $50 or more, they get 10% extra tokens, and you could bank 10% of their purchase amount—if you make it to the top 20 leaderboard. That’s passive earning with every bullish friend you onboard. Let’s talk staking. The platform offers 90% APY to token holders, meaning your holdings don’t just sit—they grow. Want to multiply your 20M tokens even more? Stake and double down. And don’t forget the live P2E game. This isn’t just fluff—it’s a fully immersive play-to-earn experience tied directly to the $BTFD ecosystem, giving you even more ways to earn while you play. Oh, and here’s a reminder: Last Chance for 2X Tokens with LAUNCH100 – Ends March 30! Snag double the $BTFD during Stage 15 when you use code LAUNCH100—but don’t sleep on it. The 100% bonus deal vanishes on March 30. Grab it now or regret it later!

Twice the tokens. And the shot at 29x returns if $BTFD hits $0.006. That’s what being early looks like in this game. With over 72 billion coins sold, $6.41 million raised, and 11,600+ holders, the BTFD community (aka the “Bulls Squad”) is showing up and showing out. If you’re sleeping on this meme coin presale , you’re missing the kind of alpha that only comes once every few market cycles. Cheems (CHEEMS) – 23% Rally Has Traders Barking Again Cheems just clawed its way back onto the leaderboard with a 23% gain in 24 hours, jumping to a market cap of $393K. The coin, inspired by the iconic Shiba Inu meme, saw a volume surge as traders responded to its comeback and nostalgic appeal. Although it’s still far from its $345 million rally high, the contract renouncement, zero taxes, and BNB Chain migration show it’s got strong community roots. While volatile, CHEEMS proves meme power never really dies—it just needs the right spark. Sudeng (HIPPO) – Airdrops, Bots, and Big Ambitions Sudeng (HIPPO) is doing something few others dare: launching a $1 million HIPPO token airdrop in partnership with MemeFi. Built on the Sui network, the HIPPO coin gained fresh momentum after the community took over when the dev stepped down. Now with the HIPPObot Telegram trading assistant and HipHop fun meme coin launcher, Sudeng is rebranding itself as a Sui-native meme hub. The token is trading at around $0.004278, and volume is heating up fast at $21.5 million. HIPPO’s community-first energy is refreshing, but like all meme coins, it’s a bumpy ride. Conclusion: Missed SHIB or DOGE? This Is Your Shot at 2900% ROI Based on current presale data, community activity, and tokenomics, BTFD Coin is hands-down one of the best new meme coins for significant returns. While CHEEMS barks back and HIPPO throws a hefty airdrop, BTFD is playing the long game—with staking, P2E gaming, and a referral program built to grow your bags before the token even hits exchanges. The clock is ticking. Stage 15 won’t last long, and March 30 is your last day to claim the 100% LAUNCH100 bonus . If you believe in smart entries, wild exits, and building wealth before the next bull cycle, BTFD or get left behind. Join the BTFD Coin presale today before this door slams shut.

According to data from blockchain analytics firm Parsec, the latest outflows happened within hours of the JELLY liquidation event, echoing a similar $300 million outflows seen during a previous Bitcoin ( BTC ) whale liquidation event. As a result, Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) USDC reserves have fallen from a high of $2.58 billion to $2.02 billion over the past 30 days. Hyperliquid USDC outflows/inflows. Credit: Parsec The JELLY controversy began when Hyperliquid’s treasury assumed a $5 million short position in JELLY. As the token’s price unexpectedly spiked, the unrealized loss grew to $10.63 million. If JELLY had reached $0.17, Hyperliquid’s treasury faced a potential $240 million loss. The price spike appears to have been manipulated. An address identified as 0xde95 opened a massive 430 million JELLY short position on HyperliquidX, only to remove its margin shortly after. This action led to a series of liquidations, with the losses being absorbed by Hyperliquid’s treasury. Another wallet, 0x20e8, opened a long position in JELLY at the same time, which caused the price to rise even more.

Four roles on BlackRock’s digital asset team were added to its website on Wednesday, including Director of Digital Assets, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Vice President for Digital Asset and ETF Legal Counsel and Associate for Digital Asset. According to the job description, three of the roles are based in New York and another one in Atlanta. The descriptions have otherwise been kept fairly broad and don’t give away any clues regarding what BlackRock might be looking to work on in the future. For the role of the legal counsel, the company is seeking somebody who can help with future crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. BlackRock has so far issued two spot ETF products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Other issuers have applied to launch funds for several other crypto assets, including Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC). BlackRock has not announced any plans to do the same. The asset manager is also strongly focused on tokenization, a sector in which it has quickly become a leading force. The firm’s tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has drawn in $1.7 billion since its introduction in 2023, making it by far the largest tokenized fund on the market currently.",Finance|Wall Street|BlackRock,EN,0,0,REGULATION|LTC|MARKET|SOL|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-27 03:19:34

According to the official announcement on Mar. 26, The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, which will oversee the launch, has partnered with LayerZero ( ZRO ) to develop and distribute the token. At the DC Blockchain Summit, Wyoming’s governer Mark Gordon and commission executive director Anthony Apollo revealed that WYST has entered its testing phase. The state-issued stablecoin has been deployed on testnets for Avalanche ( AVAX ), Solana ( SOL ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and more blockchains. These test tokens have no real value yet, but they help ensure the system works properly before the official launch. WYST will be fully backed by cash and U.S. Treasury securities to ensure stability. Interest from these reserves will be transferred to Wyoming’s school foundation fund to ensure that the stablecoin benefits the state. To ensure it maintains its value, WYST will have more reserves than the total number of tokens issued since it will be overcollateralized.

This lowers security risks by enabling users to move WYST between networks without depending on centralized bridges. A recent test transaction showed WYST moving between Ethereum and Avalanche using Stargate, a LayerZero-powered bridge. However, any compatible interface will be able to support WYST’s transfers. Wyoming lawmakers have been working on the stablecoin since passing the Wyoming Stable Token Act in March 2023. The commission will continue refining WYST’s smart contracts and risk management framework. If testing goes as planned, the stablecoin could launch as early as July 2025.

Bitwise Breaks Down the Possibilities,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-2030-29-32-or-0-13-bitwise-breaks-down-the-possibilities/,"The post XRP Price News: $29.32 or $0.13? Bitwise Breaks Down the Possibilities appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Despite the recent victory in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, XRP’s price hasn’t seen much movement. The 3-day chart still shows a clear bearish trend, with the token stuck in a pattern that suggests no major bullish momentum is expected in the near future. On the resistance side, XRP is facing short-term resistance at around $2.50 and $2.56. If the price manages to break above these levels, there is further resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. Sideways Movement Continues for XRP For the time being, XRP’s price action remains largely neutral, bouncing between support and resistance levels. There is a lack of strong directional momentum, with both short-term bullish and bearish price movements occurring intermittently. This sideways price range is expected to continue unless a significant breakout or breakdown occurs. Short-Term Pullback and Potential Support Levels Looking at the shorter 8-hour time frame, XRP is currently experiencing a pullback. This could potentially lead to a test of support levels between $2.24 and $2.30. If the price breaks below this area with confirmation, the next significant support zone would be between $1.95 and $2.05. Bitwise’s Price Prediction for XRP by 2030 Bitwise, a cryptocurrency fund manager, believes XRP could reach $29.32 by 2030 if it captures a large share of the payments and tokenization markets, greatly increasing its value. XRP’s market cap could grow to $2.9 trillion, more than Microsoft’s. In a “bull” scenario, XRP could reach $12.70 by 2030 if it grows steadily, although it may face challenges in payments and tokenization. On the other hand, if XRP struggles to gain traction and institutional support fades, its price could drop to just $0.13 in the worst-case “bear” scenario.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 03:23:30

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,050 resistance. Ethereum corrected lower and tested the $1,980 support level. The price is trading below $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,050 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,050 and $2,100 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and corrected some gains, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,020 and $2,000 support levels. It tested the $1,980 zone. A low was formed at $1,982 and the price is again rising . There was a move above the $2,000 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,097 swing high to the $1,982 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,050 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,040 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,097 swing high to the $1,982 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,100 level. A clear move above the $2,100 resistance might send the price toward the $2,150 resistance. An upside break above the $2,150 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,250 resistance zone or even $2,320 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,050 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,000 level. The first major support sits near the $1,980 zone. A clear move below the $1,980 support might push the price toward the $1,920 support and the trend line. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,880 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,810.

The XRP Price Surge has sparked new excitement, raising hopes for a break above $3. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are gathering momentum, with staking emerging as a key force behind ETH’s potential rebound. As these two established assets ride waves of optimism, BlockDAG (BDAG) is quietly stealing the spotlight. Nearing the final days of its historic presale, BlockDAG has already raised $206.5 million, selling 18.8 billion BDAG coins. With its Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings coming in 2025, BDAG’s projected $1 price target positions it as one of the best long term crypto options available today. XRP Price Surge Reaches 7%: Is a Break Above $3 Within Reach? The latest XRP Price Surge has caught traders’ attention. After climbing 7%, XRP is now valued at $2.25, triggering speculation about whether it can challenge the $3 mark. After bouncing off a solid support level at $2.10, XRP is gaining strength. Analysts are watching resistance zones at $2.40 and $2.60—critical thresholds that could open the door for further gains. If XRP breaks through these resistance points, this XRP Price Surge could be a key moment in the coin’s trajectory. Some traders believe this move could lead to a longer-term uptrend, but others remain cautious as technical hurdles remain. Ethereum ETFs Gain Attention as Staking Becomes a Major Price Catalyst Ethereum ETFs are drawing more interest, but it’s the growing importance of staking that’s really standing out. Recent analysis suggests staking rewards could have a bigger impact on Ethereum’s price than the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade. As more participants lock up ETH for staking, the reduced circulating supply may strengthen the token’s price fundamentals. Currently, Ethereum trades at around $1,860. With staking participation rising steadily, Ethereum ETFs are poised to attract increased institutional involvement. The combination of staking and ETF demand is boosting confidence in ETH’s potential recovery. As these factors gain traction, Ethereum ETFs and staking are both becoming pivotal drivers of ETH’s price direction. BlockDAG Presale Surpasses $206.5M as Mainnet & CEX Listings Draw Near Crypto presales often set the tone for a project’s long-term success. BlockDAG’s presale is proving to be no exception. So far, it has pulled in more than $206.5 million and sold 18.8 billion BDAG coins, ranking among the largest presales in recent history. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, BDAG’s price has climbed to $0.0248 in Batch 27—closing in on its $600 million goal. But what’s coming next for BlockDAG? The focus is shifting toward utility and adoption. BlockDAG’s Mainnet launch in 2025 will mark a major step, transitioning the project from presale momentum to live blockchain operations. Alongside the Mainnet release, BlockDAG has announced 10 major centralized exchange (CEX) listings, which are expected to bring a wave of new liquidity and wider access for traders worldwide. In addition, BlockDAG is expanding its developer community through its partnership with HackerEarth. Already, over 200 dApps are being built on the platform, ranging from DeFi and NFTs to Web3 solutions. This growth is fueling BlockDAG’s evolving ecosystem, which is adding real value to BDAG tokens as demand increases. With each batch of the presale, BDAG’s price continues to rise, reinforcing predictions of a $1 valuation in 2025. As the remaining supply of BDAG runs low, early adopters are securing their positions before the window closes. Those who entered earlier have already seen a 2,380% ROI, and projections show Batch 27 buyers could earn a 3,932% return if the $1 target is reached. Quick Recap The 7% XRP Price Surge has sparked hope for a move past $3, with resistance points at $2.40 and $2.60 under close watch. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are gaining momentum, with staking now viewed as a key driver of ETH’s future price. Both assets face important crossroads as investors monitor their next moves. At the same time, BlockDAG’s presale continues to build speed. With $206.5M raised and 18.8 billion BDAG sold, the project is racing toward its next phase. The Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings in 2025 could propel BDAG to its forecasted $1 valuation. Those joining before Batch 27 closes could see returns of up to 3,932%, cementing BlockDAG as the best long term crypto opportunity on the market right now.

While virality remains part of the appeal, investors are beginning to prioritize fundamentals. The focus is shifting from short-lived hype to tokens with lasting value, stronger mechanics, and community-driven ecosystems. Projects that balance cultural relevance with real utility are gaining traction. In this changing landscape, four tokens have started making a case for themselves: MIND of Pepe, Meme Index (MEMEX), Cheems, and Dragoin. Each one brings something distinct—but Dragoin is emerging as a standout by integrating entertainment, scarcity, and decentralization into a scalable ecosystem. 1. MIND of Pepe: Combining AI Tools with Meme Power MIND of Pepe sets itself apart by merging meme culture with artificial intelligence. Backed by over $7.5 million raised, the project uses an AI engine that analyzes market trends, helps with trading decisions, and offers predictive insights. Token holders gain exclusive access to these tools, along with early opportunities that non-holders can’t tap into. Rather than leaning on memes alone, MIND of Pepe builds on practical value. This combination of humor and functionality gives it an edge. As a result, it’s positioned as more than just a fun token—it’s one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025 for those who want both entertainment and intelligent investing. 2. MEMEX: Making Meme Investing Easier Through Indexing Meme Index (MEMEX) addresses a growing issue—too many choices. With new meme coins launching every week, keeping up is tough. MEMEX simplifies the process by offering a token that tracks a curated basket of top meme coins. It automatically adjusts based on market performance, giving investors diversified exposure without constant monitoring. MEMEX introduces a data-driven approach to a space often dominated by unpredictability. By focusing on structure and risk management, it transforms how meme coin investing is approached. For investors seeking efficient entry into this niche, MEMEX brings a fresh, organized strategy to the mix. 3. Cheems: Classic Meme, Clear Mission Cheems brings a familiar face and a unique purpose. Inspired by the original “Cheems” meme, the token supports charities by donating a portion of its transaction fees. This built-in charitable element adds a new dimension to its appeal. Community transparency and consistent activity have helped Cheems remain visible across several market cycles. Its long-term relevance lies in its values. By tying meme culture to social good, Cheems delivers more than humor—it delivers impact. In a time when investors are more selective, this dual-purpose model could give it a lasting place among the Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025. 4. Dragoin: A Meme Coin Designed for Sustainability Dragoin ($DDGN) is challenging the meme coin model by building a full-featured ecosystem from the ground up. Built on Ethereum, the project revolves around a play-to-earn game hosted on Telegram, where users train digital dragons and earn $DDGN tokens by competing. It connects activity with earnings, making token ownership engaging and rewarding. Beyond gameplay, Dragoin’s economic model shows strong planning. Out of its 200 billion total supply, 50% is allocated to a 25-stage presale. Each stage increases the token’s price, encouraging early investment. Unsold tokens will be permanently burned, reducing supply and boosting scarcity. The team’s decision to fully renounce ownership of the smart contract post-presale adds a decentralization layer rarely seen in meme coins. This structure builds long-term trust in the project. Dragoin’s roadmap is equally forward-focused. Q2 2025 includes the full game launch, staking tools, and partnerships with key influencers. Q3 will bring listings on major exchanges and additional in-game enhancements. With referral rewards, airdrops, and active social engagement already in place, the project is gaining momentum. What Dragoin represents is a shift. It’s not just about short-term gains—it’s about creating a self-sustaining, community-owned platform. That’s why for many investors watching the market evolve, Dragoin isn’t just an option—it’s leading the list of Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025 .

After weeks of volatility and uncertainty, the market appears to be stabilizing — but conviction remains low. Analysts are divided on the next move. Some warn that if BTC fails to break above $90K, a continuation of the downtrend is likely. Others believe the current consolidation could set the stage for a bullish surge into higher price levels. Adding to the complexity, on-chain data offers key insights into market behavior. According to CryptoQuant, since January 1st, 2025, Short-Term Holders (STH) have increased their supply by 201,743 BTC. This cohort now holds 5,750,076 BTC, a significant accumulation that reflects cautious re-entry by market participants. The rise in STH supply suggests growing interest at current levels, but it also raises questions about potential selling pressure if momentum fails to return. As Bitcoin hovers below the $90K mark , both bulls and bears are preparing for the next decisive move. The coming days will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin can regain strength — or continue its slide in a fragile market. Bitcoin Faces Critical Test As Bulls Eye Break Above $88K Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point, with bulls attempting to push the price above the $88,000 level in hopes of triggering a broader rally. After a period of consolidation and mild recovery, this level has emerged as a short-term resistance. Reclaiming it could give bulls the momentum they need to challenge the psychological $90,000 barrier and flip the market structure bullish once again. However, broader financial conditions continue to weigh heavily on sentiment. Macroeconomic uncertainty and growing fears of a trade war have kept financial markets on edge. These factors have created a cautious environment where even strong technical setups are treated with skepticism. Within this backdrop, top analyst Axel Adler offered insights on X that shed light on Bitcoin’s current on-chain dynamics. According to Adler, since January 1st, 2025, Short-Term Holders (STH) have added 201,743 BTC to their supply, which now totals 5,750,076 BTC. While this is a sizable increase, it’s still below levels seen at previous cycle peaks — 8.4 million and 7 million BTC respectively. Importantly, around 200,000 BTC are currently held at an unrealized loss, amounting to roughly $17 billion based on current prices. Despite this, Adler notes there are no on-chain signals pointing to panic or imminent selling from these holders. The data suggests that STHs are holding through volatility, signaling growing resilience or at least a wait-and-see approach. If bulls can capitalize on this stability and push above $88K with conviction, it could mark the beginning of a stronger recovery phase. Until then, Bitcoin remains locked in a cautious tug-of-war between optimism and macro-driven fear. Bitcoin Holds $88K As Bulls Target $89K Breakout Bitcoin is currently trading at $88,200 after successfully reclaiming the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and 200 exponential moving average (EMA) near the $87,000 mark. This recovery above key short-term technical indicators is an encouraging sign for bulls, suggesting that momentum is slowly building after recent consolidation. However, the next major challenge lies just ahead. To maintain upward momentum and confirm a short-term bullish breakout, BTC must push above the $89,000 level. This breakout would likely trigger a move toward the next key resistance zone around $92,000, a level that has previously acted as a strong barrier. Reaching that area could bring renewed bullish sentiment and open the door for higher targets in the coming sessions. However, if Bitcoin fails to break above $89,000, the current rally could quickly lose steam. A rejection at this level would likely increase selling pressure, with the potential for BTC to fall back toward the $81,500 support zone. This would erase recent gains and confirm that bears remain in control of the broader trend. As price hovers near critical levels, bulls must act decisively to keep the recovery alive and avoid another downturn.

Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) and Henry (@LordOfAlts), are pointing to what they believe is a major technical setup on the Dogecoin (DOGE) price chart—potentially heralding a sizable breakout. This Price Level Is Crucial For Dogecoin Early today, Rekt Capital shared a weekly DOGE/USDT chart highlighting key price levels at $0.159, $0.204, and most critically $0.22. According to the analyst, Dogecoin’s trajectory now hinges on whether it can “reclaim and/or Weekly Close above $0.22”—a level he refers to as a green zone of Pre-Halving highs on his chart. Rekt Capital suggests that the recent dip below $0.22 could represent a mere “downside deviation,” meaning any breach under that threshold might have been temporary if price action stabilizes above $0.22 in the near future. The candlesticks near $0.20 and $0.22 exhibit notable wicks, indicative of high volatility. Rekt Capital interprets these as part of a “very volatile retest” of the price region around March highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is ‘All Going To Plan,’ Says Crypto Analyst From a technical standpoint, the $0.22 area seems to act as a pivot. Should Dogecoin close a weekly candle above that boundary, it would increase the likelihood that buyers are regaining control, potentially setting the stage for a move toward higher resistance levels—such as the $0.28 and $0.338 region, identified by two horizontal green lines on Rekt Capital’s chart. DOGE Breakout Already Confirmed? Meanwhile, analyst Henry (@LordOfAlts) points to a multi-month falling wedge formation stretching from late 2024 through the first quarter of 2025. Henry notes that this pattern bears resemblance to Dogecoin’s descending wedge in 2024, which eventually led to a breakout and a significant price surge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Mirroring This 2017 Pattern Suggests That A Rise To $4 Could Happen On Henry’s chart, DOGE had been consolidating between two downward-sloping trendlines for several months. The upper trendline connects lower highs since the coin’s peak above $0.48, while the lower boundary captures a sequence of descending lows. Henry’s analysis draws a parallel between the current wedge and a similar structure that resolved in a 365% surge which started in October 2024. Over the past few days, Dogecoin broke out of the falling wedge pattern again, possibly setting the stage for another steep rise. Although Henry does not guarantee specific targets, he remarks that last time “Last time it did a similar thing was in Sep 24. 50¢ next, then $1.00,” concluding with a succinct instruction to “Trust the cycle.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19583.

42460153,https://coingape.com/?p=246162,1743048221,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US Congress Accelerates Crypto Oversight with New Stablecoin Bill,https://coingape.com/us-congress-accelerates-crypto-oversight-with-new-stablecoin-bill/,"The U.S. Congress is moving forward with efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, with a particular focus on stablecoins. A new stablecoin bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives, building on previous legislative efforts. This bill aims to provide clearer guidelines on how companies can issue dollar-denominated digital tokens and set the stage for broader crypto oversight. House Version of Stablecoin Bill Released The U.S. House of Representatives has moved forward in digital asset regulation efforts after it published its stablecoin bill text to the public. The two congressmen, Bryan Steil and French Hill introduced stablecoin legislation, that dictates rules for digital tokens which bind their value to the U.S. dollar. Steil who leads the Financial Services Committee crypto panel stated the bill functions to unite stablecoin legislative frameworks between the House and Senate. The legislation known as the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) follows Congress’ ongoing development of digital asset regulations. According to Hill the bill constitutes part of an extensive program to establish regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency operations. He stated that the bill aims to establish financial regulations which require stablecoin companies to maintain transparency while protecting consumers and the system. Senate Stablecoin Bill Moves Forward There has been some progress made on the regulation of stablecoins by the Senate as the bill was moved to the Banking Committee where it enjoyed bipartisan support. This bill has made its way to the Senate floor, awaiting the senate action. Rep. Representative Tom Emmer, a crypto supporter in Congress, noted that even though the two bills are somewhat similar but have distinct features, such differences are not significant and can be sorted out as the bills progressed through the legislative procedure. Lawmakers are looking forward to passing the stablecoin laws in the next few weeks especially following US President Donald Trump directive on stablecoin regulation. Emmer remained optimistic that the bill will be finished by August. This momentum is part of a wider effort in Congress to provide more stability in the regulation of cryptocurrencies so that companies and users have better frameworks to follow. Efforts to Clarify Crypto Asset Regulations Additionally, Emmer also reintroduced the Securities Clarity Act as another bill targeting how cryptocurrencies fit into the domain of securities. This bill, sponsored with republican partner Darren Soto, is to clarify legal uncertainty existing in the United States concerning the qualification of digital assets under the securities law. Emmer thus urged for better formalism saying that business requires legal predictability to the effect that they are able to conduct their operations within the legal framework. Emmer’s actions are in line with other pieces of legislation that have been made to determine how digital assets should be regulated within the U.S. financial system. These steps are regarded as crucial in offering that legal certainty that many cryptocurrencies and blockchain start-ups have claimed to need to enhance business growth and development. Wyoming and Other States Enter the Stablecoin Market As federal lawmakers push forward with stablecoin regulations, states are also taking steps to position themselves as leaders in the crypto space. Wyoming, in particular, is moving toward launching its own state-backed stablecoin . Governor Mark Gordon has announced plans to issue a stablecoin fully backed by U.S. dollar reserves, aiming to provide a fast, low-cost alternative for digital payments. The state’s move is part of a broader trend, with other companies and states working on their own stablecoin projects. Custodia and Vantage Bank, for example, recently launched the Avit stablecoin , backed by U.S. dollar reserves and based on the Ethereum blockchain. These efforts reflect the growing interest in stablecoins as a way to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the emerging digital economy.

A March 26 letter signed by 34 crypto companies and advocate groups sent to the Senate Banking Committee, House Financial Services Committee and the House and Senate judiciary committees said the DOJ’s take on unlicensed money-transmitting business means “essentially every blockchain developer could be prosecuted as a criminal.” The letter — led by the DeFi Education Fund and signed by the likes of Kraken and Coinbase — added that the Justice Department’s interpretation “creates confusion and ambiguity” and “threatens the viability of U.S.-based software development in the digital asset industry.” The group said the DOJ debuted its position “in August 2023 via criminal indictment” — the same time it charged Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov with money laundering. Storm has been released on bail, has pleaded not guilty and wants the charges dropped . Semenov, a Russian national, is at large. Source: DeFi Education Fund The DOJ has filed similar charges against Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, who have both pleaded not guilty. The crypto group’s letter argued that two sections of the US Code define a “money transmitting business” — Title 31 section 5330, defining who must be licensed and Title 18 section 1960, which criminalizes operating unlicensed. It added that 2019 guidance from the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) gave examples of what money-transmitting activities and said that “if a software developer never obtains possession or control over customer funds, that developer is not operating a ‘money transmitting business.’” The letter argued that the DOJ had taken a position that the definition of a money transmitting business under section 5330 “is not relevant to determining whether someone is operating an unlicensed ‘money transmitting business’ under Section 1960” despite the “intentional similarity” in both sections and FinCEN’s guidance. Related: Hester Peirce calls for SEC rulemaking to ‘bake in’ crypto regulation The group accused the DOJ of ignoring both FinCEN’s guidance and parts of the law to pursue its own interpretation of a money-transmitting business when it charged Storm and Semenov. They said the result had seen “two separate US government agencies with conflicting interpretations of ‘money transmission’ — an unclear, unfair position for law-abiding industry participants and innovators.” The letter said that if not addressed, the Justice Department’s interpretation would expose non-custodial software developers “within the reach of the U.S. to criminal liability.” “The resulting, and very rational, fear among developers would effectively end the development of these technologies in the United States.” In January, Michael Lewellen, a fellow of the crypto advocacy group Coin Center, sued Attorney General Merrick Garland to have his planned release of non-custodial software declared legal and to block the DOJ from using money transmitting laws to prosecute him. Lewellen said the DOJ “has begun criminally prosecuting people for publishing similar cryptocurrency software,” which he claims extended the interpretation of money-transmitting laws “beyond what the Constitution allows.” Magazine: Meet lawyer Max Burwick — ‘The ambulance chaser of crypto’",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-27 04:06:27

This integration unlocks powerful new strategies for EVAA users — including fixed yields, leveraged farming, and impermanent loss-protected liquidity provision — while reaffirming EVAA’s position as the leading lending platform on TON. Think of it as Pendle meets TON — and it’s live. With this move, EVAA users can now tokenize their deposits into two distinct assets, opening up access to stable returns, amplified point farming, and composable yield strategies. This also marks the launch of FIVA’s phased mainnet rollout, with EVAA’s USDT market as its next strategic integration. One Deposit, Two Tokens — You Choose Through FIVA, EVAA depositors can split a single yield-bearing position into: PT (Principal Token): A fixed-rate instrument offering predictable income (e.g., 7–15% APY over 3–6 months) YT (Yield Token): A leveraged position offering up to 100x exposure to EVAA’s variable yields and point system — with no liquidation risk This dual-token design gives users greater control over their capital, letting them hedge risk or maximize upside depending on their strategy. Three Ways to Make Your Yield Work Smarter EVAA’s mission is to deliver transparent, sustainable, and innovative lending experiences. With FIVA now integrated, users can enhance their yield performance using three core instruments: Fixed Yields with Principal Tokens (PT) Users can lock in stable returns, ideal during times of market volatility. For example: Deposit 10,000 USDT at a fixed 7% APY over 6 months Earn 350 USDT in guaranteed returns, fully insulated from rate volatility With EVAA’s historical rates swinging between 3% and 14% — and dropping by as much as 75% in a year — PTs offer valuable protection for long-term and passive investors. This mechanism is ideal for investors who prioritize stability and need predictable income, especially in the often-volatile world of DeFi. Leveraged Farming with Yield Tokens (YT) For those seeking higher returns, YT tokens provide leveraged exposure to EVAA yields and points, with capital efficiency and capped downside. For instance, a 1,000 USDT YT position can give the yield of a 55,000 USDT deposit (representing 55x leverage – a possible scenario that varies based on market conditions) — perfect for aggressive farmers ahead of EVAA’s TGE. Multi-Stream Rewards as Liquidity Provider (LP) Users can also deploy EVAA positions to FIVA liquidity pools, earning: EVAA base yield (currently 3%) Trading fees (~0.5%) Both EVAA and FIVA points with multipliers Protection from impermanent loss at maturity Each token type — PT, YT, and LP — serves a different strategic purpose, allowing users to customize their approach based on personal risk profiles and yield targets. Phased Access, Proven Security – Rolling Out the Future of Yield The integration of FIVA into EVAA marks the start of a phased mainnet rollout designed with security, performance, and community feedback at its core. The rollout is structured across three stages: Phase 1: Early access for FIVA Genesis Pass NFT holders (completed) Phase 2: Partner access for EVAA users via exclusive links (now live) Phase 3: Full-scale expansion with additional protocol integrations (upcoming) During the current phase, EVAA users can access FIVA’s yield tokenization features through invite-only links distributed via the EVAA app, Telegram channel, quests, and partner campaigns. This controlled onboarding process allows the FIVA team to closely monitor performance, collect real-world usage data, and refine the user experience — all while ensuring protocol stability and protecting early participants. The decision to launch EVAA’s USDT market was strategic: as one of the most established protocols on TON, EVAA offers a secure and well-audited foundation to test and scale FIVA’s novel mechanics. Security remains a priority throughout. Both EVAA and FIVA implement smart contract audits, rely on Pyth oracles for reliable price feeds, and maintain contingency protections. Should any issues arise within the EVAA protocol, FIVA’s contracts are designed to honor fixed-rate positions , even if the underlying token values are affected. By combining phased access with robust security measures, the integration sets a new standard for responsible scaling in the TON DeFi space — a space that’s evolving fast and demanding smarter, safer infrastructure. And this is just the beginning. FIVA is already connected with a growing network of TON-native protocols, including Tonstakers , Storm , Ethena , and Bemo , with more integrations planned. Together with EVAA, they’re laying the groundwork for a modular DeFi ecosystem, where yield is not just earned — it’s tokenized, tradable, and optimized.

Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels However, during this period, ADA has recorded several fakeouts, which now appear confusing to traders and investors trying to determine its upcoming move. According to expert technical analysis, the asset remains neutral and is currently at the upper boundary of the consolidation. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA breaches the upper boundary and closes a daily candle above the $0.76 level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 13% to reach $0.85 in the coming days. Source: Trading View However, this rally is currently halted by the upper boundary of $0.75 and the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, which has been providing constant resistance. Despite this neutral price action, a technical indicator called the Bollinger Bands on the 12-hour timeframe appears to be squeezing, signaling a potential upside or downside rally. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.742, having recorded a modest price surge of over 0.25% in the past 24 hours.
