Analyst Predicts Breakout Beyond $2,100",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-rally-incoming-analyst-predicts-breakout-beyond-2100/,"Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, is getting a lot of attention right now. Some experts who watch the market closely think its price could go above $2,100 soon. They’ve been looking at how Ethereum’s price has been moving and see patterns that suggest it might be heading up. Related Reading: Shiba Inu ETF Proposal—Could This Be SHIB’s Breakout Moment? Short-Term Signs Point Upward One analyst, Crypto Patel, shared his thoughts on the social media platform X. He pointed out a setup on the Ethereum chart that looks promising for a price increase. Patel said Ethereum made a strong move upwards, which changed the way the market is structured. This happened after the price reacted to a level he had already identified as a good place for buyers to step in. #Ethereum Prints Bullish Displacement – Swing High Liquidity in Sight$ETH Price respecting bullish POI with clear displacement on tap. Currently testing mitigation block post-retest.

This area is called a mitigation block, and it often shows strong buying interest from big investors. The idea is that these investors use this zone to adjust their previous orders before continuing to push the price in a certain direction. Patel suggests that buying in this upper part of the mitigation zone lines up with how these big players often operate. The target price Patel mentioned is $2,128. This level is what’s known as a swing high liquidity zone. These zones often have a lot of stop-loss orders and pending buy orders clustered together. If the price moves into this area, it could trigger those orders and cause a sharp move, allowing investors to profit before the price possibly changes direction. Patel set a stop-loss for this trade at $2,027, just below the mitigation block. This helps limit potential losses if his prediction is wrong. Long-Term Pattern Looks Familiar Another analyst, TimeFreedomROB, also posted on X. He compared Ethereum’s current weekly price pattern to what happened between 2018 and 2020. His chart shows Ethereum breaking below an ascending triangle pattern, which is similar to how it broke below a descending triangle before its big recovery in 2020. Back then, Ethereum’s price hit a low point and then soared from under $100 to almost $4,800. #ETH 1W Price is showing the Same type of Break below support as last Cycle 👀 Will Price Recover Rapidly Like Last Time? 📈 pic.twitter.com/uoIDTd5w8L — TimeFreedom ®️0️⃣🅱️ ⚡ (@TimeFreedomROB) March 25, 2025 Currently, Ethereum is trading near $2,060. It recently dropped below the $2,300 mark and tested a lower trendline around $1800. This area also lines up with price levels where there was a lot of demand in previous years.

The analyst’s chart suggests this could be the final dip before a significant price increase, similar to what happened in past cycles. The area between $1,800 and $2,000 has acted as a strong support level in the past. For Ethereum’s price to confirm a return to an upward trend on the weekly chart, it needs to climb back above the $2,200 to $2,400 range. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,064. Over the last week, it has gained 6%. Its total market value is $250 billion, and the amount of Ethereum traded in the last 24 hours is $11.71 billion. These analysts are presenting scenarios based on how Ethereum’s price has behaved in the past, but it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market can be unpredictable.

42450446,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143577,1743032406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Justice Served: T3 Freezes Massive $9M in Crypto Stolen from Bybit Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/t3-freezes-bybit-hack-funds/,"In a significant win for the crypto space and a stark warning to cybercriminals, the T3 Financial Crime Unit has acted swiftly to freeze over $9 million in digital assets linked to the recent Bybit Exchange security breach. This decisive action highlights the increasing sophistication and collaborative efforts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to combat illicit activities and safeguard user funds. Let’s dive into how this unfolded and what it means for the future of cryptocurrency security . What’s the Buzz About the Bybit Hack and the $9 Million Asset Freeze? If you’ve been following the crypto news, you’ve likely heard about the recent hack targeting the Bybit Exchange. While details of the exploit are still emerging, the immediate aftermath saw a substantial amount of digital assets siphoned off. This is where the T3 Financial Crime Unit stepped in. But who exactly is T3, and how did they manage to pull off such a significant asset freeze ? The T3 Financial Crime Unit isn’t your average watchdog. It’s a powerful collaboration, a trifecta of expertise combining the strengths of: TRON DAO : Known for its decentralized blockchain platform, TRON DAO brings its technological prowess and community-driven approach to the table. Tether : The issuer of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether’s involvement underscores the critical role stablecoins play in the crypto ecosystem and their commitment to security. TRM Labs : A leader in blockchain intelligence, TRM Labs provides the cutting-edge technology and investigative tools necessary to trace and track illicit crypto flows. This powerhouse partnership was specifically formed to tackle financial crime within the digital asset space, and their recent success in the Bybit hack case is a testament to their effectiveness. Decoding the $9M Crypto Asset Freeze: How Did They Do It? Freezing digital assets in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency might sound like trying to catch smoke, but T3’s operation demonstrates that it’s increasingly possible. Here’s a simplified look at the process: Rapid Response & Identification: Following the report of the crypto hack on Bybit, T3’s team sprang into action. TRM Labs’ blockchain analytics tools are crucial here, allowing for the rapid tracing of the stolen funds as they move across different wallets and exchanges. Collaboration with Exchanges and Authorities: Freezing assets isn’t a solo act. It requires close cooperation with cryptocurrency exchanges (like Bybit in this case) and potentially regulatory bodies. T3 leverages its network and established relationships to coordinate these actions. Smart Contract and Wallet Freezing Mechanisms: Depending on the nature of the assets and the blockchain involved, various technical mechanisms can be employed to freeze funds. This might involve working with smart contract developers or engaging with exchanges to freeze accounts associated with the illicit transactions. Legal Framework and Compliance: While the crypto space is still navigating regulatory landscapes, established legal frameworks related to asset recovery and financial crime are utilized to legitimize and enforce these freezes. The $9 million freeze isn’t just a number; it represents a significant portion of the stolen funds potentially recovered, preventing further laundering or use by the perpetrators of the Bybit hack . Why is this Asset Freeze a Big Deal for Cryptocurrency? This successful stolen funds recovery operation carries weight beyond just the monetary value. It sends several powerful messages across the crypto ecosystem: Enhanced Security Perception: For users and potential investors, this action reinforces the idea that the crypto space is not a lawless Wild West. Proactive measures are being taken to protect users and their assets. Deterrent to Cybercriminals: The news of swift asset freezes can act as a significant deterrent to would-be hackers. It demonstrates that illicit gains are not easily attainable and that there are consequences. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Successful recovery operations contribute to the growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies. It shows that the industry is maturing and taking security and user protection seriously, which is crucial for attracting mainstream adoption. Industry Collaboration is Key: The T3 unit exemplifies the power of collaboration. TRON DAO, Tether, and TRM Labs, each with their unique expertise, working together achieve far more than they could individually. This model of industry-led security initiatives is likely to become more prevalent. In essence, this asset freeze is a victory for the good guys in crypto, showcasing that security and accountability are becoming increasingly paramount. Are There Challenges in Crypto Asset Recovery? Absolutely. While the T3’s success is commendable, it’s important to acknowledge that stolen funds recovery in cryptocurrency is not always straightforward. Significant challenges remain: Challenge Description Decentralization and Anonymity The very features that make crypto attractive – decentralization and pseudonymity – can also hinder asset recovery. Tracing funds across multiple blockchains and anonymous wallets is technically complex. Jurisdictional Issues Cryptocurrency transactions are often borderless, making jurisdictional issues a major hurdle. Coordinating legal processes across different countries to freeze and recover assets can be lengthy and complicated. Technical Sophistication of Hackers Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics. They employ sophisticated techniques to obfuscate transactions, use mixers and tumblers, and move funds across various exchanges to complicate tracking. Regulatory Uncertainty The evolving regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies adds another layer of complexity. Lack of clear and consistent global regulations can impede cross-border asset recovery efforts. Despite these challenges, the T3 Financial Crime Unit’s achievement offers a beacon of hope and demonstrates that progress is being made in overcoming these obstacles. Looking Ahead: What Can We Learn from This Crypto Security Win? The successful freezing of assets linked to the Bybit hack provides valuable lessons and actionable insights for the crypto community: Proactive Security Measures are Essential: Exchanges and crypto platforms must prioritize robust security measures, including regular audits, advanced threat detection systems, and strong KYC/AML protocols to prevent hacks in the first place. Collaboration is Crucial: The T3 model highlights the importance of industry-wide collaboration. Sharing intelligence, resources, and expertise is vital to effectively combat crypto crime. Blockchain Analytics is a Game Changer: Tools like those provided by TRM Labs are becoming increasingly indispensable for tracing illicit crypto transactions and enabling asset recovery. User Awareness and Education: Users also have a role to play in cryptocurrency security . Practicing safe storage habits, being vigilant against phishing scams, and choosing reputable exchanges are all important steps. Conclusion: A Strong Message for a Safer Crypto Future The swift and decisive action by the T3 Financial Crime Unit to freeze over $9 million in assets linked to the Bybit hack is more than just a financial recovery; it’s a powerful statement. It signals a maturing cryptocurrency ecosystem that is actively fighting back against cybercrime, prioritizing user protection, and building a more secure and trustworthy digital asset space. This victory, while significant, is just one step in the ongoing battle for cryptocurrency security . Continued innovation, collaboration, and vigilance are crucial to stay ahead of evolving threats and ensure a safer future for all participants in the crypto revolution.

Speaking from the Oval Office, the president made his remarks during an event where he also introduced a new 25% duty on automobile imports. The comments come as part of a broader effort by the president to reshape trade relations with China, following the 20% levies he has already imposed on Chinese goods. The president predicted that he could secure at least an outline of a deal for TikTok by next week. However, he added that if an agreement is not reached, he would extend the deadline. “We’re going to have a form of a deal, but if it’s not finished, it’s not a big deal. We’ll just extend it,” Trump said, “I have the right to have the deal and to extend it if I want.” His remarks show that he’ll go one step ahead to complete the negotiations. He added, “We have a lot of interest in TikTok.” Trump speaking about the TikTok deal at the Oval Office. Source: Bloomberg Trump also mentioned that there are various ways to acquire TikTok, and he wants to find the one that’s best for the US. He clarified that China will ‘possibly’ have to play a role in it, such as in the form of an approval. He said, “I think they’ll do that. Maybe I’ll give them a little reduction in Tariffs or something, to get it done.” Trump thinks that’s justified, and probably a good offer, because “every point in Tariffs is worth more money than TikTok.” There was a time when Trump wanted to ban TikTok. However, the app helped him reach younger voters and helped him with the 2024 election campaign. This turned the President into a major supporter of the app. TikTok’s recent past in the US was troubled but now it appears that Trump will go to any lengths to change that for good. Negotiations have been underway with four unnamed bidders Under a law signed last year by President Joe Biden, ByteDance Ltd.—TikTok’s Chinese parent company—was required to sell the US operations of the app by January 19. TikTok briefly paused its service earlier this year, but a full shutdown was narrowly avoided when Trump signed an executive order delaying the law’s enforcement by 90 days, extending the deadline to April 5. Earlier this month, Trump confirmed that negotiations were underway with four potential bidders for TikTok. Although he did not name all the parties, publicly known bidders include a group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, another group featuring tech entrepreneur Jesse Tinsley and YouTube star MrBeast, and a merger offer by San Francisco-based Perplexity AI. In addition, Oracle Corp. is weighing a proposal that would see it provide security assurances and take a small stake in a new American entity while possibly allowing ByteDance to retain TikTok’s influential algorithm. Any final deal would need the approval of not only Trump but also ByteDance and the Chinese government. Allowing ByteDance to keep the algorithm might smooth the way for Chinese approval; however, it could risk noncompliance with the divestiture law.

The calm waters of the crypto market might be about to get choppy. Leading research firm K33 Research is sounding the alarm, predicting a potential surge in crypto volatility as we approach April 2nd. Why is this date circled in red on the crypto calendar? It’s the day former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his tariff plans, a move analysts are dubbing “Liberation Day.” Why is Trump’s Tariff Announcement Triggering Crypto Volatility Fears? While Bitcoin has shown resilience, climbing nearly 5% in the past week, and U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are enjoying a wave of inflows, raking in a hefty $896.6 million in just eight days, a sense of unease lingers in the trading community. According to insights from The Block, traders are treading cautiously, and for good reason. The potential catalyst for this looming market uncertainty ? Trump’s tariff announcement. K33 Research analysts pinpoint Trump’s stance as the critical factor. Here’s a breakdown of how different approaches could impact the crypto sphere: Softer Tone = Potential Price Lift: If Trump adopts a less aggressive stance on tariffs than anticipated, it could inject optimism into the broader markets, including crypto. This could be seen as a signal of reduced economic tension, potentially leading to a positive price movement for cryptocurrencies. Ambiguity or Hardline Approach = Sharp Swings: Conversely, if Trump’s announcement is vague or leans towards a hardline tariff policy, brace yourselves. History suggests that such pronouncements can trigger significant market turbulence. Think back to past tariff-related sell-offs – the crypto market could experience similar sharp downward swings. Decoding the Market Sentiment Amidst Trump Tariff Announcement To truly understand the current market pulse, let’s delve deeper into the factors contributing to this cautious optimism mixed with underlying anxiety: Bitcoin’s Recent Gains and ETF Inflows: A Sign of Strength? Bitcoin’s recent price surge and the continued positive flows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are undeniably positive indicators. These inflows suggest sustained institutional interest and growing mainstream adoption. However, seasoned traders know that in the volatile world of crypto, past performance is not always a predictor of future outcomes. The market’s reaction to the Trump tariff announcement could easily overshadow these positive trends. Trader Caution: Reading Between the Lines The reported trader caution is a crucial signal. It indicates that despite the positive momentum, a significant segment of the market anticipates potential headwinds. This caution is likely rooted in the understanding of how macroeconomic factors, such as tariff policies, can ripple through all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Experienced traders are adept at anticipating and reacting to such macro-driven risks. Navigating the Impending Crypto Volatility: Key Strategies So, how can crypto investors and traders prepare for this potential wave of crypto volatility ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to Trump’s tariff announcement. Reputable financial news sources and crypto market analysis platforms will be invaluable in providing real-time updates and expert interpretations. Risk Management is Paramount: Now is the time to review and potentially tighten your risk management strategies. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocation, setting stop-loss orders, and being prepared to reduce exposure if market conditions warrant it. Diversification: While Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency, diversification across different crypto assets can help mitigate risk. Explore established altcoins and consider spreading your investments to reduce the impact of volatility in any single asset. Cash is King (Optional): In times of heightened uncertainty, holding a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins or fiat currency can provide a safety net. This allows you to capitalize on potential buying opportunities if prices dip sharply. Understand Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment indicators. Crypto fear and greed indices and social media sentiment analysis can provide clues about the prevailing market mood and potential shifts in momentum. The Road Ahead: Beyond the Tariff Announcement The Trump tariff announcement is just one piece of the puzzle in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. While it presents a potential near-term volatility trigger, the long-term trajectory of the crypto market is shaped by a multitude of factors, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the inherent volatility of this exciting asset class. The coming days could be pivotal for the crypto market. Whether Trump’s announcement unleashes a storm of volatility or proves to be a non-event remains to be seen. However, being prepared, staying informed, and having a robust risk management strategy in place are essential for weathering any potential market turbulence and positioning yourself for long-term success in the crypto space. Conclusion: Brace for Potential Swings in the Crypto Market The crypto market stands at a potential crossroads. K33 Research’s warning about impending crypto volatility related to Trump’s tariff announcement is a timely reminder of the external factors that can significantly influence digital assets. While positive undercurrents like Bitcoin ETF inflows exist, the shadow of political and economic uncertainty looms large.

Following the latest surge, the price appears strong, advancing bullish on the day. The past months have been rough and tough for most meme coins as they dropped heavily to their multi-month lows. This came as a result of wide correction, but they recently found a solid ground. Meanwhile, Pepe mounted support two weeks ago and started to show signs of recovery, although it was less significant due to low volatility. This led to a serious squeeze throughout last week and closed at a loss. However, this week has been interesting for Pepe and other top meme coins as they find their way back into buying mode after struggling with volatility since they rebounded over the past weeks. This bearish break may last long if the bulls show strong commitment in the coming days. Failure to commit strongly might bring an end to the latest surge. This may trigger a new sell order capable of rolling the price back before breaking down the current monthly low. If the bulls defend the monthly low well, we may see a fresh increase with a new bullish pattern. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The current surge is targeted at the $0.0000108 resistance. If the price increases above this resistance, a higher level to consider for a test would be $0.0000127 and potentially $0.0000148. Resuming the downtrend, the $0.000007 and $0.000006 levels might pose a threat before reclaiming the monthly low of $0.00000522. Losing it could send the price to a low of $0.000004 in the near term.

The token has surged more than 16% in the past week and is presently hovering at $0.00000915 after breaking through the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. This may be an indication that the trend is developing a bullish reversal which may lead to a Pepe coin rally. Pepe Coin Rally Continues as Price Approaches $0.0000100 Level Top meme coin PEPE could remove a zero from its price amid the Pepe coin rally, which saw a sharp 13% rise in 24 hours. The token reached $0.00000906, breaking a major technical resistance at the 50-day EMA. The RSI has climbed to 58, reflecting a rise in bullish momentum. The price action also shows a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band. This move aligns with increased market activity and expanding volatility. According to analyst Satori , if the current indicators continue to trend upwards, the recently broken resistance level could solidify as a new support zone. Source: X Similarly, experts revealed that the top meme coin is positioned for a potential explosion, urging investors to accumulate now or risk missing out on substantial gains. With PEPE holding strong support and outperforming other meme coins, analysts believe it could see a 100% surge PEPE Futures Market Shows Strong Trader Interest PEPE futures open interest surged to $324 million, the highest since February 2, 2025. This marks a sharp increase from earlier levels in March when it stood at $166 million. A rising open interest indicates more active futures positions. It reflects a growing interest in the top meme coin among derivatives traders during the ongoing Pepe coin rally. Source: Coinglass Additionally, data from Nansen shows PEPE exchange reserves dropped by 0.73% over the past week. The current level stands at 240.7 trillion tokens held on exchanges. This movement suggests investors are withdrawing their holdings from exchanges. Reduced reserves often point to long-term holding behavior and lower short-term sell pressure. Next Resistance Levels and Technical Outlook The next price resistance is at $0.00001094. If broken, the PEPE Coin rally may test $0.00001180, a level that previously acted as a support zone. PEPE price rebound began after hitting $0.000005895 on March 10, matching its August 2023 low. Since then, it has steadily gained, supported by technical strength and investor positioning during the Pepe coin rally. Moreover, a recent analysis shows that Pepe Coin is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal signal indicating a breakout. Analysts suggest that a confirmed move above the $0.0000075 neckline could trigger a sharp surge, with some even predicting a 40x meme coin rally . At press time, Pepe coin price was up 5.59% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.000008430. Its 24-hour trading volume had surged by 96.50% to reach $1 billion, while the market cap climbed by 5.60% to $3.54 billion.

Though it remains bearish despite the latest surge. In the last leg down, Shiba managed to stay above the psychological $0.00001 level after breaking through several support levels since the start of the year. While the sell-off seemed to have temporarily cooled off, the price increased as it showed strength on the daily chart. This started after bouncing back above the mentioned psychological level two weeks back. The bounce produced a substantial gain in the past week and briefly changed the trading landscape, while the trend remains bearish on the daily chart. Looking back from where it started to drop at $0.000034 in December, Shiba still maintains a swing low trend. As we can see, the latest bounce is considered a retracement of the short-term bearish. The drag down will likely continue if the bulls fail to sustain momentum. If not, more surges could bring a bigger recovery before the bears step back. Currently, they are taking a break, and from the look of things, they will likely release pressure again. It will be too early to say the bulls are back in the market. Shiba’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Right now, Shib aims to test a nearby resistance level at $0.0000173. A rejection there may bring selling back in the market, but if it pushes higher, the next resistance to watch above it is $0.000019, followed by the $0.0000223 level. On the daily chart, there’s support for Shiba at $0.0000138, $0.0000123 and the $0.0000109 level marked as the current monthly low. If the price breaks below it, a new low may surface at the $0.000009 level.

Regulatory Dynamics Shape Adoption: Clear regulations foster trust and attract investment, but overly stringent policies risk stifling innovation, especially in emerging markets. Technological Innovations Push Boundaries: Advances in cryptography, smart contracts, and AI are addressing scalability, security, and efficiency challenges, expanding possibilities in the digital economy. Crypto Promotes Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies provide access to financial tools for the unbanked, empowering individuals while transforming global workforce dynamics. Challenges Remain Critical: Security risks, environmental concerns, and market saturation are ongoing hurdles that require innovative solutions to sustain crypto’s growth. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology transforms the way we live, and cryptocurrency is one of those innovations that feels like it’s reshaping the future right before our eyes. From decentralised finance to blockchain-powered solutions, the digital economy is evolving at an incredible pace. It’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore—it’s about the vast ecosystem driving change across industries. Understanding the forces behind this dynamic world has been both exciting and eye-opening for me. The blend of technology, economics, and community-driven innovation creates an environment full of potential. Whether it’s the promise of financial inclusion or the push for greater transparency, crypto’s impact is undeniable. Exploring these forces isn’t just about staying informed; it’s about grasping the opportunities and challenges shaping tomorrow. Analysing The Core Components Of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency operates within an intricate framework that’s both fascinating and transformative. I’ve always found breaking down its core elements helps in making sense of its revolutionary potential. Understanding Blockchain Technology Blockchain technology forms the backbone of cryptocurrency. It’s a secure, immutable ledger that records transactions across a distributed network. I’m amazed by how it eliminates intermediaries, ensuring transparency and accountability. Experts, like Andreas Antonopoulos, call it the “internet of money” for good reason. Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash. This structure ensures that altering data in one block would require changing all subsequent blocks. It fosters trust, especially in a decentralised system where no central authority exists. Its robustness excites me. Transactions are verified using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. The absence of centralised verification speeds up processes and reduces costs. Blockchain, beyond finance, impacts healthcare, supply chains, and even voting systems. Role Of Decentralisation In Cryptocurrencies Decentralisation defines cryptocurrencies and differentiates them from traditional currencies. By distributing control across a global network, it removes reliance on central authorities. I’ve seen how this feature empowers individuals in regions with unstable economies. Nodes within the network validate transactions, preventing centralised control or censorship. Vitalik Buterin describes decentralisation as “a key to resistance against systemic corruption.” This aligns with cryptocurrency’s foundational ethos of financial sovereignty. Users hold private keys, ensuring only they control their funds. Peer-to-peer transactions reduce inefficiencies, increasing inclusivity. I believe decentralisation drives trust, making cryptocurrencies attractive to those seeking alternatives to traditional banking. Examining Tokenisation And Crypto Assets Tokenisation transforms real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents ownership or usage rights, enhancing liquidity and accessibility. I’m intrigued by how it democratises ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate in high-value assets. Crypto assets can be utility tokens, security tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Utility tokens power ecosystems, while security tokens represent investments. NFTs are unique and bring digital art and collectibles into mainstream markets. This diversity is thrilling. Tokenisation ensures transparency through blockchain-based verification. Regulators like the FCA are moving to clarify frameworks, which could spur adoption. I view crypto assets as symbols of the paradigm shift in how we perceive, trade, and store value. Exploring Market Trends Shaping Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are evolving rapidly, bringing fresh opportunities and challenges. With dynamic forces influencing the market, it’s clear that understanding key trends is crucial to navigating this digital economy effectively. Volatility And Price Mechanics Price volatility defines the crypto market, driven by speculators, investor sentiment, and rapid news cycles. I’ve noticed that significant events, like regulatory announcements or technological updates, can cause sharp price swings. Supply mechanics also play a crucial role. Cryptos like Bitcoin, with a capped supply of 21 million, exhibit scarcity value, amplifying demand during market upswings. Low liquidity often exacerbates volatility, especially for emerging altcoins. Adoption By Businesses And Consumers Business and consumer adoption is redefining cryptocurrencies’ practical uses. I’ve seen global firms like Tesla accept Bitcoin for payments, showcasing their legitimacy. Payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard are integrating crypto transactions, simplifying cross-border payments. Consumers are also warming to using crypto-backed cards for everyday purchases. DeFi platforms allow earning and borrowing, making crypto an economic alternative. These examples highlight growing trust in crypto products. Key Investment Trends In The Crypto Space Investment trends in crypto have shifted towards institutional participation. According to Bloomberg, over £40 billion flowed into crypto hedge funds and ETFs in 2023 alone. I’ve personally observed rising interest in utility-driven projects like Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, reducing transaction costs. NFTs and metaverse assets are gaining traction, offering new digital ownership pathways. Staking and earning opportunities through Proof-of-Stake networks also attract a growing investor base. Investigating Regulatory And Legal Dynamics Governments and agencies are continually shaping the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. I find this part of the digital economy fascinating, as it establishes how innovation and governance coexist. Government Policies Across The Globe Global regulatory efforts aim for consistency to protect investors and economies. The IMF has stressed the importance of coordinated frameworks, warning against naming crypto as legal tender due to risks for emerging markets. I think these moves balance innovation with financial stability. In countries like Japan and Switzerland, regulators classify cryptocurrencies distinctly to integrate them within their financial systems. Meanwhile, India and China continue imposing strict bans, focusing on reducing risks like illicit financing. These varying stances define the global crypto policies today. Challenges Of Compliance And Legal Frameworks Crypto firms face challenges adapting to diverse regulations worldwide. Regular shifts in the legal framework demand constant re-evaluation of compliance strategies. I often hear industry leaders expressing frustration over uncertainties in enforcement, especially across borders. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC in the US have differing views on crypto as securities or commodities. This overlapping jurisdiction adds layers of complexity for innovation. Trustworthy industry voices, like Coinbase’s CEO, advocate clearer rules for fostering growth. Impact Of Regulations On Crypto Adoption I think regulations play a key role in mainstream crypto adoption. Clarity in rules encourages institutional investors while reducing market volatility. For example, US guidelines have attracted firms looking to legitimise crypto operations within a safe, regulated framework. However, excess restrictions could stifle innovation. Emerging economies rely on crypto for financial inclusion but risk exclusion due to heavy-handed policies. Striking the right balance can create trust, enabling more users to embrace crypto securely and confidently. Understanding Technological Innovations In Crypto Technological advances in the crypto space are reshaping the digital economy. I find it fascinating how these developments are addressing challenges like scalability and expanding possibilities for decentralised finance (DeFi) and blockchain networking. Emerging Cryptographic Protocols Cryptographic protocols ensure secure, efficient communication in blockchain systems. Zero-knowledge proofs, for example, let parties verify transactions without revealing sensitive data. Innovations in quantum-resistant algorithms are also emerging to counter future threats from quantum computing. Chainlink’s verifiable random function (VRF) stands out for generating tamper-proof randomness in blockchain processes. Role Of AI And Machine Learning In Crypto AI and machine learning are transforming crypto trading and security. Algorithms predict price trends, enabling data-driven decisions. I’ve seen machine learning help prevent fraud by detecting unusual transaction patterns. AI also optimises blockchain management by automating tasks like resource allocation. OpenAI’s insights on blockchain scalability showcase AI’s potential in improving decentralised networks. Advancements In Smart Contracts And DeFi Smart contracts have taken digital agreements to the next level. Platforms like Ethereum and Solana enable programmable agreements that execute automatically. DeFi boosts financial inclusion through innovations like yield farming and decentralised lending. High-level automation in protocols like Aave has impressed me with its efficiency in offering secure, accessible, and interest-based crypto loans. Social And Cultural Impacts Of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are reshaping societies and challenging cultural norms. They empower individuals, promote global inclusion, and redefine value exchange in the digital age. Democratising Finance For The Unbanked Cryptocurrencies open access to financial tools for people without bank accounts. Over 1.4 billion adults globally remain unbanked, according to the World Bank. With just an internet connection, anyone can send or receive money, borrow, or save. This fosters inclusion and economic participation. Blockchain-based microloans are transforming lives in developing countries. Platforms like Celo let users access lending markets without credit histories. This bypasses traditional institutions, offering hope to those once excluded. I see this as a powerful force for empowerment. The Influence Of Cryptocurrencies On Workforce Dynamics Cryptocurrencies are altering workforce structures by introducing borderless payments. Freelancers now secure payments in Bitcoin or Ethereum, cutting delays from traditional transfers. This flexibility encourages cross-border collaboration, especially for remote workers. Start-ups in the blockchain space are thriving. Many hire employees through token compensation schemes instead of salaries, aligning interests. I’ve noticed friends joining crypto firms because they value transparency and shared growth potential. It’s a revolutionary change. Crypto Communities And Global Collaboration Crypto communities unite people across countries, fostering innovation. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) like MakerDAO govern assets globally, enabling democratic participation. Leaders like Vitalik Buterin cite them as crypto’s cultural backbone. Social media amplifies collaboration among enthusiasts. Platforms like Twitter and Reddit host thriving crypto discussions. From coding to marketing ideas, these communities build ecosystems together. I feel inspired witnessing this collective, borderless teamwork grow. Challenges And Risks In The Crypto Economy The crypto economy has brought significant opportunities, but it isn’t without its challenges. From security issues to environmental concerns, these risks must be addressed to sustain its evolution. Addressing Security Threats And Fraud Security issues are a major worry in the crypto market. Crypto Ponzi schemes, ICO scams, and thefts often target inexperienced investors. I’ve seen friends fall victim to phishing attacks, losing their funds. Experts recommend using hardware wallets and two-factor authentication for protection. Transparency in transactions and blockchain tracking tools, like CipherTrace, can help authorities tackle money laundering and fraud effectively. Navigating Environmental Concerns Of Mining Crypto mining’s energy consumption harms the environment. Bitcoin alone uses more energy annually than some countries. I know developers shifting to Proof-of-Stake systems to reduce energy needs, like Ethereum did. Renewable energy sources could make mining sustainable. Reports suggest miners are exploring green solutions, cutting emissions in the process. Governments are also scrutinising environmental impacts to encourage eco-friendly crypto practices. Managing The Impact Of Market Saturation The growing number of cryptocurrencies has led to market saturation. Over 10,000 tokens now compete for investor attention, diluting value and confusing users. I’ve invested in lesser-known coins only to see poor returns. Experts often advise focusing on projects with strong use cases. Decentralised finance (DeFi) and established tokens offer better stability. Staying informed is key to avoiding unreliable or short-lived crypto projects. Conclusion: Navigating The Future Of The Digital Economy The crypto landscape is evolving at a breathtaking pace, reshaping how we perceive value, ownership, and financial systems. It’s clear that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology hold immense potential to drive transparency, inclusion, and innovation across industries. As we navigate this dynamic space, balancing technological advancements with regulatory clarity will be essential to unlocking its full potential. By embracing the opportunities while addressing the challenges, we can foster a digital economy that’s more equitable, efficient, and sustainable for everyone. The journey ahead is both exciting and complex, but with the right focus, the transformative power of cryptocurrency can truly redefine our global economy.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-26 23:59:59

For instance, the ONDO market cap has recently decreased by 12%, despite the initiative’s expansion into real-world asset tokenization with partners like Mastercard. Conversely, the cryptocurrency community has noted an Aptos (APT) price surge following Bitwise’s ETF application. Yet, perhaps the most captivating development is from BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its new Ambassador Program offers every blockchain enthusiast a chance at leadership, exclusive perks, and a firsthand experience of Web3 innovations. Given BlockDAG’s impressive growth—rising 2,380% in value—this program is seen as an opportunity to join one of the most promising ventures in the current market. Market Cap of Ondo Finance Falls Despite Forward-Looking Strategies At present, the ONDO market cap is about $3.25 billion, showing a 12% reduction over the last day. This decline comes in stark contrast to the company’s ambitious plans in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Ondo Finance has recently teamed up with Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN) to integrate its Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries Fund (OUSG). This collaboration marks a significant step toward the broader acceptance of tokenized assets. Despite recent price fluctuations, these strategic partnerships highlight Ondo’s dedication to merging conventional financial systems with decentralized technologies, setting up the ONDO market cap for potential future growth as more traditional assets become tokenized. Aptos (APT) Price Surge Following Bitwise’s ETF Proposal Aptos (APT) saw a significant price increase of about 12% on March 5, 2025, subsequent to Bitwise Asset Management’s application for a cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). This Aptos (APT) price surge signifies a growing institutional interest in this digital asset. The ETF intends to offer regulated access to APT, enhancing its appeal in the broader market. Prior to this move, Bitwise had established an Aptos trust in Delaware, indicating a strategy to enlarge its cryptocurrency investment options. The recent Aptos (APT) price surge mirrors the market’s optimistic reaction to these developments. Exploring BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program: A Path to Engagement and Rewards BlockDAG offers blockchain enthusiasts a unique opportunity to not just observe but actively influence the market. The Ambassador Program by BlockDAG goes beyond merely promoting the project—it’s a platform to gain firsthand Web3 experience, connect globally, and engage with the core team of the project. Participants in the program receive updates directly, attend workshops, and collaborate with peers who are equally passionate. To join, applicants simply complete an online form, and upon acceptance, can immediately start contributing. This initiative is central to fostering community engagement, which is vital to BlockDAG’s expansive goals. More than just participation, being an ambassador comes with tangible rewards. Participants earn BDAG coins, gain access to exclusive events, and receive unique merchandise. Active ambassadors can ascend to leadership roles, increasing their influence within the community and gaining prominence at significant blockchain events. With over $206 million gathered from the BlockDAG coin presale and BDAG’s price increase from $0.001 to $0.0248 through multiple batches, many regard this period as the best time to buy crypto. An expanding community enhances the project’s strength, pushing it toward a $600 million presale target. BlockDAG continues to progress rapidly. Having sold 18.8 billion BDAG and with projections of substantial returns for early participants, the success of the Ambassador Program is instrumental in this growth. As the ecosystem evolves, buying crypto now means joining a dynamic movement poised to make a significant impact. Final Thoughts on Ondo, Aptos & BlockDAG’s Future Which cryptocurrency stands out as the best to purchase? Ondo Finance is pushing forward with its strategy for tokenizing real-world assets, though the ONDO market cap fluctuates with market reactions to its latest initiatives. Meanwhile, the Aptos (APT) price surge after Bitwise’s ETF application highlights increasing institutional interest, though its future potential is still forming. BlockDAG distinguishes itself with considerable momentum. Its Ambassador Program offers more than community engagement—it’s a gateway to leadership, exclusive benefits, and early involvement in one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency projects.

Pseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse tells his 266,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks crypto is still bearish and the latest rally will probably lead to another leg down. According to the analyst, the current bounce has not changed the bearish market structure of crypto. “Bearish still on the high time frame until proven otherwise. I can’t see any reason why this isn’t a relief rally and markets won’t continue to suck the next few months. Chart is still broken.” Elaborating on his bearish stance on crypto, the trader says on the instant messaging platform Telegram that the downtrend will likely persist unless Bitcoin ( BTC ) flips a key price area into support. “I think we are at the part where the correction can be, as I said the other day, one that is more through time than through price. I will be looking at how FARTCOIN, HYPE, PEPE, ENA and BERA continue to trade. Being that it is a Bitcoin dominance macro trend, there is no reason to assume that changes, and any success in alts is going to come down to if BTC can turn this $90,000-$93,000 level into support.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $87,813.

The Avalanche (AVAX) price rally has picked up pace, with technical indicators and funding data hinting at more room to climb. At the same time, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has surged after a massive 1 billion token burn, reinforcing long-term efforts to reduce supply. But while both tokens ride current trends, one project is creating its own. BlockDAG (BDAG) has its Keynote 3 release set for March 28, and speculation is high—updates on exchange listings, new strategic partnerships, and even major rewards for early holders are expected. The Keynote 3 could be the mega event that cements BDAG as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Traders Eye Gains as Avalanche Price Rally Continues The Avalanche (AVAX) price rally showed continued strength on Monday, with the token climbing over 7% and trading above $21. Recent price action broke a descending trendline, and AVAX is now targeting resistance levels at $24.99 and potentially $30. On-chain indicators support the bullish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index is trending above 50, and a bullish MACD crossover appeared last week. Coinglass data further reinforces positive momentum, as AVAX’s long-to-short ratio hit 1.18—its highest in more than a month. As funding rates turn positive, the Avalanche (AVAX) price rally may still have room to run in the near term. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges Following 1B Token Burn The Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate saw a dramatic 8,470% increase after an anonymous wallet removed 1 billion SHIB tokens from circulation in a single transaction. Recorded by the community tracker Shibburn, this burn took place at 14:55 UTC and was valued at approximately $13,050. Etherscan data suggests the same wallet has conducted multiple similar burns, including two additional 1 billion SHIB transactions since August 2024. In total, over 1.004 billion SHIB were burned across 14 transactions within 24 hours. This sharp rise in the Shiba Inu burn rate reflects ongoing efforts to reduce supply and support long-term value. 2 Days Until BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Drops! Could This Be BDAG’s Plot Twist? BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 is almost here, and the excitement is hard to ignore. March 28 is shaping up to be a milestone moment. The project’s earlier keynotes already proved its flair for high-impact reveals—Keynote 1 lit up Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing, while Keynote 2 went viral for its unique, moon-themed video. Now, the third Keynote brings Hollywood-level production into the mix, raising expectations for something even bigger. Anticipation isn’t limited to visuals or theatrics—it’s tied directly to what this could unlock for the coin itself. Plenty of chatter surrounds what might drop. Some expect a confirmed mainnet launch date. Others are betting on centralised exchange listings or sizable rewards for early holders. These types of announcements often drive a shift in market perception—and with BDAG already up 2,380% since its presale began, the stakes feel higher than ever. Confidence in the project has grown steadily, and momentum continues to build as each presale batch sells out. For a growing number of analysts and crypto followers, BlockDAG is becoming a top crypto to buy in 2025 . Now priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, BDAG is attracting attention from both early adopters and latecomers. The limited window before Keynote 3 is creating urgency, not hype. As demand increases and supply tightens, the value proposition becomes harder to ignore. For holders, this moment marks a shift—from potential to pressure, from build-up to breakout. Final Takeaways The Avalanche price rally continues to hold market interest, especially as traders watch for a breakout above key resistance. Meanwhile, the sudden spike in the Shiba Inu burn rate has reignited talk about its deflationary model and long-term value prospects. But while both have their eyes on incremental gains, BlockDAG is staring down a potentially game-changing moment. Keynote 3 drops in just days, and the clock is ticking. If even half the rumors—such as updates on exchange listings, bigger partnerships, and exclusive holder rewards—prove true, BDAG’s $0.0248 price would quickly become a thing of the past as its value will jump. Among the top cryptos to buy in 2025, BDAG is racing ahead.

42451870,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=30115,1743033645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,The Future of Finance: How Crypto and Blockchain are Revolutionising the Financial World,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/the-future-of-finance-how-crypto-and-blockchain-are-revolutionising-the-financial-world/,"Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are revolutionising finance by enabling decentralised, secure, and transparent transactions without intermediaries. Blockchain’s key applications include facilitating cross-border payments, smart contracts, and decentralised finance (DeFi), which improve efficiency and reduce costs. Cryptocurrencies offer financial access to the unbanked, fostering global inclusion while also lowering transaction fees for individuals and businesses. Significant challenges to adoption include regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and public mistrust, though strides are being made to address these concerns. The future of finance includes mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, innovative blockchain advancements, and balanced regulations from governments and central banks. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and nowhere is this more evident than in finance. Over the past decade, crypto and blockchain have gone from niche concepts to transformative forces, reshaping how we think about money, transactions and trust. It’s incredible to see how these innovations are breaking barriers and creating opportunities that felt impossible just a few years ago. For me, what stands out most is the sense of empowerment these technologies bring. Blockchain’s transparency and decentralisation offer a refreshing alternative to traditional systems, while cryptocurrencies are opening doors to financial inclusion for millions. It’s not just about disrupting the old ways—it’s about building something better, more accessible and more secure. This evolution isn’t just exciting; it’s redefining the rules of the game, and I can’t wait to see where it takes us next. Understanding the Basics of Crypto and Blockchain Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have redefined how we think about financial systems. Their innovative features make them compelling tools for creating a decentralised and secure future. What Is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is digital money built on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies, it operates independently of governments or central banks. Bitcoin and Ethereum are popular examples. I find its transparency fascinating; every user can verify transactions, fostering trust in the system. How Does Blockchain Technology Work? Blockchain is a shared digital ledger that records transactions in blocks. Each block is linked to the previous one using cryptography, ensuring data can’t be altered. It’s efficient and secure. Developers I’ve spoken to praise its decentralised nature, which empowers users by removing intermediaries. Key Differences Between Traditional Finance and Blockchain Finance Traditional finance relies on centralised institutions, such as banks, to verify and process transactions. Blockchain finance eliminates middlemen by enabling peer-to-peer exchanges. It also operates 24/7, unlike banks with limited hours. I appreciate that it grants financial access globally, even to the unbanked. Exploring the Benefits of Cryptocurrency in Finance Enhanced Security and Transparency Cryptocurrency uses blockchain to secure transactions with immutable records. Each entry is tamper-proof, which builds trust in the system. Cryptographic techniques shield identities, reducing fraud risks. Public ledgers allow anyone to verify transactions, ensuring transparency. Lower Transaction Costs Crypto eliminates intermediaries like banks, cutting transaction fees. When I’ve sent payments abroad using Bitcoin, it was faster and cheaper than traditional methods. For small businesses, this is a game-changer. Blockchain’s efficiency means fewer charges for transfers, even across borders. Accessibility for the Unbanked Blockchain opens access to financial tools for the unbanked. People without traditional bank accounts can store, send, or receive funds via mobile wallets. I’ve seen how crypto empowers communities by offering global financial inclusion. It’s a step towards equal economic opportunities. Revolutionising Industries with Blockchain Technology Blockchain is reshaping industries with its transparency and efficiency. From cross-border payments to automation and decentralised finance (DeFi), its potential is vast. I’ve seen how it’s already transforming some sectors, and the future looks promising. Transforming Cross-Border Payments Blockchain is streamlining international transactions. I’ve noticed how blockchain eliminates intermediaries like SWIFT, cutting costs and delays. According to the World Bank, traditional cross-border remittance fees average 6.3%, but blockchain reduces them to nearly zero. Payments settle almost instantly, which is crucial for businesses and migrants supporting families abroad. Ripple, for instance, uses blockchain to connect banks, offering real-time global transactions. It’s a change I find incredible compared to dealing with outdated systems. Smart Contracts and Automation Smart contracts automate processes securely. These self-executing contracts reduce paperwork and eliminate disputes by enforcing terms automatically. Ethereum’s blockchain made smart contracts mainstream, and I’ve seen them in use for insurance claims, supply chains, and property deals. They save time and reduce human error. For example, companies like Slock.it use them to manage rental contracts efficiently. The potential for transparency and cost-cutting in industries is unmatched. It’s like having a neutral referee overseeing transactions. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and Its Applications DeFi is creating financial tools without banks. It enables borrowing, lending, and trading through blockchain-powered platforms. I’ve used platforms like Aave, which let users earn interest or secure loans within minutes. DeFi removes centralised control, making finance accessible to everyone. As reported by DeFi Pulse, this sector holds over £39 billion in assets, growing rapidly. Start-ups and individuals benefit from this new, trustless system. I believe DeFi could define future finance, making it fairer and more inclusive globally. Challenges Facing Crypto and Blockchain Adoption Crypto and blockchain are reshaping finance, but several obstacles slow widespread adoption. From regulatory uncertainties to concerns over scalability and trust, these challenges need solutions for full potential realisation. Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance Issues Undefined rules around cryptocurrencies make global operations tough. Countries label them differently, as securities, currencies, or commodities, leading to confusion. I’ve seen businesses hesitate to invest due to unclear legal landscapes. Regulatory clarity would boost confidence, as highlighted by leading financial experts. Scalability and Energy Concerns Blockchain struggles with processing speed, limiting use. Bitcoin handles 7 transactions per second compared to Visa’s 24,000. The energy use of proof-of-work systems also raises flags. My experience with Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake shows steps towards improving efficiency while reducing impact. Public Perception and Trust Barriers Mistrust in crypto stems from scams and market volatility. Many still link it to criminal activities despite advancements. When I first started using blockchain apps, scepticism from peers was common. Mainstream adoption requires transparency and education to break these barriers, as experts frequently suggest. Predictions for the Future of Crypto and Blockchain Blockchain and cryptocurrency are reshaping finance. I see their potential to drive innovation, boost global inclusion, and transform industries further. Here’s what’s next: Mainstream Adoption of Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies are becoming widely accepted by businesses and individuals. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) add an exciting dimension, even though they differ from decentralised crypto. Experts believe DeFi platforms and NFTs will continue accelerating adoption globally. Major companies like Tesla and PayPal already accept Bitcoin. This trend seems unstoppable as crypto payments become part of everyday life. I’ve noticed how small businesses in my circle are exploring crypto-friendly transactions, which signals a broader move towards its normalisation. New Innovations in Blockchain Technology Blockchain innovation isn’t slowing down. From scaling solutions like Ethereum’s Layer 2 updates to interoperability projects such as Polkadot, developers are creating efficient systems. These advancements might solve previous bottlenecks like high fees and slow networks. Its applications across voting systems, healthcare data storage, and supply chain transparency amaze me. Seeing energy-efficient consensus protocols like Proof of Stake rise gives hope for sustainable progress. Even friends in tech are excited about pioneering breakthroughs. The Role of Governments and Central Banks in Crypto Regulation Governments now realise crypto regulation is critical as adoption grows. China’s digital yuan and the European Central Bank’s digital euro are examples of how central banks shape future finance. Clear policies offering protection without stifling freedom can balance crypto evolution. Authorities will seek to prevent misuse without halting innovation. Conversations with legal experts reassure me that collaboration between regulators and crypto developers will define fair frameworks. It’s encouraging to see this dialogue narrowing the gap between control and innovation. Conclusion Crypto and blockchain have already begun reshaping the financial world, offering solutions that challenge traditional systems. Their potential to drive innovation, enhance inclusivity, and streamline processes is undeniable. While hurdles like regulation and scalability remain, these technologies are evolving rapidly, with promising advancements on the horizon. As adoption grows and more industries embrace decentralisation, the financial landscape will continue to transform. I believe the future of finance lies in finding the balance between innovation and regulation, unlocking opportunities for a fairer, more accessible global economy.

Buckle up, because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is gearing up for a series of crucial roundtables that could significantly shape the digital asset landscape. If you’re invested in cryptocurrencies, pay attention – this is information you absolutely need to know! What’s Happening with SEC Crypto Regulation? The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, a dedicated team focused on the burgeoning world of digital assets, has announced four pivotal industry roundtables. These aren’t just casual chats; they are structured discussions designed to gather insights and perspectives from industry experts, stakeholders, and the public. The aim? To better understand and ultimately regulate the rapidly evolving crypto space. Eleanor Terrett, a well-known name in financial journalism, broke the news on X, sparking immediate interest and anticipation within the crypto community. Why are Crypto Regulation Roundtables Important? Think of these roundtables as open forums where the SEC can directly engage with the crypto industry. This proactive approach is vital for several reasons: Direct Dialogue: It fosters direct communication between regulators and those being regulated. This two-way street allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and innovations within the crypto world. Informed Policy Making: By hearing directly from industry participants, the SEC can make more informed decisions when crafting regulations. This helps to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach that might stifle innovation. Transparency: Public roundtables offer a level of transparency, allowing the crypto community and the general public to understand the SEC’s concerns and the issues being discussed. Industry Input: These discussions provide a platform for the crypto industry to voice their concerns, challenges, and suggestions directly to the regulators. In essence, these roundtables are a critical step towards creating a regulatory framework that is both effective in protecting investors and conducive to innovation in the digital asset space. Breaking Down the Crypto Regulation Roundtable Schedule Let’s take a closer look at the schedule and the specific topics each roundtable will address: Date Topic Focus Area April 11 Crypto Trading Regulation and oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges, trading platforms, and market manipulation. April 25 Custody Secure storage and safeguarding of digital assets, addressing concerns around investor protection and asset security. May 12 Tokenization Legal and regulatory implications of tokenizing real-world assets, including securities laws and potential benefits and risks. June 6 DeFi’s Role in the U.S. Financial Landscape Examining the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, its impact on traditional finance, and potential regulatory approaches. Crypto Trading Roundtable: What’s on the Agenda? The first roundtable on April 11th will tackle crypto trading . This is a hot topic as the way cryptocurrencies are bought, sold, and exchanged is fundamental to the entire ecosystem. Expect discussions around: Exchange Regulation: Should crypto exchanges be regulated like traditional securities exchanges? What specific rules should apply? Market Manipulation: How can regulators combat market manipulation in the often volatile crypto markets? What tools and surveillance are needed?

This roundtable is crucial for setting the stage for fairer and more transparent crypto trading practices. Custody Roundtable: Securing Your Digital Assets Next up is the custody roundtable on April 25th. Crypto custody – the safe storage of digital assets – is a major concern for both institutional and retail investors. Key questions likely to be addressed include: Qualified Custodians: What standards should be required for entities holding large amounts of crypto assets? Should traditional financial institutions play a larger role in crypto custody ? Security Protocols: What are the best practices for securing digital assets against theft and hacking? How can regulatory frameworks encourage robust security measures? Liability and Insurance: Who is liable if custodied crypto assets are lost or stolen?

Tokenization has the potential to revolutionize various industries, and this roundtable is crucial for understanding its regulatory needs. DeFi Regulation Roundtable: Navigating the Decentralized Frontier Finally, on June 6th, the SEC will delve into DeFi regulation and DeFi’s role in the U.S. financial landscape . DeFi , or decentralized finance, is arguably the most disruptive force in the crypto space, aiming to recreate traditional financial services in a decentralized, permissionless manner. Expect discussions on: Regulatory Perimeter: How can regulators effectively oversee DeFi protocols and platforms given their decentralized nature? Where does regulation fit in a world without intermediaries? Smart Contract Risks: What are the risks associated with smart contracts that underpin DeFi ? How can vulnerabilities be addressed and investor protection ensured? Financial Stability: Could DeFi pose systemic risks to the broader financial system? What measures are needed to maintain financial stability in the face of DeFi growth?

Mind of Pepe and Arctic Pablo Coin are two meme coins that have captured attention with their unique concepts. Mind of Pepe combines AI integration with meme culture, offering automated insights through its self-evolving agent. Arctic Pablo Coin takes a storytelling approach, weaving an adventurous narrative into its presale phases while providing staking opportunities. Yet, among these, Dragoin ($DDGN) truly stands out by going beyond mere concepts. With practical features like Play-to-Earn gaming, staking, and a deflationary burn mechanism, Dragoin delivers real value, making it a sensible early investment in the meme coin market. Mind of Pepe: Revolutionizing Meme Coins with AI Integration Mind of Pepe ($MIND) launched its presale on January 13, 2025, introducing an innovative blend of meme culture and artificial intelligence. Specifically, this Ethereum-based token features a self-evolving AI agent designed to analyze real-time crypto market data, engage with social media platforms, and provide strategic insights to its community. Furthermore, the presale consists of 70 stages, starting at a price of $0.00310100 in Stage 1 and incrementally increasing to $0.00382150 by Stage 70. Consequently, the project quickly gained traction, raising over $3.5 million within two days of the presale launch. By February 14, 2025, MIND of Pepe had already surpassed the $6 million milestone, reflecting strong investor interest. In terms of allocation, the token distribution includes 25% for AI agent development, 30% for project growth, 20% for marketing, 15% for rewards, and 10% for exchange listings. Therefore, this strategic distribution aims to enhance the token’s utility and value over time. Arctic Pablo Coin: An Adventurous Narrative with High-Yield Potential Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) distinguishes itself through a narrative-driven presale, following the fictional journey of Arctic Pablo, an explorer uncovering hidden treasures. Notably, each presale phase represents a unique location in Pablo’s adventure, adding an immersive element to the investment experience. As of March 25, 2025, the presale has reached its 16th phase, “Crystal Cove,” with the token priced at $0.000083. As a result, the project has raised over $2 million to date, indicating robust community support. Moreover, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale, reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Additionally, investors can participate in a staking program offering a 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), with staked coins vested for a two-month period from the launch date. Significantly, the projected listing price is $0.008, suggesting a potential return on investment of approximately 9,552.41% from the current phase to the listing. Redefining Meme Coins: Dragoin’s Practical Utility Sets It Apart Dragoin ($DDGN) breaks the mold of typical meme coins by offering real-world utility and meaningful community involvement. Unlike many meme coins that thrive solely on hype, Dragoin brings practical features that give it lasting value and purpose. One standout aspect of Dragoin is its Play-to-Earn gaming platform, where users control their own dragons, take on challenges, and earn $DDGN tokens. As a result, this gaming ecosystem isn’t just for fun—it creates a continuous incentive for users to engage and hold tokens, driving demand and strengthening the community. In addition, Dragoin’s staking capability allows holders to lock their tokens and earn rewards. This not only encourages long-term investment but also reduces the circulating supply, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. Furthermore, Dragoin’s commitment to decentralization is evident in its governance model. With a renounced smart contract, no single entity holds control, promoting transparency and community trust. Moreover, one of Dragoin’s most strategic moves is its burn mechanism, where unsold tokens from the presale are permanently removed from circulation. As a result, this scarcity model directly supports price stability and creates an urgency for early investment. Consequently, investors seeking more than just short-lived hype will find Dragoin’s blend of utility and community focus appealing. By prioritizing long-term value and real user engagement, Dragoin makes a solid case as a smart early investment. It’s not just about holding a coin—it’s about being part of an ecosystem that rewards active participation and community trust. The Future of Meme Coins Lies in Practical Utility As meme coins continue to evolve, the focus is shifting from mere hype to genuine utility. Mind of Pepe and Arctic Pablo Coin both offer unique concepts that set them apart from traditional meme coins. Mind of Pepe leverages AI-driven insights, while Arctic Pablo Coin blends storytelling with staking opportunities. However, Dragoin ($DDGN) takes it a step further by integrating real-world value through Play-to-Earn gaming, secure staking, and a robust burn mechanism that drives scarcity. This thoughtful approach not only enhances user engagement but also makes Dragoin a more sustainable choice in the meme coin space.

The firm suggests that the market has not yet decided whether Bitcoin will break out from these levels or be rejected. MakroVision also raises a broader question about Bitcoin’s position in the overall market cycle. “Are we still in a bull market or have we entered a transition phase?” the firm asked in its latest market update. Its main reports examine macroeconomic correlations, historical patterns, and potential scenarios for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.

However, although the 24-hour change saw the coin pump over 10%, analysts say the setup does not look like it could take the coin higher. This is because investors' confidence is still low from the bearish hit that dropped the price below a 5-month low. But with the rising number of investors in the crypto market in the last few months, if the Dogecoin price does not reflect a long-term surge, where is the money going? Why The Dogecoin Price Is Seeing A Growth Delay While Dogecoin remains the biggest meme coin in the world, its price action in the last few months has not been impressive. Many analysts have tried to analyze why Dogecoin's price has continued to find new lows. Still, the only logical conclusion has been that investors are losing confidence in the coin. One of the top factors that drove the Dogecoin price to its ATH in 2021 is the Elon Musk Influence and its many promises. However, while there were different sentiments and speculations, the promise to add Dogecoin as a payment option for Tesla effectively drove the price higher. Four years after the Dogecoin price ATH of $0.7375, the price continues to struggle under $0.4850. The recent 10% price surge increased the coin from a $0.1847 low. This has continued to cast a shadow on the future of the Dogecoin price, causing a sharp drop in investors' interest. Analysts still believe the Dogecoin price could recover with some significant change to the ecosystem; for example, the final implementation as a Tesla payment method could add more strength to investors' confidence.

Leading crypto exchange TruBit has announced a groundbreaking partnership with DeFi lending protocol Morpho. This collaboration is set to introduce a novel DeFi earn product, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) usability and the innovative world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Are you ready to explore how this powerful alliance could reshape crypto earning opportunities in the region? What is DeFi Earn and Why is it a Game Changer? DeFi Earn , at its core, refers to earning yield or interest on your cryptocurrency holdings through decentralized finance protocols.

This new offering from TruBit and Morpho aims to simplify access to these complex DeFi mechanisms, making it user-friendly even for those new to the crypto space. Here’s why DeFi earn is creating waves: Higher Yield Potential: DeFi platforms often offer significantly higher annual percentage yields (APYs) compared to traditional savings or fixed deposits. Transparency and Control: Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, offering transparency. Users typically retain control of their assets in non-custodial wallets. Financial Inclusion: DeFi can provide access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked populations, particularly relevant in regions like Latin America. Innovation and Growth: The DeFi space is constantly evolving, with new protocols and earning strategies emerging regularly.

For those keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency and tech landscape, understanding where major players are placing their bets is crucial. And here’s a fascinating development: Amazon’s Alexa Fund, initially focused on voice technology, is now making a bold pivot towards the booming field of AI startups . This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a significant expansion signaling where Amazon sees the future of tech heading. Let’s dive into what this exciting shift means for the AI ecosystem and beyond. Why is Amazon’s Alexa Fund Now Targeting AI Startups? Launched in 2015, the Alexa Fund was originally conceived to fuel innovation in voice-first technologies, aligning perfectly with the rise of Alexa and voice assistants. However, the tech world doesn’t stand still. The monumental advancements in large language models and generative AI have created a paradigm shift. Amazon, recognizing this transformative wave, is strategically repositioning the Alexa Fund to capitalize on this new frontier. With Amazon itself launching Gen AI-powered Alexa+ and a suite of multimodal AI models, it’s a natural progression for their investment arm to follow suit. Paul Bernard, the leader of the Alexa Fund , articulated this evolution in a recent blog post. He explained that while the Fund’s core mission has always been about pushing technological boundaries, the “rapid developments in AI present an inflection point”. This inflection point allows the Fund to embrace cutting-edge AI investment while staying true to its original goal of fostering innovation. The Fund is now actively seeking to invest in startups that are pioneering: AI-enabled Hardware : The next generation of devices infused with artificial intelligence. Smart Agents : Intelligent assistants that go beyond voice commands, anticipating user needs and acting proactively. Generative Media : Startups creating novel forms of content using AI. Emerging AI Architectures : Companies developing the foundational technologies that will power future AI breakthroughs. To get a clearer picture of this evolving strategy, Bitcoin World had an exclusive conversation with Paul Bernard, diving deep into the renewed mission and recent investments of the Alexa Fund . What Kind of AI Startups is the Alexa Fund Investing In? The Alexa Fund isn’t just talking the talk; they’re walking the walk with concrete investments in promising AI startups . Recently, they’ve added four new companies to their portfolio, each tackling unique challenges and opportunities within the AI space: NinjaTech AI : Imagine an AI Swiss Army knife. NinjaTech AI is developing an all-encompassing AI platform. Their chatbot is not just about text; it can generate code, conjure images and videos, conduct in-depth research, and even manage your schedule. Think of it as a supercharged AI assistant, similar to Quora’s Poe, offering access to a range of powerful models from OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, Google, and Deepseek. Notably, Amazon highlights that NinjaTech AI’s infrastructure is built on AWS, showcasing synergy within the Amazon ecosystem. Hedra : For the creatives out there, Hedra is an AI media company that’s making waves in content generation. Their studio empowers users to create stunning visuals, audio, and video using AI . With the recent launch of Character-3 AI , Hedra is pushing the boundaries of AI -driven content creation. Having already secured $10 million in funding last year from prominent investors like a16z Games Speedrun, Abstract, and Index Ventures, Hedra is a startup to watch. Ario : Balancing family life can be chaotic. Ario steps in as an AI -powered family management app designed to bring order to scheduling and task management. One of its standout features is a “school email decoder” that intelligently extracts events and action items from school communications. Paul Bernard from the Alexa Fund praised Ario’s ability to understand the personal context behind tasks, a crucial element for effective family organization. While other startups like Hearth Display and Maple are also tackling family schedule management, Ario’s AI -driven approach offers a fresh perspective. HeyBoss : If you’re online in tech circles, you’ve likely encountered the buzz around “vibe coding.” HeyBoss is a startup firmly in this space, enabling users to create websites, apps, games, and prototypes simply by describing their vision. This low-code/no-code approach is gaining momentum, with companies like Cursor, Lovable, Replit, and Bolt.new also innovating in this area. HeyBoss democratizes development, making it accessible to a wider range of creators. What are the Strategic Benefits for Amazon? For Amazon, AI investment in these startups isn’t purely altruistic; it’s a strategic move with multiple layers of benefits. These startups become invaluable proving grounds for Amazon’s extensive cloud and AI stack. Many gain early access to private APIs and SDKs, essentially becoming living laboratories for Amazon’s technologies. Furthermore, Amazon provides these startups with access to senior executives and opportunities within Amazon Business, fostering a symbiotic relationship. This strategy mirrors a broader trend in the tech industry. Major players in AI are actively funding promising startups to expand their ecosystems and drive innovation. OpenAI’s startup fund, for example, has backed numerous ventures across healthcare, robotics, edtech, and creative tools. Anthropic has partnered with Menlo Ventures to create an investment vehicle, and Google has recently invested in companies like Glance and Toonsutra, offering them access to their AI models. The Future of AI Investment and Innovation Amazon’s redoubled focus on AI startups through the Alexa Fund is a clear indicator of the immense potential and transformative power of artificial intelligence. By strategically funding and nurturing these early-stage companies, Amazon is not only expanding its own ecosystem but also contributing to the broader advancement of AI technologies. This wave of AI investment from tech giants signals a dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape, promising exciting innovations and applications in the years to come. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the underlying technologies driving AI , such as decentralized computing and data management, may find increasing synergy and relevance as AI continues its exponential growth. The convergence of AI and blockchain could unlock entirely new paradigms, and Amazon’s proactive stance in AI investment positions them at the forefront of this technological revolution.

When incidents occur, how platforms respond can significantly impact user confidence and the future of the ecosystem. Recently, Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX), faced a challenging situation involving its JELLY perpetual futures market. Following evidence of suspicious market activity, Hyperliquid made a decisive move: delisting JELLY and, more importantly, pledging to compensate affected users. This article dives deep into the Hyperliquid compensation plan, the details surrounding the JELLY incident, and what it all means for the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Happened with the JELLY Incident on Hyperliquid? To understand the gravity of Hyperliquid’s decision, let’s break down the sequence of events that led to the JELLY incident : * Suspicious Activity Detected : Hyperliquid’s monitoring systems flagged unusual trading patterns in the JELLY perpetual futures market. * Massive Short Position: A trader opened an extraordinarily large short position of 430 million JELLY tokens. This is a highly leveraged bet that the price of JELLY would decrease significantly. * Liquidation and Margin Withdrawal: The trader strategically liquidated a smaller portion (30 million JELLY) of their position, seemingly to manipulate the market and then withdrew a substantial margin of 2.76 million USDC. * Forced Liquidation: This initial activity triggered a cascading effect, leading to the liquidation of a massive 398 million JELLY tokens from other traders’ positions. * Price Skyrocket & Losses: As the market reacted, the price of JELLY unexpectedly surged. This price spike caused significant unrealized losses on the Hyperliquid liquidation address, exceeding $10 million. * Liquidation at Profit: Interestingly, the Hyperliquid liquidation address managed to close out the JELLY short position at $0.0095, ultimately making a profit of around $700,000 despite the earlier losses. This suggests a complex and potentially manipulative trading strategy was at play. This chain of events highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets and the potential for sophisticated trading strategies to exploit vulnerabilities, even on advanced platforms like Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid’s Response: Prioritizing User Compensation In the wake of the JELLY incident , Hyperliquid’s response has been swift and user-centric. Here’s a look at their key actions: * Immediate Delisting: Recognizing the ongoing risks and potential for further manipulation, Hyperliquid acted decisively by delisting the JELLY perpetual futures market. This was done through a validator vote, showcasing a degree of on-chain governance. * Investigation and Transparency: Hyperliquid launched an investigation into the suspicious market activity to understand the full extent of the manipulation and identify the responsible parties. * Commitment to Compensation: Crucially, Hyperliquid announced its commitment to compensate users who suffered losses due to the incident, excluding those involved in the suspicious activity. This pledge is a significant step towards restoring user trust. * Hyper Foundation Backing: The compensation will be provided by the Hyper Foundation, indicating a strong financial backing and commitment to making users whole. * Details to Follow: Hyperliquid has promised to release further details on the compensation method soon, assuring users that a fair and equitable process will be implemented. This proactive approach to Hyperliquid compensation demonstrates a commitment to user protection that is crucial for the long-term health and credibility of DeFi platforms. Addressing Crypto Exchange Centralization Concerns The JELLY incident has reignited discussions around crypto exchange centralization , even within the DeFi space. While Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange, certain aspects of its operation have come under scrutiny: * Validator Vote for Delisting: The decision to delist JELLY through a validator vote, while showcasing on-chain governance, also raises questions about the level of centralization within the validator set and their influence on market decisions. Is this truly decentralized if a small group can make such impactful changes? * Risk Management and Monitoring: While Hyperliquid detected the suspicious activity, questions arise about the effectiveness of risk management systems in preventing such incidents in the first place. Can DeFi platforms be truly resilient against sophisticated market manipulation tactics? * Transparency of Operations: Critics argue that more transparency is needed regarding Hyperliquid’s operational processes, including its risk management protocols and the decision-making processes of its validators. Greater transparency can foster trust and allow users to better assess the risks involved. These concerns are not unique to Hyperliquid but are pertinent to the broader DeFi ecosystem. The balance between decentralization, efficiency, and security remains a critical challenge. DeFi Risk Management: Lessons from the JELLY Incident The JELLY incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent DeFi risk management challenges in decentralized finance. Here are some key takeaways: * Market Manipulation is a Real Threat: Even in supposedly decentralized environments, sophisticated actors can attempt to manipulate markets for their gain. Robust monitoring and risk management systems are essential. * Liquidity and Volatility: The incident highlights the interplay between liquidity and volatility in crypto markets. Low liquidity pairs can be particularly susceptible to manipulation, and rapid price swings can amplify losses. * Importance of Audits and Security: While not directly related to smart contract vulnerabilities in this case, the incident underscores the ongoing need for rigorous audits and security measures to protect DeFi platforms and users. * User Education is Crucial: Users need to be aware of the risks associated with trading volatile and less liquid assets, and understand the mechanics of leverage and liquidation. * Platform Responsibility: DeFi platforms have a responsibility to implement robust risk management systems, provide transparent information, and act decisively to protect users when incidents occur, as Hyperliquid is demonstrating with its compensation plan. Rebuilding User Trust in DeFi Incidents like the JELLY situation can erode user trust in DeFi platforms. Hyperliquid’s proactive approach to Hyperliquid compensation is a vital step in rebuilding that trust. Here’s why their response is important for fostering user confidence: * Demonstrates Accountability: By taking responsibility and offering compensation, Hyperliquid shows that it values its users and is accountable for events on its platform, even when caused by external actors. * Sets a Precedent: This action sets a positive precedent for other DeFi platforms facing similar challenges. It signals that user protection should be a top priority. * Encourages Responsible Platform Behavior: Knowing that they may be held responsible for user losses due to market manipulation incentivizes platforms to invest in better security and risk management. * Strengthens DeFi’s Reputation: By addressing issues transparently and fairly, the DeFi sector as a whole can build a stronger reputation for reliability and user-centricity. owever, rebuilding user trust is an ongoing process. Hyperliquid needs to follow through on its compensation promise and provide clear details on the process. Furthermore, continued efforts to enhance security, transparency, and risk management are essential for the entire DeFi space to thrive. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users What can crypto users learn from the JELLY incident and Hyperliquid’s response? * Diversify Your Holdings: Avoid concentrating your portfolio in highly volatile or low-liquidity assets. Diversification can mitigate risk. * Understand Leverage and Risk: If you trade leveraged products, fully understand the risks of liquidation and potential losses. Use leverage responsibly. * Choose Platforms Wisely: Research DeFi platforms thoroughly. Look for platforms with robust security measures, transparent risk management practices, and a track record of user support. * Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments in the crypto space. Understanding market dynamics and platform responses to incidents can help you make informed decisions. * Engage with Communities: Participate in platform communities and discussions. Sharing information and experiences can help identify potential risks and best practices. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users Conclusion: A Critical Moment for Hyperliquid and DeFi The Hyperliquid compensation plan in response to the JELLY incident is a significant development. It showcases a commitment to user protection and a willingness to address the challenges inherent in decentralized finance. While questions about crypto exchange centralization and DeFi risk management remain, Hyperliquid’s decisive action provides a glimmer of hope and a potential roadmap for other platforms facing similar crises. The success of the compensation process and Hyperliquid’s ongoing efforts to enhance security and transparency will be crucial in determining whether this incident ultimately strengthens or weakens user trust in the platform and the broader DeFi ecosystem. This is a critical moment for Hyperliquid and a valuable learning opportunity for the entire crypto space.

BNB Chain introduced a $100 million liquidity fund with the aim to increase decentralized finance capabilities and attract users back through the platform. Investors now focus on Remittix because they consider it to be the contemporary implementation of XRP. Through its $0.0734 pre-sale phase Remittix earned $14.1 million as it pursued remittances as its core business following the goal of cutting down worldwide fees affecting millions of people. This part reveals the growing strength of Solana alongside BNB Chain and Remittix in this time period. Solana’s Price Prediction on Speed and Ecosystem Expansion Solana initiated a rapid cost increase which aggregated to nearly $145 while maintaining a $4 trillion daily transaction volume. Solana has become a magnet for developers building DeFi and NFT projects because of its feature of quick settlements coupled with low fees. Social activity on the network now runs against the initial network problems that caused diminishing support. Rapid increase of Solana: Coingecko The aggregator data suggests users are partially returning to network functions although intermittent performance setbacks remain potential risks according to critics statements. The Solana price prediction depends on a loyal user base if they continue steady performance which will enable them to take some market share back from competing chains. The rally potential of institutional participants remains unclear since their new disclaimers could limit further price increases until DeFi usage expands. The future success of Solana's dominance depends on continuous positive data reports from aggregator sources regarding DeFi transactions. BNB Chain Launches $100M Liquidity Boost The Binance chain's $100 million liquidity program serves to intensify DeFi dApps because stakeholders feared user adoption growth was slowing down. The network has managed success because of low transaction fees and big exchange user counts yet its connection to centralized systems creates potential regulatory issues. Binance demonstrates their commitment to maintain BNB as a top network choice through this new funding initiative despite existing competitor networks recorded in aggregator data . Efficient dApp adoption and stable yield generation through this program could help BNB Chain match the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies. Some investors experience regulatory concerns that threaten their investments because the chain needs to establish clear protocols for this liquidity strategy to sustain a substantial price increase. Why Investors Are Flocking to Remittix, the “New XRP” New XRP nowadays typically references Remittix (RTX) because market participants have shifted their attention from Solana price prediction and BNB coverage. Through its successful presale funds of $14 million at $0.0734 Remittix provides PayFi solutions for the remittance services operating in the $190 trillion market. Remittix connects with DeFi users while drawing both unbanked families and unbanked people and freelancers through its speedy cost-effective swapping system. The initiative diverges from common superficial or failing development methods which neglect real cost-saving solutions. Expert opinions conclude that agent partnerships alongside user-pleasing applications and appropriate licensing must exist for attracting mainstream customers. Remittix financial advantages extend to every demographic group thus luring both institutional investors along with regular holders to the platform. In order to protect new crypto tokens from rug pulls a three-year liquidity lock combined with renounced post-presale contracts should be applied. Analysis indicates that the future success of Remittix depends on maintaining evidence of rising user interest from aggregator sources because experts believe the coin demonstrates better promise through fast problem-solving aimed at real user needs. Those intrigued can review the presale at Remittix and track official updates at Linktree . Practical Solutions vs. Legacy Networks: The Battle for Relevance Solana’s rocket-like price prediction and BNB Chain’s $100 million liquidity program emphasize altcoins striving for user growth and DeFi relevance.The market considers Remittix to be a fresh variant of XRP because its simple solution for daily financial transfer meets the requirements of international customers who currently face expensive wire transfer charges. The three methods provide separate benefits with Solana enhancing dApp operation while BNB allocates funds for DeFi liquidity growth and Remittix delivers direct payment reductions for wires. The market demonstrates its categorical preference for utility-driven coins combined with steady user attraction yet no project bears an absolute guarantee of success. Real financial integration could make Remittix surpass older cross-border solutions because of the failing hype-based ventures. The success of Remittix in local currency solutions could establish ""New XRP"" status which sets the platform for future bull runs in 2025.

The remaining 6.4% said they weren’t sure, the report stated. Percentage of trust that Argentines have in Milei after the Libra scandal. Source: Zuban Córdoba This was the first time the question was asked within a Zuban Córdoba poll. However, several other metrics, such as Milei’s image and the national management approval rating, have plummeted considerably in recent months. The latter of those metrics, for example, fell from 47.3% in November to 41.6% in March. “Fifty-eight percent disapprove of Javier Milei’s management. Negativity increases slowly but steadily and seems to find no ceiling,” Zuban Córdoba said. “The change in tone and evaluation of the government is consolidating as more and more problematic fronts appear on the political agenda.” Zuban Córdoba conducted its study between March 12 and March 14, and the sample size of 1,600 participants had a confidence level of 95% and a sampling error of 2.45%. Another survey from the University of San Andrés conducted between March 11-20 with 1,020 respondents found that Milei’s approval rating dropped to 45%. However, not all polls paint the same picture of President Milei. Data collected from Morning Consult between Feb. 27 and March 5 indicates that Milei still possessed a 62.4% approval rating after the Libra scandal. Related: LIBRA memecoin orchestrators named as defendants in US class-action suit Milei has distanced himself from Libra since the scandal, arguing he didn’t “promote” the LIBRA token in a controversial Feb. 14 X post — as fraud lawsuits filed against him allege — and instead merely “spread the word” about it. The Libra (LIBRA) token soared to a $4.6 billion market cap shortly after Milei’s X post before tanking nearly 94% over the next few hours. Argentina’s opposition party called for Milei’s impeachment but has had limited success thus far. President Milei’s party still in lead as election looms The controversy comes as the next Argentine election is set to take place on Oct. 26. Despite the negative results, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party is still most likely to take out the next Argentine election, with 36.7% in favor of the libertarian party, while Unión por la Patria comes in next at 32.5%. However, only 43% of Argentine respondents believe that Milei — an economist prior to taking office — has sufficiently controlled inflation, while 63% of those polled oppose Milei’s efforts to secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund.

XRP, currently priced at $2.39, is set for a 300% rally to $7.17, driven by increasing adoption in cross-border payments. Cardano (ADA), now at $0.71. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding strong bullish momentum, positioning itself as top performers for explosive growth in the coming months. The project is in phase 3 of its presale priced at $0.02. Over 80% of the presale has been sold out meaning it won’t stay long before it concludes. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $4.9 million with over 6900 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 4, the price will jump 25% to $0.025. MUTM could be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. Ripple and Cardano: Strong Performers for 2025’s Bull Run The price of Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) is set to jump substantially by 2025 because growing organizations worldwide are adopting their systems as well as broadening their ecosystems. XRP is expected to climb 300% to achieve a value of $7.17 in the next few years because its capabilities in international transactions will drive its growing influence in financial services. Continued network upgrades and expanding DeFi applications drive Cardano (ADA) toward a 5x price jump from its current value of $0.71 until it reaches $4. These undertakings host solid base fundamentals that lead to practical use cases because they create strong investment options for the long term. The crypto market watches Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as analysts expect explosive growth due to its rising market presence alongside two other dominant altcoins. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A Secure and Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance establishes its security foundation through the launch of an entirely collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization requirement in this model eliminates volatility risks that break algorithmic stablecoins due to their instability. The platform establishes investor confidence by employing multiple auditing activities on smart contracts together with financially transparent systems to repair DeFi lending platform vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance emphasizes sustainability and security thus establishing itself as an excellent option for investors making long-term decisions. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives The initial supporters of Mutuum Finance can benefit from multiple enticing rewards which offer both generous giveaways of $100,000 awarded through $10,000 MUTM token distributions to ten winners alongside a referral program that rewards its users for new investor acquisitions. The referral system of Mutuum Finance motivates users to recruit new investors while providing rewards to these referrals. Users who join early receive privileged access to future staking pools and they obtain governance privileges while receiving first access to platform upgrade updates. The incentives provided by Mutuum Finance motivate users to join initially while developing better long-term retention of token holders. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as a DeFi leader, with $4.8 million raised and 6,600+ investors onboard. Its hybrid lending model and strong fundamentals set it up for explosive growth. With a 200% return potential, the presale is selling out fast. Don’t miss out join now before prices rise.

According to crypto analyst (basictradingtv), the meme coin is playing out a trend of rounding bottom patterns and parabolic rallies, which have always sent its price to all-time highs. The current setup suggests that Dogecoin’s ongoing recovery from its March low may not just be a temporary bounce, but there’s a 100% chance it is the beginning of a much larger parabolic rally. Dogecoin Trading In A Familiar Cycle: 100% Chance Of Rally At the core of the bullish forecast is the recurrence of a well-known price pattern, the rounding bottom. Dogecoin is known for trading in multi-year cycles that start with a gradual bottoming formation, eventually leading to explosive rallies. This pattern, visible on longer-term charts, has formed again over the past several months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Activity Levels Crash To 4-Month Lows, Does This Spell Doom For The Meme Coin? As shown in the monthly candlestick timeframe chart below, the rounding bottom played out during the time period between Dogecoin’s all-time high in 2021, the bear market in 2022, and the recovery phase in late 2024. The recovery led to Dogecoin pushing to new highs since 2021, which was probably the start of the parabolic rally phase. However, this time around, the anticipated parabolic rally was temporarily interrupted by a strong resistance zone. After reaching highs around $0.48 in December 2024, Dogecoin saw a rejection that has seen its price going on a correction path until it reached $0.1477 in early March. But rather than breaking below, this level acted as a solid support. Since then, the price rebounded slightly and has recovered to $0.2 at the time of writing. With this in mind, the analyst predicted that the bullish cycle is intact, with the parabolic leg of the pattern expected to unfold anytime soon. Monthly Candle Needs To Close Above Support Right now, the most important step is for Dogecoin to close its monthly candlestick for March above the key support level established during the recent market correction. If this is successful, it will certify 100% that a bullish parabolic rally will follow. The analyst also pointed out two important levels for Dogecoin in the coming weeks and months: $0.15 and $0.5. The $0.15 level was tested during Dogecoin’s sharp pullback earlier this month, when the price dipped to as low as $0.1477. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters Order Block Zone That Could Trigger Rally To ATHs $0.15 now acts as the support level that should not be broken. The longer Dogecoin tests this support level, the longer the delay for the parabolic rally. Fortunately, the recovery from that zone has added technical strength to the argument that buyers are going to step in at that level. Meanwhile, $0.5 is identified as the primary resistance target ahead. Breaking through that resistance will confirm the start of a full-fledged parabolic rally, similar to the one that sent Dogecoin to its all-time high in 2021. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2052, up by 10.8% in the past 24 hours.

BTC Bull Token and Best Wallet Token have both managed to capture attention with their unique approaches. BTC Bull Token offers rewards based on Bitcoin milestones, while Best Wallet Token integrates practical utility within a multi-asset management platform. Yet, it’s Dragoin that truly stands out by blending gaming and crypto in a way that feels natural and rewarding. With its Telegram mini-game, Dragoin doesn’t just promise returns—it lets players earn tokens through immersive gameplay. BTC Bull Token: Riding the Bitcoin Wave BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) launched in early 2025, aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s success. Notably, the token’s primary attraction is its innovative mechanism: holders receive Bitcoin airdrops when BTC reaches specific price milestones, with the first reward set at $150,000. Consequently, this unique approach attracted significant investor interest, raising over $4 million during its presale phase. Starting at a presale price of $0.002425, BTCBULL has experienced impressive growth as Bitcoin recently surged to $87,000. Furthermore, token burns at various price points also reduce the supply, creating potential for increased value. As a result, the community-driven nature and the excitement around Bitcoin’s future prospects have fueled the token’s popularity. Therefore, early investors have already seen their holdings appreciate significantly, with projections indicating further gains as Bitcoin climbs higher. Best Wallet Token: Empowering Crypto Management Best Wallet Token ($BEST) launched in 2023 as the native utility token for the Best Wallet ecosystem, which facilitates seamless management of digital assets across multiple blockchains. Notably, with features like reduced transaction fees, staking rewards, and early access to token presales, $BEST quickly became popular, attracting over 250,000 active users. Moreover, the presale raised more than $11.3 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Initially priced at $0.0225, $BEST has appreciated to $0.02445 as of March 26, 2025, marking an 8.67% increase. Additionally, the token’s success is driven by its integration within the Best Wallet app, which supports thousands of cryptocurrencies, making it one of the most versatile wallets available. Dragoin’s Telegram Mini-Game Pays Investors to Play Dragoin’s Telegram mini-game is more than just entertainment—it’s an opportunity to boost your token holdings while having fun. Specifically designed with both casual and dedicated gamers in mind, the game combines excitement with real rewards, making it a favorite among Dragoin investors. As players control their own dragon, they take on challenges and missions that keep them engaged while earning $DDGN tokens as they progress. Whether you’re aiming to build a strong token reserve or simply enjoy gaming, the mini-game offers a perfect blend of strategy and enjoyment. From the moment Dragoin hit the scene, it promised more than just another meme coin—it aimed to build a community that’s both engaged and rewarded. In fact, the mini-game is at the heart of that vision. Notably, what sets it apart is its instant reward system. Unlike typical investments, where returns take time, players can start multiplying their tokens right after joining. Consequently, as Dragoin’s value continues to grow, these earned tokens become even more valuable, giving early adopters an edge. For presale buyers, the game is an especially enticing feature. Instead of just holding onto tokens and waiting for market movements, players can actively increase their holdings by participating in this interactive experience. Furthermore, the sense of accomplishment that comes with earning tokens through skillful gameplay makes the process not only rewarding but genuinely enjoyable. Ultimately, Dragoin has made it clear—being part of its community means more than just holding coins. It means playing, earning, and thriving together. Play, Earn, and Thrive: The Future of Crypto Engagement Crypto investors are no longer content with passive holding—they want interactive experiences and tangible rewards. BTC Bull Token brings a strategic approach with its Bitcoin milestone airdrops, while Best Wallet Token enhances asset management with practical features. However, Dragoin takes things to the next level by turning token earning into a gamified adventure. Its Telegram mini-game allows users to grow their holdings while actively enjoying a fantasy-inspired experience. This engaging approach makes Dragoin more than just a meme coin—it’s a dynamic community space where gameplay meets real financial opportunity.

You’re not alone. Deepfakes are no longer just a futuristic worry; they’re a present danger, costing companies millions and posing serious national security risks. But there’s a beacon of hope in the fight against this emerging threat: GetReal. This startup, armed with $18 million in funding and a client list that speaks volumes, claims to have cracked the code on AI deepfakes . Let’s dive into how GetReal is revolutionizing deepfake detection and safeguarding our digital world. Funding Fuels the Fight Against AI Deepfakes GetReal, co-founded by Dr. Hany Farid, a pioneer in deepfake detection technology, has successfully raised $17.5 million in Series A equity funding. This significant investment, led by Forgepoint Capital, with participation from Ballistic Ventures, Evolution Equity, and K2 Access Fund, will propel GetReal’s research and development, expand its team, and accelerate business development. This financial backing underscores the urgency and importance of addressing the growing threat of AI deepfakes . The funding coincides with the launch of GetReal’s groundbreaking forensics platform as a service. This platform offers: Web Interface: User-friendly access to deepfake analysis tools. API: Seamless integration for automated media analysis. Media Analysis-as-a-Service: Scalable solution for various organizational needs. Key features of GetReal’s platform include: Threat Exposure Dashboard: Provides a comprehensive overview of potential deepfake risks. “Inspect” Tool: Specifically designed to protect high-profile executives from impersonation attacks. “Protect” Tool: Screens media content to proactively identify and block deepfakes. “Respond” Service: Offers in-depth analysis by GetReal’s expert human teams for complex cases. The Brains Behind the Breakthrough in Deepfake Detection GetReal’s origins are deeply rooted in expertise. Incubated at Ballistic Ventures since 2022, the startup emerged from stealth mode in June 2024. Ballistic’s founder, Ted Schlein, also serves as GetReal’s chairman and co-founder, highlighting the venture capital firm’s strong belief in GetReal’s mission. Adding to this powerhouse team is CEO Matt Moynahan, a seasoned cybersecurity veteran with decades of experience leading companies like Symantec and Forcepoint. He emphasizes the critical gap GetReal is filling in the cyber forensics landscape, stating, “If you think cybersecurity has a shortage of people, get ready for forensics.” However, the true linchpin is co-founder Dr. Hany Farid. A renowned academic from UC Berkeley, Farid has spent years pioneering techniques for identifying manipulated digital images, long before AI deepfakes became a mainstream concern. Moynahan aptly describes GetReal’s core offering as “Hany as a service,” explaining how they’ve transformed Farid’s deep expertise into a scalable, cloud-based platform. Farid himself notes the fascinating blend of cutting-edge technology and timeless principles in their approach: “There are techniques we developed 20 years ago that still work today,” showcasing the enduring foundation of their deepfake detection methods. Strategic Backing and Real-World Validation for AI Forensics The Series A funding round isn’t just about the amount raised; it’s about the strategic investors involved. Cisco Investments, Capital One Ventures, and In-Q-Tel (linked to the CIA) are among the backers, signaling strong industry and government interest in GetReal’s AI forensics capabilities. Alberto Yépez of Forgepoint Capital points out that regulated industries, particularly financial institutions, are proactively seeking solutions like GetReal’s due to board-level concerns about deepfake impersonations, especially after instances of CEO voice impersonations. Notable clients like John Deere and Visa further validate the platform’s real-world effectiveness. While GetReal’s current focus is on audio, video, and image deepfake detection , the recent incident involving The Atlantic’s editor being mistakenly added to a Signal group chat planning a military attack highlights the emerging threat of text-based impersonations. Farid acknowledges that text is a “different beast” but confirms that expanding to address all forms of deepfake and impersonation threats is a long-term goal. Is GetReal the Ultimate Weapon Against AI Deepfakes? GetReal’s emergence with significant funding, a stellar team, and an impressive client roster strongly suggests they are a leading contender in the fight against AI deepfakes . Their platform, built on decades of expertise and cutting-edge technology, offers a comprehensive suite of tools for detection and response. However, the battle against deepfakes is constantly evolving. Here’s a quick look at the landscape: Pros of GetReal Challenges for Deepfake Detection Expert-led technology with proven methods. Deepfake technology is rapidly advancing. Strong funding and strategic partnerships. Detecting text-based deepfakes is a new frontier. Comprehensive platform with various tools and services. The ‘fun’ deepfake apps contribute to the problem. Addresses a critical gap in cyber forensics talent. Phishing tactics are becoming more sophisticated. While GetReal appears to have made significant strides in deepfake detection , the ongoing arms race between deepfake creators and detection technology means continuous innovation and adaptation are crucial. The $18 million investment and the caliber of clients and investors signal a powerful vote of confidence in GetReal’s approach. Whether they have definitively “cracked the code” remains to be seen, but they are undoubtedly a formidable force in safeguarding the digital realm from the insidious threat of AI deepfakes .

Here is the summary of the detailed interview and the most important points to know. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) explained that the company chose Abu Dhabi as its home base due to its regulatory environment and strategic location rather than its financing needs. According to CZ, the UAE’s compliance framework provides Binance with a stable foundation for global expansion. CZ acknowledged that the memecoin ecosystem is growing, attributing the rise to community-driven imagination. However, he warned that memecoins carry high risks, indicating a need for user education and clear risk warnings. Referring to US President Donald Trump’s memecoin launch, CZ explained that most celebrity coins are launched by third parties for publicity purposes, and urged public figures to focus on long-term, value-driven projects instead. Binance aims to maintain a balanced market where institutional investors do not disproportionately benefit individual users. CZ stated that the exchange should not act as a gatekeeper, but instead promote transparency. He encouraged projects to disclose their token locking mechanisms and leverage third-party smart contracts to increase trust. Looking forward, CZ expressed optimism about the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) as the future of the industry. Related News: According to Onchain Data, the Founder of this Altcoin Starts Selling Again CZ assessed the industry’s transition from requiring a private blockchain for token issuance to the widespread adoption of the ERC-20 standard. He believes that despite the lowering of technical barriers, community consensus remains the primary driver of value. He urged the crypto space to move beyond financial speculation and explore real-world applications such as government authentication and decentralized science (DeSci). While CZ admitted to missing out on an early Ethereum investment, he acknowledged ETH’s fundamental role in DeFi. However, he noted that Ethereum’s real problem lies not in its technology, but in its lack of innovation at the application layer. CZ, who recently evaluated the legal troubles he has experienced, shared that his four-month prison sentence has reshaped his perspective on life. Underlining the importance of family and health, CZ stated that he lost six kilos during his time in prison but is physically healthier. He noted that the biggest challenge is coping with the uncertainty of the situation. CZ introduced Giggle Academy, an educational initiative that aims to address global learning inequalities through gamified experiences. The project aims to equip users with job-related skills, such as AI data annotation, to improve employment opportunities around the world. *This is not investment advice.

Investors actively looking for the best crypto to buy for 2025 want projects with innovative features and utility which serve practical purposes. There is a new Defi payment token that has begun to divert investor attention from XRP price predictions as it presents solutions for important problems for both businesses and individuals throughout the global remittance framework. The crypto market shows an increasing need for effective solutions to manage cross-border payments. XRP maintains its financial institution partnerships but faces slower market acceptance which enables emerging projects to find new grounds for innovation.

This unexpected shoutout, highlighted by Chainlink’s Communications Director Chris Barrett on X (formerly Twitter), has sparked considerable interest and speculation within the crypto community. Let’s dive into why this mention is noteworthy and what it could signify for the future of Chainlink and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Why is the World Liberty Financial and Chainlink Mention at the DC Blockchain Summit Significant? The DC Blockchain Summit is a prominent event that brings together policymakers, industry leaders, and innovators in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. It serves as a platform for discussions, announcements, and networking, shaping the regulatory and developmental trajectory of the industry. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Zach Witkoff, choosing this stage to recognize Chainlink is significant for several reasons: Legitimacy and Mainstream Attention: World Liberty Financial’s association with the Trump family brings a level of mainstream attention and political relevance to the DeFi space. Their public acknowledgment of Chainlink at such a summit can be interpreted as a nod towards the growing acceptance and importance of decentralized technologies within traditional financial and political circles. Validation for Chainlink: For Chainlink, a project focused on providing secure and reliable data to smart contracts, this shoutout serves as further validation of its crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem. It highlights Chainlink’s growing recognition beyond the core crypto community and into more traditional finance adjacent sectors. Potential for Collaboration: While just a ‘shoutout’ for now, this public acknowledgment could hint at potential future collaborations or integrations between World Liberty Financial and Chainlink. For a DeFi project like World Liberty Financial, leveraging Chainlink’s oracle services could be instrumental in enhancing the security, reliability, and functionality of their platform. Broader DeFi Implications: This event underscores the increasing maturity and interconnectedness of the DeFi space. It signals a move towards greater collaboration and recognition between different projects, potentially fostering a more robust and integrated decentralized financial ecosystem. Chris Barrett’s X post, further amplified by Zach Witkoff’s repost, quickly circulated within the crypto community, igniting discussions on social media platforms and crypto forums. The brevity of the initial communication leaves room for interpretation and fuels speculation about the nature of this acknowledgment. What is Chainlink and Why Does it Matter in DeFi? Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that plays a pivotal role in the functionality and security of smart contracts, particularly within the DeFi space. In simple terms, oracles are bridges that connect blockchains to the real world, enabling smart contracts to access external data, APIs, and payment systems. Here’s why Chainlink is crucial: Bridging the Data Gap: Blockchains, by design, are isolated environments. Smart contracts operating on blockchains cannot inherently access data from the outside world. Chainlink solves this by providing a secure and reliable way for smart contracts to receive external data feeds. Ensuring Data Integrity and Security: Chainlink’s decentralized nature is key. Instead of relying on a single point of failure, Chainlink uses a network of independent node operators to source and verify data. This decentralized approach enhances the security and reliability of the data provided to smart contracts, mitigating risks like data manipulation or single points of failure. Enabling Complex Smart Contracts: Many sophisticated DeFi applications rely heavily on real-world data. Price feeds for decentralized exchanges, weather data for insurance contracts, and random number generation for gaming platforms are just a few examples. Chainlink empowers the creation of these complex and data-driven smart contracts, expanding the possibilities of DeFi. Variety of Services: Beyond price feeds, Chainlink offers a suite of decentralized services, including Proof of Reserve (PoR) to verify the collateralization of assets, Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for provably fair randomness, and Keepers for automating smart contract functions. In essence, Chainlink is the infrastructure that enables smart contracts to interact with the real world in a secure and trustworthy manner, making it an indispensable component of the growing DeFi ecosystem. Its importance is reflected in its widespread adoption across numerous DeFi protocols and its recognition by projects like World Liberty Financial. World Liberty Financial: Trump Family’s Foray into DeFi? World Liberty Financial has garnered attention primarily due to its co-founder, Zach Witkoff, and its reported connection to the Trump family. While details about the project are still emerging, its association with such a prominent political family immediately places it under a spotlight. Here’s what we know and what it implies: Trump Family Ties: Reports suggest that World Liberty Financial is linked to the Trump family, although the exact nature and extent of this connection are not fully transparent. This association inevitably brings a certain level of political and public interest to the project. DeFi Ambitions: World Liberty Financial is positioned as a DeFi project, indicating its aim to operate within the decentralized finance space. This likely involves leveraging blockchain technology to offer financial services in a decentralized and potentially more accessible manner. Limited Public Information: As of now, detailed information about World Liberty Financial’s specific products, services, and roadmap is relatively scarce. Their website and public communications are still developing, leaving many aspects of their project shrouded in some mystery. Speculation and Scrutiny: Given the Trump family connection and the nascent stage of the project, World Liberty Financial is subject to both significant speculation and scrutiny. The crypto community and the broader public are keenly watching to see how this project evolves and what impact it might have. The involvement of individuals connected to prominent political figures in the DeFi space is a developing trend. It could signal a bridging of traditional political and financial spheres with the decentralized world of crypto. However, it also raises questions about regulatory implications, transparency, and the potential for political influence within the ostensibly decentralized realm of DeFi. What Does This Mean for the Future of Chainlink and DeFi? The Chainlink shoutout from World Liberty Financial at the DC Blockchain Summit, while seemingly a minor event, could have broader implications for both Chainlink and the DeFi sector as a whole. Here are some potential takeaways: Increased Institutional Interest in Chainlink: Recognition from a project with political connections like World Liberty Financial might attract further attention from institutional investors and traditional financial entities towards Chainlink. This could lead to increased adoption of Chainlink’s services in more mainstream financial applications. Growing Convergence of Traditional Finance and DeFi: This event may be another indicator of the increasing convergence between traditional finance and decentralized finance. As projects like World Liberty Financial, with links to established political and financial networks, enter the DeFi space, it could accelerate the integration of these two worlds. Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased mainstream and political attention on DeFi, partly driven by projects like World Liberty Financial, could also lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Policymakers may become more focused on understanding and regulating the DeFi space as it gains prominence in traditional circles. Potential for Mass Adoption of DeFi: Ultimately, events like these, which bring DeFi into the broader public consciousness, can contribute to the gradual mass adoption of decentralized finance. As more people become aware of and potentially interact with DeFi through projects with familiar connections, the path to wider adoption could be paved. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial’s public acknowledgment of Chainlink at the DC Blockchain Summit is more than just a casual mention. It’s a noteworthy event that highlights the evolving landscape of DeFi, the increasing recognition of Chainlink’s vital role, and the potential for greater convergence between the crypto world and traditional finance. As the DeFi space continues to mature and attract attention from diverse sectors, such seemingly small events can serve as significant markers of broader industry trends and future directions.

42454093,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143597,1743038417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Suspicious Funds Unveiled: OKX & Binance Wallets Linked to Hyperliquid JELLY Attack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/okx-binance-hyperliquid-jelly-attack/,"The crypto sphere is buzzing with the latest developments in the Hyperliquid JELLY attack saga. On-chain data has unveiled a potentially significant piece of the puzzle: the funds utilized to orchestrate the JELLY short position attack on Hyperliquid originated from prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, OKX and Binance. This revelation, initially reported by LookOnChain via X (formerly Twitter), throws a new light on the incident and prompts crucial questions about exchange security and the flow of funds in decentralized finance (DeFi). What We Know About the Hyperliquid JELLY Attack and Fund Withdrawal For those unfamiliar, the Hyperliquid JELLY attack involved exploiting vulnerabilities in the platform to open substantial short positions in JELLY, a relatively new cryptocurrency. This maneuver reportedly caused price fluctuations and raised concerns within the Hyperliquid community. Now, LookOnChain’s findings suggest that the capital fueling this attack was traced back to withdrawals from two of the largest centralized exchanges in the world: OKX and Binance. Here’s a breakdown of the key details: On-chain Investigation: LookOnChain, a reputable blockchain analytics firm, conducted an investigation into the flow of funds related to the Hyperliquid JELLY attack. Exchange Identification: Their analysis pointed towards OKX and Binance as the source of the funds used to execute the attack. Withdrawal Confirmation: Data indicates that the attacker withdrew cryptocurrency from these exchanges prior to initiating the JELLY short positions on Hyperliquid. Rumor Debunking: The news indirectly addresses earlier rumors suggesting Binance’s direct involvement as the orchestrator of the JELLY incident. While funds were withdrawn from Binance, this doesn’t automatically imply Binance’s complicity, but rather highlights the exchange as a platform used for fund movement. To visualize the flow, consider this simplified representation: Why is the Origin of Funds in the Hyperliquid JELLY Attack Important for Crypto Security? Understanding where the attack funds originated is critical for several reasons, particularly concerning crypto security and the overall integrity of the digital asset ecosystem: Exchange Security Protocols: The fact that funds could be withdrawn from major exchanges like OKX and Binance and then used for a market manipulation attack raises questions about Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. Were there any red flags missed? Can exchange security measures be further strengthened to prevent such incidents? Traceability of Funds: This incident underscores the importance of blockchain analytics in tracing illicit activities. The ability to follow the flow of funds on the blockchain is a crucial tool for investigations and for deterring malicious actors. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Vulnerabilities: While the funds originated from centralized exchanges, the attack targeted a DeFi platform, Hyperliquid. This highlights the interconnectedness of CeFi and DeFi and the potential for vulnerabilities in one area to impact the other. Crypto security needs to be robust across both centralized and decentralized platforms. Market Manipulation Concerns: The JELLY attack is a stark reminder of the risks of market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space, especially for newer and less liquid tokens. Understanding the source of funds helps in analyzing the motives and scale of such attacks. Binance and OKX Under Scrutiny: What Does This Mean for Exchange Reputation? While the report doesn’t directly implicate Binance or OKX in orchestrating the attack, the revelation that attacker funds were withdrawn from these platforms inevitably puts them under scrutiny. Does this tarnish their reputation? Not necessarily, but it does raise pertinent questions: Enhanced Monitoring: Will Binance and OKX enhance their transaction monitoring systems to detect and prevent suspicious withdrawal patterns that could precede market manipulation attempts? User Accountability: Should exchanges implement stricter measures to ensure user accountability and deter the use of their platforms for illicit activities, even if indirectly? Transparency and Cooperation: Will these exchanges cooperate with investigations into the Hyperliquid JELLY attack and share information to help identify the perpetrators? Transparency in such situations is crucial for maintaining user trust and demonstrating a commitment to crypto security . Fund Withdrawal and the Future of Crypto Investigations The fund withdrawal from OKX and Binance, as revealed by on-chain analysis, sets a precedent for future cryptocurrency investigations. It demonstrates the power of blockchain forensics in uncovering the origins of illicit funds and tracking their movement. This capability is increasingly vital as the crypto space matures and faces more sophisticated forms of attacks and financial crimes. Here are some potential implications for the future: Increased Reliance on On-Chain Analytics: Expect to see a greater reliance on on-chain analytics tools and firms like LookOnChain to investigate crypto-related incidents and provide crucial insights into fund flows. Collaboration Between Exchanges and Analytics Firms: Closer collaboration between cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain analytics firms could become more common to proactively identify and mitigate risks related to money laundering and market manipulation. Regulatory Scrutiny: Incidents like the Hyperliquid JELLY attack, and the subsequent tracing of funds to major exchanges, might attract further regulatory scrutiny on exchanges and their security measures. Advancements in Crypto Security Technology: The need for more advanced crypto security technologies, both for exchanges and DeFi platforms, will become even more pressing to stay ahead of evolving attack vectors. Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Users Learn? This incident offers valuable lessons for crypto users and the wider industry: Diversification of Exchange Usage: Consider diversifying your cryptocurrency holdings across multiple reputable exchanges to mitigate risks associated with any single platform. Stay Informed About Crypto Security Practices: Keep yourself updated on the latest crypto security best practices, including secure wallet management and being cautious of new and unaudited DeFi platforms. Support On-Chain Transparency: Advocate for greater transparency and on-chain data availability within the crypto ecosystem, as it is crucial for accountability and security. Exercise Caution with New Tokens: Be particularly cautious when trading newly launched or low-liquidity tokens, as they can be more susceptible to market manipulation. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The revelation that funds used in the Hyperliquid JELLY attack were withdrawn from OKX and Binance serves as a potent reminder of the ongoing challenges in crypto security . While it doesn’t confirm any wrongdoing by these exchanges, it underscores the need for continuous vigilance, enhanced security protocols, and greater transparency across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The ability to trace funds is a powerful tool, but proactive measures and industry-wide collaboration are essential to prevent future incidents and foster a safer environment for all participants.

This streamlines the advertising process and potentially opens up new avenues for businesses and creators to reach their target audiences within Telegram. Exclusive Withdrawal Method for Creators and Developers: For those building bots, creating content, or developing within the Telegram ecosystem, TON serves as the primary method for withdrawing earnings. This is a game-changer, offering a potentially faster and more efficient way to access revenue compared to traditional banking systems, especially for a global user base. Trading Telegram Assets via TON-based NFTs: Ever wanted to own a unique Telegram username? Or perhaps send a digital gift that truly stands out? TON underpins the trading of Telegram assets like usernames and digital gifts through NFTs . This introduces a new layer of digital ownership and scarcity within Telegram, leveraging the booming NFT space. Backbone for Telegram Mini Apps: Those engaging and interactive Telegram Mini Apps , used by hundreds of millions, are built entirely on TON. This signifies a massive scale of operation and trust in TON’s infrastructure to support a significant portion of Telegram’s user activity. Decoding the Technology: Why TON Blockchain is Telegram’s Choice Durov didn’t just randomly pick a blockchain. He specifically emphasized TON’s scalability as a crucial factor. In a world where blockchain networks often struggle with transaction speeds and high fees, TON stands out. But what makes the TON blockchain so special, and why is it the ideal fit for Telegram’s ambitious plans? Sharding for Scalability: TON utilizes a technique called sharding. Imagine dividing a massive database into smaller, more manageable parts. Sharding does something similar for the blockchain, allowing it to process transactions in parallel across multiple shards (sub-blockchains). This dramatically increases throughput and allows TON to handle a significantly larger volume of transactions compared to blockchains without sharding. Designed for Billions of Transactions: Durov explicitly mentioned TON’s potential to support billions of transactions. This isn’t just marketing hype; it’s a testament to TON’s architecture, which is built from the ground up to handle massive scale, aligning perfectly with Telegram’s ever-growing user base and transaction demands. Real Fundamental Value: In a crypto landscape often filled with projects lacking tangible utility, Durov boldly stated that TON is “one of the few blockchains with real fundamental value.” This endorsement from a tech leader like Durov carries significant weight and suggests that TON isn’t just about speculation; it’s about providing real-world utility and infrastructure. The choice of TON underscores Telegram’s commitment to building a robust and scalable in-app economy that can accommodate its massive global user base. It’s not just about adding crypto features; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how transactions and interactions happen within the platform. Pavel Durov’s Vision: A Decentralized Future for Telegram? Pavel Durov ‘s endorsement of TON goes beyond just technological integration; it hints at a broader vision for Telegram’s future. By embracing blockchain technology and decentralization, Telegram could be positioning itself as a leader in the next evolution of social platforms. What could this vision entail? Empowering Creators and Users: By using TON for payments and withdrawals, Telegram potentially empowers creators and users with more control over their earnings and digital assets. Decentralized systems can often reduce reliance on intermediaries and potentially lower fees, benefiting both creators and users. Building a Web3 Ecosystem within Telegram: The integration of NFTs and Mini Apps on TON suggests Telegram is building a mini-Web3 ecosystem within its platform. This could attract developers and entrepreneurs looking to leverage Telegram’s massive user base to build decentralized applications and services. Future Decentralization of Telegram Infrastructure? While not explicitly stated, the deep integration with TON raises questions about the potential for further decentralization of Telegram’s infrastructure in the future. Could we see aspects of Telegram itself, beyond just the in-app economy, becoming more decentralized and community-driven? Durov’s statements suggest a long-term commitment to TON and a belief in the power of blockchain to enhance Telegram’s ecosystem. This could mark a turning point, not just for Telegram, but for how social platforms integrate with cryptocurrency technologies. Streamlining Transactions: Telegram Crypto Payments Powered by TON One of the most immediate and impactful applications of TON is in Telegram crypto payments . The shift to TON for Telegram Ads payments and creator withdrawals is more than just a technical upgrade; it represents a fundamental shift in how value is exchanged within the Telegram ecosystem. Let’s explore the benefits and implications: Feature Traditional Systems TON-Powered Telegram Payments Payment Method for Telegram Ads Credit Cards, Bank Transfers, etc. TON Withdrawal Method for Creators Bank Transfers, Payment Processors TON Transaction Speed Varies, can be slow Potentially Faster Transaction Fees Can be higher Potentially Lower Accessibility May have geographical limitations Potentially more globally accessible By embracing TON for crypto payments, Telegram is potentially offering a more efficient, cost-effective, and globally accessible payment infrastructure. This is particularly beneficial for creators and businesses operating in regions with limited access to traditional financial systems. Scaling for the Future: Can TON Scalability Handle Telegram’s Growth? The question on everyone’s mind is: Can TON scalability truly handle the demands of Telegram’s massive and ever-growing user base? Durov’s confidence is reassuring, but let’s delve deeper into the technical aspects of TON’s scalability and its potential limitations: Theoretical Limits of Sharding: While sharding significantly enhances scalability, it’s not a silver bullet. There are theoretical limits to how much a blockchain can scale, even with sharding. However, TON’s architecture is designed to push these limits further than many other blockchains. Real-World Performance Under Load: The true test of scalability is real-world performance under heavy load. As Telegram’s in-app economy grows and transaction volumes increase, TON’s network will be continuously tested. Ongoing monitoring and optimization will be crucial to ensure smooth performance. Future Upgrades and Developments: Blockchain technology is constantly evolving. TON, like other blockchains, will likely undergo continuous upgrades and improvements to further enhance its scalability and performance over time. Staying adaptable and innovative is key to maintaining long-term scalability. While challenges may arise, TON’s sharding architecture and focus on scalability position it well to handle Telegram’s future growth. The integration is a bold bet on the future of blockchain technology and its ability to support mainstream applications at scale. Conclusion: Telegram and TON – A Powerful Partnership for the Future Pavel Durov’s announcement is a clear signal: TON is not just a side project; it’s the engine driving Telegram’s in-app economy and potentially shaping its future trajectory. From revolutionizing Telegram crypto payments to powering Telegram in-app economy , TON’s scalability and utility are being put to the test on a massive scale. Pavel Durov ‘s vision of a decentralized and efficient platform is taking shape, leveraging the power of the TON blockchain . This partnership is one to watch closely, as it could set a new precedent for how social platforms integrate with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, unlocking a world of possibilities for users, creators, and the entire crypto ecosystem.

While investors are still scratching their heads over Slerf’s accidental $10 million burn and Goatseus Maximus’ AI-fueled rise, another project is silently stacking massive gains for its community— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . In a market where volatility is the norm and headlines move prices, BTFD Coin has raised over $6.41 million, sold more than 72 billion tokens, and is serving up a limited-time 100% bonus for anyone brave enough to buy the dip. The presale is sitting at Stage 15 out of 16, and with the price currently at $0.0002, it’s only going up from here. LAUNCH100 is the code everyone’s using to double their BTFD coins—but heads up, this wild bonus ends March 30. Let’s dig into why BTFD’s presale may be the best play in town right now, while Slerf and GOAT deliver their own (kinda bizarre) headlines among the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Built for Bulls, Ready to Charge Imagine getting in on a meme coin that’s not just vibes and volatility, but backed by utility, rewards, and one of the most relatable mottos in all of crypto: Buy The Dip . That’s BTFD Coin for you. But this isn’t just some internet meme dressed up as the top new meme coin to join today. It’s a community-powered ecosystem with staking, a P2E game that’s already live, and the heart of it all—the Bulls Squad. Let’s talk about this squad. Baby Bull leads with memes and momentum. Raging Bull fuels the visuals. Nerdy Bull’s building the tech, and People’s Bull? He’s out here making sure every new buyer feels like they’re in on something real. This isn’t some random Telegram group—this is a movement of 11,600+ holders, all chasing opportunity instead of fearing dips. And that P2E game? It’s not just hype—it’s live and paying out. Users can now jump into the BTFD Bull Run Game, climb levels, invite friends, and earn real BTFD tokens while playing. Combine that with staking that’s delivering a solid 90% APY, and you’ve got a token that pays you for holding and playing. Literally. Then there’s the presale. Stage 15 is where things are cooking. The current price is $0.0002, but once it hits $0.0006 at launch, that’s a 200% ROI just from getting in now. Let’s put that in perspective. Drop $1000 today at $0.0002, and you’ll get 5 million tokens. Use the LAUNCH100 bonus code , and that turns into 10 million tokens instantly. Once BTFD hits $0.0006, those 10 million coins? They’re worth $6000. Oh, and don’t miss this—March 30 is the deadline for that 100% bonus. This isn’t one of those “limited time” deals that stick around forever. After March 30, LAUNCH100 is gone. Hey Bulls, this one’s for you: 100% BONUS CODE: LAUNCH100 – Buy now and your tokens get doubled. That’s right—twice the tokens, zero extra cost. But you gotta act fast. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus: Step 1: Head to the BTFD Presale Step 2: Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, whatever works for you) Step 3: Enter LAUNCH100 in the bonus code field and hit “Apply” Step 4: Choose your purchase amount and click “Buy Now” Step 5: Confirm everything in your wallet, and boom—you just doubled your stack Remember: LAUNCH100 must be entered in ALL CAPS. Don’t miss that. Oh, and if you’ve got friends in the game, bring ‘em in. BTFD’s referral program is giving away 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens for the top 20 referrers each month. If your code makes the top list by month’s end, you’re getting some serious rewards. The competition resets at 12:01 UTC on the 1st of every month. Bottom line? BTFD is more than a meme coin presale —it’s a moment. A chance to lock in value while everyone else waits for the next crash to “maybe” buy. You don’t need to wait for dips when you’re buying at dip prices right now. Slerf (SLERF) – The $10M Mistake That Created a Meme Legend SLERF was already a playful sloth on the Solana blockchain, but it made waves after its developer accidentally burned $10 million in presale funds. Yep, just—poof—gone. Instead of tanking, the price spiked, and SLERF became a legend overnight. Now trading at around $0.068174, with a market cap of $34.35 million, SLERF’s community is all-in on chaos and comedy. Still, with only ~500 million tokens circulating, volatility is a constant. SLERF’s wild start is great if you’re into high-risk, high-reward bets—but if you’re looking for stability and a guaranteed bonus? BTFD is a safer bet with real utility. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) – From Meme to Meme Religion? GOAT’s origin is about as bizarre as it gets. An AI called “Terminal of Truths” tweeted about a “GOAT singularity,” and boom—someone launched a meme coin to match the vibe. With a total supply of 1 billion and a circulating supply of ~999.99 million, GOAT is now trading at $0.0638 with a market cap of $63.82 million. Its AI-backed cult following and lore-filled community called the “Gospel of Goatse” give it a unique twist. But with an all-time high of $1.35, it’s down massively. It could rebound—or it could stay weird. Either way, GOAT is fascinating, but again, it doesn’t hold a candle to BTFD’s reward-packed presale and live ecosystem. Conclusion – Time to Charge with the Bulls Crypto’s wild. We get it. Some days, it feels like you need divine intervention or AI prophecies just to make sense of the madness. But based on what we’re seeing—from market trends to community momentum— BTFD Coin stands out as the most solid, value-packed project among the top new meme coins to join today. The presale is real. The P2E game is live. The staking is juicy. The LAUNCH100 bonus ends March 30. Miss it, and you’re leaving 100% of your gains on the table. This is your shot to be part of something where utility meets meme, and community meets conviction. Don’t just scroll and think “maybe later.” Join the BTFD Coin presale right now—before Stage 16 hits and the bonus disappears! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What is BTFD Coin’s LAUNCH100 Bonus? It’s a limited-time offer where buyers get 100% extra BTFD tokens during Stage 15 by entering the code LAUNCH100. It ends on March 30. How do I buy BTFD Coin in the presale? Visit the BTFD site, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in the bonus field, and confirm the purchase. What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins? BTFD isn’t just hype. It’s got a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, Ethereum security, and a presale with real rewards. Is Slerf a good investment? SLERF is high-risk with unpredictable moves. It gained fame from an accidental $10M burn but lacks core utilities like staking or gaming. What’s the story behind Goatseus Maximus? GOAT was born from an AI’s meme prophecy. It has a loyal fanbase, but no staking or presale bonus—unlike BTFD.

The current market situation has brought renewed speculation about which promising tokens such as Remittix would offer investment returns like Pepe Coin's projected 2024 rise and Shiba Inu's historic 2021 performance. Let us find out why analysts think Remittix is the best crypto to buy in 2025. Is Pepe Coin Dead Or Still Riding the Meme Coin Wave The meme coin Pepe Coin uses nostalgic branding combined with viral promotional activities to build a strong community base among speculators. The price of Pepe stands at $0.00000912 while showing a 22% weekly gain through speculative trader interest seeking risky investment opportunities. The market momentum of Pepe Coin shows signs of deceleration since investors are moving toward initiatives that present better fundamental values. The key market insights indicate that despite the RSI standing at 50, which is neutral, other short-term technical indicators like MACD and moving averages are indicating a 'buy', albeit in spite of long-term moving averages still indicating some bearish pressure. Additionally, open interest has increased by 8.47%, indicative of increased trader activity. If PEPE is able to break past the resistance zone at $0.00000980 , it may target $0.000011 levels in the forthcoming weeks. However, the meme coin market remains unpredictable, even though the bulls appear to be in control, with the long-term direction of PEPE not yet clear, the next few days will be crucial in knowing whether the coin is actually ready for a significant breakout Pepe faces sustainability risks as a speculative asset because it must prove its ability to move past hype-based trading while developing practical applications which Remittix demonstrates successfully. Can Shiba Inu Soar In 2025; Or Is The Hype Over? Shiba Inu remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies available today with its reputation of building life-changing wealth for early adopters. Currently trading at under $0.000016, SHIB has seen a calm after being characterized by extreme volatility in the first part of this year. Its fan base keeps expanding with ecosystem initiatives like Shibarium a Layer-2 infrastructure with the objective of enhancing scalability and reducing transaction fees which has helped maintain investor demand for the token. Market forecasts indicate that Shiba Inu may experience a steady increase to $0.000025 by the end of 2025 if adoption of its ecosystem speeds up. Nevertheless, as SHIB matures, its growth potential might be capped against newer entrants in the market with new concepts and innovative technologies such as Remittix. Others believe Shiba Inu is set for an explosive 12x surge as its ecosystem team supports a bullish call, with upside potential for a 1,137% rise that will leave the meme currency smashing through levels to hit $0.0001833. Analysts See A Safe Path to Exponential Gains Following Remittix Aggressive Presale Success Through its presale Remittix has established a digital finance revolution that has already delivered more than 300% return on investment to its early investors. The crypto market adopted an exceptional positive stance toward the Defi project because of its promising potential to break into 2025’s top altcoins list. The DeFi coin, RTX, powers Remittix’s PayFi technology that makes international fund transfers easier for users. Blockchain technology allows the platform to offer fast and cost-effective money transfers that modernize global money transfer processes with transactions occurring in mere minutes. The smart contract safety of Remittix has been completely tested by BlockSAFU for maximum reliability. Through rigorous testing the platform achieves both reliability and robustness which brings stakeholders full security assurance. Those who join now with prices below 10 cents at $0.0734 have exceptional chances to take part in this revolutionary shift. Potential investors should seize this opportune period to buy Remittix tokens because the presale currently promises to produce substantive financial yield. Analysts think Remittix will yield up to 30x returns on investment when it eventually lists on top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Bybit thus making Remittix a noteworthy competitor in the crypto industry.

42454841,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143617,1743039605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Crypto Bills Update: Congress Nears Landmark Vote on Stablecoins & FIT 21,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/congress-crypto-stablecoin-bills/,"Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto landscape? Washington D.C. is buzzing with activity as Congress edges closer to making decisive moves on crypto bills and stablecoin bills . For crypto enthusiasts, investors, and industry players, this is a moment to watch closely. The future of digital assets in the US could be defined in the coming days as lawmakers work to establish a clear regulatory framework. Let’s dive into the details of these potentially groundbreaking developments. What’s the Buzz Around Crypto Bills in Congress? The momentum is building on Capitol Hill. Rep. French Hill, a key figure in these discussions, has indicated that a revised version of the highly anticipated FIT 21 bill will be unveiled within days. This is not just another piece of legislation; FIT 21 , or the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, is designed to create a comprehensive market structure for the crypto industry. Think of it as a blueprint for how digital assets will be governed in the US. But what exactly does FIT 21 aim to achieve? Expanding CFTC Oversight: One of the core goals of FIT 21 is to broaden the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This would mean the CFTC would have a greater role in overseeing the crypto market, particularly concerning digital commodities. Defining the SEC’s Role: Equally important is clarifying the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. The bill seeks to delineate where the SEC’s regulatory perimeter ends and where the CFTC’s begins, aiming to eliminate the ambiguity that has plagued the industry. Clarity for Crypto Businesses: For crypto businesses operating in the US, this clarity is paramount. A well-defined regulatory landscape can foster innovation, encourage investment, and provide a stable environment for growth, reducing the fear of inadvertently crossing regulatory lines. Rep. Hill’s announcement signals that lawmakers are serious about advancing crypto regulation . The revised draft likely incorporates feedback and revisions from previous discussions, suggesting a collaborative effort to create a workable framework. Stablecoin Bills: Are We Nearing a Breakthrough? Parallel to the FIT 21 developments, significant progress is also being made on stablecoin bills . Rep. Bryan Steil has confirmed that the text of the House stablecoin bill is imminent, with a markup expected shortly after its introduction. This is a crucial step towards regulating stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. Why are stablecoin bills so important? Systemic Risk Mitigation: Stablecoins have grown exponentially in popularity and market capitalization. Their widespread use means that their stability (or instability) can have broader implications for the financial system. Regulation aims to mitigate potential systemic risks. Consumer Protection: Ensuring that stablecoins are backed by adequate reserves and operate transparently is crucial for consumer protection. Regulations can establish standards for reserves, auditing, and disclosure. Payment Innovation: Stablecoin bills can pave the way for the responsible innovation of stablecoins as payment mechanisms. Clear rules can encourage adoption while safeguarding against misuse. The fact that both House and Senate versions of the stablecoin bill are reportedly about 80% aligned is a very encouraging sign. This level of consensus suggests a strong bipartisan push to get stablecoin regulation across the finish line. Unified digital asset regulation appears to be a shared goal, transcending partisan lines. The Push for Unified Digital Asset Regulation The overarching narrative here is the drive towards unified digital asset regulation . Lawmakers are recognizing the need for a cohesive and comprehensive approach to governing cryptocurrencies and related technologies. Fragmented or conflicting regulations could stifle innovation and create unnecessary compliance burdens. A unified framework, on the other hand, can provide: Benefit Description Clarity and Certainty Businesses and investors gain a clear understanding of the rules of the game, reducing uncertainty and fostering confidence. Reduced Compliance Costs A unified framework can streamline compliance, making it less costly and complex for businesses to operate within the regulatory perimeter.

These cryptocurrencies are catching the eyes of investors with promising growth signals. Dive into the analysis of why Cardano could hit $2 and XRP might reach $5 soon. Discover the key factors driving this expected upward movement. Cardano Shows Strong Long-Term Momentum Despite Recent Lull During the past month, Cardano experienced a minor dip of 0.26% despite a healthy weekly gain of 9.56%. Over the half-year period, a striking increase of 91.04% highlights notable investor interest and a period of significant upward movement. These figures reveal a coin that has built momentum over time, even though recent short-term performance appears subdued. Currently, Cardano trades within a range of $0.44 to $0.88 with a nearby resistance at $1.15 and support at $0.25. Indicators such as an RSI of 52.06 and a near-neutral Awesome Oscillator suggest a balanced market with a slight tilt toward bulls. Trading strategies could focus on buying within this range and monitoring moves toward key resistance levels for potential exits. XRP Market Insights: Past Trends and Current Price Dynamics XRP price declined by 4.45% over the past month, while a staggering 316.93% gain over six months underscores a strong long-term rally. A weekly increase of 7.74% hints at periodic momentum despite recent pullbacks. Historical performance shows volatility with significant upward movements punctuating shorter-term dips. The data highlights potential strength when examined across different periods, reflecting both short-term fluctuations and a robust long-term recovery signal. Current levels show a trading range from $1.60 to $2.88, with support near $1.06 and resistance at $3.61, followed by a secondary resistance at $4.89. Bulls and bears appear relatively balanced, with no clear trend dominating. Traders may look to buy near support and sell at resistance if bulls can push the price higher while monitoring key indicator signals. Conclusion ADA shows strong potential to reach the $2 mark. XRP is also demonstrating signs that it could soon hit $5. Both coins are exhibiting bullish trends. Investors are closely watching the market for a potential breakout. The sustained momentum could lead to significant gains for both ADA and XRP. The current market indicators suggest promising times ahead for these cryptocurrencies.

42455244,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143619,1743040259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Warning: Bitget CEO Exposes Hyperliquid FTX Threat After JELLY Incident,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitget-ceo-hyperliquid-ftx-threat/,"Is history about to repeat itself in the volatile world of cryptocurrency exchanges? The crypto community is buzzing after Bitget CEO Gracy Chen issued a stark warning about decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid. Chen publicly stated that Hyperliquid’s handling of a recent incident, known as the JELLY incident, bears an uncanny resemblance to the events leading up to the colossal FTX collapse. Could Hyperliquid be the next domino to fall in the crypto space? Let’s dive into the details of this developing crypto exchange controversy and understand what’s at stake for crypto users. Why is Bitget CEO Gracy Chen Sounding the Alarm on Hyperliquid? The core of the issue stems from what Bitget CEO Gracy Chen describes as Hyperliquid’s “immature, unethical, and unprofessional” response to the JELLY incident. In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Chen didn’t mince words, suggesting that Hyperliquid’s actions not only caused financial losses for users but also severely damaged the exchange’s credibility. This is a significant accusation, especially considering Hyperliquid markets itself as an innovative decentralized exchange. Here’s a breakdown of Chen’s key concerns: Immature Handling of JELLY Incident: Chen criticized Hyperliquid’s approach to resolving the JELLY incident, implying a lack of transparency and user-centric solutions. User Losses: She highlighted that Hyperliquid’s actions resulted in tangible financial losses for users, a critical breach of trust in the crypto exchange environment. Damaged Credibility: According to Chen, the incident has significantly eroded Hyperliquid’s credibility, questioning its reliability and trustworthiness as a DEX platform. FTX 2.0 Potential: The most alarming aspect of Chen’s statement is the direct comparison to FTX, suggesting that the JELLY incident could be a precursor to a larger crisis at Hyperliquid, mirroring the catastrophic downfall of FTX. Chen’s commentary raises serious questions about the operational standards and user protection mechanisms within the decentralized exchange sector, particularly when compared to regulated centralized exchanges. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) vs. Centralized Exchange (CEX): Are User Funds Really Safer? The rise of decentralized exchange DEX platforms was largely fueled by the desire for greater user control and transparency, contrasting sharply with the opaque nature of some centralized exchanges. DEXs, in theory, eliminate the need for intermediaries, allowing users to trade directly from their wallets. However, Chen’s critique throws a spotlight on the potential pitfalls even within the DEX space. Let’s compare DEXs and CEXs in light of this controversy: Feature Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Centralized Exchange (CEX) Custody of Funds Users retain control of their private keys and funds. Users deposit funds into the exchange’s custody. Transparency Transactions are typically recorded on a public blockchain. Transparency can vary; some CEXs are less transparent about their operations. Regulation & Compliance Often operates with less regulatory oversight. Subject to regulations and KYC/AML compliance. Risk of Incidents Smart contract vulnerabilities, protocol risks, operational immaturity. Exchange hacks, mismanagement, regulatory risks. User Protection User protection mechanisms can be less defined and harder to enforce. Often have established customer support and some level of regulatory protection (depending on jurisdiction). Chen’s statement suggests that while DEXs offer the promise of decentralization, they are not immune to operational failures and user harm. Her comparison of Hyperliquid to “offshore centralized exchanges that facilitate illegal activities without KYC/AML” is particularly damning. It implies that Hyperliquid, despite being a DEX, might be exhibiting similar risky behaviors and lack of accountability that contributed to the FTX debacle. The JELLY Incident Crypto: What Actually Happened? To understand the gravity of the JELLY incident crypto controversy, it’s crucial to know what transpired. While specific details of the JELLY incident require further investigation and official statements from Hyperliquid, the core issue seems to revolve around a significant operational or technical glitch that led to user losses. Based on available information and Chen’s comments, the JELLY incident likely involved: A Technical Issue: Potentially a smart contract vulnerability, a platform bug, or an exploit that affected trading or asset management on Hyperliquid. User Losses: This technical issue resulted in direct financial losses for users who were trading or holding assets on the platform at the time of the incident. Hyperliquid’s Response: Chen’s criticism focuses on how Hyperliquid handled the aftermath – allegedly in an “immature, unethical, and unprofessional” manner, suggesting a lack of adequate communication, compensation, or resolution for affected users. The lack of detailed public information about the JELLY incident itself further fuels concerns about transparency and user protection within the DEX space. A robust and transparent response to such incidents is crucial for maintaining user trust and the long-term viability of any crypto exchange, whether centralized or decentralized. Hyperliquid FTX: Is History Repeating Itself? The most alarming takeaway from Bitget CEO’s statement is the direct comparison of Hyperliquid FTX . The collapse of FTX sent shockwaves through the crypto industry, exposing the dangers of centralized control, lack of transparency, and alleged fraudulent activities. Chen drawing parallels between Hyperliquid and FTX is a serious accusation that warrants attention and scrutiny. Why is the FTX comparison so potent and concerning? Sudden and Unexpected Collapse: FTX’s downfall was rapid and largely unexpected by many, highlighting how quickly trust can erode in the crypto space. User Fund Mismanagement: Allegations of FTX mismanaging and misusing user funds were central to its collapse, leading to massive user losses. Lack of Transparency and Accountability: FTX was criticized for its opaque operations and lack of accountability, contributing to the crisis. Industry-Wide Contagion: The FTX collapse had ripple effects across the crypto market, impacting numerous projects and investors. If Hyperliquid is indeed exhibiting similar patterns of questionable practices or inadequate user protection, as suggested by Chen, the potential for a similar catastrophic outcome cannot be dismissed lightly. The crypto community remembers the lessons of FTX, and any hint of history repeating itself is bound to trigger alarm bells. Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself in the DEX Era This crypto exchange controversy serves as a crucial reminder for all crypto users, especially those venturing into the world of decentralized exchanges. While DEXs offer exciting possibilities, they also come with inherent risks. Here are some actionable insights to protect yourself: Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research any DEX platform before using it. Understand its operational model, security measures, and community reputation. Risk Diversification: Don’t put all your crypto assets on a single platform, especially a relatively new or less established DEX. Diversify across multiple platforms and cold storage solutions. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and developments related to the DEX platforms you use. Follow industry experts and monitor social media for any red flags or user concerns. Understand Smart Contract Risks: Be aware that DEXs rely on smart contracts, which can have vulnerabilities. Opt for platforms with audited and well-vetted smart contracts. Prioritize Transparency: Favor DEXs that are transparent about their operations, incident response protocols, and user protection mechanisms. The evolving landscape of crypto exchanges demands vigilance and informed decision-making. The Hyperliquid situation, highlighted by Bitget CEO Gracy Chen, underscores the importance of critical evaluation and risk management, even within the decentralized realm. Conclusion: A Stark Warning for the DEX Future? Bitget CEO Gracy Chen’s shocking allegations against Hyperliquid have ignited a crucial conversation about the state of decentralized exchanges and user safety. The comparison to FTX is a grave warning, urging both users and the industry to take a closer look at the operational practices and accountability mechanisms within the DEX sector. While decentralization offers numerous benefits, it doesn’t inherently guarantee safety or immunity from failures. The JELLY incident and its aftermath serve as a potent reminder that robust security, transparency, and user-centric responses are paramount for the sustained growth and trust in the decentralized crypto ecosystem. The crypto community will be watching closely to see how Hyperliquid responds to these serious accusations and what steps the broader DEX industry takes to ensure user protection and prevent potential “FTX 2.0” scenarios.

A glance at the charts reveals that crypto price today exhibits dour sentiments with BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP in bleed mode. Crypto Price Today: Top Coins Suffers Are In The Red According to CoinMarketCap data , flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has dipped by nearly 2% today to trade at $87,000, quelling enthusiasm for a run toward $90K. Bitcoin’s decline is pulling other assets underwater with the largest altcoin Ethereum down by 3.1% at just above $2,000. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has shed nearly 4% as it exchanges hands at $2.36. The asset has failed to rally following the dismissal of the Ripple SEC Case, wallowing at 38.27% from its all-time high of $3.84. Furthermore, Solana (SOL) has lost 5% of its value as it trades at $137. The sixth-largest token has erased previous gains despite rising institutional interest from Polymarket enabling SOL deposits and BlackRock’s BUIDL fund launching on the network. On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) is bleeding at $0.7, after shedding nearly 5% of its market capitalization in the correction. Predictions for ADA to $10 seem far off for the ninth-largest cryptocurrency with daily trading volumes of under $1 billion confirming widespread optimism. Chainlink (LINK) trades at $15.19 with a respectable 1.68% decline for the asset. Daily trading volumes of over 12% are signaling a potential upswing for LINK price in the near future. Memecoins Are Recording Impressive Gains While the rest of the market is bleeding memecoins are bucking the trend to notch upswing. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has surged by nearly 4% as it seeks to eliminate a zero from its present price. Dogecoin (DOGE) continues its upward trend, climbing by 2% to trade at $0.1945 on the heels of a Dogecoin Reserve . DOGE’s daily trading volume is matching the enthusiasm of price predictions touting the memecoin to embark on a strong rally. The biggest gainer of the lot is PEPE with its near 7% spike over the last day. The memecoin has a daily trading volume of $1 billion, a 96% jump over the last day as it eyes an increase in its market value. Despite the rallies, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood says memecoins will lose value in the coming days. However, the memecoin rally was unable to stop the global market capitalization for crypto price today from sliding by 2% to settle at $2.84 trillion.

According to Rector, the SEC Commissioners will hold a vote on March 27 to finalize their decision to end the appeal against Ripple. He stated that an official announcement would follow soon after. This development comes after the SEC agreed to dismiss its appeal against Ripple, marking a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The image attached to the Rector’s post showed a Sunshine Act notice for a closed SEC meeting scheduled for March 27, 2025. While the official agenda of this meeting has not been disclosed, the timing suggests it could include discussions related to the Ripple case. According to Rector, the first hearing to confirm Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair will happen the same day.

Over the years, the case has seen multiple notable rulings, including Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 decision that XRP was not a security in secondary sales and the August 2024 ruling that imposed a $125 million penalty on the company. The SEC’s subsequent appeal attempts have not changed any of these rulings, and the regulator’s decision to drop the appeal follows recent dismissals of other crypto-related lawsuits and investigations. This dismissal would mark a major victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry, and the results could be a notable precedent for digital asset regulation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The SEC Meeting and Possible Announcement The SEC’s Sunshine Act notice confirms that a closed meeting will occur on March 27, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. ET. While the notice does not specify the topics under discussion, Rector and others in the cryptocurrency community speculate that the formal vote to end the Ripple appeal could be included. If the vote occurs as expected, an official announcement could follow. This dismissal is a major step toward the future. It coincides with the confirmation hearing of Paul Atkins, the man Donald Trump has nominated to bring the SEC into a new era of proper regulatory practices. The timing of this meeting, combined with the recent lawsuit dismissals , raises expectations that the Ripple lawsuit’s resolution could be confirmed soon.

The House of Representatives just released its version, following the Senate’s recent approval of a similar bill. New Bill to Align House and Senate Efforts This new legislation will set rules for how companies can create and use digital tokens backed by the U.S. dollar, marking a major step in bringing more oversight and clarity to the growing crypto industry. Steil explained that the new version of the bill will help align the House and Senate’s efforts, making the two versions more similar and easier to work with. The Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) “is a strong continuation of our work on digital assets in the last Congress,” Hill said in a statement. Rep Emmer Reintroduces Securities Clarity Act Besides, on Wednesday, Rep. Emmer reintroduced his Securities Clarity Act , aiming to clarify how crypto assets fit into securities law. “Until we have a clear definition of what is a commodity and what is a security, American innovation will continue to suffer. Our legislation will help provide these answers and allow American investors to fully participate in digital asset technology without sacrificing consumer protections,” Congressman Tom Emmer noted. As the conference came to an end, the Senate held a second vote to overturn the IRS’ 2024 rule on DeFi brokers, after both the Senate and House passed the resolution before. The vote passed with 70 Senators in favor and 28 against. Amanda Tuminelli, Executive Director of the DeFi Education Fund, thanked the bipartisan lawmakers who supported the resolution, pointing out the negative effects of the IRS’ rule on the DeFi industry. French Hill to Release Revised FIT 21 Bill Shortly At the DC Blockchain Summit on Wednesday, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill also mentioned that a revised version of the market structure bill is almost ready, following work from his committee last year. The bill, called FIT 21 (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act), passed the House last year with support from 71 Democrats, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Hill plans to release a revised draft in the next few weeks, after receiving “technical assistance.” The market structure bill from last year aimed to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more control over crypto markets, especially bitcoin, and clarify the SEC’s role. Passing the market structure bill is more challenging than the stablecoin legislation due to its complexity. When FIT 21 passed the House, it was influenced by opposition to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler and former President Joe Biden, leading to some compromises. However, now, with a different political landscape, those compromises may no longer be needed. Stablecoin Regulation Picking Up The Senate Banking Committee recently advanced the bipartisan GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a framework for regulating stablecoins and determining when issuers fall under state or federal oversight. Some Democrats voiced concerns and sought changes, but they were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, in the House, Republicans, led by Rep. Bryan Steil, introduced the STABLE Act in February to regulate stablecoins.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 01:57:31

The global markets are on edge as former President Donald Trump is set to make a significant announcement regarding auto tariffs tonight at 8 p.m. UTC. While it might seem distant from the world of digital currencies, this move could send ripples through the entire financial ecosystem, potentially creating both challenges and opportunities for the crypto market. Let’s dive into what this Trump trade policy shift means and how it could affect your crypto portfolio. Why Auto Tariffs Matter to Crypto: Understanding the Economic Uncertainty At first glance, auto tariffs might seem like they only concern the automotive industry. However, in today’s interconnected global economy, such decisions have far-reaching consequences. Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, designed to protect domestic industries. But they can also: Increase Consumer Prices: Tariffs can lead to higher prices for imported cars and potentially domestically produced cars as well, contributing to inflation. Spark Trade Wars: Imposing tariffs can provoke retaliatory measures from other countries, escalating into full-blown trade wars. This creates global trade tensions and economic instability. Impact Global Growth: Trade wars disrupt supply chains, reduce international trade, and can slow down global economic growth. Currency Fluctuations: Tariffs can influence currency exchange rates, impacting the value of the US dollar and other currencies, which in turn can affect crypto prices. For the crypto market, which often thrives on economic uncertainty crypto and volatility, these broader economic shifts are crucial to watch. When traditional markets face turbulence, investors sometimes look to alternative assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as hedges. Decoding Trump’s Auto Tariff Announcement: What to Expect? While the exact details of President Trump’s announcement are still under wraps, the anticipation itself is causing jitters in financial markets. Here’s what we can anticipate and consider: Scope of Tariffs: Will these tariffs be targeted at specific countries, or will they be broad-based? The scope will determine the extent of the impact. Tariff Rates: The percentage of tariffs imposed will directly influence the price increases and the level of trade disruption. Retaliation Risk: We need to assess the likelihood and potential scale of retaliatory tariffs from other nations. This could amplify global trade tensions . Market Reaction: How will stock markets, bond markets, and currency markets react immediately after the announcement? This initial reaction can give us clues about the potential impact on crypto. Navigating Market Volatility Crypto: Opportunities and Challenges The expected market volatility crypto markets might experience due to the tariff announcement presents a double-edged sword. Here’s a breakdown of potential scenarios: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Impact Opportunities Challenges Increased Economic Uncertainty Investors may seek safe-haven assets, potentially driving capital into Bitcoin and other established cryptocurrencies. Potential for price appreciation in major cryptocurrencies. Increased trading volume and market activity. Altcoins might experience higher volatility and increased risk. Regulatory uncertainty could be amplified during economic turmoil. Stock Market Downturn If auto tariffs trigger a significant stock market correction, some investors might diversify into crypto as an alternative investment. Opportunity to buy crypto at potentially lower prices if a market dip occurs. Increased awareness of crypto as a non-correlated asset. Broader market panic could temporarily drag down all asset classes, including crypto. Liquidity issues might arise in highly volatile conditions. Dollar Weakness Tariffs could weaken the US dollar if they negatively impact the US economy. A weaker dollar can historically be positive for Bitcoin. Bitcoin, often seen as an alternative to fiat currencies, could become more attractive. Dollar-pegged stablecoins might see increased scrutiny. Importing goods and services using crypto might become more expensive if the dollar weakens significantly against other currencies. Actionable Insights: Preparing Your Crypto Strategy Given the impending announcement and potential market volatility crypto could face, here are some actionable steps for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to the tariff announcement and its immediate aftermath. Monitor market reactions across different asset classes. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and potentially other asset classes can help mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Consider reducing leverage and setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital during periods of high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that short-term market fluctuations are common. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your crypto investments. Explore Stablecoins: In times of uncertainty, stablecoins pegged to stronger currencies (other than USD if it weakens) could offer a temporary safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. The Bottom Line: Navigating the Trade Winds in Crypto President Trump’s auto tariff announcement is more than just trade policy; it’s a potential catalyst for economic shifts that can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. By understanding the potential consequences of this Trump trade policy and preparing for increased market volatility crypto markets might experience, you can navigate these uncertain times strategically. Whether it presents opportunities for growth or challenges to overcome, staying informed and adaptable is key in the ever-evolving world of crypto.

Over the past week, the Pi Coin sentiment collapsed after a 90% price drop, triggering concerns about trust and engagement. In more positive news, Chainlink shows breakout potential, supported by bullish technical indicators and rising trading volumes. Yet all eyes are on BlockDAG (BDAG) , as explosive presale momentum drives the project closer to an ambitious $600 million presale goal. With over $206.5 million raised and growing BDAG demand, BlockDAG is doing more than keeping up—it’s surging ahead and solidifying its position as the best crypto to buy now. Pi Coin Sentiment Deteriorates as Market Confidence Wavers The spotlight is back on Pi Network but for all the wrong reasons. In just 24 hours, Pi coin sentiment worsened due to a staggering 90% drop in Pi’s value, sparking debate across the crypto space. The sharp drop appears linked to a wave of bot activity and spam, raising serious concerns about the project’s social credibility and underlying engagement metrics. The unexpected turn in Pi coin sentiment has raised concerns about the authenticity of Pi Network’s community support. With user trust under pressure and organic activity declining, the incident has cast a shadow over the project’s credibility. As speculation continues, it remains unclear how quickly Pi coin sentiment can recover from this reputational setback. Chainlink Technical Analysis Suggests Potential $24 Breakout Recent Chainlink technical analysis indicates growing bullish momentum as LINK trades near the $19 mark. Analysts point to strong support at $17.75 and resistance at $19.98. A successful breakout above this resistance could set the stage for a rally toward the $24 target, especially if market sentiment remains favorable. The analysis also highlights rising trading volume and improving RSI levels, which reinforce the bullish outlook. While short-term volatility remains, Chainlink’s technical analysis suggests the project is gearing up for a key move. Continued strength above support levels may confirm upward momentum in the coming weeks. BlockDAG’s Presale Surge Puts $600M Target in Striking Distance BlockDAG is racing toward its ambitious $600 million presale target, and it’s not just hype, it’s measurable momentum. With over $206.5 million raised and 18.9 billion BDAG coins sold, the numbers speak for themselves. The presale’s steady climb shows no signs of slowing, fueled by consistent batch sellouts and growing public interest. Not to mention, demand for BDAG coins is through the roof. Over 700,000 users are actively mining BDAG on its mobile mining tools, while more than 170,000 unique holders have bought BDAG coins. These figures show BlockDAG’s wide adoption and reflect the trust crypto enthusiasts have in the BlockDAG ecosystem and its growth. As the demand for BDAG grows and more people join the project, the presale keeps getting bigger. BDAG holders now anticipate its upcoming Mainnet launch and 10 centralized exchange listings, while BlockDAG’s momentum feels unstoppable. What sets BlockDAG apart is its balance between traction and forward visibility. Analysts are now projecting a $1 price in 2025, a jump that would reflect both its growing ecosystem and scalable architecture. With over 200 dApps to be developed under its Hackathon partnership and a clear roadmap in place to expand its ecosystem, BlockDAG’s price outlook is backed by substance. BlockDAG checks every box: real user adoption, consistent presale growth, and a realistic path to major market milestones. The $600 million goal isn’t just within reach—it’s becoming a matter of how soon. The Bottom Line The dramatic drop in Pi Coin sentiment has cast doubt on the project’s community strength, highlighting the risks of hype without sustained engagement. In contrast, the Chainlink technical analysis points to a potential breakout, signaling an opportunity if key resistance levels are broken. Both stories reflect the volatility that continues to define crypto. But one project is breaking through the noise. BlockDAG’s record-breaking presale, surging adoption, and steady progress toward its $600 million goal make it a standout crypto in 2025. BlockDAG has raised $206.5 million in presale and momentum is building across due to its fast-growing holder base. This isn’t hype, it’s execution at scale, and that’s what makes it the best crypto to buy now .

In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Elizabeth, who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, said, “Nobody is safe, not even the chairman of the Federal Reserve,” and warned that Trump’s interpretation of executive power means “all the power belongs to the king.” Elizabeth made the statement in Washington, D.C., just hours after Powell met with Treasury and Fed officials on the inflation trajectory. She accused Trump of overstepping legal limits to fire officials from independent agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Elizabeth helped set up after the 2008 crash. “If he can just mow through every civil servant,” she said, “it’s a form of lawlessness.” She believes the president’s actions violate federal law. Warren hits Powell’s record and calls out Musk’s mass firings Elizabeth reminded Bloomberg that she had opposed Powell’s reappointment by former president Joe Biden, pointing to Powell’s support for loosening financial rules. She accused Powell of siding with Wall Street interests and warned that deregulating the banking sector would eventually hurt everyday people. Still, she said she supported the Fed’s independence and that of agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Inspectors General, who have all been targeted under Trump’s return to power. During the same interview, Elizabeth called out Trump and Elon Musk for firing massive numbers of federal workers and terminating government contracts. She called it “lawlessness” and said it could destabilize the system designed to protect both markets and workers. She added that cutting rules that protect investors would wreck confidence in U.S. markets, saying, “The reason our stock market is so valuable is in part because it has level, transparent rules that are strictly enforced.” She also targeted Paul Atkins, who Trump wants to install as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Elizabeth blamed Paul for voting in favor of weaker regulations before the financial crash of 2008 and said he hadn’t learned anything since then. “He had the chance to have 20-20 hindsight,” she said. “He has 20-zero hindsight.” Elizabeth, one of the Senate’s most outspoken progressives, also took aim at Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for backing down on a procedural move that could have blocked a Republican spending bill earlier this month. That bill kept the government open, but many Democrats wanted to use the moment to push back against Musk’s federal firings. Elizabeth said: “I think there’s a moment when you stand and fight. We cannot avoid this fight, because Donald Trump and Elon Musk, truly they want to take this country over for just a handful of people and they want even more wealth and power to go to them while everybody else has to pay for it.” Bostic cuts forecast as tariffs drag inflation outlook While the political fights played out in Washington, Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, appeared on Monday in a Bloomberg interview and lowered his rate-cut forecast. Earlier this year, Raphael had expected two rate cuts in 2025. Now he’s predicting just one, citing Trump’s tariffs as the key reason. “I moved to one mainly because I think we’re going to see inflation be very bumpy and not move dramatically and in a clear way to the 2% target,” he said. Raphael now expects inflation to settle around the Fed’s 2% target sometime in early 2027, which is even later than the Fed’s own projection in September 2024, when officials thought 2026 was more realistic. This adjustment aligns with the Fed’s most recent forecast, issued last week. Despite Raphael’s cautious tone, the Fed still says it sees a half-point rate cut coming this year, which would mean two reductions of 25 basis points. But that number is just the median. A closer look shows that more officials now expect either one cut or none at all next year. Trump demands immediate rate cuts as Powell hesitates Trump, meanwhile, wants rate cuts now. During a Cabinet meeting at the White House this week, he said, “Generally, prices are coming down, and energy prices are coming down, and I hope the Fed lowers interest rates, and then you get to see interest rates coming down.” Last week, he also posted online that the Fed should start slashing now before his new tariffs kick in on April 2. Those tariffs are already affecting the Fed’s inflation models, according to Jerome Powell, who acknowledged that rising trade costs are being considered in their economic forecasts. But the Fed isn’t moving just yet. Officials are still waiting for more data, even though investors are growing restless. The Fed’s latest inflation report showed slower price increases for both consumer and producer goods in February, but deeper numbers suggest the central bank’s 2% inflation goal could be delayed. The biggest problem is Trump’s trade policy, which throws uncertainty into every model Powell’s team is working with. Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer for Global Fixed Income at BlackRock, said on Wednesday, “Uncertainty was a highlight of the statement.” He explained that both the market and the Fed are stuck in limbo and need time to figure out what to do next. Powell told reporters that the Fed has to stick with earlier projections for now, saying, “There is a level of inertia” until more clarity emerges. But time might be running out, especially if Trump’s tariff policies escalate through the summer. There’s also concern that the Fed might cut rates for the wrong reason — not because inflation is easing, but because growth is slowing and the job market is weakening. That would signal weakness, not strength, and investors may not like what comes next. Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday: “Everybody wants two cuts, three cuts, four cuts. You don’t want any cuts. You want earnings growth. You want a strong economy. Be careful what you wish for.” Even though Powell has held a more hawkish line, markets still priced in three rate cuts by the end of this year, up from two. That shift was reported by Bloomberg, based on traders reacting to the latest projections. But Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, warned that none of it might play out as expected. He said the Fed’s forecast models — especially the dot plot — haven’t exactly nailed it over the last five years. “The ‘dot plot’ and [the Fed’s] projections have not been super reliable over the last five years,” he said. He pointed to political chaos and economic confusion as reasons not to trust the numbers. “When the path forward is so unclear,” Ross said, “you just take it with a grain of salt, go back to basics, and focus on the drivers of either the individual equities or the sectors in the market that you own. In this case, thinking about things like earnings and long rates, rather than what the Fed is doing at the short end of the curve.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Recent data reveals a noteworthy shift in the digital asset landscape. As cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gain popularity, global banks are seemingly adjusting their strategies, leading to a decrease in their direct cryptocurrency holdings. Let’s dive into this intriguing development and understand what it means for the future of finance and crypto. Why are Global Banks’ Crypto Holdings Declining? The ETF Effect The primary driver behind this shift appears to be the rise of crypto ETFs impact . These investment vehicles offer a regulated and perhaps more palatable way for institutional investors, including banks, to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. Instead of managing the complexities and security risks associated with direct spot cryptocurrency holdings , banks can now invest in ETFs that track the performance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Consider these points to understand the ETF effect: Ease of Access: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through existing brokerage accounts. This simplifies the investment process for banks accustomed to traditional financial instruments. Regulatory Comfort: Regulated ETFs provide a layer of compliance and oversight that might be more comfortable for risk-averse institutions like banks, especially compared to the often-murky waters of direct crypto custody. Diversification within Crypto: Crypto ETFs can offer diversified exposure to the crypto market, reducing the risk associated with holding individual cryptocurrencies. Liquidity: ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing banks to easily buy and sell their crypto exposure as needed, which might be less straightforward with direct cryptocurrency holdings. The Numbers Speak: A Snapshot of Banks’ Crypto Holdings Decline According to a CoinDesk report, citing data from the Basel Committee crypto on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the numbers clearly illustrate this downward trend. In the second quarter of 2024, an estimated 29 banks worldwide held $368.3 billion in cryptocurrencies. While this figure might seem substantial, it’s crucial to look at it in context. The proportion of spot cryptocurrency holdings within these banks’ overall assets is currently less than 3%. This figure represents a significant decline when compared to earlier periods, although specific historical data for direct comparison within the article is limited. To put this in perspective, let’s consider the BCBS’s recommendation: BCBS Recommendation: Back in December 2022, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision advised that banks’ spot cryptocurrency holdings should ideally not exceed 2% of their total assets. Current Status: While the current proportion is “less than 3%”, it’s important to note that it’s still slightly above the recommended threshold from 2022. However, the direction of travel is clearly downwards, indicating banks are actively managing their direct crypto exposure. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and Regulatory Influence The Basel Committee crypto on Banking Supervision plays a pivotal role in setting global standards for the regulation of banks. Their recommendations, although not legally binding in every jurisdiction, carry significant weight and influence how global banks crypto approach digital assets. Key aspects of BCBS’s influence include: Risk Management Framework: BCBS provides guidelines for banks to assess and manage the risks associated with crypto assets. This framework encourages a cautious approach, particularly towards volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Capital Requirements: The committee’s recommendations often include guidelines on capital requirements for banks holding crypto assets. Higher capital requirements can make holding certain crypto assets less attractive from a capital efficiency perspective. Promoting Stability: BCBS’s primary objective is to enhance financial stability globally. Their cautious stance on direct banks crypto holdings decline reflects a broader concern about the potential risks that cryptocurrencies could pose to the traditional banking system. Guidance Evolution: It’s important to note that the regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated with traditional finance, BCBS’s guidance and recommendations are likely to adapt as well. What Does This Trend Mean for the Future of Crypto and Banks? The observed banks crypto holdings decline , coupled with the rise of crypto ETFs, signals an evolving trend in how traditional financial institutions are engaging with the cryptocurrency space. It’s not necessarily a retreat from crypto, but rather a strategic shift towards potentially less risky and more regulatory-compliant avenues for exposure. Here’s a look at the potential implications: Mainstream Adoption via ETFs: Crypto ETFs could become a primary vehicle for mainstream and institutional crypto adoption, channeling investment through regulated and familiar structures. Shift in Bank Strategy: Banks might focus more on offering crypto-related services, such as custody solutions for ETFs or advisory services, rather than directly holding large amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Regulatory Clarity and Growth: As regulations surrounding crypto ETFs and digital assets become clearer globally, we could see further growth in these regulated crypto investment products. Continued Bank Interest in Blockchain: While direct crypto holdings might decrease, banks’ interest in blockchain technology and its applications is likely to remain strong, as they explore use cases beyond just cryptocurrency investments. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto-Banking Landscape The data indicating a decline in global banks crypto direct holdings is a significant development, highlighting the dynamic interplay between traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. The surge in popularity of crypto ETFs impact appears to be a key catalyst, offering banks a different, potentially more palatable route to participate in the crypto space. As the regulatory landscape continues to mature and crypto ETFs gain further traction, it will be fascinating to observe how banks crypto holdings decline trend evolves and shapes the future of institutional crypto adoption. This isn’t necessarily a bearish signal for crypto; instead, it may represent a strategic recalibration as banks navigate the complexities and opportunities presented by digital assets in a rapidly changing financial world.

While fluctuations are inevitable, some altcoins are breaking barriers with real-world applications and cutting-edge innovations. Qubetics (TICS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Gala (GALA) are at the forefront, making waves with major updates. Arbitrum DAO is debating whether to withdraw funding from its Gaming Catalyst Program due to concerns over transparency. Meanwhile, Gala Games has introduced staking for its native token, giving its 1.5 million users a new way to engage with the ecosystem. These moves could reshape their respective communities, but one project is standing out for its ability to solve long-standing issues in blockchain utility—Qubetics. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another crypto token; it’s a powerful force in Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization. By transforming physical assets into digital tokens, Qubetics unlocks liquidity, broadens market accessibility, and simplifies asset ownership. Qubetics: Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is revolutionizing asset ownership by digitizing real-world assets on the blockchain. This means that traditionally illiquid assets, such as luxury real estate, can be fractionally owned, bought, or sold in a seamless, borderless manner. For decades, investing in high-value assets required substantial capital and extensive legal processes. Qubetics eliminates these barriers by allowing asset tokenization. For instance, instead of needing millions to own a stake in a prime real estate property, a user can buy fractional tokens that represent small portions of the property’s value. With a presale price of $0.1300 and a projected ROI of 669% at $1, Qubetics is rapidly gaining traction among enterprises, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts who recognize its long-term potential. With over $15.5 million raised, more than 503 million $TICS tokens sold, and 23,800+ token holders already on board, this is no ordinary presale. Currently in its 27th stage, the price is still accessible, but every phase sees an increase, meaning those who act now are locking in the lowest possible cost before the token hits the open market, one of the best altcoins to invest in now. What a $1,000 Investment Looks Like Right Now At the current crypto presale price of $0.1300, a $1,000 investment secures 7,692 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics hits $1, that $1,000 turns into $7,692. At $5 per $TICS, the same investment skyrockets to $38,460, and if Qubetics reaches $10, the value explodes to $76,920. With over 503 million tokens already sold, every passing stage sees an increase in price, reducing the potential returns for those who hesitate. Qubetics isn’t waiting for mainstream adoption—it’s building the infrastructure that will drive it. Blockchain interoperability isn’t a future dream; it’s happening now. Those securing $TICS at this stage are positioning themselves for what could be one of the most explosive blockchain transformations of the decade. Arbitrum (ARB): Governance & Security Challenges Arbitrum, a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is facing governance and security concerns. The Arbitrum DAO is debating whether to withdraw funding from its Gaming Catalyst Program, which allocated 225 million ARB tokens to support Web3 gaming. Transparency concerns have led to calls for reallocating the funds to one of the best altcoins to invest in now. On March 10, 2025, a vulnerability in Arbitrum’s signature verification system led to unauthorized transactions and a loss of $140,000. The issue has been addressed, but it highlights the importance of ongoing security enhancements. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even established blockchain networks must continuously evolve to stay ahead of potential threats. Gala (GALA): Staking & User Engagement Gala Games is taking a major step forward in its blockchain gaming ecosystem with the introduction of staking options for GALA tokens. With over 1.5 million active players and 21 developed games, this new feature is set to reshape how participants interact with the platform. By allowing token holders to lock up their assets in exchange for rewards, staking is expected to drive higher demand for GALA by reducing its circulating supply one of the best altcoins to invest in now. This move also strengthens user engagement by encouraging long-term holding, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and robust token economy. As more players and developers recognize the benefits of staking, Gala Games continues to solidify its position as a leader in blockchain gaming, ensuring a thriving ecosystem that benefits both gamers and token holders alike. Analyst projections for GALA vary. CoinCodex predicts a potential rise to $0.63998 by April 2025, while Changelly suggests a possible 1.1% decrease by March 26, 2025. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, Gala’s commitment to expansion remains strong. Conclusion Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Gala are shaping the crypto market in distinct ways. While Arbitrum navigates governance and security challenges, and Gala introduces new staking mechanisms, Qubetics is forging a future where real-world assets seamlessly integrate with blockchain technology. For those seeking the best altcoins to invest in now , staying informed on these evolving projects could unlock exciting opportunities. With Qubetics’ presale gaining momentum, Arbitrum refining its governance, and Gala enhancing its staking ecosystem, these three altcoins remain pivotal players in the crypto space.

42456336,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143644,1743042049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: Crypto Firms Demand DOJ Clarity on Money Transmitter Rules,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-firms-doj-clarity-rules/,"Is the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) casting a shadow over the future of crypto innovation? Over 30 leading crypto firms are raising serious concerns about the DOJ’s interpretation of money transmitter rules, arguing it could stifle development and push innovation overseas. Let’s dive into why these companies are ringing alarm bells and what it means for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). Why are Crypto Firms Calling for DOJ Clarity on Money Transmitter Rules? At the heart of the issue is Section 1960, a statute designed to combat illegal money transmitting. While its original intent is clear, crypto firms argue that the DOJ is applying an overly broad interpretation, particularly in cases like the recent Tornado Cash sanctions. This broad interpretation, spearheaded by the DOJ, is seen as a significant departure from established FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) guidelines, creating a murky legal landscape for developers, especially those working on non-custodial software. Here’s a breakdown of the key concerns: Threat to Non-Custodial Software: The DOJ’s stance is perceived as a direct threat to developers of non-custodial software. Non-custodial software is crucial for DeFi, empowering users to maintain control of their own digital assets. If developers are deemed money transmitters simply for creating and distributing this software, it could severely hamper innovation. Bypassing FinCEN Guidance: FinCEN is the primary regulatory body for money transmission in the U.S. The crypto industry feels the DOJ is bypassing FinCEN’s more nuanced approach, creating regulatory confusion and uncertainty. Legal Uncertainty and Innovation Chill: The lack of legal clarity is creating a chilling effect. Firms are hesitant to invest and innovate in the U.S. when the legal boundaries are unclear and potentially punitive. This could lead to an exodus of crypto talent and development to more welcoming jurisdictions. In a strongly worded letter to Congress, spearheaded by the DeFi Education Fund, these crypto firms are urging lawmakers to step in and provide much-needed clarification. They are seeking a clear legislative intent that explicitly protects U.S.-based crypto and DeFi development from overly aggressive interpretations of money transmitter laws. The Tornado Cash Case: A Lightning Rod for Concerns The Tornado Cash saga is a prime example of why the industry is so concerned. Tornado Cash, a decentralized privacy tool, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department, with implications extending to developers who contributed to its code. The DOJ’s approach in this case has been interpreted by many as equating software code with money transmission itself. This is a dangerous precedent, according to industry experts, as it could criminalize the very act of writing and sharing open-source code. What are the Potential Ramifications of Vague DOJ Money Transmitter Rules? The consequences of the DOJ’s broad interpretation of DOJ money transmitter rules could be far-reaching and detrimental to the U.S. crypto industry. Let’s consider some potential outcomes: Ramification Description Innovation Stifled Fear of prosecution could discourage developers from building and deploying innovative DeFi applications and non-custodial tools within the U.S. Brain Drain Crypto talent and businesses may relocate to countries with clearer and more favorable regulatory frameworks, diminishing the U.S.’s position in the global crypto landscape. Reduced Competitiveness U.S.-based crypto firms could become less competitive compared to their international counterparts operating in more innovation-friendly environments. Hindered DeFi Growth The development and adoption of DeFi, a sector with immense potential for financial inclusion and innovation, could be significantly hampered. The Call for Action: Seeking Legislative Solutions for Legal Clarity The crypto industry’s plea is clear: they need Congress to step in and provide legal clarity . This isn’t just about protecting crypto firms ; it’s about fostering innovation, ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in technological advancement, and allowing the responsible growth of the digital asset ecosystem. The letter to Congress is a proactive step, urging lawmakers to: Clarify Legislative Intent: Explicitly define the scope of Section 1960 to ensure it doesn’t inadvertently target software developers and non-custodial technology providers. Reinforce FinCEN’s Role: Reaffirm FinCEN as the primary regulatory authority for money transmission within the crypto space, ensuring a consistent and expert-led approach. Promote Innovation-Friendly Regulation: Develop a regulatory framework that balances consumer protection and compliance with the need to encourage innovation and technological progress in the crypto sector. What’s Next? The Path to Regulatory Certainty for Crypto and DeFi The coming months will be crucial. Will Congress heed the call from crypto firms and take action to provide the necessary legal clarity ? The response will not only shape the future of the U.S. crypto industry but also send a powerful message about the nation’s commitment to innovation and technological leadership. The industry is watching closely, hoping for a positive resolution that fosters growth and ensures the U.S. remains at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. The demand for DOJ money transmitter rules clarification is not just about compliance; it’s about creating an environment where innovation can flourish, where developers feel safe to build, and where the U.S. can harness the transformative potential of crypto and DeFi.

Bitcoin Accumulation Rises Among Whales In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a notable increase in BTC whale activity. He shared the following chart showing that 48 new wallets now hold 100 or more BTC. A surge in whale accumulation often signals rising confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The leading digital asset has climbed over 15% from its March 10 low of approximately $76,600. As of writing, BTC is trading in the high $80,000s. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surge Fueled by $32B in Open Interest—Here’s What Could Happen Next Renewed optimism around BTC’s price trajectory stems from several recent macroeconomic developments, including cooler than expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data for February and reports of US President Donald Trump adopting a softer stance on retaliatory tariffs scheduled to go into effect from April 2. On-chain intelligence firm Arkham reported long-dormant BTC whales becoming active again. In an X post, the firm highlighted how a wallet that held $3 million worth of BTC in 2017, recently became active after 8 years, with its holdings now valued at close to $250 million. Fellow crypto analyst Crypto Rover shared the following chart, illustrating a sharp rise in whale accumulation since late 2024. It is worth noting that the data excludes wallets tied to non-US exchanges and US Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Is BTC Eyeing A New Record High? Several crypto analysts believe BTC may have already bottomed out this cycle and entered a new bullish phase, potentially setting the stage for a fresh all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Pattern Returns – Is A Massive Uptrend Imminent? Noted crypto entrepreneur and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently suggested that BTC ‘probably’ hit this cycle’s bottom during the March 10 dip to $76,600. Hayes added that while bottom may be in for BTC, stocks could still face further downside. Momentum indicators – such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – also appear bullish. Bitcoin’s daily RSI recently broke out of a multi-month downtrend, fuelling hopes of sustained upward momentum. Additionally, Martinez projected that BTC could surge to $112,000 if it decisively breaks the $94,000 resistance level. However, a drop below $76,000 could open the door to a deeper decline, potentially falling to $58,000. Moreover, in their latest investor memo, digital asset management firm Bitwise hinted that on a risk-adjusted basis, now could be an opportune time to buy BTC. As of press time, BTC is trading at $88,069, up 1% in the last 24 hours.

42456727,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143655,1743042646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Leak: Chinese AI Censorship Machine Exposed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chinese-ai-censorship-machine-exposed/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and digital freedom, the specter of censorship looms large. Imagine a world where even the subtlest dissent is flagged, where algorithms decide what you can and cannot see. This isn’t a dystopian fantasy; it’s the reality emerging from a massive data leak exposing China’s sophisticated AI Censorship Machine . Bitcoin World’s exclusive investigation reveals how China is supercharging its censorship capabilities using advanced AI, raising profound questions about digital rights and the future of online freedom globally. Are we on the brink of a new era of AI-powered authoritarianism? Let’s dive into the shocking details. Unveiling the Chinese AI Censorship Machine: A Data Leak Revelation A recently leaked database, uncovered by security researcher NetAskari and analyzed by Bitcoin World, paints a chilling picture of China’s escalating efforts to control online narratives. This isn’t just about blocking keywords like ‘Tiananmen Square’; it’s a leap into a new era of AI powered censorship . The data exposes a system trained on a staggering 133,000 examples of content deemed ‘sensitive’ by the Chinese government. What kind of content triggers these alarms? Social Unrest Indicators: Complaints about poverty, corruption, and labor disputes are flagged as ‘highest priority’. Political Satire: Even subtle jokes or historical analogies targeting current political figures are instantly flagged. Taiwan and Military Matters: Any mention of Taiwan politics, military movements, or weaponry is heavily scrutinized. Public Protests Triggers: Issues like pollution and food safety scandals, known to spark public demonstrations, are closely monitored. This isn’t just keyword filtering; this is a sophisticated LLM censorship China system designed to understand context and nuance, making it far more effective than traditional methods. Xiao Qiang, a UC Berkeley researcher specializing in Chinese censorship, confirms this, stating it’s “clear evidence” of the Chinese government using LLMs to enhance repression. He emphasizes the increased “efficiency and granularity of state-led information control” compared to human-labor-intensive methods. How Does This AI Censorship Machine Work? The leaked data reveals a system eerily similar to prompting ChatGPT. It tasks an unnamed Large Language Model (LLM) to assess content for sensitivity related to ‘politics, social life, and the military.’ Content deemed sensitive is flagged as ‘highest priority.’ The system’s creators are clearly leveraging the power of AI to automate and refine censorship at an unprecedented scale. Key Features of the AI Censorship System: Feature Description LLM Powered Utilizes a Large Language Model for content analysis, moving beyond simple keyword filtering. Extensive Training Data Trained on 133,000 examples of ‘sensitive’ content, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Prioritization Ranks flagged content by priority, focusing on ‘highest priority’ items for immediate action. Proactive Detection Aims to detect subtle dissent and nuanced criticism, not just blatant violations. The system’s goal, according to the data, is for ‘public opinion work’ – a term experts identify as Chinese government jargon for censorship and propaganda. Michael Caster from Article 19 explains this ‘public opinion work’ is managed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), with the aim of enforcing government narratives online and eliminating dissenting voices. President Xi Jinping himself has called the internet the “frontline” of this ‘public opinion work.’ Examples of Censored Content: Glimpse into the Database Bitcoin World analyzed representative samples from the 133,000 data points, revealing the breadth of content targeted by this Chinese AI Censorship system. These examples provide a stark look at what the Chinese government deems unacceptable for public consumption: Rural Poverty: Posts lamenting the decline of rural Chinese towns and the struggles of remaining residents. Local Corruption: Complaints from business owners about police extortion and corruption. CCP Corruption: News reports about Communist Party officials expelled for corruption and ‘superstitions’. Taiwan Military Analysis: Commentary on Taiwan’s military capabilities and Chinese military developments. Subtle Political Criticism: Anecdotes using idioms to indirectly criticize power dynamics and political transitions. The sheer volume of mentions of ‘Taiwan’ (台湾) – over 15,000 times – highlights the extreme sensitivity surrounding this topic. Even subtle forms of dissent, like using idioms to comment on power transitions, are targeted, demonstrating the system’s sophistication and reach. The Broader Implications: AI Censorship Globally This leak isn’t just about China. It’s a warning sign for digital freedom worldwide. The adoption of AI Censorship Machine technology by authoritarian regimes is accelerating. OpenAI itself reported catching Chinese entities using LLMs to track and smear dissidents. This trend signifies a dangerous shift towards more efficient and pervasive digital repression. Key Takeaways: Escalating AI Repression: Authoritarian governments are rapidly adopting AI to enhance censorship and surveillance. Beyond Keyword Blocking: AI-powered censorship is far more sophisticated, capable of understanding context and nuance. Global Implications: This technology could be exported and adopted by other regimes, further shrinking digital freedom. Urgent Need for Scrutiny: We must critically examine the ethical and human rights implications of AI-driven censorship. The Future of Digital Freedom: Fighting Back Against AI Censorship As China AI Surveillance capabilities grow, so too must our vigilance and efforts to protect digital freedom. Understanding how these AI censorship systems operate is the first step. Supporting organizations that fight for online freedom and privacy is crucial. The fight for a free and open internet is becoming increasingly complex, but it’s a fight we cannot afford to lose. This data leak serves as a stark reminder: the battle for online freedom is ongoing, and the stakes are higher than ever. The rise of AI-powered censorship demands our attention, our action, and our unwavering commitment to a free and open digital world.

Aljarrah and Farina pointed to rising credit card defaults, tightening lending standards, and increasing living costs as indicators of a weakening financial system. Aljarrah highlighted a trend among the wealthy, moving capital into tangible assets such as gold, silver, and natural resources. He argued that fiat currencies are deliberately devalued, forcing individuals to liquidate assets. The Role of Blockchain in the New Financial System They examined the relationship between stablecoins and CBDCs, proposing a future where a two-tier banking system incorporates asset-backed digital currencies pegged to real-world commodities. They emphasized the importance of XRP and XLM in this two-tier monetary system , referencing documents from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding trust bridges , which could play a role in this transition. According to them, the existing system collapses while a new digital framework is being constructed. Digital assets like XRP and XLM, including gold and silver, will play critical roles in this transition. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This comes just a day after the company revealed its Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Gamestop To Raise $1.3B Through Convertible Notes The company plans to issue $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes, targeting qualified institutional buyers, with a five-year maturity. It also granted the initial purchasers a 13-day option to buy up to an additional $200 million in notes, bringing the potential total raise to $1.5 billion. The notes will carry a 0% coupon and will mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier. GameStop plans to use the funds raised from the offering for general corporate purposes, including buying bitcoin in line with its Investment Policy. GME Follows MSTR’s Strategy With this move, GameStop joins companies like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), Semler Scientific (SMLR), Marathon Digital (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT), which have also issued convertible debt to fund bitcoin purchases. Michael Saylor initiated a poll on X, asking how much bitcoin GameStop needs to buy to gain respect from Bitcoiners. 1B at least pic.twitter.com/SBsT1b8fxZ — Alex (@AlexesNakamoto) March 26, 2025 GME Stock Dips 8% However, GameStop (GME) stock dropped over 8% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company revealed plans to raise funds for Bitcoin. This follows a 12% surge in GameStop shares just a day earlier when the company announced that its board had unanimously approved adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserve assets. Concerns about potential share dilution could have led to the drop. However, like MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy boosted MSTR, GameStop’s move could drive long-term growth for its stock. Bitcoin has bounced back from its earlier lows, rising to $87,000 after briefly dipping to $86,000. GameStop’s planned Bitcoin investment follows reports from CNBC a month earlier that the company was exploring cryptocurrency. The interest in crypto was further fueled by CEO Ryan Cohen’s post with MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, who holds over 447,000 Bitcoins. Wall Street Skeptical Over The Move While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin bet has boosted its stock by 84% over the past year, Wall Street remains skeptical about GameStop’s move.

The SEC’s decision not to challenge the 2023 ruling by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres brings much-needed clarity to the question of whether XRP should be classified as a security. Judge’s Ruling on XRP Sales Judge Torres had previously ruled that Ripple’s “programmatic sales” of XRP on secondary exchanges did not violate securities laws. However, the direct sale of XRP to institutional investors was found to be in violation of securities regulations. With the SEC choosing not to appeal, this ruling stands as a key precedent in the cryptocurrency space. Settlement Details: SEC Returns $75 Million As part of the settlement, the SEC has agreed to return $75 million of the $125 million fine originally imposed on Ripple by a New York judge in 2022, leaving $50 million to settle the case. Ripple’s Future Sales to Institutional Investors Amid the excitement, one user on X (formerly Twitter) commented that the lifting of the SEC’s injunction would now allow Ripple to sell directly to institutional investors. The user said that while Ripple would still need to adhere to securities laws, it would no longer be required to go through over-the-counter (OTC) desks and could sell directly to entities like hedge funds or private equity firms. Clarification from Former SEC Attorney However, former SEC attorney Marc Fagel clarified that while the injunction is lifted, the original ruling that Ripple’s sales to institutional investors violated the law still stands. I haven't gone back to revisit the order. But to the extent any future sales are sold in similar fashion as the institutional sales described in the order, they would continue to pose problems under Section 5 (at least if the SEC were still invested in the case). — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 25, 2025 Fagel explained that while the SEC will no longer pursue enforcement of the case, Ripple’s sales to institutional investors may still face legal challenges under Section 5 of the Securities Act if they are conducted in a similar manner as before. Impact on Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity Product When asked about the impact on Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, Fagel responded that the ruling would likely alleviate some of the restrictions Ripple faced, particularly regarding how it could sell XRP. However, he warned that if Ripple were to resume sales in the same manner as those deemed illegal, it could still face legal issues, though the SEC would no longer actively pursue enforcement.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 02:55:14

Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence said in a March 26 post to X that the trader attempted to manipulate the system to profit from price movements, withdrawing collateral before Hyperliquid’s liquidation system could catch up. The trader opened three accounts within five minutes of each other, two with $2.15 million and $1.9 million long positions, and the third a $4.1 million short, to cancel out the long positions , according to Arkham in a post-mortem report. “This allowed him to build up leverage in an attempt to drain funds from Hyperliquid,” Arkham said. Source: Arkham When the price of Jelly pumped by over 400%, the $4 million short position entered liquidation, but the open short didn’t liquidate immediately because it was too large and instead passed to the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP), which is supposed to liquidate the position. At the same time, the trader withdrew collateral from the other two accounts while having a “7-figure positive PnL to withdraw from,” Arkham said. However, the “exploiter” quickly hit a wall when the accounts, which still had millions in unrealized profit and loss, were restricted to reduce-only orders, forcing them to sell the tokens in the first account on the market to recoup some of the funds. Source: Arkham Hyperliquid eventually closed the Jelly token market at a price of 0.0095, the same price as the trader’s short trade, which “zeroed out all floating PnL on the first two exploiter accounts.” In total, Arkham says the trader withdrew $6.26 million, but at least $1 million is still in the accounts. “Assuming he can withdraw this at some point in the future, his actions on Hyperliquid have cost him a total of $4,000. If he is unable to, he faces a loss of almost $1 million,” the blockchain analytics firm said. Hyperliquid has since delisted perpetual futures tied to the JELLY token , citing evidence of suspicious market activity. Other traders have been using similar tactics This isn’t the first time Hyperliquid has had issues like this. On March 14, Hyperliquid increased margin requirements for traders after its liquidity pool lost millions of dollars during a massive Ether ( ETH ) liquidation.

F. Sharapov Russian Economic Society and a Doctor of Economics. Russian Economist: Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Talk ‘Like Laying Landmines’ Katasonov said he was concerned about the need for Russia “to take a cautious approach” to the idea of “creating a crypto reserve.” Valentin Katasonov, the Chairman of the S. F. Sharapov Russian Economic Society. (Source: Ministerstvo Idey/YouTube/Screenshot) The economist used an allegory to explain his point of view, equating creating a national crypto reserve to “laying landmines” in Russia. Katasonov claimed that cryptoassets were “not fully fledged” forms of “money,” but “rather speculative tools that can pose threats to the economy.” “[Talk about creating strategic crypto reserves] is way of inflating bubbles. If the bubble bursts, everything will be fine as long as the economy holds up. But, regardless, there will still be many victims.” Katasonov Stores selling Russian products have spread across China, and now Moscow is seizing on the interest with a plan for a major expansion of its own https://t.co/QYYmkpu6rv — Bloomberg (@business) March 26, 2025 Economist: ‘Russian Crypto Advocates Are Fifth Columnists’ Katasonov hit out at crypto advocates who call for the “introduction of tokens” into “the official economic system.” He called them “fifth columnists,” and suggested they intended to “undermine the country’s economic security.” A Central Bank office building in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Dzasohovich [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The economist also cast doubt on other countries’ plans to launch strategic Bitcoin reserves. He noted that “while some countries, such as the United States, are considering creating Bitcoin (BTC) reserves,” the process was “still far from practical implementation.” Katasonov concluded that “no country” in the world has yet “had a successful experience launching official crypto reserves.” Some critics may point to the example of El Salvador, whose government embarked on a bullish program of Bitcoin buying in 2021. However, in recent months, the question of El Salvador’s BTC-purchasing has come under the spotlight of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which disaproves of the nation’s Bitcoin pivot.

Think again! Recent data has revealed a surprising reality: the vast majority of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading actually happens outside of U.S. borders. Let’s dive into this eye-opening data and explore why the global stage is stealing the spotlight when it comes to crypto. The Shocking Numbers: US Exchanges Play a Smaller Role Than You Think According to a recent report from Unfolded, powered by data from Kaiko, the numbers are quite stark. Only a small fraction of global Ethereum trading and Bitcoin trading volume originates from exchanges based in the United States. Specifically: Ethereum (ETH) Trading: A mere 8.6% of global ETH trading volume occurs on U.S. exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) Trading: Slightly higher, but still surprisingly low, at 11.5% of global BTC trading volume on U.S. platforms. These figures paint a clear picture: the crypto market is truly global, and the lion’s share of activity is happening elsewhere. But where exactly, and why is this the case? Where is the Real Crypto Action Happening? Exploring Global Markets If the U.S. isn’t the primary hub for crypto exchanges , then where is all the trading volume concentrated? The data suggests a much more distributed landscape, with significant activity in regions like: Asia: Exchanges in Asia, particularly in countries like South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong, have historically been major players in the crypto space. Their early adoption and large tech-savvy populations contribute to substantial trading volumes. Europe: European exchanges are also gaining prominence, with regions like Eastern Europe and countries with favorable crypto regulations attracting significant trading activity. Emerging Markets: Countries in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia are increasingly embracing cryptocurrencies as alternative financial tools, leading to growing trading volumes in these regions. This global distribution highlights the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency market itself. Unlike traditional finance, which is often centered around major financial hubs like New York or London, crypto operates on a worldwide stage. Why Are US Exchanges Losing Ground in Crypto Trading? Several factors contribute to the relatively smaller share of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading volume on US exchanges . Let’s break down some key reasons: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States remains somewhat unclear and fragmented. This uncertainty can create hurdles for crypto exchanges operating in the US, potentially driving some trading activity to more favorably regulated jurisdictions. Stringent Compliance Requirements: U.S. regulations are known to be rigorous, requiring significant compliance efforts and costs for crypto exchanges . These stringent requirements can make it more challenging and expensive to operate in the U.S. compared to some other regions. Global Crypto Adoption: Cryptocurrency adoption is a global phenomenon. Many regions outside the U.S. have seen rapid crypto adoption, driven by factors like limited access to traditional banking, high inflation, and a desire for alternative financial systems. This organic growth in global adoption naturally leads to higher trading volumes outside of the US. Competition from International Exchanges: International crypto exchanges have become increasingly sophisticated and competitive, offering a wide range of services and often lower fees. This intense global competition can draw trading volume away from US-based platforms. Benefits of a Globally Distributed Crypto Market While the smaller share of US exchange volume might seem surprising, a globally distributed crypto exchanges market actually offers several benefits: Increased Resilience: Decentralization is a core tenet of crypto. A globally distributed trading market reduces reliance on any single jurisdiction, making the overall crypto ecosystem more resilient to regional regulatory changes or economic shocks. Wider Access to Crypto: With trading activity spread across various regions, individuals around the world have greater access to cryptocurrencies. This broader accessibility promotes financial inclusion and empowers individuals globally. Innovation and Competition: Global competition among crypto exchanges fosters innovation and drives improvements in services, security, and user experience. This competitive environment ultimately benefits crypto users worldwide. Reduced Regulatory Risk: Diversification across multiple jurisdictions can help mitigate regulatory risks. If one region imposes restrictive regulations, the global market can continue to function, albeit with potential shifts in trading volume. Challenges of a Globally Distributed Crypto Market Of course, a decentralized global market also presents certain challenges: Regulatory Fragmentation: The lack of harmonized global regulations can create complexities for crypto exchanges operating across multiple jurisdictions. Navigating diverse regulatory frameworks can be challenging and costly. Enforcement Issues: Cross-border enforcement of regulations and combating illicit activities in a globally distributed market can be more complex than in a centralized system. Market Fragmentation: While global distribution is beneficial, excessive fragmentation could potentially lead to liquidity issues or price discrepancies across different exchanges. However, arbitrage opportunities often help to mitigate these discrepancies. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this data, and how can you use this information? Diversify Your Exchange Usage: Don’t limit yourself to only US-based crypto exchanges . Explore reputable international platforms to potentially access a wider range of assets, features, and potentially lower fees. Stay Informed About Global Crypto Trends: Keep an eye on developments in global crypto markets , not just the US. Understanding global adoption patterns and regulatory trends can provide valuable insights into the future of crypto. Consider Regulatory Differences: Be aware of the regulatory landscape in different jurisdictions if you are trading on international crypto exchanges . Understand the compliance requirements and potential risks associated with each platform. Conclusion: The Global Crypto Revolution is Here The data is clear: the cryptocurrency market is a truly global phenomenon, with the majority of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading volume happening outside of the United States. This stunning revelation underscores the decentralized and international nature of crypto. While US exchanges remain important players, the future of crypto trading is undoubtedly global, offering both exciting opportunities and unique challenges. Embracing this global perspective is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

A flurry of factors appears to be affecting the investors’ sentiment, with recent trends and analysis indicating towards further slip ahead to about $0.6. However, despite that, experts remained bullish on the long-term trajectory of Pi Coin. Pi Network Price Slips 3%: What Lies Ahead? Pi price today was down around 3% and exchanged hands at $0.79, while its volume for the last 24 hours increased by 33% to $327 million. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour low of $0.77 from yesterday, indicating the gloomy sentiment hovering in the market. Notably, an article highlighted the key reasons behind the latest Pi price dip . Amid this, market watchers anticipate a further fall ahead, with some experts predicting a slump to even $0.6. However, despite that, the market watchers remained bullish, hinting at a potential breakout ahead. Will Pi Coin Slip To $0.6? A flurry of market experts anticipates a further dip in Pi Network price due to massive token unlocks ahead. According to PiScan data, a total of 105.96 million Pi will be unlocked over the next 30 days, worth around $85 million at the current price. The daily average unlock is around 3.5 million coins. This heavy influx could significantly dampen the investors’ sentiment. Besides, a lack of clarity from the Pi Core Team has further fueled concerns. On the other hand, the lack of major listings on leading crypto exchanges like Binance, which many were anticipating, has weighed on the sentiment. Besides, looking ahead to the next 12 months, 1.6 billion Pi Coins are set to be unlocked, with an average of 129 million per month. This trend is expected to continue until May 2028, with minimal changes. To mitigate this potential price drop, Pi enthusiasts are urging the Pi Core Team to implement measures to reduce circulation, such as burning mechanisms or smart contract features. Expert Predicts Dip To $0.6: What’s Next For Pi Network? Analyst bullstraders7 on TradingView noted that Pi Network price risks falling to $0.61 or even $0.6 in the coming days. This has further dampened the market sentiment, especially with soaring anticipation over a robust rally in Pi price. However, another expert Coinvo sees this latest dip as a buying opportunity. He said that “Pi RSI divergence” is signaling towards a “massive buy signal.” Besides, he also noted that the current “Fibonacci zone” could push the crypto to a new high ahead. Source: Coinvo, X Considering this analysis, Pi Network price could hit a new high in the coming days. However, a recent Pi Coin price prediction hints at a potential drop to $0.54 by next month. Having said that, investors should exercise due diligence before putting their bets into the market.

He made it clear that cars built within the country will not be affected, saying there’s “absolutely no tariff” for them. He signed the new trade order inside the Oval Office. According to a report from CNBC, Trump formalized the tariffs through a presidential proclamation. His longtime aide, Will Scharf, told reporters at the White House that the new rule includes foreign-made light trucks too, and stacks on top of all existing duties. “Over $100 billion of new annual revenue” is what Scharf claimed this move will generate for the U.S. Trump adds pressure on auto supply chains with parts enforcement Trump didn’t offer many specifics about how it’ll work, especially considering most vehicles today are built from thousands of individual parts sourced from several different countries. Still, he told reporters the government would launch “very strong policing” to monitor which components trigger the tariffs. That means federal agents will have to track exactly which parts are foreign and where they come from—no easy task in a system where even a single sedan might carry pieces from 20 different countries. The move instantly drew backlash from Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded within hours, saying the European Union would continue pursuing negotiations but wouldn’t roll over. “Tariffs are taxes — bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the US and the European Union,” she said in a formal statement Wednesday. As expected, the stock market didn’t sit still. After-hours trading saw shares of General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis all drop about 5%. All three companies have some manufacturing capacity outside the U.S., even though they assemble a lot of cars within it too. Trump didn’t throw them under the bus completely. He offered GM, Ford, and Stellantis a one-month exemption from the new 25% tariff—for imports from Mexico and Canada only—if their cars qualify under the rules in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. That deal replaces the old NAFTA structure and has stricter guidelines around regional production. The waiver is set to expire at the end of April. The announcement didn’t come out of nowhere. Trump already warned on Monday during a Cabinet meeting that auto tariffs were on the way. “We’ll be announcing that fairly soon over the next few days, probably, and then April 2 comes, that’ll be reciprocal tariffs,” he said earlier this week. The plan is part of what Trump calls his “reciprocal tariff” policy. It targets countries that impose high duties on U.S. goods but expect low barriers coming into the American market. Business executives say these surprise rollouts have made it impossible to plan ahead. Trump’s trade decisions change fast, and sometimes without notice. Even companies that support American manufacturing say they don’t know how to prepare anymore. Musk left out of decision, Tesla parts still vulnerable One person not involved in the decision was Elon Musk. Trump confirmed that himself Wednesday, telling reporters Musk “may have a conflict” and had “never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever.” Musk is Trump’s top advisor for federal operations, but this time he had no input. Musk’s involvement with the administration goes deeper than just advice. He donated $290 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign and currently leads the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is supposed to reduce federal spending and downsize bloated agencies. Even with that power, Musk didn’t weigh in on the car tariffs, according to Trump. That didn’t stop Tesla from getting a spotlight moment this month. Trump turned the White House’s South Lawn into a temporary Tesla display, ordering five of the company’s electric vehicles to be delivered so he could walk around and inspect them. Afterward, he posted on Truth Social that he was planning to buy one himself to “support Elon” and his companies. During the walkthrough, Trump called the designs “beautiful” and pointed at the sharp, stainless-steel Cybertruck. When asked whether Tesla would benefit from the new import penalties, Trump said the effect would likely be “net neutral or they may be good.” He pointed out that Tesla has major factories in Fremont, California and Austin, Texas, and repeated that “anybody that has plants in the United States — it’s going to be good for them.” But Tesla doesn’t build everything at home. The company recently wrote to the U.S. Trade Representative warning that “even with aggressive localization” of production, certain vehicle components are “difficult or impossible to source within the United States.” The list of imported parts includes suspension systems, brake assemblies, glass, panels, printed circuit boards, and other electrical gear. A lot of these still come from Canada, Mexico, and China. Tesla isn’t the only one with that problem, but their international parts footprint puts them in a tough spot. And while the tariffs don’t directly mention Tesla, any imported part can trigger a tax. The policing that Trump promised would mean border checks could flag individual parts even if the final car is assembled in Texas. There’s also a bigger fight happening in the electric vehicle market. More automakers are building EVs now than ever before, squeezing Tesla’s dominance. But not everyone gets to play in the American sandbox. BYD, the top electric vehicle manufacturer in China, still hasn’t been allowed to sell its cars in the U.S. With Trump in office and tariffs being thrown around like darts, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.

He drew attention to Tokentus Investment AG, a German venture capital firm actively educating its audience about XRP through detailed videos. His post contrasted the firm’s efforts with U.S. media platforms that “pretend it doesn’t exist,” fueling ongoing debates about how XRP is presented to investors globally. German financial news educating their audience on XRP while @cnbc tries to pretend it doesn't exist. We see you @SquawkCNBC @andrewrsorkin @BeckyQuick @JoeSquawk pic.twitter.com/4IsGidFT0W — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) March 24, 2025 Tokentus Investment AG’s Educational Efforts Tokentus Investment AG has consistently shared insights on XRP through its YouTube channel, covering topics ranging from regulatory status to price movements. In one of its latest videos, the firm reiterated that XRP does not classify as a security, addressing a long-standing debate that has shaped perceptions of the asset. The discussion also explored the differences between cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets, explaining that while a tokenized stock would inherently be considered a security, XRP does not fall into the same category. By clarifying these distinctions, Tokentus aims to equip investors with a clearer understanding of XRP’s role in the financial landscape. Tokentus’s Support for XRP Beyond regulatory topics, Tokentus has continually provided detailed market insights into XRP’s price trends. CEO Oliver Michel previously examined historical data to assess the asset’s growth potential. He pointed to the asset’s 4,300% surge from 2014 to 2017, suggesting that while such extreme growth is less likely this time, a significant rally remains possible. Based on historical patterns and broader market trends, he projected that the asset could rise by 2,000% , potentially reaching $8-$10. The CEO also previously discussed XRP’s role as the world reserve bridge currency , and he has big expectations for the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Media Coverage Disparities in the U.S. and Germany The community has long debated how the asset is portrayed in media, and Tokentus’s videos have reignited this conversation. Digital Asset Investor’s remarks suggested that German firms are actively educating investors about the asset, whereas major U.S. financial media outlets appear to downplay its significance. This view is shared by other community members, with some calling out Bitcoin maximalists. While this perspective continues to gain traction, it is worth noting that U.S. financial networks such as CNBC, Bloomberg, and FOX have covered the asset and related events, particularly legal battles involving Ripple and the SEC. High-profile interviews, including those with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, have been featured in mainstream media platforms like 60 Minutes , though not to the level that some supporters would like.

Yeah, the meme coin market never sleeps. Every week, something goes viral, communities get louder, and gains get crazier. But while most of the action feels like it’s already passed, there’s one rare moment when you’re early—really early. That moment is now. Right in the middle of this meme coin madness, BTFD Coin is throwing down an offer that’s tough to ignore—especially for anyone still chasing that 1000x dream. Its 90% APY staking, wild play-to-earn ecosystem, and an active Bulls Squad community are already turning heads. But the real kicker? A limited-time 2x token bonus through the LAUNCH100 code that ends March 30. It’s no wonder BTFD is turning heads as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week . Let’s break down why this presale stands out, and take a look at three other trending picks—CAT, APU, and NPC—bringing their own flavor to the meme coin scene. BTFD Coin: 2x Tokens, 90% APY, and Just One Stage Left Here’s the deal— BTFD Coin is in Stage 15, and things are heating up fast. The current price is just $0.0002, and over $6.41 million has already been raised from more than 11,600 holders. More than 72 billion tokens have been snapped up, and only one stage remains before BTFD hits exchanges at $0.0006. If you’re hunting for one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week, this is your window—because it’s closing fast. But what’s grabbing attention more than anything? Staking. At 90% APY. That’s not a typo. This isn’t your typical “stake and hope” situation either—investors are already mapping out their passive income. Let’s say you toss in $5,000 worth of BTFD at the current price of $0.0002. That nets you 25 million tokens. If you stake those tokens at 90% APY, you’re earning 22.5 million extra tokens annually. That’s real, tangible growth—especially if BTFD hits its $0.0006 listing price or the projected moon price of $0.006. At the moon price, that $5,000 could balloon into $150,000. That’s the kind of ROI that puts BTFD squarely on the map as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week. And don’t forget the limited-time LAUNCH100 bonus. Until March 30, every token you buy will be doubled—no catch. Just enter the code LAUNCH100 at checkout. So your 25 million tokens? Now they become 50 million. That’s double the stake, double the rewards, and way more room to run when BTFD gets listed. How to buy BTFD Coins? Start by setting up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Then, head to the BTFD presale page , connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 code, and complete your purchase. After the presale ends, you’ll claim your BTFD tokens—and that’s when the staking, earning, and moon-chasing really begins. This is one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week, and the window is closing fast. One more stage, one more shot. The question is—are you in? Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BTFD Coin offers a rare mix of meme culture, real utility, massive staking returns, and an epic bonus that doubles your tokens. Combine that with a moon price prediction of $0.006 and a vibrant Bulls Squad backing the movement—this isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a full-blown opportunity. Simon’s Cat (CAT): From Animated Fame to Meme Chain Fame You’ve probably seen the iconic white cat batting at everything in sight on YouTube. Simon’s Cat, the British animated sensation, has clawed its way into the crypto world with a fully licensed meme token. This isn’t just another knockoff—CAT has full IP rights and the backing of a global fanbase that’s already watched the brand rack up over 1.6 billion views online. CAT combines nostalgia, cuteness, and meme culture in one smooth purr. And because it’s based on an internationally beloved character, the community is vast and highly engaged. This coin has the kind of brand recognition that most meme tokens could only dream of—and that gives it staying power in a space filled with short-lived hype. Why did this coin make it to this list? CAT stands out because it’s not just a meme, it’s a brand with global appeal. Backed by the real creators of Simon’s Cat, this token has the meme market’s attention, plus built-in credibility. That combo makes it a solid choice in this week’s roundup. Apu Apustaja (APU): The Purest Meme on the Chain Let’s take a break from the usual chaotic meme coins and talk about something… wholesome. Apu Apustaja is the softer, more innocent cousin of Pepe—a meme that rose from imageboard origins to become a symbol of hope and sweetness in a rough digital world. And now it’s a token. APU is all about community and positive vibes. This little frog is designed to push back against toxic crypto culture and deliver something that feels human again. Instead of aggression or hype, APU thrives on humor, kindness, and inclusivity. It’s meme coin energy without the toxicity. Why did this coin make it to this list? APU makes the cut because it brings heart to the meme coin world. The community is loyal, the message is strong, and the brand is genuinely different. If you’re tired of edgelord memes and soulless pumps, APU is a refreshing shift in tone. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Where Memes Meet NFTs If there’s one meme that defines the chaotic energy of 2020s internet culture, it’s “I support the current thing.” That’s exactly where Non-Playable Coin (NPC) draws its fuel. But it goes a step further by merging ERC20 and ERC1155 standards to create something new: Meme Fungible Tokens (MFTs). Yup, that means NPCs can be traded as both tokens and NFTs. This coin is pioneering the crossover between meme investing and NFT flexibility. And because it leans so hard into social commentary, the project naturally grabs attention from creators and traders alike. It’s satirical, it’s flexible, and it’s hella tradable. Why did this coin make it to this list? NPC brings a tech-forward angle to the meme game. By blending NFT utility with viral meme aesthetics, it carves out a unique spot in the market. It’s more than a joke—it’s a hybrid of culture and code, and that deserves a spotlight. Conclusion: The Clock Is Ticking—Don’t Miss This Wave There are a lot of meme coins out there, but only one is offering 2x tokens, 90% APY staking, and a community that’s locked in for the long haul. BTFD Coin is the standout among the best meme coin presales to buy this week, and it’s racing toward launch. Just one stage remains. The presale price is still low at $0.0002—but it won’t be for long. When the listing hits at $0.0006—or the forecasted moon price of $0.006—the ROI speaks for itself. There’s only a few days left to use the LAUNCH100 code and double your token stack. Whether you’re new to crypto or hunting your next 100x, BTFD is the moment. The other meme coins—CAT, APU, and NPC—each bring their own brand of magic, but BTFD Coin is the only one giving you a chance to stack tokens and earn big before the bull run begins. Join the BTFD Coin presale now . Stake big. Earn bigger. Ride the bull. FAQs How do I use the LAUNCH100 bonus code for BTFD Coin? Go to the presale page, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps, input your amount, and complete the transaction to get 2x tokens. What makes BTFD Coin one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week? It’s the only coin offering 90% APY staking, a live play-to-earn game, a growing Bulls Squad community, and a limited 2x token bonus that ends March 30. Is staking with BTFD really 90% APY? Yes. BTFD offers a real 90% APY staking model. The earlier you stake, the more you earn. When will BTFD Coin be listed on exchanges? After the final presale stage ends. The projected listing price is $0.0006, and the moon price prediction is $0.006.

While most people are still sleeping on the wild potential of presale tokens, Cheems just exploded by 23%—sending waves across the meme market—and Sudeng (HIPPO) rolled out a jaw-dropping $1 million airdrop to energize its Telegram-based trading bot and token launchpad. The meme coin market is heating up—but not all opportunities are created equal. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Unlike high-volatility assets like CHEEMS or tokens ruled by dev drama like HIPPO, BTFD offers something rare: stability at entry, community-driven momentum, and a clear path to massive ROI. BTFD’s presale is currently in Stage 15, priced at just $0.0002, with a 100% bonus (yes, 2x tokens) available using code LAUNCH100—until March 30. With the presale heading into its final stage before launch at $0.0006, BTFD is looking like a generational chance for wealth creation through timing, conviction, and FOMO-worthy perks. Keep reading to break down how BTFD Coin could be the best new meme coin for significant returns, plus a look at CHEEMS and Sudeng’s big moves this week. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Can This Referral Program Turn You Into a Crypto Magnet? Why are savvy traders ditching short-term pumps and throwing $2,000 or more into a meme coin presale? Because BTFD Coin isn’t just a project—it’s a movement. This Ethereum-based token launched its P2E game on January 1, 2025, and has been gaining unstoppable traction ever since. Right now, we’re in Stage 15 of the presale, and here’s what’s wild: BTFD started at just $0.000004, and today it’s $0.0002. At launch, it’ll list for $0.0006. That’s a 200% return baked in. But if the price hits the projected moon target of $0.006, we’re talking a massive 2900% ROI. Now imagine this: You invest $2,000 today in Stage 15 using the LAUNCH100 bonus code. You’d snag 10 million $BTFD tokens at $0.0002—and get another 10 million FREE. That’s 20 million tokens total. If BTFD hits just $0.0006, you walk away with $12,000. If it hits $0.006? That’s a life-changing $120,000 from just $2K. That’s not hopium. That’s math. But that’s not the only juicy piece. BTFD’s referral program is making waves. Share your unique referral code after connecting your wallet on the official BTFD site , and when someone buys $50 or more, they get 10% extra tokens, and you could bank 10% of their purchase amount—if you make it to the top 20 leaderboard. That’s passive earning with every bullish friend you onboard. Let’s talk staking. The platform offers 90% APY to token holders, meaning your holdings don’t just sit—they grow. Want to multiply your 20M tokens even more? Stake and double down. And don’t forget the live P2E game. This isn’t just fluff—it’s a fully immersive play-to-earn experience tied directly to the $BTFD ecosystem, giving you even more ways to earn while you play. Oh, and here’s a reminder: Last Chance for 2X Tokens with LAUNCH100 – Ends March 30! Snag double the $BTFD during Stage 15 when you use code LAUNCH100—but don’t sleep on it. The 100% bonus deal vanishes on March 30. Grab it now or regret it later!

Twice the tokens. And the shot at 29x returns if $BTFD hits $0.006. That’s what being early looks like in this game. With over 72 billion coins sold, $6.41 million raised, and 11,600+ holders, the BTFD community (aka the “Bulls Squad”) is showing up and showing out. If you’re sleeping on this meme coin presale , you’re missing the kind of alpha that only comes once every few market cycles. Cheems (CHEEMS) – 23% Rally Has Traders Barking Again Cheems just clawed its way back onto the leaderboard with a 23% gain in 24 hours, jumping to a market cap of $393K. The coin, inspired by the iconic Shiba Inu meme, saw a volume surge as traders responded to its comeback and nostalgic appeal. Although it’s still far from its $345 million rally high, the contract renouncement, zero taxes, and BNB Chain migration show it’s got strong community roots. While volatile, CHEEMS proves meme power never really dies—it just needs the right spark. Sudeng (HIPPO) – Airdrops, Bots, and Big Ambitions Sudeng (HIPPO) is doing something few others dare: launching a $1 million HIPPO token airdrop in partnership with MemeFi. Built on the Sui network, the HIPPO coin gained fresh momentum after the community took over when the dev stepped down. Now with the HIPPObot Telegram trading assistant and HipHop fun meme coin launcher, Sudeng is rebranding itself as a Sui-native meme hub. The token is trading at around $0.004278, and volume is heating up fast at $21.5 million. HIPPO’s community-first energy is refreshing, but like all meme coins, it’s a bumpy ride. Conclusion: Missed SHIB or DOGE? This Is Your Shot at 2900% ROI Based on current presale data, community activity, and tokenomics, BTFD Coin is hands-down one of the best new meme coins for significant returns. While CHEEMS barks back and HIPPO throws a hefty airdrop, BTFD is playing the long game—with staking, P2E gaming, and a referral program built to grow your bags before the token even hits exchanges. The clock is ticking. Stage 15 won’t last long, and March 30 is your last day to claim the 100% LAUNCH100 bonus . If you believe in smart entries, wild exits, and building wealth before the next bull cycle, BTFD or get left behind. Join the BTFD Coin presale today before this door slams shut.

According to data from blockchain analytics firm Parsec, the latest outflows happened within hours of the JELLY liquidation event, echoing a similar $300 million outflows seen during a previous Bitcoin ( BTC ) whale liquidation event. As a result, Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) USDC reserves have fallen from a high of $2.58 billion to $2.02 billion over the past 30 days. Hyperliquid USDC outflows/inflows. Credit: Parsec The JELLY controversy began when Hyperliquid’s treasury assumed a $5 million short position in JELLY. As the token’s price unexpectedly spiked, the unrealized loss grew to $10.63 million. If JELLY had reached $0.17, Hyperliquid’s treasury faced a potential $240 million loss. The price spike appears to have been manipulated. An address identified as 0xde95 opened a massive 430 million JELLY short position on HyperliquidX, only to remove its margin shortly after. This action led to a series of liquidations, with the losses being absorbed by Hyperliquid’s treasury. Another wallet, 0x20e8, opened a long position in JELLY at the same time, which caused the price to rise even more.

Four roles on BlackRock’s digital asset team were added to its website on Wednesday, including Director of Digital Assets, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Vice President for Digital Asset and ETF Legal Counsel and Associate for Digital Asset. According to the job description, three of the roles are based in New York and another one in Atlanta. The descriptions have otherwise been kept fairly broad and don’t give away any clues regarding what BlackRock might be looking to work on in the future. For the role of the legal counsel, the company is seeking somebody who can help with future crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. BlackRock has so far issued two spot ETF products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Other issuers have applied to launch funds for several other crypto assets, including Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC). BlackRock has not announced any plans to do the same. The asset manager is also strongly focused on tokenization, a sector in which it has quickly become a leading force. The firm’s tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has drawn in $1.7 billion since its introduction in 2023, making it by far the largest tokenized fund on the market currently.",Finance|Wall Street|BlackRock,EN,0,0,REGULATION|LTC|MARKET|SOL|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-27 03:19:34

According to the official announcement on Mar. 26, The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, which will oversee the launch, has partnered with LayerZero ( ZRO ) to develop and distribute the token. At the DC Blockchain Summit, Wyoming’s governer Mark Gordon and commission executive director Anthony Apollo revealed that WYST has entered its testing phase. The state-issued stablecoin has been deployed on testnets for Avalanche ( AVAX ), Solana ( SOL ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and more blockchains. These test tokens have no real value yet, but they help ensure the system works properly before the official launch. WYST will be fully backed by cash and U.S. Treasury securities to ensure stability. Interest from these reserves will be transferred to Wyoming’s school foundation fund to ensure that the stablecoin benefits the state. To ensure it maintains its value, WYST will have more reserves than the total number of tokens issued since it will be overcollateralized.

This lowers security risks by enabling users to move WYST between networks without depending on centralized bridges. A recent test transaction showed WYST moving between Ethereum and Avalanche using Stargate, a LayerZero-powered bridge. However, any compatible interface will be able to support WYST’s transfers. Wyoming lawmakers have been working on the stablecoin since passing the Wyoming Stable Token Act in March 2023. The commission will continue refining WYST’s smart contracts and risk management framework. If testing goes as planned, the stablecoin could launch as early as July 2025.

Bitwise Breaks Down the Possibilities,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-2030-29-32-or-0-13-bitwise-breaks-down-the-possibilities/,"The post XRP Price News: $29.32 or $0.13? Bitwise Breaks Down the Possibilities appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Despite the recent victory in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, XRP’s price hasn’t seen much movement. The 3-day chart still shows a clear bearish trend, with the token stuck in a pattern that suggests no major bullish momentum is expected in the near future. On the resistance side, XRP is facing short-term resistance at around $2.50 and $2.56. If the price manages to break above these levels, there is further resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. Sideways Movement Continues for XRP For the time being, XRP’s price action remains largely neutral, bouncing between support and resistance levels. There is a lack of strong directional momentum, with both short-term bullish and bearish price movements occurring intermittently. This sideways price range is expected to continue unless a significant breakout or breakdown occurs. Short-Term Pullback and Potential Support Levels Looking at the shorter 8-hour time frame, XRP is currently experiencing a pullback. This could potentially lead to a test of support levels between $2.24 and $2.30. If the price breaks below this area with confirmation, the next significant support zone would be between $1.95 and $2.05. Bitwise’s Price Prediction for XRP by 2030 Bitwise, a cryptocurrency fund manager, believes XRP could reach $29.32 by 2030 if it captures a large share of the payments and tokenization markets, greatly increasing its value. XRP’s market cap could grow to $2.9 trillion, more than Microsoft’s. In a “bull” scenario, XRP could reach $12.70 by 2030 if it grows steadily, although it may face challenges in payments and tokenization. On the other hand, if XRP struggles to gain traction and institutional support fades, its price could drop to just $0.13 in the worst-case “bear” scenario.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 03:23:30

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,050 resistance. Ethereum corrected lower and tested the $1,980 support level. The price is trading below $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,050 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,050 and $2,100 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and corrected some gains, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,020 and $2,000 support levels. It tested the $1,980 zone. A low was formed at $1,982 and the price is again rising . There was a move above the $2,000 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,097 swing high to the $1,982 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,050 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,040 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,097 swing high to the $1,982 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,100 level. A clear move above the $2,100 resistance might send the price toward the $2,150 resistance. An upside break above the $2,150 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,250 resistance zone or even $2,320 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,050 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,000 level. The first major support sits near the $1,980 zone. A clear move below the $1,980 support might push the price toward the $1,920 support and the trend line. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,880 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,810.

The XRP Price Surge has sparked new excitement, raising hopes for a break above $3. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are gathering momentum, with staking emerging as a key force behind ETH’s potential rebound. As these two established assets ride waves of optimism, BlockDAG (BDAG) is quietly stealing the spotlight. Nearing the final days of its historic presale, BlockDAG has already raised $206.5 million, selling 18.8 billion BDAG coins. With its Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings coming in 2025, BDAG’s projected $1 price target positions it as one of the best long term crypto options available today. XRP Price Surge Reaches 7%: Is a Break Above $3 Within Reach? The latest XRP Price Surge has caught traders’ attention. After climbing 7%, XRP is now valued at $2.25, triggering speculation about whether it can challenge the $3 mark. After bouncing off a solid support level at $2.10, XRP is gaining strength. Analysts are watching resistance zones at $2.40 and $2.60—critical thresholds that could open the door for further gains. If XRP breaks through these resistance points, this XRP Price Surge could be a key moment in the coin’s trajectory. Some traders believe this move could lead to a longer-term uptrend, but others remain cautious as technical hurdles remain. Ethereum ETFs Gain Attention as Staking Becomes a Major Price Catalyst Ethereum ETFs are drawing more interest, but it’s the growing importance of staking that’s really standing out. Recent analysis suggests staking rewards could have a bigger impact on Ethereum’s price than the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade. As more participants lock up ETH for staking, the reduced circulating supply may strengthen the token’s price fundamentals. Currently, Ethereum trades at around $1,860. With staking participation rising steadily, Ethereum ETFs are poised to attract increased institutional involvement. The combination of staking and ETF demand is boosting confidence in ETH’s potential recovery. As these factors gain traction, Ethereum ETFs and staking are both becoming pivotal drivers of ETH’s price direction. BlockDAG Presale Surpasses $206.5M as Mainnet & CEX Listings Draw Near Crypto presales often set the tone for a project’s long-term success. BlockDAG’s presale is proving to be no exception. So far, it has pulled in more than $206.5 million and sold 18.8 billion BDAG coins, ranking among the largest presales in recent history. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, BDAG’s price has climbed to $0.0248 in Batch 27—closing in on its $600 million goal. But what’s coming next for BlockDAG? The focus is shifting toward utility and adoption. BlockDAG’s Mainnet launch in 2025 will mark a major step, transitioning the project from presale momentum to live blockchain operations. Alongside the Mainnet release, BlockDAG has announced 10 major centralized exchange (CEX) listings, which are expected to bring a wave of new liquidity and wider access for traders worldwide. In addition, BlockDAG is expanding its developer community through its partnership with HackerEarth. Already, over 200 dApps are being built on the platform, ranging from DeFi and NFTs to Web3 solutions. This growth is fueling BlockDAG’s evolving ecosystem, which is adding real value to BDAG tokens as demand increases. With each batch of the presale, BDAG’s price continues to rise, reinforcing predictions of a $1 valuation in 2025. As the remaining supply of BDAG runs low, early adopters are securing their positions before the window closes. Those who entered earlier have already seen a 2,380% ROI, and projections show Batch 27 buyers could earn a 3,932% return if the $1 target is reached. Quick Recap The 7% XRP Price Surge has sparked hope for a move past $3, with resistance points at $2.40 and $2.60 under close watch. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are gaining momentum, with staking now viewed as a key driver of ETH’s future price. Both assets face important crossroads as investors monitor their next moves. At the same time, BlockDAG’s presale continues to build speed. With $206.5M raised and 18.8 billion BDAG sold, the project is racing toward its next phase. The Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings in 2025 could propel BDAG to its forecasted $1 valuation. Those joining before Batch 27 closes could see returns of up to 3,932%, cementing BlockDAG as the best long term crypto opportunity on the market right now.

While virality remains part of the appeal, investors are beginning to prioritize fundamentals. The focus is shifting from short-lived hype to tokens with lasting value, stronger mechanics, and community-driven ecosystems. Projects that balance cultural relevance with real utility are gaining traction. In this changing landscape, four tokens have started making a case for themselves: MIND of Pepe, Meme Index (MEMEX), Cheems, and Dragoin. Each one brings something distinct—but Dragoin is emerging as a standout by integrating entertainment, scarcity, and decentralization into a scalable ecosystem. 1. MIND of Pepe: Combining AI Tools with Meme Power MIND of Pepe sets itself apart by merging meme culture with artificial intelligence. Backed by over $7.5 million raised, the project uses an AI engine that analyzes market trends, helps with trading decisions, and offers predictive insights. Token holders gain exclusive access to these tools, along with early opportunities that non-holders can’t tap into. Rather than leaning on memes alone, MIND of Pepe builds on practical value. This combination of humor and functionality gives it an edge. As a result, it’s positioned as more than just a fun token—it’s one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025 for those who want both entertainment and intelligent investing. 2. MEMEX: Making Meme Investing Easier Through Indexing Meme Index (MEMEX) addresses a growing issue—too many choices. With new meme coins launching every week, keeping up is tough. MEMEX simplifies the process by offering a token that tracks a curated basket of top meme coins. It automatically adjusts based on market performance, giving investors diversified exposure without constant monitoring. MEMEX introduces a data-driven approach to a space often dominated by unpredictability. By focusing on structure and risk management, it transforms how meme coin investing is approached. For investors seeking efficient entry into this niche, MEMEX brings a fresh, organized strategy to the mix. 3. Cheems: Classic Meme, Clear Mission Cheems brings a familiar face and a unique purpose. Inspired by the original “Cheems” meme, the token supports charities by donating a portion of its transaction fees. This built-in charitable element adds a new dimension to its appeal. Community transparency and consistent activity have helped Cheems remain visible across several market cycles. Its long-term relevance lies in its values. By tying meme culture to social good, Cheems delivers more than humor—it delivers impact. In a time when investors are more selective, this dual-purpose model could give it a lasting place among the Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025. 4. Dragoin: A Meme Coin Designed for Sustainability Dragoin ($DDGN) is challenging the meme coin model by building a full-featured ecosystem from the ground up. Built on Ethereum, the project revolves around a play-to-earn game hosted on Telegram, where users train digital dragons and earn $DDGN tokens by competing. It connects activity with earnings, making token ownership engaging and rewarding. Beyond gameplay, Dragoin’s economic model shows strong planning. Out of its 200 billion total supply, 50% is allocated to a 25-stage presale. Each stage increases the token’s price, encouraging early investment. Unsold tokens will be permanently burned, reducing supply and boosting scarcity. The team’s decision to fully renounce ownership of the smart contract post-presale adds a decentralization layer rarely seen in meme coins. This structure builds long-term trust in the project. Dragoin’s roadmap is equally forward-focused. Q2 2025 includes the full game launch, staking tools, and partnerships with key influencers. Q3 will bring listings on major exchanges and additional in-game enhancements. With referral rewards, airdrops, and active social engagement already in place, the project is gaining momentum. What Dragoin represents is a shift. It’s not just about short-term gains—it’s about creating a self-sustaining, community-owned platform. That’s why for many investors watching the market evolve, Dragoin isn’t just an option—it’s leading the list of Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025 .

Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) and Henry (@LordOfAlts), are pointing to what they believe is a major technical setup on the Dogecoin (DOGE) price chart—potentially heralding a sizable breakout. This Price Level Is Crucial For Dogecoin Early today, Rekt Capital shared a weekly DOGE/USDT chart highlighting key price levels at $0.159, $0.204, and most critically $0.22. According to the analyst, Dogecoin’s trajectory now hinges on whether it can “reclaim and/or Weekly Close above $0.22”—a level he refers to as a green zone of Pre-Halving highs on his chart. Rekt Capital suggests that the recent dip below $0.22 could represent a mere “downside deviation,” meaning any breach under that threshold might have been temporary if price action stabilizes above $0.22 in the near future. The candlesticks near $0.20 and $0.22 exhibit notable wicks, indicative of high volatility. Rekt Capital interprets these as part of a “very volatile retest” of the price region around March highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is ‘All Going To Plan,’ Says Crypto Analyst From a technical standpoint, the $0.22 area seems to act as a pivot. Should Dogecoin close a weekly candle above that boundary, it would increase the likelihood that buyers are regaining control, potentially setting the stage for a move toward higher resistance levels—such as the $0.28 and $0.338 region, identified by two horizontal green lines on Rekt Capital’s chart. DOGE Breakout Already Confirmed? Meanwhile, analyst Henry (@LordOfAlts) points to a multi-month falling wedge formation stretching from late 2024 through the first quarter of 2025. Henry notes that this pattern bears resemblance to Dogecoin’s descending wedge in 2024, which eventually led to a breakout and a significant price surge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Mirroring This 2017 Pattern Suggests That A Rise To $4 Could Happen On Henry’s chart, DOGE had been consolidating between two downward-sloping trendlines for several months. The upper trendline connects lower highs since the coin’s peak above $0.48, while the lower boundary captures a sequence of descending lows. Henry’s analysis draws a parallel between the current wedge and a similar structure that resolved in a 365% surge which started in October 2024. Over the past few days, Dogecoin broke out of the falling wedge pattern again, possibly setting the stage for another steep rise. Although Henry does not guarantee specific targets, he remarks that last time “Last time it did a similar thing was in Sep 24. 50¢ next, then $1.00,” concluding with a succinct instruction to “Trust the cycle.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19583.

A new stablecoin bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives, building on previous legislative efforts. This bill aims to provide clearer guidelines on how companies can issue dollar-denominated digital tokens and set the stage for broader crypto oversight. House Version of Stablecoin Bill Released The U.S. House of Representatives has moved forward in digital asset regulation efforts after it published its stablecoin bill text to the public. The two congressmen, Bryan Steil and French Hill introduced stablecoin legislation, that dictates rules for digital tokens which bind their value to the U.S. dollar. Steil who leads the Financial Services Committee crypto panel stated the bill functions to unite stablecoin legislative frameworks between the House and Senate. The legislation known as the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) follows Congress’ ongoing development of digital asset regulations. According to Hill the bill constitutes part of an extensive program to establish regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency operations. He stated that the bill aims to establish financial regulations which require stablecoin companies to maintain transparency while protecting consumers and the system. Senate Stablecoin Bill Moves Forward There has been some progress made on the regulation of stablecoins by the Senate as the bill was moved to the Banking Committee where it enjoyed bipartisan support. This bill has made its way to the Senate floor, awaiting the senate action. Rep. Representative Tom Emmer, a crypto supporter in Congress, noted that even though the two bills are somewhat similar but have distinct features, such differences are not significant and can be sorted out as the bills progressed through the legislative procedure. Lawmakers are looking forward to passing the stablecoin laws in the next few weeks especially following US President Donald Trump directive on stablecoin regulation. Emmer remained optimistic that the bill will be finished by August. This momentum is part of a wider effort in Congress to provide more stability in the regulation of cryptocurrencies so that companies and users have better frameworks to follow. Efforts to Clarify Crypto Asset Regulations Additionally, Emmer also reintroduced the Securities Clarity Act as another bill targeting how cryptocurrencies fit into the domain of securities. This bill, sponsored with republican partner Darren Soto, is to clarify legal uncertainty existing in the United States concerning the qualification of digital assets under the securities law. Emmer thus urged for better formalism saying that business requires legal predictability to the effect that they are able to conduct their operations within the legal framework. Emmer’s actions are in line with other pieces of legislation that have been made to determine how digital assets should be regulated within the U.S. financial system. These steps are regarded as crucial in offering that legal certainty that many cryptocurrencies and blockchain start-ups have claimed to need to enhance business growth and development. Wyoming and Other States Enter the Stablecoin Market As federal lawmakers push forward with stablecoin regulations, states are also taking steps to position themselves as leaders in the crypto space. Wyoming, in particular, is moving toward launching its own state-backed stablecoin . Governor Mark Gordon has announced plans to issue a stablecoin fully backed by U.S. dollar reserves, aiming to provide a fast, low-cost alternative for digital payments. The state’s move is part of a broader trend, with other companies and states working on their own stablecoin projects. Custodia and Vantage Bank, for example, recently launched the Avit stablecoin , backed by U.S. dollar reserves and based on the Ethereum blockchain. These efforts reflect the growing interest in stablecoins as a way to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the emerging digital economy.

A March 26 letter signed by 34 crypto companies and advocate groups sent to the Senate Banking Committee, House Financial Services Committee and the House and Senate judiciary committees said the DOJ’s take on unlicensed money-transmitting business means “essentially every blockchain developer could be prosecuted as a criminal.” The letter — led by the DeFi Education Fund and signed by the likes of Kraken and Coinbase — added that the Justice Department’s interpretation “creates confusion and ambiguity” and “threatens the viability of U.S.-based software development in the digital asset industry.” The group said the DOJ debuted its position “in August 2023 via criminal indictment” — the same time it charged Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov with money laundering. Storm has been released on bail, has pleaded not guilty and wants the charges dropped . Semenov, a Russian national, is at large. Source: DeFi Education Fund The DOJ has filed similar charges against Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, who have both pleaded not guilty. The crypto group’s letter argued that two sections of the US Code define a “money transmitting business” — Title 31 section 5330, defining who must be licensed and Title 18 section 1960, which criminalizes operating unlicensed. It added that 2019 guidance from the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) gave examples of what money-transmitting activities and said that “if a software developer never obtains possession or control over customer funds, that developer is not operating a ‘money transmitting business.’” The letter argued that the DOJ had taken a position that the definition of a money transmitting business under section 5330 “is not relevant to determining whether someone is operating an unlicensed ‘money transmitting business’ under Section 1960” despite the “intentional similarity” in both sections and FinCEN’s guidance. Related: Hester Peirce calls for SEC rulemaking to ‘bake in’ crypto regulation The group accused the DOJ of ignoring both FinCEN’s guidance and parts of the law to pursue its own interpretation of a money-transmitting business when it charged Storm and Semenov. They said the result had seen “two separate US government agencies with conflicting interpretations of ‘money transmission’ — an unclear, unfair position for law-abiding industry participants and innovators.” The letter said that if not addressed, the Justice Department’s interpretation would expose non-custodial software developers “within the reach of the U.S. to criminal liability.” “The resulting, and very rational, fear among developers would effectively end the development of these technologies in the United States.” In January, Michael Lewellen, a fellow of the crypto advocacy group Coin Center, sued Attorney General Merrick Garland to have his planned release of non-custodial software declared legal and to block the DOJ from using money transmitting laws to prosecute him. Lewellen said the DOJ “has begun criminally prosecuting people for publishing similar cryptocurrency software,” which he claims extended the interpretation of money-transmitting laws “beyond what the Constitution allows.” Magazine: Meet lawyer Max Burwick — ‘The ambulance chaser of crypto’",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-27 04:06:27

This integration unlocks powerful new strategies for EVAA users — including fixed yields, leveraged farming, and impermanent loss-protected liquidity provision — while reaffirming EVAA’s position as the leading lending platform on TON. Think of it as Pendle meets TON — and it’s live. With this move, EVAA users can now tokenize their deposits into two distinct assets, opening up access to stable returns, amplified point farming, and composable yield strategies. This also marks the launch of FIVA’s phased mainnet rollout, with EVAA’s USDT market as its next strategic integration. One Deposit, Two Tokens — You Choose Through FIVA, EVAA depositors can split a single yield-bearing position into: PT (Principal Token): A fixed-rate instrument offering predictable income (e.g., 7–15% APY over 3–6 months) YT (Yield Token): A leveraged position offering up to 100x exposure to EVAA’s variable yields and point system — with no liquidation risk This dual-token design gives users greater control over their capital, letting them hedge risk or maximize upside depending on their strategy. Three Ways to Make Your Yield Work Smarter EVAA’s mission is to deliver transparent, sustainable, and innovative lending experiences. With FIVA now integrated, users can enhance their yield performance using three core instruments: Fixed Yields with Principal Tokens (PT) Users can lock in stable returns, ideal during times of market volatility. For example: Deposit 10,000 USDT at a fixed 7% APY over 6 months Earn 350 USDT in guaranteed returns, fully insulated from rate volatility With EVAA’s historical rates swinging between 3% and 14% — and dropping by as much as 75% in a year — PTs offer valuable protection for long-term and passive investors. This mechanism is ideal for investors who prioritize stability and need predictable income, especially in the often-volatile world of DeFi. Leveraged Farming with Yield Tokens (YT) For those seeking higher returns, YT tokens provide leveraged exposure to EVAA yields and points, with capital efficiency and capped downside. For instance, a 1,000 USDT YT position can give the yield of a 55,000 USDT deposit (representing 55x leverage – a possible scenario that varies based on market conditions) — perfect for aggressive farmers ahead of EVAA’s TGE. Multi-Stream Rewards as Liquidity Provider (LP) Users can also deploy EVAA positions to FIVA liquidity pools, earning: EVAA base yield (currently 3%) Trading fees (~0.5%) Both EVAA and FIVA points with multipliers Protection from impermanent loss at maturity Each token type — PT, YT, and LP — serves a different strategic purpose, allowing users to customize their approach based on personal risk profiles and yield targets. Phased Access, Proven Security – Rolling Out the Future of Yield The integration of FIVA into EVAA marks the start of a phased mainnet rollout designed with security, performance, and community feedback at its core. The rollout is structured across three stages: Phase 1: Early access for FIVA Genesis Pass NFT holders (completed) Phase 2: Partner access for EVAA users via exclusive links (now live) Phase 3: Full-scale expansion with additional protocol integrations (upcoming) During the current phase, EVAA users can access FIVA’s yield tokenization features through invite-only links distributed via the EVAA app, Telegram channel, quests, and partner campaigns. This controlled onboarding process allows the FIVA team to closely monitor performance, collect real-world usage data, and refine the user experience — all while ensuring protocol stability and protecting early participants. The decision to launch EVAA’s USDT market was strategic: as one of the most established protocols on TON, EVAA offers a secure and well-audited foundation to test and scale FIVA’s novel mechanics. Security remains a priority throughout. Both EVAA and FIVA implement smart contract audits, rely on Pyth oracles for reliable price feeds, and maintain contingency protections. Should any issues arise within the EVAA protocol, FIVA’s contracts are designed to honor fixed-rate positions , even if the underlying token values are affected. By combining phased access with robust security measures, the integration sets a new standard for responsible scaling in the TON DeFi space — a space that’s evolving fast and demanding smarter, safer infrastructure. And this is just the beginning. FIVA is already connected with a growing network of TON-native protocols, including Tonstakers , Storm , Ethena , and Bemo , with more integrations planned. Together with EVAA, they’re laying the groundwork for a modular DeFi ecosystem, where yield is not just earned — it’s tokenized, tradable, and optimized.

The ChatGPT creators also expect its revenue target for 2025 to more than double to $29.4 billion by 2026, Bloomberg reported on March 26, citing a person familiar with the matter. The 2025 estimate is a little higher than the $11.6 billion revenue target that OpenAI was reportedly eyeing for 2025, The New York Times reported last September. Bloomberg noted that the bulk of ChatGPT’s revenue has come from its paid AI software subscription offerings for consumers and businesses. OpenAI reportedly hit 1 million paid users for the corporate versions of ChatGPT last September, while the company more recently added a $200 monthly ChatGPT Pro option. The Sam Altman-led firm does not expect to be cash-flow positive until 2029, when it expects its revenue to top $125 billion, the person told Bloomberg. OpenAI is reportedly close to finalizing a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank Group at a valuation of up to $300 billion, Bloomberg reported on March 26. The firm is also looking to convert its nonprofit business model into a for-profit venture. Competition heats up between US and Chinese AI players While the release of DeepSeek’s ChatGPT-competitor “R-1” model sent shockwaves through the AI industry in late January, it sparked a wave of several other high-quality, low-cost AI solutions from other Chinese tech firms, Bloomberg reported on March 26. Baidu Inc. launched its “Ernie X1” model to compete with DeepSeek’s R-1 model in China, while Alibaba Group launched its new open-source AI model for cost-effective AI agents on March 26. Source: David Sacks Tencent Holdings also unveiled an AI chatbot of its own under subsidiary firm Ant Group Co, while DeepSeek released its latest model — DeepSeek-V3-0324 — on March 24. Related: Cathie Wood to kick off El Salvador’s AI public education program While it remains to be seen how these Chinese models truly stack up against OpenAI’s products, the newer and often cheaper options are putting more pressure on the business models of leading US companies, Balaji Srinivasan, a tech investor and former general partner at tech-focused venture capital firm Andreessen “a16z” Horowitz said in a March 22 X post. “China is trying to do to AI what they always do: study, copy, optimize, and then bankrupt everyone with low prices and enormous scale.” Lee Kai-fu, CEO of Chinese startup 01.AI told Reuters on March 25 that DeepSeek’s efforts have positioned Chinese AI firms only three months behind their US counterparts after previously being around six to nine months behind.

Plus and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at a “higher level of intelligence” which will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research features and more, he said in OpenAI’s technical roadmap update.

According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato, this oracle services provider is named Lumina and is built on the open-source financial data platform DIA (Decentralized Information Asset). Unveiling DIA’s Oracle Services Provider DIA Lumina is scheduled to go live on March 26. It will provide verifiable, trustless oracles for decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world assets (RWAs), and Web3 applications in the crypto ecosystem. DIA claims the platform will redefine the standard for oracle security, transparency, and efficiency. The financial data platform says Lumina will end “black-box data processing,” which has caused DeFi protocols and blockchain networks to rely on opaque, centralized, trust-based, and unverifiable data feeds for years. According to DIA, Lumina puts an end to an era where crypto networks are forced to depend on oracles that operate behind closed doors. Lumina offers a fully on-chain and transparent architecture that makes sure every step of the data journey is verifiable. Developers, networks, and institutions will be able to audit oracle operations directly in Lumina’s open and permissionless environment. This is why Ripple and the peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized network Stellar have chosen DIA to provide oracle services for their blockchains. Transparency and Trustlessness Unlike other popular oracles like Chainlink and Pyth , Lumina has a fully transparent design that meets institutional and regulatory standards. Ripple believes access to fully auditable, trustless off-chain data is non-negotiable for the growth of the RWAs sector, and Lumina enables that. “For years, oracles have been considered a necessary evil by many—an infrastructure layer blockchain builders had no choice but to trust. That stops now. DIA Lumina isn’t just another oracle stack. It’s the first one that doesn’t ask you to trust it at all,” said DIA’s head of business development, Dillon Hanson. Meanwhile, Lumina’s core technology is Lasernet, a modular layer-2 rollup built for trustless and verifiable oracles. DIA says this network leverages Arbitrum’s optimistic rollup technology and Ethereum’s security to ensure oracle transactions are processed publicly and verifiably, eliminating the reliance on off-chain, multi-sig-controlled nodes. “By putting every transaction, price feed, and computation on-chain, we’re not just competing with existing oracles—we’re making them obsolete,” Hanson added.

An official release from the state governor’s office noted that the state is considering nine blockchains to host the stablecoin. Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on Wednesday, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon confirmed the token’s launch after a testing period. Wyoming has partnered with LayerZero to launch WYST, pegged to USD and backed by cash, US Treasuries and repurchase agreements. Further, the stable token maintains a statutory requirement of no less than 102% capitalization, per Bloomberg . “There’s no clearer signal of where finance is heading than a U.S. state putting the dollar onchain,” wrote LayerZero on X. We’re honored to be chosen by Wyoming as the token issuance partner for WYST, the first fiat-backed and fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the United States.

Wyoming Governor Gordon Emphasizes Stablecoin Vision Speaking at the Blockchain Summit, state Governor Mark Gordon noted that the stable token’s testing phase will continue through the second quarter. “Once launched, WYST will grant holders the ability to transmit dollar-denominated transactions of any value, anywhere in the world, nearly instantly, with significantly reduced fees compared to traditional ACH or wires,” said Wyoming Stable Token Commission Executive Director Anthony Apollo. Governor Mark highlighted the state’s “commitment to transparency and innovation” in the digital asset space. “We are thrilled to share Wyoming’s vision for state leadership in the nation’s capital,” he noted, adding that Wyoming is well-positioned as a model for other states and the federal government. “It can also be a tool that farmers and ranchers can use to develop new markets,” Gordon said. He explained how the state would generate new revenue streams from WYST through interest income derived from the reserve assets. Pro-crypto Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has been planning to launch a state-issued stablecoin for years. Despite her Bitcoin support, however, the Senator has harboured reservations about stablecoins like Tether. WYST Undergoes Demo Transaction Stargate, a third-party bridge powered by LayerZero, already conducted a demo transaction of WYST between Ethereum and Avalanche testnets. “The next phase of testing and customizing smart contracts is an imperative step towards delivering the best product for Wyoming and stable token holders,” said Director Apollo.

The U.S. Senate is back in session this evening, and crypto enthusiasts are holding their breath. After a snag in the initial vote on April 4th, senators are set to revisit the contentious DeFi broker rule. This regulation, aimed at bringing decentralized finance (DeFi) under traditional financial reporting frameworks, has sparked significant opposition from the crypto community. Will this second vote finally overturn the rule? Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for the future of crypto. What is the DeFi Broker Rule and Why the Fuss? At the heart of this legislative battle is the DeFi broker rule . This rule, proposed by regulatory bodies, mandates that entities operating as brokers in the decentralized finance space must report the total proceeds from digital asset sales. Sounds simple enough, right? Not quite. The crypto industry argues this rule is deeply flawed and impractical for several key reasons: Defining a ‘Broker’ in DeFi is Murky: DeFi is built on decentralization. There aren’t always clear intermediaries in the way traditional finance operates. Identifying who qualifies as a ‘broker’ in a decentralized, often anonymous environment is incredibly complex and potentially overbroad. Privacy Concerns: The reporting requirements could compromise the privacy of DeFi users, a core tenet of many cryptocurrency principles. Forcing platforms to collect and report user data goes against the ethos of decentralization and could stifle innovation. Technical Challenges: Implementing such reporting requirements in the decentralized world presents immense technical hurdles. DeFi protocols are often designed to be permissionless and operate without central control, making data collection and reporting a significant challenge. Innovation Stifling: Many in the crypto space fear that overly burdensome regulations like the DeFi broker rule could stifle innovation and drive developers and businesses away from the U.S., pushing the burgeoning DeFi sector offshore. Essentially, the crypto industry views the DeFi broker rule as a square peg being forced into a round hole – traditional financial regulations being clumsily applied to a fundamentally different technological paradigm. The industry argues for a more nuanced and tailored approach to regulation that acknowledges the unique characteristics of DeFi. The Senate Vote: A Second Chance for Crypto? The fact that the Senate is holding a second vote on overturning the DeFi broker rule is significant. It indicates that the initial attempt, while facing a technical hurdle, has garnered enough support to warrant another try. According to reports from Eleanor Terrett, a procedural vote is scheduled for 5 p.m. this evening, followed by a final passage vote expected around 8 p.m. Eastern Time. This timeline suggests a focused and determined effort to push this resolution through. Why is this Senate vote so crucial? Industry-Wide Impact: The outcome of this vote will have a ripple effect across the entire crypto industry. Overturning the rule would be seen as a major victory, signaling a more accommodating regulatory environment in the U.S., encouraging further investment and development in the crypto space. Setting a Precedent: This vote could set a precedent for future crypto regulations. If the Senate successfully repeals the DeFi broker rule, it might embolden lawmakers to take a more cautious and considered approach to regulating digital assets, engaging with the industry and understanding its nuances. Global Signal: The U.S.’s stance on crypto regulation is closely watched globally. A move to overturn the DeFi broker rule could send a positive signal to the international crypto community, positioning the U.S. as a more crypto-friendly nation. What Happens Next? Potential Scenarios Let’s consider the potential outcomes of this pivotal Senate vote and what they could mean: Scenario Likelihood Impact on Crypto Industry Senate Repeals DeFi Broker Rule (Again) High (Given second vote attempt) Positive: Crypto industry celebrates a significant regulatory victory. Increased investment, innovation, and potentially clearer regulatory pathways in the U.S. Senate Fails to Repeal DeFi Broker Rule Medium (Possible resistance remains) Negative: Disappointment in the crypto industry. Concerns about overregulation and potential stifling of DeFi innovation in the U.S. May lead to increased focus on offshore DeFi development. Resolution Moves to President Trump Dependent on Senate outcome Uncertain: Trump’s stance on crypto regulation is evolving. His administration’s final decision would be crucial. Industry hopes for a favorable outcome given Trump’s generally pro-business stance. Crypto Regulation: A Constant Balancing Act The debate surrounding the DeFi broker rule highlights the ongoing tension between regulation and innovation in the cryptocurrency space. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate this nascent industry effectively. The challenge lies in finding a balance that protects consumers and prevents illicit activities without suffocating the potential for growth and technological advancement that crypto offers. Key Challenges in Crypto Regulation: Rapid Technological Evolution: The crypto space is constantly evolving. Regulations need to be adaptable and forward-thinking to keep pace with technological advancements. Decentralization and Anonymity: The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of many cryptocurrencies poses unique challenges for traditional regulatory frameworks designed for centralized and transparent systems. Global Nature of Crypto: Crypto operates globally, transcending national borders. Effective regulation requires international cooperation and coordination to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards. Education and Understanding: Policymakers and regulators need to develop a deeper understanding of the technology and its nuances to create informed and effective regulations. Digital Asset Sales: What’s at Stake? The core of the DeFi broker rule controversy revolves around the reporting of digital asset sales . For the crypto industry, this isn’t just about compliance; it’s about the fundamental principles of how digital assets are treated and regulated. Requiring DeFi brokers to report total proceeds from digital asset sales raises questions about: Definition of ‘Sale’: In DeFi, transactions can be complex and involve various forms of exchange, staking, lending, and borrowing. Defining what constitutes a ‘sale’ for reporting purposes can be ambiguous and problematic. Data Collection and Reporting Burden: The sheer volume and velocity of transactions in DeFi networks could make the reporting burden overwhelming and technically infeasible for many platforms. Impact on Market Liquidity: Overly stringent reporting requirements could reduce liquidity in DeFi markets if platforms and users become hesitant to engage in transactions due to compliance concerns. Ultimately, the debate over reporting digital asset sales in DeFi is about striking a balance between regulatory oversight and fostering a thriving, innovative digital economy. The Crypto Industry Impact: Watching with Bated Breath The entire crypto industry impact is keenly observing the Senate’s second vote. This isn’t just about one rule; it’s about the broader regulatory climate in the United States and its implications for the future of crypto innovation. A successful repeal would be a shot in the arm for the industry, signaling that policymakers are listening to concerns and are willing to take a more balanced approach to regulation. Potential Positive Impacts of Rule Repeal: Boost to Investor Confidence: A more favorable regulatory environment could attract more institutional and retail investors to the crypto market. Increased DeFi Adoption: Reduced regulatory uncertainty could encourage wider adoption of DeFi protocols and applications. Job Creation and Economic Growth: A thriving crypto industry can create new jobs and contribute significantly to economic growth in the U.S. Innovation Hub: A supportive regulatory framework can position the U.S. as a global hub for crypto innovation and development. Final Thoughts: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto The Senate’s second vote on the DeFi broker rule is more than just a procedural step; it’s a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The outcome will send a strong message about the U.S.’s approach to crypto regulation and its willingness to foster innovation in this transformative space. As the crypto world waits with anticipation, the decisions made in the Senate this evening could significantly shape the future trajectory of decentralized finance and the broader digital asset ecosystem.

42461880,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143708,1743051021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Clarity: SEC Nominee Atkins Promises Clear Crypto Guidelines,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/atkins-promises-clear-crypto/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as Paul Atkins, President Trump’s pick for SEC Chair, has publicly committed to establishing clear and principled digital asset regulations. This news comes as a beacon of hope for many in the crypto space who have long yearned for regulatory certainty. But what exactly does this mean for the future of crypto, and why is Atkins’ nomination such a significant development? Let’s dive into the details of his pledge and explore what it could entail for the evolving world of digital currencies. Why Clear Crypto Guidelines Matter? For years, the cryptocurrency industry has navigated a complex and often ambiguous regulatory landscape. This lack of clarity has been a major pain point, hindering innovation and creating uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Imagine trying to build a house without knowing the building codes – that’s been the reality for many crypto ventures. Clear crypto guidelines are not just about ticking boxes; they are about fostering a healthy and thriving ecosystem. Here’s why they are so crucial: Reduced Market Uncertainty: Ambiguity breeds volatility. When regulations are unclear, market participants are unsure of the rules of the game, leading to hesitant investment and potential market instability. Clear guidelines provide a stable foundation, encouraging confidence and long-term growth. Fostering Innovation: Innovation thrives in environments where the boundaries are defined, not absent. Knowing the regulatory parameters allows crypto companies to innovate within a framework, rather than constantly fearing unforeseen legal hurdles. This clarity can unlock a wave of new products and services in the digital asset space. Attracting Institutional Investment: Large institutional investors, who could inject significant capital into the crypto market, often shy away due to regulatory uncertainty. Clear rules can pave the way for greater institutional participation, bringing much-needed liquidity and maturity to the market. Investor Protection (Yes, it’s crucial!): While some fear regulation stifles growth, thoughtful regulation is paramount for investor protection . Clear guidelines can help prevent scams, fraud, and market manipulation, ensuring a safer environment for everyone involved. Who is Paul Atkins, the SEC Chair Nominee? Paul Atkins isn’t a newcomer to the world of securities regulation. He brings a wealth of experience to the table, having served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008. This prior experience within the agency provides him with a deep understanding of the SEC’s workings and its mandate. Currently, he leads Patomak Global Partners, a regulatory consulting firm. His background suggests a pragmatic and informed approach to regulation. As SEC Chair nominee , his words carry significant weight, signaling a potential shift in the regulatory approach towards digital assets. Atkins’ Pledge: Principled and Clear Crypto Regulations During his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee , Atkins didn’t just vaguely mention crypto regulation. He specifically vowed to establish “clear and principled digital asset regulations” if confirmed. This is a strong statement of intent. He emphasized the need for “coherent rules” to reduce market uncertainty and, crucially, to foster innovation. This balanced approach – promoting both clarity and innovation – is being welcomed by many in the crypto community. Atkins further outlined his priorities, which include: Investor Protection First: He stressed that protecting investors would be a top priority. This aligns with the SEC’s core mission and is a reassuring message for those concerned about the risks in the crypto market. Depoliticizing Securities Oversight: Atkins aims to remove political bias from the SEC’s oversight, suggesting a focus on objective, rule-based decision-making. This could lead to more predictable and consistent regulatory actions. Smart, Tailored Regulation: He advocated for regulation that is “smart” and “tailored” to the specific nuances of the digital asset space, operating within the SEC’s existing authority. This implies a move away from a one-size-fits-all approach and towards regulations that are fit for purpose. The Crypto Investments Controversy: A Hurdle to Overcome? Atkins’ nomination hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. It has faced delays due to scrutiny over his financial disclosures, particularly concerning his crypto investments . Reports indicate these investments could be as high as $6 million. This has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. However, Atkins has taken a proactive step, agreeing to divest these holdings if he is confirmed as SEC Chair. This commitment to divestiture attempts to address these concerns and clear the path for his confirmation. The Senate Banking Committee’s approval is the next hurdle, followed by a full Senate vote. The timeline remains uncertain, but the crypto industry is watching closely, hoping for a swift and positive outcome. The potential for clear crypto guidelines under Atkins’ leadership is seen as a significant positive development. What to Expect if Atkins is Confirmed? If Paul Atkins is confirmed as SEC Chair, the cryptocurrency industry can likely anticipate a more defined and structured regulatory environment. While the specifics of these regulations remain to be seen, his statements suggest a focus on: Area Potential Impact Digital Asset Classifications Clearer definitions of what constitutes a security versus other types of digital assets, reducing ambiguity and legal uncertainty. ICO/Token Sales More defined rules for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales, potentially making it easier for legitimate projects to raise capital compliantly. Crypto Exchanges and Custodians Potentially clearer guidelines for the operation and regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges and custodial services, enhancing investor protection and market integrity. Enforcement Actions While aiming for clarity, the SEC under Atkins may also be expected to take enforcement actions against bad actors in the crypto space to maintain market integrity and protect investors. It’s important to remember that regulatory frameworks take time to develop and implement. Even with Atkins at the helm, the process will likely be gradual and involve consultation with industry stakeholders. However, his commitment to clarity is a significant first step and signals a potentially more constructive and innovation-friendly approach from the SEC. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Crypto Regulation? Paul Atkins’ nomination and his pledge for clear crypto guidelines represent a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. His experience, coupled with his stated commitment to principled and smart regulation, offers a glimmer of hope for a more stable and predictable future for digital assets. While challenges remain, and the Senate confirmation process is still underway, the prospect of clearer rules is undoubtedly a positive signal for the crypto market. The industry waits with bated breath to see if this promise of clarity will translate into a regulatory framework that fosters both innovation and investor protection, paving the way for the next phase of crypto’s evolution.

The promise of creating stunning visuals directly within your chat interface was incredibly exciting. However, if you’re a free ChatGPT user eagerly awaiting this feature, there’s some disappointing news. OpenAI has announced a delay in rolling out this fantastic tool to free users. Let’s dive into why this delay has occurred and what it means for you. Why the Delay in ChatGPT’s AI Image Generation for Free Users? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself broke the news, citing unexpectedly high demand as the primary reason for the delay . In a post on X, Altman stated that the “Images in ChatGPT are wayyyy more popular than we expected (and we had pretty high expectations).” This surge in popularity has seemingly overwhelmed OpenAI’s current infrastructure, leading to the decision to postpone the rollout for free users. Think of it like a viral product launch – everyone wants it at once, and the servers are struggling to keep up! Here’s a breakdown of the situation: Overwhelming Demand: The AI image feature has become an instant hit, exceeding even OpenAI’s optimistic projections. Capacity Constraints: OpenAI is facing limitations in its current computing capacity to handle the massive influx of users wanting to generate images. Prioritizing Paid Users: Currently, the feature has only been launched for ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Teams subscribers. This suggests a prioritization of paying customers to ensure a smooth experience for them, while free users will have to wait. What Does This Delay Mean for Free ChatGPT Users and AI Image Generation Access? For millions of free ChatGPT users who were looking forward to experimenting with AI image generation , this delay is undoubtedly a setback. It means you’ll have to wait longer to access this innovative feature directly within ChatGPT. While it’s disappointing, it’s important to understand the context and potential reasons behind this decision. Here’s what you should consider: Limited Access for Now: The AI image feature is currently exclusive to paid subscribers. If you’re keen to use it immediately, upgrading to ChatGPT Plus or Pro might be an option. Patience is Key: OpenAI hasn’t provided a specific timeline for when the feature will be available to free users. However, Altman’s statement suggests they are working on addressing the capacity issues. Alternative Options: In the meantime, there are other AI image generation tools available online, such as DALL-E 2 (also from OpenAI, but accessible separately), Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. You can explore these alternatives while waiting for the ChatGPT feature to become available. Is OpenAI’s Infrastructure Prepared for the Future of AI? This isn’t the first time OpenAI has faced capacity-related challenges. Remember the Sora launch in December? Sign-ups were quickly disabled due to similar issues. These recurring hiccups raise questions about whether OpenAI’s infrastructure is adequately prepared for the rapid growth and adoption of its AI technologies. However, there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon. OpenAI’s ambitious $500 billion “Stargate” data center project could be the long-term solution to these capacity constraints. This massive investment signals OpenAI’s commitment to scaling its infrastructure to meet the ever-increasing demands of its AI models and user base. Stargate, if successful, promises to provide the robust computing power needed to support features like ChatGPT ‘s image generation and future AI innovations. Navigating the Wait for Free AI Image Generation in ChatGPT While the delay of AI image generation for free users is frustrating, it also highlights the immense popularity and potential of these technologies. OpenAI is clearly grappling with the challenges of scaling its services to meet this unprecedented demand. For now, free users will need to exercise patience. Keep an eye on official OpenAI announcements and tech news outlets for updates on when this exciting feature will finally become accessible to everyone.

On 27th March, the Korean government’s Public Officials Ethics Committee released the regular updates on public officials’ assets for 2025. According to the Korean Cultural Daily, 411 out of 2,047 public officials (about 20.1%) hold cryptocurrency, with a total value of 14.4 billion won (around $9.8 million). Notably, two out of 10 high-ranking public officials held virtual assets and the average holding per person was found to be 35.07 million won. Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young Tops The List Among them, Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young tops the list, with an impressive 1.7 billion won, which is about $1.27 million in Digital assets. Council Member Kim owns 16 types of cryptocurrencies, including 0.00144591 Bitcoin. Additionally, her spouse and eldest son also hold ETH, DOGE, and XRP. She reported holding 0.01226935 Ethereum, around 472 Dogecoins, and approximately 519,004 Ripples, along with about 3,336 Ripples owned by her eldest son. Seoul City Councilor Choi Min-gyu stood second with a reported 1.62 billion KRW in virtual assets, including nearly 410,000 Ripples and thousands of Artidiums and Ads. Close behind is, Kim Ki-hwan, CEO of Busan-Ulsan Expressway, with 1.43 billion KRW in crypto, holding over 150,000 Luna Classics and a range of other altcoins. Growing Trend of Government Officials Investing In Crypto Besides, several high-ranking public officials including Kim Dae-hwan, Oh Moon-kyo, and Park Byeong-chun, have significant cryptocurrency holdings. These officials are part of the top 10, with assets ranging from KRW 270 million to over KRW 1.3 billion. The disclosure of their crypto assets follows new regulations requiring public officials to report their holdings. This marks a growing trend of government figures investing in virtual currencies, highlighting a shift in how traditional officials are engaging with the evolving financial landscape. The involvement of public officials in cryptocurrency has sparked both interest and debate. In South Korea, the government’s move to mandate the disclosure of public officials’ cryptocurrency holdings aims to enhance transparency and accountability. Conflict of Interest In the U.S., some officials, including President Trump, have shown interest in cryptocurrencies, with Trump proposing a Bitcoin reserve to boost financial innovation. However, this involvement has raised some concerns ove conflicts of interest. Trump’s involvement in the crypto space has also drawn criticism, with his family’s ties to World Liberty Financial and the launch of a memecoin in January raising concerns about close connections between the administration and the crypto industry.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|LUNC|ALTCOIN|ASIA|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 05:04:43

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $640 resistance. BNB price is moving higher above the $620 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $630 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $627 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $615 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Upside Break After forming a base above the $600 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $618 and $610 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $625 level, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $645 swing high to the $615 low. The price is now trading below $630 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $628 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $627 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $630 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $645 swing high to the $615 low. A clear move above the $630 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $638. A close above the $638 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $665 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $630 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $622 level. The next major support is near the $615 level. The main support sits at $600. If there is a downside break below the $600 support, the price could drop toward the $585 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $622 and $615.

His remarks, released in prepared testimony ahead of Thursday’s Senate confirmation hearing, position Atkins as a crypto-friendly regulator seeking to rein in what he described as burdensome and overly politicized oversight. Atkins, who previously served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, criticized the agency’s approach to crypto regulation under the Biden admin, calling it “ambiguous and non-existent” and a barrier to innovation. “Since 2017, as I have led industry efforts to develop best practices for the digital asset industry, I have seen how ambiguous and non-existent regulations for digital assets create uncertainty in the market and inhibit innovation,” he said. SEC Poised for Policy Overhaul as Atkins Pledges Pro-Growth Crypto Framework In his testimony, Atkins pledged to work alongside fellow commissioners and lawmakers to establish clear rules that foster innovation while protecting investors. U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CHAIR NOMINEE PAUL ATKINS PLEDGES TO PROVIDE 'RATIONAL, COHERENT AND PRINCIPLED' APPROACH TO CRYPTO REGULATION -TESTIMONY — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) March 26, 2025 “It is time to reset priorities and return common sense to the SEC,” he added, arguing that excessive regulation has stifled capital formation and confused retail investors with overly complex disclosures. The confirmation hearing comes as the SEC begins reassessing its stance on digital assets under a new administration. Since January, the Trump White House has issued several pro-crypto executive orders and is actively working to roll back regulations adopted under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Paul Atkins Holds Up to $6M in Crypto-Related Assets, Faces Questions Over FTX Ties Atkins enters the confirmation process with notable financial ties to the crypto sector. In an ethics filing released Tuesday, he disclosed up to $6m in crypto-related investments , including equity stakes in Anchorage Digital and tokenization platform Securitize. He also reported between $1m and $5m in the crypto investment fund Off the Chain Capital, where he is a limited partner. While none of the holdings include Bitcoin, the disclosure highlights Atkins’ deep exposure to the industry he may soon be charged with regulating. Together with his wife, Sarah Humphreys, Atkins reported total assets of up to $327m, mostly derived from his consulting firm Patomak Global Partners and her family’s business, Tamko Building Products. The couple’s combined holdings could exceed $588m based on upper-range estimates. But Atkins’ nomination has already drawn fire from Senate Democrats. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a longtime crypto skeptic, has demanded clarity on his ties to collapsed exchange FTX , which is listed as a creditor of Patomak in bankruptcy filings. In a letter this week, Warren urged Atkins to explain his advisory work and how he would avoid conflicts of interest in overseeing digital asset markets.

As Bonk (BONK) rallies 35% and Dogs (DOGS) makes waves on Telegram, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is handing out a one-time-only LAUNCH100 code that doubles your tokens instantly. But blink and you’ll miss the best meme coin to buy today—this bonus is gone by March 30. With a live P2E game, 90% staking rewards , and 2900% ROI potential, BTFD is more than just a meme coin. It’s a movement. The presale is now in Stage 15 at just $0.0002 with over $6.41M raised and 72B+ coins sold to 11,600+ holders. Investors are piling in—because no one wants to miss this dip. So how does BONK’s trend-break and DOGS’ Telegram-powered push stack up against BTFD’s insane staking returns and game rewards? Let’s break it all down—because this presale window is closing fast. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today for 100% Bonus and 90% APY Can you imagine doubling your coins before they hit the market? That’s exactly what’s happening with BTFD Coin. Right now, investors can use the LAUNCH100 bonus code during Stage 15 and instantly get 100% more tokens—2X the value on the same dollar. For example, if you invest $6,000 in Stage 15 at $0.0002, you’ll bag 30 million BTFD Coins. Use the bonus code LAUNCH100, and suddenly you’re sitting on 60 million tokens. Once the listing hits $0.0006, that investment could balloon into $36,000—without even factoring in staking. And let’s talk about staking: BTFD Coin offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY to those who lock their tokens. The staking feature went live back on December 2, 2024, and has quickly become one of the most lucrative passive income plays in the meme coin space. Imagine watching your stack grow every month while others pray for green candles. This isn’t some vague promise. The BTFD presale started at just $0.000004 and is now nearing its final stage. Over $6.41M has been raised, 72 billion coins sold, and 11,600+ holders have joined the Bulls Squad. And let’s not forget the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that went full throttle on January 1, 2025—real-time rewards for real-time fun. Want to Know How to Snag that LAUNCH100 Bonus Before it Disappears? Step 1: Visit the BTFD Presale site and connect your wallet. Step 2: Enter LAUNCH100 in all caps and hit apply. Step 3: Buy your tokens and double your bag on the spot. This meme coin presale isn’t just about hype—it’s about building long-term value through real utility, insane rewards, and a community-driven roadmap. On top of all that, BTFD launched a killer referral program. Share your code, and if you make the top 20 leaderboard by the end of the month, you earn 10% of all your referrals’ purchases in BTFD tokens. Meanwhile, your referrals get 10% extra BTFD when they invest $50 or more. It’s a win-win hustle. The clock’s ticking, and this 100% bonus window slams shut on March 30. Once it’s gone, so is your chance to enter with double the value. BTFD isn’t just the best meme coin to buy today—it’s the best shot at meme coin dominance in 2025. Bonk (BONK) – Breaking Out and Gaining Traction Bonk just pulled a classic reversal, breaking above its descending trendline with a juicy 35% weekly gain. With daily trading volume now topping $100 million and its market cap sitting around $1.1 billion, BONK is back on the radar. The resistance zone between $0.0000158 and $0.0000225 could be the next major battleground. Still, BONK is about 75% down from its all-time high in November 2024, and meme coin volatility is no joke. But if momentum keeps pushing, BONK may have more room to bark. Dogs (DOGS) – Telegram’s Favorite Pup Is Barking Louder Dogs (DOGS) is making moves on the TON Blockchain, climbing 16.5% in just a week. The Telegram-powered meme coin is sitting at $0.00016741 with a market cap of $86.31 million. DOGS is drawing serious hype, especially from users embracing its dog mascot created by Telegram’s founder. Still, it’s a risky play—DOGS is down nearly 90% from its all-time high. That said, its community-first design and strong brand connection are keeping it alive in the dog-eat-dog meme coin arena. Final Verdict: Is BTFD the Best Meme Coin to Buy Today? You tell us—would you rather chase pumps or position yourself before liftoff? BONK and DOGS are both delivering newsworthy gains, but neither comes close to what the BTFD presale is offering right now. With a 100% token bonus, a 90% APY staking system, and an ROI that could hit 2900%, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the one investors are watching like hawks. Based on what we’re seeing in the market and across social platforms, this presale is shaping up to be a watershed moment. That’s why BTFD is hands down the best meme coin to buy today—for the rewards, for the tech, and for the future. Don’t wait till the presale ends. March 30 is the deadline to claim your double tokens . Buy the dip. BTFD or get left behind.

Meanwhile, the majority of altcoins are trying to recover from recent losses . Experts are noticing an interesting shift, as altcoins begin to break trends and take the lead. For months, Bitcoin was the dominant force, but as it slowed down, altcoins started to drive the market’s correction. However, Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, recently discussed risks facing the markets, especially in light of the current economic climate. Here are three key reasons why markets may be turning bearish: Weakened Consumer Confidence : Consumer confidence dropped to its lowest point since 2021, hitting 92.9 in March. This suggests that Americans are feeling uneasy about the economy, and if spending slows down, it could hurt the market, especially in the consumer sector. Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 are down 9% this year, compared to a 2% decline in the overall market. Bearish Positioning in Consumer Discretionary : There are signs of a bearish outlook in the consumer discretionary sector, with $800 million in outflows in March alone. Options data also shows a higher number of puts compared to calls, and short interest is rising. A lot of this bearish sentiment comes from poor performance in stocks like Tesla and broader economic factors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Four Reasons Why XRP Price May Hit $20 Soon , Uncertainty in Economic Data : Worries over inflation and weak economic data, like GDP forecasts from the Atlanta Fed, are also affecting market sentiment.

It looked like someone was manipulating the market, putting the exchange at risk of losing $12 million. But before things got worse, Hyperliquid’s team stepped in, fixed the issue, and turned the loss into a $700K profit. To stop any more trouble, they shut down trading for JELLYJELLY. How One Whale Nearly Broke the System The chaos started when a trader holding 124.6 million JELLYJELLY tokens, worth $4.5 million, placed an $8 million short bet on Hyperliquid. This forced the platform’s liquidity vault to take on the risk. But then, another wallet likely controlled by the same trader opened a massive long position at the same time. This caused JELLYJELLY’s price to skyrocket, leading to mass liquidations and huge profits for the trader. Arkham later revealed that this was a deliberate strategy to exploit leverage and drain funds from Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid just got exploited. What happened? A trader deposited $7.167M on 3 separate Hyperliquid accounts within 5 minutes of each other. He then made leveraged trades on an illiquid coin, JELLYJELLY. However, he ended up losing money, and is down almost $1M unless… pic.twitter.com/uNyMwLS5Sc — Arkham (@arkham) March 26, 2025 But the plan backfired when the trader’s accounts were restricted to reduce-only orders. This meant they could no longer open new trades and had to start selling off tokens from the first account to recover some of their funds, despite still having millions in unrealized gains. The attacker’s last withdrawal was at 12:43 UTC. However, he continued to attempt withdrawals – but was unable to, since his account was restricted to reduce-only orders at 12:50 UTC. However, his accounts still had millions of dollars in unrealized PnL. Instead of withdrawing,… pic.twitter.com/T9XcL35rCr — Arkham (@arkham) March 26, 2025 As JELLYJELLY’s price kept climbing, Hyperliquid’s liquidity vault faced the risk of a massive wipeout. If the token’s market cap kept rising, the vault could have lost everything. Seeing the surge in trading, major exchanges like Binance and OKX stepped in, listing perpetual futures for JELLYJELLY to capitalize on the hype. Hyperliquid Pulls the Plug With the situation escalating, Hyperliquid validators stepped in and reset JELLYJELLY’s price to $0.0095—the level where the whale had originally placed their short position. This allowed the platform to liquidate 392 million JELLYJELLY tokens, converting a multi-million-dollar disaster into a manageable $703K profit. However, to prevent further manipulation, Hyperliquid immediately closed all open JELLYJELLY positions and removed the token from its platform. The team also promised to reimburse affected users, with compensation set to be distributed automatically, except for flagged addresses suspected of being involved in the scheme. A Blow to Hyperliquid’s Reputation? Hyperliquid’s response to the crisis drew mixed reactions. Some praised its quick action, while critics like Bitget CEO Gracy Chen argued it acted more like a centralized exchange. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also questioned the handling of the situation. This marks Hyperliquid’s second major liquidity scare in just two weeks. Earlier, a whale’s $200 million Ethereum long liquidation caused a $4 million loss for its liquidity vault. The repeated turmoil has shaken confidence, sending Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, down over 12% in a day and over 30% for the month. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42463025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143711,1743052817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking! Trump’s 25% Car Tariff Unleashes Chaos in Global Auto Industry,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-car-tariff-auto-industry/,"Buckle up, folks! The global auto industry is bracing for a seismic shift as former President Donald Trump has reportedly slapped a hefty 25% tariff on all vehicles manufactured outside the United States. According to a Wu Blockchain post on X, citing Bloomberg, this dramatic move is set to take effect on April 2nd, with enforcement beginning April 3rd. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a colossal increase on top of the existing 2.5% import duty, potentially reshaping the landscape of car imports and the automotive market as we know it. Let’s dive into what this shocking development means for consumers, manufacturers, and the broader economy. What Exactly is This New Trump Car Tariff? In essence, the Trump car tariff is a significant tax levied on vehicles imported into the United States that are not manufactured within the country. Imagine it like this: for every foreign-made car shipped to the U.S., an additional 25% of its value will be added as a tariff, right at the border. This is separate from, and in addition to, the already existing 2.5% import duty. The announcement, as reported by Bloomberg and highlighted by Wu Blockchain, indicates that this policy is aimed squarely at vehicles fully assembled outside of the U.S. Interestingly, parts manufactured in the U.S. and used in vehicles assembled abroad will be exempt, hinting at a strategy to incentivize domestic parts production even for foreign automakers. Why the Sudden Auto Import Tariff Hike? While the exact motivations behind this sudden and substantial auto import tariff increase aren’t explicitly stated in the announcement, we can infer potential reasons based on past trade policies and Trump’s economic philosophies. Likely drivers could include: Boosting Domestic Manufacturing: A core tenet of Trump’s economic agenda has been to revitalize American manufacturing. By making imported cars significantly more expensive, the administration aims to make domestically produced vehicles more competitive, encouraging consumers to buy American-made cars and prompting automakers to shift or expand production within the U.S. National Security Concerns: While not explicitly mentioned in this announcement, previous tariffs under the Trump administration have been justified using national security arguments. The rationale could be extended to the auto industry, deeming a strong domestic auto manufacturing base as vital for national economic security. Trade Deficit Reduction: Another key focus of past trade policies has been to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Imposing tariffs is a tool to discourage imports, theoretically narrowing the trade gap. Political Signaling: Announcing such a significant tariff could also be a strategic political move, signaling a tough stance on trade and potentially exerting pressure on trading partners in ongoing or future trade negotiations. Who Will Bear the Brunt of These US Auto Tariffs ? The impact of these US auto tariffs will ripple across various sectors. Here’s a breakdown of who is likely to be most affected: Stakeholder Potential Impact Consumers Likely to face higher prices for imported cars. Reduced choice and potentially increased prices even for domestic cars due to reduced competition and potential price adjustments across the board. Foreign Automakers Significant decrease in competitiveness in the U.S. market. Potential reduction in sales and market share. May need to reconsider production strategies, possibly shifting production to the U.S. or absorbing tariff costs, impacting profitability. U.S. Automakers Potentially benefit from increased domestic demand and reduced competition from imports. However, they may also face increased costs if they import parts, although U.S.-made parts are exempt in foreign-assembled vehicles, this might still affect global supply chains. Auto Parts Suppliers (Global) Complex impact. U.S. parts suppliers might benefit. Foreign suppliers, especially those not integrated into U.S. supply chains, could face challenges. Exemption for U.S. parts in foreign cars adds complexity. Economy (Overall) Potential for inflation due to higher car prices. Uncertainty in trade relations. Possible retaliatory tariffs from other countries. Potential benefits to specific U.S. manufacturing sectors, but broader economic consequences need careful evaluation. The Impact on Your Wallet: Understanding the Foreign Car Tax Let’s get down to brass tacks: how will this foreign car tax impact your pocket? Imagine you’re eyeing a popular imported sedan priced at $30,000. Under the new 25% tariff, the price could effectively increase by $7,500 (25% of $30,000), plus the original 2.5% duty. This means the same car could now cost you closer to $38,250 (including original duty, assuming duty is calculated on the original price before tariff). This price hike could make purchasing a new car significantly more expensive for American consumers, especially those who prefer or rely on imported brands known for their fuel efficiency, specific features, or price points. Furthermore, the ripple effect could extend beyond just imported vehicles. Reduced competition from imports might allow domestic manufacturers to potentially raise prices as well, impacting the entire car market. The extent of this price increase will depend on various factors, including how automakers decide to absorb or pass on these tariff costs and how consumer demand reacts to these changes. Navigating the Auto Industry Impact : What Happens Next? The auto industry impact of this tariff is poised to be substantial and multifaceted. Here are some potential near-term and long-term consequences: Immediate Price Hikes: Expect to see price increases on imported vehicles relatively quickly as automakers adjust to the new tariff structure. Shifting Production Strategies: Foreign automakers might accelerate plans to establish or expand production facilities within the U.S. to circumvent the tariffs. This could lead to new jobs in the U.S. but also significant capital investment shifts. Trade Negotiations and Retaliation: This move could escalate trade tensions with countries that export cars to the U.S. Retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports are a distinct possibility, impacting other sectors beyond the auto industry. Consumer Behavior Changes: Consumers might delay car purchases, opt for used cars, or shift preferences towards domestic brands or smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles if import prices become prohibitive. Legal Challenges: The legality and implementation of these tariffs could face legal challenges, potentially leading to delays or modifications in the policy. Conclusion: A Road of Uncertainty for the Auto World President Trump’s imposition of a 25% tariff on foreign-made cars is a dramatic intervention that injects significant uncertainty into the global automotive industry. While proponents might argue it will bolster domestic manufacturing and jobs, the potential downsides – including higher prices for consumers, strained international trade relations, and broader economic disruptions – are equally significant. The coming months will be crucial in observing how automakers, consumers, and governments react to this seismic policy shift, and whether it achieves its intended goals or sets the stage for unintended consequences.

Gillibrand Pushes for Stablecoin Limits to Shield Local Banks,https://coinpaper.com/8220/us-sen-gillibrand-pushes-for-stablecoin-limits-to-shield-local-banks,"Gillibrand also warned that yield-bearing tokens could undermine community banking. Meanwhile, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon also spoke at the DC Blockchain Summit, and announced a July launch for the state’s USD-backed stablecoin. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce echoed calls for clearer, lasting crypto rules, as the SEC pivots under the Trump administration. With Congress ramping up legislation and Paul Atkins poised for confirmation as the SEC Chair, the US is on the brink of reshaping its digital asset regulatory landscape. Gillibrand Defends Local Banks Against Stablecoin Disruption At the 2025 DC Blockchain Summit that is held in Washington, DC, US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand voiced her strong support for stricter regulations on stablecoin issuers to protect the traditional banking sector. The New York Democrat argued that allowing stablecoin providers to offer yield-bearing products could significantly undercut local banks, which rely on customer deposits to issue home mortgages and small business loans. According to Gillibrand, if consumers shift their funds away from local banks in favor of interest-bearing stablecoins, it could lead to the collapse of key financial services that communities depend on. Sen. Gillibrand at the DC Blockchain Summit She also praised New York's financial regulatory framework as one of the most robust globally, and advocated for the adoption of similar standards across both state and federal levels to ensure consumer protection and legal compliance in the digital finance space. Her remarks were tied to the broader legislative effort behind the GENIUS Act, which is a stablecoin regulation bill that is co-sponsored by Gillibrand and introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in February. The main goal of the GENIUS Act is to create a comprehensive framework for the issuance and oversight of fiat-backed digital tokens. It was updated on March 10 to include enhanced anti-money laundering (AML) provisions, stricter know your customer (KYC) rules, financial transparency standards, and safeguards for consumers. The Senate Banking Committee approved the bill with an 18-6 vote on March 13, moving it closer to a full vote in both chambers of Congress before potentially being signed into law by President Donald Trump. However, the bill has faced some criticism from members of the crypto industry who see it as a covert move toward establishing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) through private actors. Jean Rausis , co-founder of the decentralized trading platform Smardex, warned that centralized stablecoins could become tools for financial surveillance and censorship. He warned that such systems might eventually give governments the power to freeze assets or block people from accessing financial services entirely. Wyoming Stablecoin Set for July Launch Despite Gilibrand’s concerns, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon announced that the state’s highly anticipated stablecoin could be ready for launch by July. This is a huge milestone in the state’s years-long effort to embrace digital asset innovation. At the DC Blockchain Summit on March 26, Gordon talked about the efficiency of the Wyoming state government in adopting blockchain technology. In fact, the Wyoming Stable Token Commission revealed that it formally partnered with LayerZero, an interoperability protocol, to handle token development and distribution. Executive Director Anthony Apollo confirmed that Wyoming stable tokens are already live on several test networks. The project traces its roots back to February of 2022, when Wyoming lawmakers introduced the Wyoming Stable Token Act . The legislation proposed a state-issued stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar and fully redeemable for fiat currency. It was signed into law in March of 2023, and allowed the state treasury to assemble a team of financial and technical professionals to oversee the stablecoin’s issuance and supply management. Since then, the state steadily built the infrastructure required to bring the stablecoin to market. In August 2024, Governor Gordon told attendees at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium that the launch was being targeted for Q1 2025. Taking a very different approach from Gilibrand, he also criticized the dominance of “too big to fail” institutions in US finance and described the Federal Reserve Bank as a barrier to innovation. The Wyoming stablecoin will be backed by short-term US Treasury Bills and repurchase agreements, providing a secure and liquid foundation for its value. Apollo also advocated for putting the state's public budget on-chain , and argued that blockchain technology can improve transparency, accountability, and government efficiency. Wyoming is represented in the Senate by crypto-friendly lawmaker Cynthia Lummis, and continues to position itself as a leader in digital asset regulation and innovation. Hester Peirce Calls for Lasting Crypto Rules SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has called for more permanent and transparent regulatory structures for the crypto industry that can endure changes in political leadership. Peirce also spoke at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 26, and she placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of rulemaking and congressional legislation over temporary agency guidance, which can shift with each administration. She specifically argued that the current lack of clarity leaves developers too focused on legal ambiguity, particularly around the Howey test, rather than innovation. Peirce also pointed out that she wants clearer boundaries for what falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction and straightforward guidance on how projects can proceed if they fall within that scope. Hester Peirce speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit Her comments were made at a time when the SEC recently dropped several high-profile enforcement actions against crypto firms, including Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, and Immutable. This shift in posture is being interpreted by some people in the industry as a political move that is aligned with President Donald Trump’s administration, which has been viewed as more industry-friendly. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda led the commission during this transitional period, but his leadership may soon change. Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and Trump’s recent nominee, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on March 27. His confirmation could pave the way for an even more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Atkins holds investments in Securitize, which is a real-world asset tokenization platform, and is connected to a consulting firm linked to the collapsed exchange FTX. His ties to the industry and prior experience made him a very popular figure among crypto advocates, though it remains to be seen whether the full Senate will confirm him for a term that will run through 2031. Meanwhile, the 119th Congress has shown increasing interest in establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. A recently proposed market structure bill aims to better define the responsibilities of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in overseeing crypto markets. On his third day back in office, Trump signed an executive order launching a working group to explore comprehensive stablecoin regulations, which means that the administration is working hard already to create a much more structured approach to crypto policy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-27 05:26:07

Member states should now look at other options listed in the recently unveiled “Rearm Europe/ Readiness 2030” plan as the Union is yet to figure out how to repay loans used for post-pandemic recovery funding, the European official suggested. Brussels not prepared to fund defense readiness with EU debt For now, EU nations are expected to utilize instruments already set out in the “Readiness 2030” plan rather than rely on joint debt for military spending, the Union’s defense chief has indicated. Andrius Kubilius told Euronews that the bloc is not ready to issue Eurobonds for that purpose. Ahead of discussions on the next Multiannual Financial Framework ( MMF ), the commissioner emphasized that the European Union will have to spend a significant portion of its long-term budget to pay back pandemic-related debt, unless another solution is found. The EU has to decide first how to cover debt resulting from recovery grants issued in the wake of Covid-19. Annual repayments are expected in the range of €25 billion to €30 billion (over $32 billion), amounting to 20% of the approximately €1.2 trillion MMF which represents 1% of the EU’s economic output. “Eurobonds means that the European Union will have a bigger debt, which will need to be serviced again by all the member states, and now we have in some ways a challenge on how to repay the existing debt,” explained Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania and ex-leader of the country’s conservative Homeland Union party. PIC – https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/photo-details/P-066064~2F00-29 Andrius Kubilius, EU commissioner for defense and space, Brussels, March 19, 2025 (Source: EC Audiovisual Service) The European Commission (EC) unveiled its “Rearm Europe” plan earlier this month and later rebranded it to “Readiness 2030” after objections from Italy and Spain. Their prime ministers called for widening the scope of the term to encompass spheres beyond simply buying armaments such as cybersecurity, anti-terrorism, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications. The initiative seeks to ramp up the defense capabilities of EU member states and expand military production across the Old Continent. Its key goal is to mobilize up to €800 billion for defense and security over the next four years. EU aims for 3.5% of GDP defense spending target in member states The bulk of that total, around €650 billion, is supposed to come from member states increasing their defense spending to up to 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). To achieve that, the Commission has come up with a set of proposals, including to relax fiscal rules and attract private capital. “For the next four years, in some kind of idealistic scenario, member states will start to spend 3.5% of GDP, so it will be €2.4 trillion spent on defense. The question is: will it cover all the needs,” commented Andrius Kubilius who expects to have more clarity on the matter in the next couple of months. The remaining €150 billion should be provided by a newly established financial loan instrument called Security Action for Europe ( SAFE ). The latter will allow the executive body in Brussels to issue bonds and borrow on the capital markets to lend funds to the EU countries. Within the scope of SAFE, the EC requires at least 65% of the value of some items, such as missiles, small drones and ammunition, to be purchased from within the EU, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the European Economic Area (EEA), or from war-torn Ukraine. “We want to incentivize member states to spend more money on European production,” Kubilius pointed out. The Commission has estimated that the European Union will need hundreds of billions of euros in fresh investments by the end of the decade in order to remain competitive on the global stage, fight climate change and address rising defense needs. Last week, the EC presented a plan to steer some of the €10 trillion in citizens’ savings toward capital markets. Meanwhile, Europe’s economic powerhouse, Germany, removed its constitutional “debt brake” to be able to borrow funds for infrastructure, climate and defense projects.

While Coinbase Ventures remains focused on infrastructure, stablecoins, and real-world applications, Bitso is expanding its regional reach with the launch of a Mexican peso-pegged stablecoin aimed at improving cross-border payments. Bitso Launches Peso-Pegged Stablecoin on Arbitrum to Drive Financial Efficiency in Latin America Bitso Business, the enterprise division of leading Mexican crypto exchange Bitso, has unveiled a new peso-pegged stablecoin , MXNB, to be issued on the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum. According to a March 26 announcement, MXNB will be fully backed by Mexican pesos on a 1:1 basis and will be managed by Juno, a newly created subsidiary of Bitso. The firm promises regular independent audits of the reserves, with transparent attestation reports to be published publicly on the token’s dedicated website. “Global companies face significant monetary challenges when it comes to serving customers in new markets and conducting cross-border payments, including high intermediary costs and inefficient transaction times,” said Ben Reid, Head of Stablecoins at Bitso Business. He emphasized that MXNB could offer a more efficient, faster, and lower-cost alternative to the traditional financial rails for businesses and investors seeking exposure to Latin America. The launch of MXNB comes at a time when Mexico’s remittance market is booming, and cryptocurrency is playing an increasingly vital role in enabling cross-border transfers. According to the World Bank , Mexico received a staggering $61 billion in remittances in 2023, largely from the United States, making it the second-largest recipient of remittances globally. Crypto research firm Chainalysis noted in October that Mexico is one of the most critical markets for crypto-based remittances, citing high usage rates and growing infrastructure. From July 2023 to June 2024, Latin America received $415 billion in crypto transactions, a 42.5% increase year-over-year — the second-fastest growing region after sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, MXNB could act as a liquidity bridge between the fiat peso and the global crypto economy, particularly in regions where financial services are expensive or limited. The use of Arbitrum, a high-throughput Ethereum Layer-2 network, is expected to reduce costs and latency compared to mainnet Ethereum or traditional remittance corridors. While Bitso’s move is strategic, MXNB enters a growing but competitive space. Tether’s MXNT, launched in 2022 across Ethereum, Polygon, and Tron, already has a presence in the region. At the time, Tether’s CTO and now-CEO Paolo Ardoino called it a tool to protect Mexican users from inflation and facilitate a smoother fiat-to-crypto transition. Other players include MMXN, backed by Monetary Digital, and MXNe, a stablecoin launched in 2024 by US-based Brale on the Solana and Stellar networks. Each stablecoin issuer has targeted niche use cases such as fintech applications, remittances, or DeFi integrations, indicating a maturing and diversifying Mexican crypto economy. Despite the competition, Bitso’s advantage lies in its local dominance, boasting over 7 million users across Latin America, and its robust regional infrastructure that supports both retail and institutional users. The company’s recent Latin America Crypto Landscape report found that stablecoin purchases on Bitso surged by 9% in recent months, as users seek refuge from local fiat volatility by turning to USDC and USDT. Building Trust Through Transparency Juno, the entity managing MXNB, will operate independently of Bitso to ensure transparency and regulatory clarity. This governance structure aligns with best practices for stablecoin issuance globally, especially as scrutiny from financial watchdogs continues to intensify. By offering public audits, Juno seeks to instill trust among both institutional and retail users wary of opaque backing practices, a concern that has plagued some stablecoin issuers in the past. The launch of MXNB marks a pivotal moment for Mexico’s crypto ecosystem. As businesses in Latin America look for faster, cheaper, and more secure financial rails, Bitso’s stablecoin could serve as a linchpin connecting the digital economy with real-world fiat value. The combination of fiat-backing, Arbitrum’s scalability, and Bitso’s market reach may position MXNB to become a cornerstone asset for cross-border commerce, remittances, and decentralized finance in Mexico and beyond. With crypto-based remittances on the rise, and stablecoins emerging as reliable financial tools for inflation-hit economies, MXNB could prove to be more than just a new token — it could be the digital peso for the next generation of Latin American finance. Coinbase Ventures Doubles Down on Crypto’s Future, Eyes 2025 as Banner Year for Blockchain VC As crypto markets continue to experience cycles of volatility, venture capital appears unfazed, seeing turbulence not as a threat but as a filter that exposes true innovation. At the forefront of this resilient outlook is Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the US-based crypto giant Coinbase, which remains steadfast in its commitment to backing the next wave of blockchain and Web3 builders. In an interview, Hoolie Tejwani, head of Coinbase Ventures, outlined a long-term thesis that positions crypto not as a fleeting trend but as a foundational transformation — a technological evolution just entering its adolescence. We’re “one decade into a 30-year paradigm shift,” Tejwani said. “What we’re seeing as investors is an exponential technology change curve that is transforming the way people interact, how value flows, and how economies are run. And it’s being shaped by the people who are building on crypto infrastructure.” While some investment firms have pulled back due to market uncertainty, Coinbase Ventures is taking the opposite approach — investing steadily through all market conditions, with its eyes on the “big picture. Its portfolio is already stacked with some of the most influential names in crypto, including Arbitrum, Dune, EigenLayer, Etherscan, OpenSea, Optimism, and Uniswap. These are not just token projects or trading platforms — they are infrastructure builders, data aggregators, and decentralized systems that are shaping the backbone of Web3. A significant area of focus for Coinbase Ventures in 2025 is the rapid growth and normalization of stablecoins — particularly US dollar-pegged assets like USDC and USDT. Tejwani pointed to a shifting regulatory landscape in the US that could supercharge adoption. The recent advancement of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins), which cleared the Senate Banking Committee in an 18-6 vote, has been hailed as a milestone. If passed, the bill would bring much-needed clarity to stablecoin issuers and provide a regulatory framework that supports both innovation and compliance. California Representative Ro Khanna recently revealed that at least 70 Democrats now support stablecoin legislation , a remarkable shift in sentiment that underscores the technology’s geopolitical significance. With the stablecoin market now exceeding $220 billion — or about 1.1% of the US M2 money supply — the stakes have never been higher. Beyond stablecoins, Coinbase Ventures is honing in on next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, on-chain consumer applications (especially in social, gaming, and creator economies), and crypto-AI convergence as key areas of investment heading into 2025. This thematic focus is shared by other major players in the space. Jeffrey Hu, head of research at HashKey Capital, also noted an increasing VC appetite for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) — both of which aim to bridge blockchain with the physical world. What unites these efforts is a common belief that real-world utility and institutional involvement will drive the next bull market, not hype. VC Capital Already on the Rise Tejwani’s bullish outlook is echoed by recent funding data, which shows a surge of capital flowing back into the crypto space. Blockchain startups raised $1.1 billion in February alone, a sign that investor confidence is rebounding despite market headwinds. Key sectors attracting VC capital include DeFi, business services, security infrastructure, and payment systems, according to analytics firm The TIE. These areas align closely with Coinbase Ventures’ investment thesis, which prioritizes infrastructure and utility over speculation. Whether through enabling borderless payments, offering financial inclusion, or building decentralized digital economies, blockchain technology is being positioned as a generational shift — and Coinbase Ventures wants to be at the center of it.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-27 05:30:00

Market Index Reveals Crucial Clues,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ongoing-recovery-a-bull-trap-or-breakout-market-index-reveals-crucial-clues/,"Bitcoin has maintained its upward trajectory so far this week, with the asset reclaiming and holding above the $85,000 mark. This performance reflects a weekly gain of approximately 4.7%, indicating a possible shift in momentum after weeks of sideways and bearish activity. While short-term gains have been recorded, signs that might determine Bitcoin’s next major move appear to have emerged. Particularly, a renewed analysis of market health and investor behavior has accompanied the current price action of BTC. On-chain metrics and sentiment indicators are being used to assess whether the current recovery signals a continuation of the bull cycle or if the market may be transitioning into a new phase. One such framework recently shared by CryptoQuant contributor Woominkyu offers a broader view of Bitcoin’s positioning using the Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI). Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally To $95K? Market Greed Suggests It’s Possible Assessing Market Health Through BCMI Metrics According to Woominkyu, the BCMI provides a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin’s market condition by aggregating four core metrics: MVRV (30%), NUPL (25%), SOPR (25%), and the Fear & Greed Index (20%). Each component reflects key aspects of network valuation, investor sentiment, realized gains/losses, and emotional market trends. The index assigns weightings to each metric and calculates a combined score, which can indicate whether the market is overheated or undervalued. Historically, a BCMI score below 0.15 is associated with extreme fear and potential buying opportunities, while scores above 0.75 often precede market tops or sharp corrections. At present, the BCMI remains below the 0.5 level, suggesting that Bitcoin has not yet entered the overheated zone. Woominkyu suggests two possible scenarios: the market is either undergoing a normal correction within an ongoing bull cycle, or it is showing early signs of an atypical transition into a bearish phase. The moment of decision for Bitcoin “During this current market cycle, BCMI hasn’t yet reached the typical ‘overheated’ zone (above 0.75). It’s currently hovering below 0.5, suggesting we’re at a crucial market juncture.” – By @Woo_Minkyu Read more ⤵️https://t.co/sfyunRuWbh pic.twitter.com/he77VS98t7 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 26, 2025 Key Thresholds to Watch in Bitcoin The analyst points to the importance of monitoring the 7-day and 90-day moving averages of the BCMI for clearer direction.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President is expected to sign a resolution repealing it. The rule, introduced during the Biden administration, required DeFi platforms to report crypto transactions to the IRS, much like traditional financial institutions. 3/ Next up? The CRA heads to @realDonaldTrump for signature – a milestone that would officially roll back the IRS’ misguided “DeFi Broker” rulemaking, and formally protect DeFi innovators in the United States. — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) March 27, 2025 Senate Votes to Overturn Crypto Reporting Requirements The Senate voted 70-28 in favor of repealing the rule, following a similar decision by the House earlier this month. The legislation had been widely criticized by the crypto community for being impractical and harmful to innovation. Supporters of the repeal argue that DeFi platforms operate differently from centralized financial entities and should not be subjected to the same reporting rules. Critics Say the Rule Was Unworkable Crypto advocacy groups, including the Blockchain Association, praised the Senate’s decision, calling it a victory for DeFi innovation. Thank you, @SenTedCruz , @RepMikeCarey and all of the members who voted to strike down this rule. Your leadership will ensure American innovation in crypto and DeFi thrives. We look forward to President @realDonaldTrump ’s final signature to take this rule off the books for good. https://t.co/e0de4b5Sfd — Kristin Smith (@KMSmithDC) March 27, 2025 Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, expressed gratitude to Senator Ted Cruz, Representative Mike Carey, and other lawmakers for voting to overturn a rule that could have restricted crypto and DeFi innovation. She emphasized that their leadership helps secure the future of digital assets in the U.S. and is now looking forward to Donald Trump’s final approval to scrap it permanently. However, some experts argued that the rule was unrealistic and would have placed excessive burdens on decentralized platforms , making compliance nearly impossible. However, opponents of the repeal, such as Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett, warned that removing the rule could open doors for tax evasion and illicit financial activities. He claimed that keeping the regulation in place would have helped prevent wealthy investors from exploiting tax loopholes. What’s Next? With Trump expected to approve the repeal, the rule will soon be off the books. The decision highlights the shifting political landscape around crypto regulation as the industry gains stronger support in Washington. For now, DeFi platforms can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing they won’t have to comply with the IRS reporting requirements that many saw as an existential threat to the sector. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42464808,https://invezz.com/?p=2639197,1743053474,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Wyoming stablecoin WYST enters test phase across Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/27/wyoming-stablecoin-wyst-enters-test-phase-across-ethereum-solana-and-avalanche/,"Wyoming has taken a major step forward in the race to become a blockchain policy leader in the United States. The state has officially begun testing its own government-backed stablecoin, the Wyoming Stable Token (WYST), across several major blockchain networks. The tests are being conducted on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and others, marking a critical step toward a planned launch in July 2025. WYST will be issued under the authority of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission and built using LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard to enable seamless movement between blockchains without relying on centralised bridges. WYST launch backed by US Treasuries The WYST token will be fully backed by a combination of cash and US Treasury securities, with reserves exceeding the total number of tokens issued. This overcollateralisation model is designed to maintain price stability and instil public trust. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that have failed in the past, WYST will hold assets that match or exceed the token supply at all times. Interest earned on these reserves will go directly to Wyoming’s school foundation fund, creating a mechanism through which stablecoin adoption could directly benefit public services in the state. The initiative is being managed by the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, formed after the passage of the Wyoming Stable Token Act in March 2023. This marks a rare example of a US state pursuing its own stablecoin project under direct legislative authority. LayerZero enables cross-chain transfers The commission has partnered with LayerZero to build WYST on the OFT standard. This framework allows tokens to move securely across blockchains without the need for third-party bridges, which are often targets for exploits. LayerZero’s protocol is designed to enable cross-chain communication using decentralised oracles and relayers, reducing the risk of hacks that have plagued the industry. WYST has already been successfully transferred between Ethereum and Avalanche during testnet demonstrations using Stargate, a LayerZero-enabled bridge. While Stargate was used for initial testing, WYST will be compatible with any interface that supports LayerZero’s OFT standard. These developments were shared during the DC Blockchain Summit on 26 March, where Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon and Stable Token Commission Executive Director Anthony Apollo confirmed that the token had entered its testing phase. The state aims to use these trials to ensure smart contracts function properly, identify vulnerabilities, and confirm that cross-chain mechanics are stable ahead of the launch window. Testnets include Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche WYST is being deployed on multiple blockchain testnets to prepare for a wide-scale launch. The inclusion of Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and others allows Wyoming to ensure compatibility with the most widely used decentralised finance platforms. The testnet version of the token does not carry any real-world value but replicates the behaviour of the live version. Each blockchain brings different capabilities to the table. Ethereum provides robust security and institutional adoption. Solana offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees, while Avalanche provides high scalability and eco-friendliness. By deploying WYST across these networks, the state is aiming to build a flexible, future-ready digital asset. This approach positions WYST as a uniquely interoperable state-issued stablecoin, capable of serving multiple decentralised ecosystems. It also reflects Wyoming’s broader strategy of developing comprehensive blockchain legislation and infrastructure, attracting both startups and institutional players to the state. Wyoming aims for stablecoin leadership With initial testing underway, the next few months will be focused on refining WYST’s smart contracts, finalising risk management protocols, and expanding test coverage. If these elements are completed on schedule, the token could see a full-scale launch by July 2025. Wyoming’s move into stablecoins follows years of progressive blockchain legislation. The state has created a favourable regulatory environment for decentralised technologies, and WYST could become the first government-issued stablecoin of its kind in the US.

Will BTC set a new all-time high?,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-supply-on-exchanges-drops-to-8-year-low-will-btc-set-a-new-all-time-high/,"Bitcoin exchanges supply has dropped to its lowest in 8 years, sparking hopes of a price recovery towards a new BTC all-time high. According to a Mar. 27 post on X by blockchain analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) supply on exchanges has dropped to 7.53%, its lowest level since 2018. This implies that more investors are moving their Bitcoin into self-custody, which lowers the amount available for immediate selling. Because it signifies less short-term sell pressure and rising confidence among holders, a declining exchange supply is frequently interpreted as a bullish sign. 💸 Bitcoin's ratio of supply on exchanges has officially dropped to as low as 7.53%, the lowest since February 20, 2018. The 7-year milestone reflects a continued trend of investors of crypto's top asset feeling comfortable 'hodling' for the long-term, regardless of short-term… pic.twitter.com/m7d6Yon5HR — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 26, 2025 One of the main factors driving Bitcoin’s price movement has been institutional demand. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen steady inflows since Mar. 14, which has caused BTC to rise more than 10%. In contrast, between Feb. 10 and Mar. 13, ETF inflows were negative to nearly stagnant, and Bitcoin dropped 17%. This pattern shows the strong link between institutional buying and Bitcoin price trends, with large investors having a greater market impact than retail speculators. You might also like: Economist warns of a recession: Will Bitcoin and altcoins crash or rise? Alongside the growing institutional demand, a Mar. 25 article published on OKX’s research page indicates that the market behavior of Bitcoin is also changing. Historically, a 50% drop was regarded as a bear market. In previous cycles, drops of up to 80% have been recorded. But as Bitcoin has matured, extreme crashes brought about by panic selling have become less common. Now, a 30% decline is often enough to trigger bear market concerns. According to insights from the article, on-chain data suggests that instead of the prolonged declines of past cycles, Bitcoin might be going through a brief “mini” bear market . An early indicator of this change was the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value ratio, which compares the current price of Bitcoin with the average price at which short-term holders purchased their coins. The metric displayed a bearish sentiment even before there were notable price drops on Feb. 25. Now, it has fallen below the 365-day moving average, which is a critical level that usually signals more selling pressure. However, analysts anticipate that the metric will improve and lead to a relief rally as the amount of Bitcoin on exchanges declines. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $87,653, roughly 19% down from its peak of $108,786.

42464820,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143715,1743054009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Opportunity: Why Smart Investors Are Piling Into Crypto Hedge Funds Now,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-hedge-funds-investment-opportunity/,"Are you looking for a fresh, potentially lucrative avenue in the world of cryptocurrency? Forget the noise and focus on where the smart money is moving. According to a top executive at Amitis Capital, the answer might surprise you: it’s crypto hedge funds . Chris Solarz, Chief Investment Officer at Amitis Capital, recently shared his expert insights, suggesting that right now presents a golden opportunity to dive into this burgeoning sector. Let’s unpack why this seasoned investor believes now is the prime time to consider cryptocurrency investment through hedge funds. Why Crypto Hedge Funds Are Ripe for Investment Now? Solarz argues that the cryptocurrency market, despite its maturity in some aspects, still retains the characteristics of its early days. This ‘early stage’ environment allows for the successful deployment of investment strategies that were highly effective in the initial phases of the traditional hedge fund industry. Strategies that have become too commonplace and less profitable in traditional finance are finding new life and effectiveness within the volatile yet potentially rewarding digital assets landscape. Early Stage Advantage: The crypto market mirrors the early hedge fund days, offering unique profit opportunities. Revived Strategies: Commoditized traditional finance strategies are effective again in crypto. Untapped Potential: The relative immaturity of the crypto space allows for alpha generation through less saturated strategies. Think of it like this: imagine being able to use well-tested, proven strategies in a market that hasn’t been completely saturated by them yet. That’s the opportunity Solarz is highlighting. It’s about applying financial wisdom to a relatively new frontier where those time-honored principles can yield exceptional results. But it’s not all smooth sailing; navigating this space requires discernment and expertise. The Challenge: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff in Crypto Asset Management While the opportunity is significant, Solarz also issued a stark warning about the current state of crypto asset management . In a candid assessment, he revealed that out of 20 cryptocurrency asset management firms he recently evaluated, he found only one worthy of entrusting with funds. This sobering statistic underscores a critical challenge: the crypto space is still young, and many firms lack the experience and expertise needed to navigate its complexities effectively. The Expertise Gap: Solarz observed that the majority of firms he encountered were: Young and Inexperienced: Many firms are newly established and lack a long track record in asset management. Lacking Traditional Finance Acumen: Some firms may not possess the deep understanding of financial principles and risk management crucial for hedge fund success. Potentially Overwhelmed: The rapid pace and volatility of the crypto market can be challenging for inexperienced teams. This highlights the importance of due diligence. Investors need to be exceptionally careful when selecting a crypto hedge fund . It’s not enough to be enthusiastic about crypto; you need seasoned professionals at the helm, individuals who understand both traditional finance and the nuances of the digital asset world. Bitcoin’s Ascent: Could Bitcoin Outshine Gold? Beyond the immediate opportunity in crypto hedge funds, Solarz also shared a bold prediction about Bitcoin . He anticipates that Bitcoin could potentially surpass gold in market capitalization within the next decade. This is a significant statement, considering gold’s long-standing position as a safe-haven asset and store of value.

PepeX aims to tackle issues of market manipulation and insider advantages that have affected meme launchpads. Set to launch in Q3, the platform aims to “make fair launches fair again” at a time when confidence in existing models is shifting, even as the sector has generated billions of dollars in token launches. PepeX introduces features like anti-bundling transparency, developer wallet tracking, sniping protections, and AI-powered tools for democratized token creation. These innovations seek to enhance fairness and accessibility in one of crypto’s most active segments. PepeX presale gains momentum The presale follows a 30-stage, 90-day model, starting at $0.02 with a 5% price increase per stage, culminating at $0.0823 on June 22—a 311% rise from its opening price. PepeX, now in the first stage of its presale, gives early investors access to 45% of the total supply, amounting to 2.25 billion PEPX tokens. The presale has already gained strong traction, raising $771,430 in just a few days since launch. Early-stage investors could benefit from PepeX’s structured price increases throughout the presale. After the presale, PepeX is expected to list on major exchanges ahead of the launch of its AI-powered platform. Positioned as a next-generation meme coin launchpad, PepeX aims to surpass existing competitors by leveraging AI-driven features. Why is the market excited about PepeX PepeX has been generating strong interest. Positioned as the “world’s first AI-powered meme coin launchpad,” PepeX aims to offer a fairer alternative to existing platforms like Pump.fun. To promote fairness, PepeX caps project creators’ token holdings at 5% of the total supply. Additionally, deployers must put down $500 upfront when launching a token, reinforcing accountability and long-term commitment. By requiring founders to do this, PepeX sets a higher entry barrier than Pump.fun. This helps filter out low-effort projects, attracting more serious and committed developers. The AI-powered Moonshot Engine streamlines meme coin creation by allowing users to upload an image—whether it’s Doge, a frog, or their own face—and generate a custom token with built-in anti-snipe protection and liquidity pools. In addition to simplifying token creation, PepeX leverages AI-driven bots to promote projects across social media, automating community engagement and increasing visibility. By tackling the major pain points of existing launchpads, PepeX aims to enhance platform integrity and rebuild user confidence. This comes at a time when interest in the sector remains strong, with market participants looking for more transparent and equitable solutions. PepeX’s momentum The launchpad sector has already generated several million dollars in revenue, underscoring the scale of interest and the opportunity PepeX is entering. While the market has recently cooled, discussions around a potential resurgence are growing, particularly if issues of fairness and transparency can be resolved. PepeX positions itself as part of the next evolution in meme coin infrastructure, launching at a time when macroeconomic conditions appear increasingly favorable for high-risk digital assets. Analysts have suggested that expected rate cuts, prompted by shifts in global trade policy, could drive a renewed appetite for speculative assets, including meme coins.

OpenAI’s latest AI image generator, baked into ChatGPT, dropped just yesterday, and already, social media is exploding with AI-crafted memes channeling the iconic style of Studio Ghibli. Think ‘My Neighbor Totoro’ meets Elon Musk – you get the picture? This sudden surge of Generative AI art, while visually captivating, has reignited a critical debate: AI Copyright . Is this playful mimicry just harmless fun, or does it tread into legally murky waters? Let’s dive into the captivating and complex world of AI-generated art and the copyright concerns it raises. Why is OpenAI’s Studio Ghibli Moment Going Viral? It’s hard to miss. Your social media feeds are likely flooded with images that look straight out of a beloved Studio Ghibli film. In just 24 hours since OpenAI launched its new image generation feature within ChatGPT (powered by GPT-4o), users have been enthusiastically experimenting. We’re seeing: Ghibli-fied Celebrities: Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself have been reimagined in the warm, whimsical style of Ghibli animation. Altman even changed his profile picture to a Ghibli-esque avatar, showcasing the tool’s immediate impact. Pop Culture Reboots: ‘The Lord of the Rings’ and other iconic franchises are getting the Studio Ghibli treatment, creating fascinating and often humorous crossovers. Personal Transformations: Users are uploading their own photos and asking ChatGPT to reimagine them in the signature Ghibli style, leading to personalized AI art experiences. Users seem to be uploading existing images and pictures into ChatGPT and asking the chatbot to recreate it in new styles. pic.twitter.com/M8B7eqfNzR — Moon Parameter (@ParamMoon) March 26, 2025 This viral trend highlights the accessibility and power of Generative AI tools, following closely on the heels of Google Gemini’s similar image feature, which also went viral for its watermark removal capabilities. Both platforms have made it incredibly simple to mimic copyrighted artistic styles with just a text prompt. But this ease of creation brings us to a crucial question… Does Recreating Studio Ghibli Style Infringe on Copyright? The rapid adoption of these AI image generators has reignited the debate surrounding AI Copyright and fair use. Are these tools, trained on vast datasets that may include copyrighted material, potentially violating copyright law? Let’s break down the legal complexities: Style vs. Substance: According to IP lawyer Evan Brown, current copyright law primarily protects specific works, not artistic styles themselves. This means that simply generating images that *look like* Studio Ghibli films might not, on the surface, be illegal. The Training Data Question: The legal grey area emerges when considering how these AI models learn styles. It’s plausible that OpenAI ’s model was trained on millions of frames from Studio Ghibli movies to achieve such accurate stylistic replication. Fair Use in Question: Courts are actively grappling with whether training AI on copyrighted material constitutes “fair use.” If it doesn’t, companies like OpenAI could face significant legal challenges. Ongoing Lawsuits: The New York Times and numerous publishers have already filed lawsuits against OpenAI , alleging unauthorized use of copyrighted works in AI model training. Similar lawsuits are targeting Meta and Midjourney. Brown aptly summarizes the core issue: “What are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?” This question remains at the heart of the legal battles surrounding Generative AI . OpenAI’s Stance: Broader Styles vs. Individual Artists In response to the growing copyright concerns , an OpenAI spokesperson clarified their position to Bitcoin World. While ChatGPT is designed to avoid replicating the style of *individual living artists*, it *does* permit the replication of “broader studio styles.” This distinction, however, raises further questions: The Pioneers of Style: Studio Ghibli’s distinctive style is deeply intertwined with the vision of its co-founder, Hayao Miyazaki, a living artist. Can a “studio style” truly be separated from the individual artists who pioneered it? Beyond Ghibli: Users are already pushing the boundaries, successfully recreating styles from other studios like Pixar and even individual artists like Dr. Seuss. This suggests the current limitations might be easily circumvented. studio ghibli is out, dr seuss is in pic.twitter.com/4ECxwLLkoj — Jordi Hays (@jordihays) March 26, 2025 How Does OpenAI’s AI Image Generator Stack Up? To understand the capabilities of these new AI tools, we put several popular image generators to the test, comparing their ability to mimic the Studio Ghibli style. Our findings: AI Image Generator Studio Ghibli Style Replication Accuracy OpenAI (ChatGPT) Highest Accuracy – Remarkably captures the essence of Ghibli’s animation style, including character design, backgrounds, and color palettes. Google Gemini Good – Demonstrates stylistic similarity but sometimes lacks the nuanced charm and detail of OpenAI ‘s output. xAI Grok Moderate – Attempts Ghibli style but results are less consistent and often miss key stylistic elements. Playground.ai Moderate – Can generate Ghibli-inspired images, but requires more prompting and fine-tuning to achieve accurate results. (Left) A real dog vs. (Right) AI-generated Ghibli-style dog by ChatGPT (Credit: Maxwell Zeff/OpenAI) OpenAI ’s new image generator clearly leads the pack in replicating the Studio Ghibli aesthetic, showcasing a significant leap in Generative AI capabilities. The Future of AI Art and Copyright: Waiting for the Courts The overwhelming popularity of OpenAI and Google’s new image features signals a major step forward for Generative AI . The sheer demand has even led OpenAI to delay the rollout of its image tool to free-tier users. While user adoption and technological advancement are rapidly accelerating, the legal landscape is still catching up. The courts will ultimately play a crucial role in defining the boundaries of AI Copyright and determining the legality of training AI models on copyrighted works. For now, we’re in a fascinating, and somewhat legally precarious, era of AI-generated art.

Is this a recipe for disaster or a calculated risk? Let’s delve into the unfolding saga of Unicoin and its high-stakes gamble amidst regulatory headwinds. If you’re invested in the crypto world, especially in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation , this story demands your attention. Why is Unicoin Still Under SEC Scrutiny? Despite requesting an end to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force investigation, Unicoin has reportedly received no response, according to CoinDesk. This silence from the regulatory body speaks volumes, especially considering the initial notification Unicoin received at the end of last year. The SEC had then signaled its intention to charge Unicoin with serious allegations, including: Fraud : Accusations of misleading investors or engaging in fraudulent schemes. Deceptive Practices : Allegations of employing deceptive tactics in their crypto operations. Dealing in Unregistered Securities : Potentially offering or selling securities without proper SEC registration. These are not light accusations. They strike at the heart of investor protection and regulatory compliance within the cryptocurrency space. The ongoing SEC probe casts a long shadow over Unicoin’s ambitious plans. Unicoin’s Audacious IPO Plans Amid Regulatory Cloud What makes this situation even more intriguing is Unicoin’s unwavering commitment to an Initial Public Offering (IPO). While many companies might retreat and address regulatory concerns before considering such a significant step, Unicoin is seemingly pressing forward. CEO Alex Konanykhin’s return to New York from Europe, driven by Trump’s vision of the U.S. as a crypto hub, underscores this determination. But is this ambition misplaced in the face of an active SEC probe ? Navigating the Complexities of Cryptocurrency Regulation Unicoin’s predicament highlights the broader challenges faced by blockchain companies operating in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency regulation . The SEC’s role is to ensure investor protection and market integrity, and their scrutiny of Unicoin is part of this larger effort. Here’s a look at the complexities: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty The rules governing cryptocurrencies are still being developed and interpreted, leading to ambiguity for businesses. Global Reach vs. Local Laws Crypto operates globally, but regulations are often jurisdiction-specific, creating compliance hurdles. Defining Securities Determining whether a crypto asset is a security or not is complex and often subject to SEC interpretation, as seen in the Unicoin IPO case. Enforcement Actions The SEC has been actively enforcing regulations, as evidenced by the SEC probe into Unicoin and other crypto firms. Has the Regulatory Climate Shifted? The content mentions that “other crypto firms have been released from enforcement actions by the agency’s new leadership since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.” This suggests a potential shift in the regulatory climate. Is the SEC becoming more lenient? Or are these releases specific cases unrelated to Unicoin’s situation? It’s crucial to understand that while there might be individual instances of eased enforcement, the overall commitment to cryptocurrency regulation remains strong. It’s possible that the releases refer to cases where firms demonstrated proactive compliance or addressed the SEC’s concerns effectively. However, Unicoin’s ongoing SEC probe indicates that not all firms are experiencing a smooth ride. What’s Next for Unicoin and the Crypto Market? Unicoin’s journey through this SEC probe will be closely watched by the entire crypto industry. Here’s what to consider: Transparency is Key : How Unicoin responds to the SEC’s concerns and communicates with the public will be critical. Precedent Setting : The outcome of this case could set precedents for how the SEC approaches other blockchain companies planning IPOs. Investor Confidence : The SEC probe undoubtedly impacts investor confidence in Unicoin, and potentially the broader crypto market. Geopolitical Factors : Konanykhin’s return based on Trump’s crypto-friendly stance introduces a geopolitical dimension to this regulatory challenge. For those following crypto news , Unicoin’s story is a stark reminder of the interplay between innovation, regulation, and ambition in the digital asset space. Will Unicoin successfully navigate this SEC probe and achieve its IPO dreams? Or will regulatory hurdles prove too significant? The coming months will reveal the answer. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Crypto Gamble Unicoin’s decision to pursue an IPO while under an active SEC investigation is a bold move, bordering on audacious. It underscores the inherent risks and rewards within the cryptocurrency sector. The ongoing SEC probe presents a significant challenge, but Unicoin’s leadership seems determined to overcome it. This situation serves as a crucial case study for anyone involved or interested in cryptocurrency regulation , blockchain companies , and the future of crypto news . Keep a close watch on Unicoin – their journey reflects the larger battles being fought and won (or lost) in the dynamic world of digital finance.

Blockchain stats from etherscan show Vitalik Buterin transferred 250 ETH, worth approximately $500K, to privacy platform Railgun. Wu Blockchain @WuBlockchain · Follow Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin (vitalik.eth) transferred 250 ETH (~$500k) to the privacy protocol Railgun 7 hours ago. Vitalik Buterin has previously stated that privacy is normal, and Railgun utilizes a privacy pool protocol that effectively prevents malicious actors from 6:49 am · 27 Mar 2025 124 Reply Copy link Read 15 replies The transaction has sparked debate regarding its motive and possible implications. Privacy crypto protocols have been on investors’ radar lately, especially after the US OFAC removed Tornado Cash from its sanctioned entities . Understanding Railgun Railgun is a privacy-focused network that allows individuals to hide their transaction footprints on Ethereum and EVM-compatible protocols such as Avalanche and Polygon. Railgun uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure financial privacy in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The protocol allows individuals to hold private balances without compromising smart contract compatibility. That’s unlike old-fashioned mixers, which use pooling to shield transaction histories. While the transaction’s motive remains unclear, multiple factors could have influenced Buterin’s move to Railgun. Ethereum’s co-founder is a recognized blockchain expert. His transfers could indicate an experiment to examine Railgun’s security and competence. Moreover, Buterin has previously navigated privacy-focused mechanisms. Some technologies he has explored include zk-Succinct no-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) and zk- Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs). He also referenced Tornado Cash as a sufficient privacy mixer. Further, Buterin advocates for privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. What does it mean for Ether and the crypto market Vitalik’s moves often impact the Ethereum ecosystem and the cryptocurrency market. For instance, PolitiFi tokens suffered user exodus after his criticism . His latest transaction with Railgun could reflect his dedication to financial privacy. Ethereum uses a public ledger, making all transactions visible. Some experts argue that the approach undermines monetary confidentiality. Buterin’s active exploration of privacy-focused solutions could suggest potential integrations to bolster Etehreum’s privacy. Notably, the move emerges amid regulatory developments linked to privacy protocols. Recently, the US OFAC removed sanctions on crypto mixer Tornado Cash. In 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash for not implementing adequate controls to prevent malicious actors from laundering funds through the crypto mixer. Community response The cryptocurrency community remained divided on Buterin’s potential motive and market implications. Some see the transfer as a simple test, while others believe it is a step toward improving Ethereum’s ecosystem with privacy solutions. Source – X Whether an experiment or a strategic decision, Buterin’s transaction with Railgun confirms increased interest in privacy crypto solutions. Enthusiasts will watch whether these protocols will be crucial for the next wave of blockchain evolution. Ethereum trades at $2,026 after losing 2% in the past 24 hours.

This recovery marks a shift in short-term sentiment after several weeks of price turbulence. While the asset remains down approximately 20.2% from its all-time high set in January, the current rebound suggests a pause in downward pressure and a potential reassessment among market participants. Despite the recent uptick, traders and analysts remain cautious. Market behavior has been mixed, with on-chain metrics and trading activity offering differing signals. CryptoQuant contributor Nino recently provided a breakdown of the Coinbase Premium Index and its implications for Bitcoin’s short-term direction, pointing to changing sentiment in the US market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pushes Past $88K Amid Rising Volatility and On-Chain Resistance Zones Coinbase Premium Turns Positive Amid Stabilizing Price In a recent QuickTake post titled “Is the Coinbase Premium Signaling a Bullish Shift for Bitcoin?”, Nino observed that the index—which measures the price gap between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges—had hovered near zero for weeks. However, it now appears to be entering positive territory. This trend, if sustained, may reflect a growing appetite from US-based traders and institutions. Historically, a positive Coinbase Premium has coincided with increased spot demand and broader upward price momentum. Nino added that while this shift can be a bullish signal, it should be evaluated alongside other market indicators such as trading volume and on-chain metrics. These combined factors help clarify whether the move represents real buying conviction or short-term speculation. In parallel, renowned market analyst Ali noted that following Bitcoin’s surge above $70,000 in late 2024, stablecoin reserves grew from $26 billion to $46 billion—often an indication of profit-taking by investors. Now that reserves have plateaued, the market may be entering a period of reduced selling pressure, as participants appear to be waiting for new catalysts before re-entering. After #Bitcoin $BTC broke $70,000 in late 2024, stablecoin reserves jumped from $26 billion to $46 billion, signaling heavy profit-taking. Now that reserves have plateaued, it looks like investors are sitting on the sidelines. pic.twitter.com/PRtOQnNq5x — Ali (@ali_charts) March 26, 2025 Bitcoin Whale Accumulation and Long-Term Signals Further reinforcing this narrative, Ali also pointed to new whale accumulation trends. Specifically, 48 new Bitcoin wallets have surpassed the 100 BTC threshold, indicating growing holdings among large-scale investors. This increase in whale addresses is generally interpreted as a sign of confidence in long-term price appreciation. When whales accumulate during consolidation phases, it can reflect expectations for upward movement once market uncertainty subsides. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend, But Analyst Warns Of Strong Resistance Ahead Whale behavior has historically played a significant role in shaping Bitcoin’s market structure. Accumulation at higher levels can act as price support while selling activity from these holders can introduce major volatility.

This price action demonstrates healthy accumulation with decreasing volatility while maintaining higher lows since the local bottom. The rise is led by the Walrus Protocol mainnet launch , which is a popular decentralized storage network powered by the SUI blockchain. Therefore, the price is expected to trigger another 25% upswing and rise above $3 ahead of the quarterly close. The SUI price has surged by over 6% to 7% since the early trading hours and has surpassed giants like Shiba Inu and Hedera. With this, the token has become one of the top layer-1 cryptos with a potential of displaying a 100x rally for the upcoming bull cycle. The token underwent a tremendous retest and is displaying huge buying opportunities at these levels. Therefore, this suggests that the SUI price rally has just started, and hence, a new ATH can be expected in April 2025. After plunging from the highs, the price remained consolidated within a falling wedge that was broken during the previous trading day. The bullish start for the day, mainly above the resistance of the wedge, is expected to keep up the rally until the end. Besides, the RSI is incremental, and the DMI underwent a bullish crossover. However, the ADX continues to plunge, indicating a drop in the strength of the rally. Therefore, the SUI price may remain consolidated around the local resistance zone of around $2.8 and $2.85 until the platform does not receive a huge buying volume. The SUI price has retraced much deeper and smashed a major support zone, and hence, the rebound is expected to attract a huge liquidity onto the platform. Moreover, the Walrus Protocol mainnet launch is also seen as a major catalyst that may keep up the momentum of the rally for a long time. Therefore, the SUI price has begun to breakout and is believed to rise above $3 before the end of the month. With this, the price is expected to maintain a strong ascending trend and reach a new ATH in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SUI|BLOCKCHAIN|SHIB|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 07:36:45

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 3.63% in 24 hours to $2.36. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. Talking about the XRP price, it is presently down 3.63% to $2.36. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.462. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $2.3192. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.36562580 -4.03% Market cap $ 137,692,899,431.23 Circulating Supply 58,205,697,378.00 Trading Volume $ 3,347,207,297.2116 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 27th shows 646k outflows in comparison to 290k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs-up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Arctic Pablo Leads The Best New Meme Coins For Exponential Returns Amid Gigachad And Brett’s Rapid Rise,https://thecoinrise.com/grab-12-million-tokens-for-1k-arctic-pablo-leads-the-best-new-meme-coins-for-exponential-returns-amid-gigachad-and-bretts-rapid-rise/,"The meme coin market in 2025 is off its rocker—and that’s putting it mildly. Gen Z and Millennial crypto traders are diving headfirst into the wildest new tokens in search of sky-high returns, viral community vibes, and narratives that actually get the blood pumping. So, if you’re chasing the best meme coins for exponential returns, you’re in the right place. In this guide, lets strapping in and going full throttle into Arctic Pablo Coin , Gigachad, and Brett—three meme coin monsters lighting up the crypto radar. Whether you’re keen on deep lore, Solana-powered surges, or BASE-backed bangers, this list packs serious punch. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns — Ride the Ice-Cracking Presale Into 9552%+ Gains Right out the gate, Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a meme coin presale —it’s a mythical movement. As the Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale isn’t based on boring stages or arbitrary price jumps. Instead, Pablo—the cartoon arctic explorer—is journeying through legendary locations, and each location represents a new presale phase. Currently, he’s diving deep into Crystal Cove, the 16th location, and the $APC token price is just $0.000083. But here’s the kicker: if $APC lists at $0.008, a humble $1000 investment today could explode into $96,385.52.That’s 12,048,190.00 tokens for a thousand bucks. Absolute madness. The tokenomics are even juicier. As the Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns, Arctic Pablo Coin is built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), with a total supply of 221.2 billion tokens and a deflationary burn model. Each week, unsold tokens are torched, permanently reducing supply. And the presale? It doesn’t just tick along—it automatically increases the price every week, no matter what. No pauses. No gimmicks. Just raw, deflationary fire. Even better? The staking rewards slap hard—lets talking 66% APY. Stake your Arctic Pablo Coin tokens and watch your wallet swell while Pablo pushes through frozen realms in search of ancient riches. Just know your staked $APC will be locked for two months from launch day. But hey, the gains? Worth the wait. And let’s not ignore the vibes. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a presale. It’s a full-blown cartoon adventure, with each location unveiling secret myths, glowing coins, and snow-slicked mysteries. Pablo’s currently surfing ancient Atlantean currents in Crystal Cove, uncovering treasure maps, whispering mermaids, and coins that practically beg to be hoarded. With over $2 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining serious traction. It’s meme meets myth, wrapped in slick tokenomics, and delivered on a blazing-fast BSC contract. If you’re chasing the Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns , Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t a maybe—it’s your icy golden ticket. Gigachad (GIGA): Solana’s Alpha Beast Charging Back from the Shadows Gigachad ain’t here to play nice. This Solana-powered meme coin is flexing harder than a bodybuilder on pre-workout. Currently trading at $0.02338, GIGA is making waves with a 36.67% gain in the past 24 hours. It’s backed by a $217.52 million market cap and a whopping $25.62 million daily volume, meaning liquidity’s flowing like protein shakes at a gym convention. The token’s supply sits at 9.3 billion, just shy of its 10 billion cap. There’s still room for growth, but the scarcity angle is kicking in too, making this a powder keg waiting for the right spark. And let’s not forget—it once hit an ATH of $0.09511 back in January 2025. That’s over 75% off from the top, which screams opportunity for any savvy degens hunting value. But here’s where GIGA gets wild. The coin’s already up a jaw-dropping 1,274,610% from its all-time low. Let that sink in. This isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan token. This is a proven monster that’s shown it can rocket like a SpaceX launch, even from the ashes. Brett (BRETT): The Base Chain’s Meme Market Royalty With Major Room to Run Let’s be real: Brett is based AF. And that’s not just a meme—it’s the mission. BRETT is currently riding a nice 11.60% daily pump, sitting at $0.04059. With a $402.27 million market cap and $21.75 million in daily trading volume, this Base Chain baddie is gaining serious traction in the meme coin ecosystem. The circulating supply’s nearly maxed at 9.91 billion tokens out of 10 billion, making Brett an absolute scarcity play. Sure, it’s still 82% off its ATH of $0.235, but don’t let that throw you off. Since its all-time low, it’s ripped +37,580.68%. That’s the kind of performance that makes crypto whales raise eyebrows and weekend warriors FOMO in (okay, we almost used the word). What gives BRETT this edge? It’s got cultural meme status, tight tokenomics, and it’s riding shotgun on the rising Base ecosystem, which is getting more devs and users than ever. Plus, Brett doesn’t take itself too seriously—it’s got that chaotic Gen Z humor, drip-fed into meme culture, and polished with network utility. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin stands tall as the most unique and promising meme coin of 2025. It’s not just another token—it’s a full-blown mythical journey through crypto lore. The presale model, weekly burns, narrative world-building, and 66% APY staking make it a no-brainer for anyone chasing the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Gigachad brings the Solana heat with undeniable strength and comeback potential. Meanwhile, Brett continues to stack meme power on Base Chain, proving its resilience and explosive ROI capacity. But let’s be honest, if you’re holding onto $1,000 and you miss Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale at Crystal Cove, you might be kicking yourself later when those listing prices explode. Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and lock in your seat on Pablo’s snowmobile before it vanishes into the next location.

42468434,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=700852,1743061527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42468434.jpeg,Robinhood to launch bank accounts with cash delivery to your door,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robinhood-to-launch-bank-accounts/,"Robinhood just confirmed it’s building full-scale banking services into its app—and those services will include a feature for cash delivery straight to your house. The announcement came on Wednesday during its event Robinhood Presents: The Lost City of Gold, where the company laid out its newest products: Robinhood Banking, Robinhood Strategies, and Robinhood Cortex. All three are designed to expand its reach beyond trading into areas traditionally reserved for the wealthy. According to the company’s announcement, Robinhood Banking will launch in the fall of 2025, and it’s only available to Robinhood Gold members. Once live, users can open both checking and savings accounts inside the Robinhood Credit Card app, which will officially become the central banking app for all Robinhood financial tools. Gold members will get access to private banking services, traditional features like wire transfers, and luxury options like on-demand cash delivery, eliminating the need to visit an ATM. Robinhood promises private banking and luxury perks inside its app The upcoming banking platform includes 4.00% APY on savings accounts, which Robinhood says is nine times the national average. Users will be able to open individual, joint, and even children’s accounts with spending controls and built-in allowances. Every user will receive a debit Mastercard, and the platform supports money movement across 100+ currencies, international transfers, and real-time transfers between Robinhood accounts. Deepak Rao, Robinhood’s GM and VP of Money, said , “With Robinhood Banking, we’re trying to solve many of the challenges presented by legacy banks.” He added that the service was “designed to be as easy to use as possible” while offering benefits usually kept for the ultra-wealthy. Source: Robinhood Accounts will come with up to $2.5 million in FDIC insurance, around-the-clock support, and estate planning services. Professional tax advice will also be available through the platform. Users can monitor their net worth, see totals across linked accounts, and track assets held outside Robinhood. The cash delivery feature is part of a list of luxury perks, which also includes access to private jets, chauffeurs, helicopters, and tickets to invite-only events like the Met Gala, the Oscars, the F1 Monaco Grand Prix, and The Masters. Robinhood Banking is the follow-up to the Robinhood Gold Card, which launched last year. Over 100,000 users already have it, and the waitlist stands at nearly 3 million people. This week, Robinhood said it’s moving another 100,000 users off the waitlist. Robinhood Strategies introduces managed portfolios with capped fees Also announced at the event was Robinhood Strategies, which gives users tailored portfolios, financial guidance, and market insights inside the app. It’s available now for Gold members, with access for all users starting in April 2025. The platform offers portfolio management with a flat 0.25% annual fee, capped at $250 for Gold users. Anything over $100,000 is managed for free. So if your portfolio hits $250,000, that’s effectively 0.1% in fees, and at $500,000, it drops to 0.05%. Steph Guild, President of Robinhood Asset Management, said, “We realized the existing digital advisory model was broken, with limited features and fees that grow as you do better. We designed Robinhood Strategies to give everyone incredible service and low fees with a cap.” According to Robinhood, the team running this service has more than 50 years of combined experience on Wall Street, including managing accounts for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. Source: Robinhood The product builds portfolios using a foundation of diversified ETFs, with hand-picked single stocks chosen to take advantage of market behavior. Users get transparency through regular portfolio updates and market analysis right in the app. The platform gives users a dashboard that displays portfolio performance, asset allocation, and return drivers. It also allows recurring deposits and simulated return projections using Monte Carlo simulations. Robinhood said users can block specific stocks they don’t want in their portfolio and adjust preferences to match their risk level and time horizon. Tax features are included as well. Robinhood Strategies will attempt to minimize capital gains by selecting specific tax lots for selling. It will also allow users to manage external assets and enforce turnover limits to control taxes in brokerage accounts. Toward the end of the year, users will receive a breakdown of their gains and losses to help with tax-loss harvesting. Right now, the platform supports individual and retirement accounts, and Robinhood said joint accounts are on the way. Gold members who fund accounts by June 30 get the first $1,000 managed for free through the end of 2025. Non-Gold users get $500 managed free under the same timeline. Through May 30, Gold users also receive a 1% transfer boost up to $500, and non-Gold users get a 1% deposit boost up to $250. Robinhood Cortex adds AI-powered market analysis for retail traders The third product announced was Robinhood Cortex, a new AI tool that helps users break down market news and generate trade ideas. It’s not automated trading. It’s real-time research, and it’s built into the same app as Robinhood’s other tools. Abhishek Fatehpuria, VP of Brokerage Product, said, “High quality, premium investment and market analysis has historically been reserved for institutional investors and the rich. Over time, Robinhood Cortex will completely transform the Robinhood experience as we strive to bridge that gap and put a premium research assistant right in your pocket.” The first feature inside Cortex is Stock Digests, which shows a summary of what’s affecting any given stock. Users can tap a ticker and immediately get an update on news events, technical factors, or analyst reports that might be moving the price. The goal is to cut through the noise and get a short answer to the question: “Why is this stock up or down today?” The other feature is called Trade Builder. This lets users input their outlook for a stock, and Cortex responds by recommending a potential options trade based on that belief. It uses signals like price patterns, market data, and technical analysis to suggest strategies. Cortex will not place trades for users—it just helps gather and organize the information. Fatehpuria said the company expects Cortex to keep growing over time. In the future, it will be integrated into other areas of the app, improving how users research trades, manage risk, and interact with their portfolios. The tool will launch later this year, with early access going to Robinhood Gold members. All three products—Banking, Strategies, and Cortex—are set to roll out across 2025. All of them are tied to Robinhood’s push to give regular retail users tools that have traditionally belonged to elite firms and private banks. Every single part of the new lineup was presented as being available through a phone, with no in-person visits or paperwork needed. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In 6 years, the company has grown from a local project to a leader in the European market. Today, the WhiteBIT Group ecosystem has over 35 million clients and includes various blockchain and crypto solutions, including a decentralized exchange, crypto processing, its own blockchain, and more. In a new interview, Volodymyr Nosov shares how the company transformed tough challenges into new opportunities and success through determination and innovation. The founder and president of WhiteBIT Group talks about the exchange’s start, rapid global expansion, and corporate culture, and shares his expert opinion on introducing regulation in the crypto market and the future of meme coins. How our launch in the bear market made us stronger Volodymyr, you founded the WhiteBIT cryptocurrency exchange six years ago, which soon became the largest in Europe. Please share a bit about your background and what led you to crypto. Everyone has a unique journey—what’s yours? WhiteBIT Group has come a long way from a startup to a global business. Today, our ecosystem serves over 35 million users and includes many blockchain and crypto products and services. However, it all started as a local project, with the creation of the WhiteBIT exchange. I’ve always been passionate about innovation—building something impactful, shaping the future, and improving everyday processes has been my driving force. 2016 was a turning point for me. That’s when I started exploring blockchain and Bitcoin, eager to invest and understand how to store crypto securely. I quickly realized that existing exchanges were far from user-friendly—they lacked essential features and provided a poor experience. This led me to conceptualize a crypto exchange that would meet user needs. In just over six years, what started as an exchange has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem, offering various blockchain and crypto solutions. Today, WhiteBIT continues to expand, shaping the industry and setting new standards in the market. WhiteBIT was founded in 2018 and has endured time and volatile markets. It now serves over 8 million users and has a $2.7 trillion annual trading volume. Can you take us back to its early days as a startup? We launched WhiteBIT in 2018 during a bear market—arguably one of the most challenging times to enter the industry. However, these harsh conditions shaped us. They forced us to stay focused, optimize resources, and build a solid foundation. When we were just starting, during peak loads or high registration periods, every specialist—regardless of their role—jumped in to help process client applications. We worked day and night as one well-coordinated team. No one stood aside; everyone was invested in the company’s success. Today, we are a team of 1,200, a full-fledged group of companies with a strong corporate culture and well-established processes. Over the years, we’ve grown, scaled, and improved key business metrics—and even accumulated some bureaucracy along the way (laughs). WhiteBIT Group is a vast blockchain ecosystem with various products that meet the needs of crypto and blockchain users worldwide. Apart from its flagship project, the WhiteBIT crypto exchange, WhiteBIT Group encompasses the Whitechain blockchain with its native coin, WhiteBIT Coin (WBT), the crypto acquiring solution Whitepay, the WhitePool mining pool, the decentralized exchange WhiteSwap, the WB Soul ecosystem, the CS marketplace White.market, and crypto education initiatives like ByHi and The Coinomist. We continue to expand and innovate, proving that a company born in a bear market can survive and thrive.

It was a matter of principle for us to stop working with the Russian market after the full-scale invasion. We took all necessary measures to block transactions by Russian citizens. First, we disabled all payment gateways that allowed deposits or withdrawals in Russian rubles. Second, we removed all trading pairs involving the ruble. Third, we completely restricted Russian users from registering on our platform—both through KYC verification and by blocking access based on IP addresses. At the time, Russian users comprised nearly 30% of our client base, meaning we faced an immediate and substantial loss. However, instead of looking back, we chose to diversify and innovate, pushing forward with new business strategies to ensure sustainable growth. As a result, 2022 became a pivotal year for WhiteBIT, marked by the launch of numerous new products, projects, and partnerships. For example, in 2022, we expanded into the Turkish market, establishing a strong presence in a promising new region. Since then, we have entered the markets of Spain, Portugal, Georgia, Australia, Kazakhstan, Croatia, and Italy. Beyond product development, strategic partnerships played a key role in our expansion. In the fall of 2022, we became the official crypto partner of Trabzonspor, one of Turkey’s leading football clubs. Just a month later, we achieved another significant milestone—becoming the official cryptocurrency partner of FC Barcelona, further solidifying our presence in the global sports and crypto ecosystem. Our support for Ukraine during the war exceeds $11 million WhiteBIT has been a strong supporter of Ukraine during the war. Can you share some key initiatives the exchange has undertaken to aid the country? Many of our team members are Ukrainian, and for many of them, the war is deeply personal—friends, family members, and colleagues have joined the front lines as soldiers, medics, or volunteers. From the very beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, WhiteBIT has been committed to actively supporting Ukraine. One of our key initiatives was signing a memorandum of cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Through this partnership, we launched a 24-hour call center and a chatbot to assist Ukrainians worldwide. Beyond humanitarian support, WhiteBIT has provided direct financial aid to support Ukraine. Over three years of full-scale war, starting February 24, 2022, we have donated more than $11 million of our funds. Our dedication remains steadfast, and we continue to explore new ways to contribute to the country’s resilience and recovery. You started in Ukraine but expanded the market into Europe. If Ukraine had remained geopolitically stable, do you think WhiteBIT would have achieved the same level of success, or did the situation in the country act as a catalyst for global expansion? We have always aimed high, building WhiteBIT with a strong focus on technological innovation and top-tier security. From the start, our goal was to create a platform that could compete with the biggest global players. Our team has worked tirelessly to refine and enhance our product, ensuring it meets the highest industry standards. Global expansion has always been part of our vision, and every step we’ve taken has been focused on steady growth and long-term success. What key factors would you say have contributed to your success in the crypto industry? Our success is built on three key pillars: security, user experience, and strategic growth. First and foremost, we prioritize reliability and security, which are the cornerstones of any leading crypto exchange. WhiteBIT became the first crypto exchange in the world to achieve the highest level of certification under the Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS). Secondly, we’ve always been user-focused, continuously improving our product to meet the evolving demands of modern traders. Today’s users expect more than just basic functionality—they want an intuitive interface, diverse trading pairs, and innovative tools. We’ve tailored our platform to serve individual traders and institutional clients while developing strong marketing strategies, including top-tier referral programs. Recently, in partnership with Visa, we introduced the WhiteBIT Nova card, a debit card for daily cryptocurrency payments, adding even more value for our users. Another key factor is our global expansion strategy and collaborations with industry leaders. For example, we established official partnerships with VISA and ESL Faceit. Finally, our greatest strength is our team. With over 1,200 dedicated professionals, we are constantly enhancing the platform, launching new products, and engaging with our growing community of 35+ million users. Our team shares a deep belief in the future of crypto, working tirelessly to ensure WhiteBIT remains at the forefront of the industry. The WhiteBIT Nova card surpassed 1 million transactions in 3 months You mentioned the WhiteBIT Nova card. Given the considerable competition in the crypto card market, how successful do you view this project to be? We didn’t just launch another crypto payment card—we created something truly valuable. WhiteBIT Nova is the first-ever debit card for payments using digital assets with cashback, introduced in late 2024 in partnership with Visa. Unlike many competitors, we offer zero fees for opening or closing, which our customers appreciate. In just three months, we’ve recorded over a million transactions. Users frequently pay using USDC, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and WhiteBIT Token, often for subscriptions and services like Spotify, YouTube, Booking, KFC, and Ryanair. Cashback is most commonly earned on everyday purchases—groceries, dining, taxis, entertainment, and gaming. As expected, 89% of users prefer the digital version of the WhiteBIT Nova card, while only 11% opt for a physical card. The industry is flooded with new tokens—600,000 were launched in January alone. Are we in another ICO-style bubble, or is this just a sign of increasing crypto adoption? How do exchanges like WhiteBIT filter out real projects from the noise? We have a rigorous process for listing new coins. We carefully evaluate each project, its goals, and its unique features. Our listing procedure involves several stages. Initially, we discuss their technology, tokenomics, and legal compliance with the project’s team. We conduct a preliminary check to weed out fraudulent or low-quality projects that don’t meet our basic listing criteria. If the project passes this initial filter, we proceed with a more detailed analysis. This includes assessing legal compliance, project viability, and security measures, and evaluating the asset’s liquidity. Any project we list must offer enough liquidity to maintain a healthy trading environment and avoid excessive volatility. That being said, we also listen to our users. Many of them request certain high-risk assets in which they can allocate part of their portfolio, even if the success of these projects is uncertain. However, when we decide to filter out certain meme tokens or high-risk projects, it’s often done in response to user feedback. We aim to strike a balance between offering innovative projects and protecting the interests of our traders. What are your thoughts on the meme cycle? What do you think will be the community’s breaking point, especially after that high-profile back-to-back rug pulls? Are memes gonna die this year like NFTs did in 2022? Meme coins are not a recent phenomenon—they’ve been around since the first global hype in 2017. Take Dogecoin, for example, one of the oldest meme coins. It gained significant attention, even earning support from figures like Elon Musk. While Dogecoin continues to have a decent market cap, the reality is that any project without real utility or tangible benefits will eventually fizzle out. As industry regulation deepens, meme coins will face even greater challenges. Over the next few years, the market will likely cleanse itself of these short-lived hype projects. For instance, investors and companies backing Bitcoin have little interest in these types of projects. They dilute the audience and financial flows. With 600,000 tokens being launched each month, the target audience gets fragmented. Instead of focusing on core assets like Bitcoin and Ether, users are spread thin across countless tokens. For larger market players, it’s more beneficial to build a market audience around key coins like Bitcoin and Ether, increasing their demand and value. This shift will gradually lead to meme coins fading from the market as the focus moves back to assets with real, long-term value. Being a global player, how do you see the crypto regulatory landscape evolving across major regions? Mass legalization and regulation of cryptocurrencies will be among the most significant factors shaping the market’s development in 2025. More countries are set to adopt clear legislative frameworks, which will provide a much-needed boost for the global expansion of the crypto ecosystem. For example, implementing MiCA in the European Union opens many new opportunities. With a well-defined regulatory environment, the market will gain new tools—crypto projects will have access to banking and fintech services. At the same time, traditional financial institutions can tap into blockchain technologies. This will lead to greater availability of virtual assets for users. I think the adoption rate will soar when crypto is integrated into familiar platforms, such as German banks or mainstream apps. Virtual assets will increasingly find their way into banking products, telecommunication services, and marketplaces, making them more accessible and practical for everyday use. Regulatory clarity, combined with this wider integration, will make virtual assets more understandable and user-friendly for the mass market, much like the experience in Asian countries, where people have a deeper understanding of the industry compared to Europe. The team’s role and the upcoming trading competition Finally, let’s discuss your team. How has your team and corporate culture changed during the rapid growth of the company and its international expansion? Over the past three years, our team has grown 5x, bringing together 1,200 top professionals worldwide. We’ve built a truly global presence with official offices in Europe (UK, Lithuania, Ukraine, Georgia, Portugal), Asia (Turkey), and Australia. At WhiteBIT, our team is the foundation of everything we do. We are proud to work with the best of the best—passionate, driven experts who push the boundaries of innovation every day. At the same time, we are deeply committed to nurturing young talent and fostering a culture of continuous learning. We prioritize vertical growth—helping our employees advance their careers—and horizontal development, encouraging cross-functional expertise and collaboration. To support this, we have developed a range of internal programs. Knowledge-sharing is at the heart of our culture: we host regular internal sessions where team members exchange expertise and insights. We have also introduced exclusive crypto education courses to equip our employees with top-tier industry knowledge. Beyond theory, we emphasize real-world learning experiences—our recent WhiteBIT Crypto Trading tournament is just one example of how we create hands-on opportunities for professional growth. Our expansion continues rapidly—just last year, we welcomed 200+ new professionals. As we grow, we remain committed to building a strong and future-focused team that drives the evolution of the crypto industry. Do you intend to host similar competitions for a larger audience? This spring, we are launching the first-ever International Crypto Trading Cup (ICTC), a groundbreaking event that will bring cryptocurrency trading to the big stage with a live broadcast. The tournament will feature eight elite traders competing in live futures trading using a dedicated game capital provided by WhiteBIT. This ensures a secure environment where participants can fully showcase their skills. Hence, ICTC is an educational experience in its essence. Millions of viewers worldwide will have the chance to watch top professionals make real-time decisions, track their trades, and analyze their strategies, gaining invaluable insights along the way. Secondly, it’s set to be an exciting, large-scale trading show where anyone can participate. Viewers will be able to compete against star traders online—individually or as part of squads led by experienced leaders. On top of that, we have valuable prizes and surprises in store. One of the eight star traders will be chosen from our global trading community. From March 27 to April 7, we host a Qualifying trading tournament to select a standout trader who will join the top seven professionals on stage for the main event in May.

Table of Contents XRP battles resistance as it struggles to hold above two dollars Payment altcoin Remittix becomes the top pick over XRP Remittix presale explodes as XRP fatigue sets in XRP is facing heavy resistance at the $2.50 mark, with momentum slowing despite bullish market conditions. As signs of buyer fatigue set in, investors are beginning to look elsewhere, specifically toward Remittix (RTX), a rising payment-focused altcoin offering real-world utility and rapid adoption. While XRP remains weighed down by past regulatory scars and sluggish breakout attempts, Remittix’s explosive presale and instant crypto-to-fiat features are drawing serious attention. The shift suggests a growing appetite for practical blockchain solutions in 2025. XRP battles resistance as it struggles to hold above two dollars The XRP price is testing investor patience as it hovers just below a key psychological level. After a long legal standoff with the SEC, Ripple finally cleared its regulatory hurdles, sparking waves of optimism. But that momentum is beginning to fade. XRP has struggled to decisively break past $2.50, despite being added to the U.S. Digital Asset Reserve, a milestone many expected would ignite a sustained rally. Instead, the token is showing signs of buyer fatigue. At $2.47, the XRP price has posted only modest gains, and technical indicators suggest it’s hitting liquidity resistance near the $2.60 mark. Even with Bitcoin’s rally lifting the broader market, XRP has failed to keep up with the surging energy. Some traders point to thinning volume and slowing upward pressure as red flags. The initial buzz around ETF speculation and Ripple’s stablecoin plans has cooled, leaving investors looking elsewhere for faster gains. While XRP continues to position itself as a global payment solution, others argue that the market has already priced in much of its near-term potential. That sentiment is reflected in capital rotation happening in real time, funds are now flowing toward newer payment-based altcoins that promise not just legacy use cases, but innovation. One such rising token is already pulling ahead in terms of both momentum and user demand, and for many investors, it’s becoming the more attractive play.

Payment altcoin Remittix becomes the top pick over XRP As XRP faces stiff resistance at $2.50, a new altcoin quietly reshaping the payment conversation is gaining serious traction. Remittix (RTX), a next-gen Ethereum -based token, is rapidly becoming the investor favorite among those frustrated by XRP’s sluggish breakout attempts. Traders who once doubled down on XRP are now turning to Remittix, drawn by its practical crypto-to-fiat remittance system and explosive upside potential. Unlike speculative memecoins or stalled Layer-1s, Remittix offers an immediate real-world utility, instant crypto conversions to fiat, which are then deposited straight into bank accounts worldwide. The platform removes delays, minimizes fees, and enables international payments with a level of ease XRP originally promised but has yet to fully deliver. This shift in focus toward utility has not gone unnoticed. The project has already raised more than $14 million and sold over 522 million tokens, despite still being in presale at just $0.0734. Early backers are already celebrating returns of over 1,000%, while projections of a 50x to 100x surge after launch continue to attract investors watching XRP stagnate near resistance. With XRP struggling to build momentum and Remittix consistently outperforming expectations, the narrative is changing. Remittix presale explodes as XRP fatigue sets in Analysts are pointing to the increasing shift in retail and institutional sentiment, away from established names and toward functional, high-upside platforms like Remittix. As momentum builds, it’s no longer a question of whether Remittix can match XRP’s rise; it’s whether it can outperform it entirely. With adoption accelerating and attention shifting, this payment altcoin isn’t just another alternative. It’s the one investors believe could redefine the payment sector of crypto.

With President Trump expected to sign the bill , it could officially become law by the end of the week. The bill’s supporters say this will ease pressure on DeFi developers and help grow blockchain innovation. The vote took place on March 26, when senators passed H.J. Res. 25 with a strong 70-28 majority. This resolution, led by Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mike Carey, had already been passed earlier in March but needed a second vote due to budget rules. The House had previously approved it with a 292-132 vote. Crypto advocate Dan Gambardello called the move “bullish,” pointing out that fewer regulations will likely lead to more innovation. Journalist Eleanor Terrett said, based on a Republican source in the Senate, that the bill could become law by Friday. If President Trump signs it under the Congressional Review Act, it would be the first crypto-related bill to become U.S. law . Earlier this month, David Sacks, the White House advisor for AI and crypto, voiced his support for the resolution, saying Trump’s senior advisors would suggest signing it. This development comes at a time when the crypto industry is pushing for more clear and fair rules. A coalition of organizations—such as Coinbase, Kraken, Paradigm, A16z Crypto, and Polygon Labs—sent a letter to Congress on March 26. The letter was addressed to key committees in the Senate and House, including Banking, Judiciary, and Financial Services. In the letter, the DeFi Education Fund and its partners criticized the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) interpretation of money transmission laws , especially the law on “unlicensed money transmitting businesses.” They argue that the DOJ is stretching the law too far and that it could criminalize software developers who build blockchain tools but don’t hold or control user funds . According to the coalition, these developers use non-custodial technologies, meaning they have no access to customer assets. Treating them as money transmitters, they say, goes against legal tradition and could harm U.S. tech innovation. The letter also says the DOJ’s view doesn’t match earlier guidance from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) or past legal rulings. The signers are asking Congress to urge the DOJ to rethink its position. They want to make sure software developers are protected and that U.S. law matches both legal history and what Congress originally meant. The goal is to prevent confusion and keep the U.S. as a leader in digital innovation. In short, this Senate vote signals a turning point. If President Trump signs the bill as expected, it will be a major victory for the crypto industry, reduce oversight on DeFi, and protect developers building open, decentralized systems.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|MATIC,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-27 07:53:58

As selling activity rises and buyers show hesitance, is a Ripple price crash to $1 brewing? Let’s explore. XRP Price Prediction as Top Trader Sounds Bearish Alarm XRP price today trades at $2.36 after a 4% drop in 24 hours. At press time, Ripple had the biggest 24-hour loss among the top ten largest cryptos by market cap. Top crypto analyst and trader Peter Brandt has noted that Ripple’s downtrend was only just beginning. In his analysis, he pointed out a head and shoulders pattern on the XRP price chart. This pattern usually predicts a trend reversal from bullish to bearish. Brandt observed that XRP price has successfully defended support at the neckline of this pattern at $1.90. However, if the current downtrend progresses and Ripple breaches this support level, it could spark a decline towards $1.07. Conversely, if buyers step in now, and XRP price manages to break out above $3, it will invalidate this bearish setup. XRP Price Chart A recent Coingape article also highlighted the top reasons why the XRP bull run may be over as the price remains stuck in consolidation for three months. Moreover, speculation that the market may have already priced in Ripple’s win in the SEC case is causing reduced trader interest. Is an XRP Crash to $1 Brewing? A full bearish reversal for XRP price that will confirm a crash to $1 will only happen if it breaches the neckline of $1.90 as highlighted on Brandt’s chart. However, several catalysts could push Ripple past $2.90 and invalidate this bearish pattern. Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, opined that the end of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit has increased the odds of an XRP ETF approval . “Spot XRP ETF approval is simply a matter of time. And yes, I expect Blackrock, Fidelity, etc to all be involved.” If BlackRock files for a spot XRP ETF before the XRP price drops to $1.90, the price is bound to rally and possibly break out of the bearish head and shoulders pattern and avoid a crash to $1. The other catalyst that could prevent an XRP price crash to $1 is a surge in leveraged trading activity. Popular analyst Ali Charts noted that XRP futures contracts have surged by 36% in just two weeks. This increase likely comes from a buildup of long positions. Data from Coinglass further shows that on Binance, 72% of traders have opened long positions on XRP, while only 27% of traders have opened short positions. This data depicts positive trader sentiment that the XRP price will rebound . Binance XRP Long/Short Ratio These factors suggest that an XRP crash to $1 is not brewing, and such a drop might not happen in the near term. Ripple Technical Analysis Ripple’s 4-hour price chart shows that the altcoin has entered a key demand zone. The volume profile bars show at the current price zone, bullish pressure is stronger than bearish pressure, which could prevent a drop to the crucial level of $1.90. This price chart further shows that the immediate support level lies at $2.23. Falling below this level has previously caused a spike in selling volumes. If XRP continues to trade above this level, a drop to $1 may not happen. However, a full reversal from bullish to bearish trends will occur if XRP makes a decisive close above the $2.59 resistance. The RSI, which stands at 39 at press time, also needs to rise past 50 to show strong buying activity and bullish momentum. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart This price chart shows mixed sentiment towards the XRP price. Despite Ripple being in a demand zone, buying activity as depicted by the RSI is still low. Nevertheless, as long as Ripple defends crucial support levels at $2.23 and $1.90, it can prevent a crash to $1.

42468747,https://nulltx.com/?p=147481,1743062064,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Solana ($SOL) Faces Uncertainty Amid Unrealized Losses and Optimism Over Potential Spot ETF,https://nulltx.com/solana-sol-faces-uncertainty-amid-unrealized-losses-and-optimism-over-potential-spot-etf/,"At present, the Solana ($SOL) market is moving through a phase of unmistakable uncertainty. Long-term holders are seeing a significant portion of their invested capital sitting underwater. Using data from Glassnode’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss indicator, we can see that sentiment has entered a state of fear. This is a signal that, in previous instances, has indicated either a sharp increase in accumulation or some other form of price reaction in the near future. Solana is at present not able to achieve those previous high marks. Many people are watching closely to try and see what it is indicating, if anything, about market direction. All this is occurring alongside growing trader optimism that a spot Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) could be imminent, with Polymarket traders saying there’s an 85% chance for such a creature to exist by 2025. If that happens, it could really pump the price. But is that what we’re seeing now? Or are we just seeing the market pump in anticipation of approval? Polymarket traders are betting big on a spot Solana ETF—pricing in an 85% chance of approval in 2025. Is the market ahead of the curve, or is this just wishful thinking? https://t.co/0b0WAsKL24 pic.twitter.com/DseQid9R7d — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 25, 2025 A Critical Moment for Solana: Fear and Unrealized Losses Once hailed as a high-speed, low-cost alternative to Ethereum, Solana has had a rough stretch in the market. The NUPL indicator, which tracks the balance between unrealized profits and losses of a network’s holders, now shows that a pretty large portion of $SOL holders are underwater. That’s a pretty big deal for Solana, considering that the last time it held a rally prior to this apparent downturn, quite a few net new investors had come on board and had started buying. Now, those are the people who seem to be the most net long on Solana, and they’re the ones really holding onto what are pretty apparent losses. Previously, times characterized by high amounts of unrecognized losses tended to lead to one of two results. They sometimes produced accumulation phases, which are periods in which market participants recognize that a discounted asset presents an extraordinary buying opportunity. They sometimes produced price rallies, which are what happen when assets start looking good to enough participants that they start buying those assets again. Solana being at a potentially pivotal price point could be related to either of those two possibilities. Solana Market Update Glassnode’s NUPL indicator is flashing ‘fear’—long-term $SOL holders are deep in unrealized losses. Historically, moments like this have led to one of two things: Big accumulation before a rally More pain if buyers don’t step in Will SOL find… pic.twitter.com/6JM3AK0uqZ — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 25, 2025 On the other hand, if buying pressure does not show up, the market may suffer more. Selling from underwater investors could still push prices lower, especially if there is no new buying interest in $SOL. Continued price declines could push the Solana ecosystem deeper into a bear market. As with any asset, sentiment is a critical driver of price, and Solana’s future trajectory seems destined to zigzag up and down based on how fear-filled or exuberant the community around it feels. Solana ETF Speculation: A Potential Catalyst? In a market that is largely filled with uncertainty, there is one source of optimism: the possible approval of a spot Solana ETF. Traders on the Polymarket betting platform now give an 85% chance that such an ETF gets approved before 2025, and this is certainly a growing sentiment among members of the Solana community in light of the recent overall market being more bullish. The idea of a Solana ETF has built quite a bit of traction behind it. An ETF would let institutional folks buy into the $SOL without having to buy the cryptocurrency itself—nebulously “owning” the thing through the fund structure. This, in turn, could signal a (possibly increased) wave of institutional capital surging into Solana’s ecosystem, and, as lore has it, might boost the token’s “legitimacy” and liquidity. The question, however, remains whether this optimism is premature. While an ETF could be a major catalyst for the token’s price, we must remember that the approval process for such products is never certain. Regulatory hurdles and market conditions might delay or stop altogether the approval of a Solana ETF. Furthermore, while the market has shown considerable interest in Ethereum ETFs, the approval of a Solana ETF would be a first for the Solana ecosystem, and the success of such a product is still an open question. Despite all this, traders appear to be pricing in at least a decent chance the ETF will be approved. And if it is actually OK’d in the next couple of years, that very well might lead to an immediate bump in Solana’s token price, given how associated with the Ethereum alternative that network is right now. What’s Next for Solana? “The next few months remain cloudy for Solana, with key factors likely to influence its price action.”Why? There could be two reasons. One is the sobering possibility that if the current sentiment does not turn around, and if the selling pressure does not abate, then Solana and perhaps the whole crypto market could face significant downside. Not just in the short term, but also in what some might call a crypto winter. The alternative is the market could have reached a point of maximum fear. And in that case, it could be setting up for a period of accumulation. Hope is in sight for Solana long-term investors as we could see a Solana ETF getting approved by 2025. The result of this approval would mean that Solana could experience some sort of boost in its price and market perception, mainly because ETFs are more readily accessible and consequently more impactful than direct investments by institutions. At present, Solana holders and potential investors need to keep a close watch on the market sentiment and be ready to react to whatever direction the market may take. Whether the fear represents a market bottom that is signaling a time to accumulate or whether it foretells further downside is still an open question. In either case, Solana’s long-term potential will ultimately depend on whether the project can come through this period of adversity and emerge on the other side.

Despite the Layer 2 (L2) solutions of Ethereum booming and seeing a lot of development, Arbitrum, the second-largest L2 platform by total value locked, is in a market downturn that’s very sharp, very clear, and not very good. Most recently, @intotheblock reported that a staggering 98% of Arbitrum holders are currently under water, with only 1% able to claim that their investments are in the green. This is a massive wipeout for a platform that most of us (including me) thought was going to be a big winner. Is the market on the verge of capitulating, or is it gearing up for a reversal? According to @intotheblock , 98% of #Arbitrum ($ARB) holders are out of the money, with only 1% in profit. With ARB at $0.39, are we near capitulation or setting up for a reversal? What's your take ? Bullish or bearish on $ARB ? #Crypto pic.twitter.com/R0qYsfIr67 — champagne mami (@EkponoAkwaowo) March 26, 2025 Arbitrum Faces a Critical Moment Amid Price Decline $ARB’s price has dropped sharply, leading to widespread concern among holders. The majority of the token’s investors are now underwater. This state of affairs points to a period of difficulty for Arbitrum, punctuated by the price dropping to such a low level. Meanwhile, the market seems on the verge of capitulation—when most holders sell off their positions—that could, in the view of some hopeful investors, set up the potential for a reversal. Market sentiment often reaches extremes of pessimism before a market cedes to capitulators. Investors abandon their holdings, and prices spiral downwards; yet in the case of Arbitrum, the fundamentals and adoption level of the project not only allow but practically ensure a recovery. Even as arbitration pricing against the ERC-20 standard has fallen significantly—reduced by half just last week—Arbitrum remains a vital part of the Ethereum ecosystem. At $2.58 billion, Arbitrum’s total value locked (TVL) puts it firmly at the front of the line in Ethereum’s scaling efforts. But the price of ARB has been in freefall for the most part, which has in turn catalyzed some grandstanding on the part of a few analysts who want to use Arbitrum’s predicament to badmouth Ethereum as a whole. We wanted to avoid that. So today, we’re taking a look at some of the oomph Arbitrum has as an Ethereum Layer 2. The focus will be on technology and ecosystem — not so much on price. And we’ll be looking at our old friend T-shirt graph, depicted in some now-familiar colors. Ethereum’s L2 Ecosystem: Growth and Competition Although the current problems with Arbitrum may be grabbing the headlines, the entire Layer 2 ecosystem of Ethereum is flourishing. Base, another Layer 2 chain, has recently taken the lead in terms of total value locked (TVL), with an impressive $3.19 billion. Base has emerged as a big player in the Layer 2 space, attracting all sorts of investors to its platform thanks to its scalability and the rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) that it enjoys. Base’s TVL has grown at an absolutely stunning clip over the past week, up 12.6% in just seven days. By contrast, Arbitrum has not made quite the same sort of TVL explosion lately, but it retains a solid edge over several other Layer 2 competitors in terms of total value locked. Top Layer 2 Chains by Total Value Locked! #Ethereum ’s L2 ecosystem is booming, with Base leading at $3.19B TVL, followed by Arbitrum at $2.58B! Biggest 7D Growth: @soneium (+23.3%), Mantle (+12.3%), @base (+12.6%) Biggest TVL: @base , @arbitrum , @0xPolygon … pic.twitter.com/qVybSNwi6r — TokenHunter (@_TokenHunter) March 26, 2025 The contest among Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystems is getting fiercer, with other projects like Mantle (up 12.3%) and Soneium (up 23.3%) also enjoying handsome gains. These platforms, along with the previously mentioned ones, are adding to what seems like the inexorable expansion of Ethereum’s scaling solutions. And Layer 2 is where the action is. Compared with the demure Layer 1 Ethereum, which is known for its slow speeds and high fees, Layer 2 offers a low-cost, low-latency alternative that still gets the Ethereum security blanket. Even though Arbitrum is having a hard time with its price, it is still bringing in some strong numbers with its TVL. The platform is one of the top Layer 2 chains when it comes to 24-hour volume, and it even had $613 million traded over the last day. This suggests, despite how much Arbitrum is struggling in terms of its price, that the network is still very active. The Path Ahead for Arbitrum and Layer 2 The future looks murky for Arbitrum, but one thing is certain: it’s at a crossroads. Most holders are nursing losses, and with so many investors underwater, the sell pressure could intensify if prices keep dropping. But how likely is that? And could a downturn somehow work in Arbitrum’s favor? Currently, Arbitrum holds a solid position as one of the lead Layer 2 solutions, boasting a sizeable total value locked (TVL) along with a significant level of activity in terms of transactions. Most recently, the projected long-term viability of Ethereum—and, by extension, its ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps)—has given Layer 2 solutions renewed attention as a potentially thriving segment of the Ethereum network. If Ethereum retains its place in the blockchain pantheon, and if the dApp revolution takes off as some envision, then Layer 2s like Arbitrum should enjoy significant long-term growth prospects. To sum up, although Arbitrum is confronted with major problems at the present time, the overall Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem is expanding quickly, with Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon in the lead. Whether Arbitrum can manage to turn things around is an open question, but its ongoing development, coupled with its pivotal role in Ethereum’s scaling efforts, suggest that it might just manage to ride out the present storm. Meanwhile, the steadily evolving L2 landscape is not going to hold still for anyone, so closely watching both the price action and the ongoing technological advancements associated with Arbitrum and its chief rivals is going to be a necessary task for investors.

Lawmakers across the country are proposing and passing bills that support crypto mining, Bitcoin reserves , and digital asset investments. These moves highlight a growing view of crypto not just as a speculative tool, but as a strategic financial asset . In Kentucky, major progress came on March 24 when the governor signed the “Blockchain Digital Asset Act” (HB701) into law. This law gives residents the right to hold their own Bitcoin and offers benefits to crypto mining companies. The Senate passed it with full support, 37-0. With access to energy from coal and hydropower, Kentucky is positioning itself as a major mining hub. In fact, it currently holds 11% of the total U.S. Bitcoin hashrate. North Carolina is also taking bold steps. Lawmakers there introduced three bills to invest public money in digital assets. Bill H506 and S709 both allow up to 5% of state funds to go into digital assets, while H92 pushes that number up to 10% for strategic reserves. These proposals would allow the state to protect public funds from inflation and build long-term value through crypto investments. Lawmakers are working quickly, aiming to pass the bills in the coming weeks. Arizona is following a similar path. Two bills—SB1373 and SB1025—were approved by the House Rules Committee. SB1373 allows the state treasurer to create a digital asset reserve using funds from seized criminal assets. The treasurer can invest up to 10% of the reserve and lend assets to earn more money, as long as the risks are controlled. SB1025 would let Arizona invest up to 10% of treasury and pension funds into Bitcoin. If the federal government builds a Bitcoin reserve fund, Arizona could store its holdings there for added safety. Oklahoma is getting involved too. The state’s House recently passed HB1203, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill. This bill allows public funds from several state accounts to be invested in Bitcoin, stablecoins, and top-tier digital assets with a market cap over $500 billion. Across the country, more than 20 states are now considering similar plans. According to Bitcoin Law, 23 of 50 U.S. states have introduced Bitcoin reserve bills. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, said these bills could bring up to $23 billion in Bitcoin purchases , or 247,000 BTC . This estimate doesn’t even include what might come from pension fund investments, which could increase if lawmakers go forward. These state efforts are gaining momentum after the Trump administration showed strong support for Bitcoin. On March 7, the White House approved the creation of a Federal Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This has opened the door for states to align their financial strategies with national crypto policy. With this growing wave of state-level legislation, the U.S. is moving closer to integrating cryptocurrency into public finance. Whether it’s through mining, reserves, or direct investment, states are laying the foundation for a new kind of financial future—one where digital assets play a central role.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|FIAT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-27 07:56:39

Priced at $0.62, Nillion is not just catching attention; it is easily the most longed token since the past 24 hours, and with good reason too: several groundbreaking innovations introduced by Nillion just this week have many thinking that it may very well be the most undervalued project in the space. $NIL @nillionnetwork (now at $0.62) is the most longed token by CEX smart money wallets during the last 24 hours Few facts about Nillion and why they probably invest in it: Privacy Innovation: Nillion introduces ""Blind Compute"" technology, enabling secure data computation and… pic.twitter.com/akfutaEp5M — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 26, 2025 A Groundbreaking Approach to Privacy with Blind Compute Technology Nillion’s recent attention stems in large part from its edgy take on privacy. At the heart of Nillion’s tech is something called “Blind Compute,” which, as the name suggests, offers a way to compute (make calculations with) data without seeing the data (or without exposing it). In this case, “seeing” involves artificial intelligence that has been trained to make sense of data. In an era when privacy is in increasing demand—particularly as AI becomes more pervasive—Nillion’s remedy for the problem of projecting private data into the public domain seems, on the surface anyway, to be a solid solution. Blind Compute technology fills a critical gap in the current AI landscape. Concerns are growing over the amount of sensitive data AI and machine learning handle. Nillion’s innovation allows data to be processed in a blind manner. That means no third party sees the data being processed. This level of privacy and security appeals to both users who are conscious of their privacy and to institutional investors. Increasingly, these investors are looking to put money into projects that are focused on privacy. A Leap Forward in AI Research Nillion is tooting its own horn in artificial intelligence and getting some serious buzz from the sectors it straddles—tech and cryptocurrency. Recent developments have now very much become a part of Nillion’s narrative. Tech and crypto reconnaissance have been captivated and intrigued. The network’s prototype stands compared to a pretty big milestone for privacy-oriented AIs—Microsoft’s Sigma paper. Combining Blind Computation with AI offers an attractive, infrequent-solution way of doing secure, efficient data processing. Nillion’s prototype produces impressive, superior results that showcase its technological advantage and highlight the way its very existence has the potential to revolutionize compute-intensive tasks like deep learning and AI model training and to do so while protecting the user data involved. For investors who are keen on AI and its potential, Nillion’s model offers something extremely unique: a project that merges two of the most critical sectors—AI and data privacy—at a scale no other project has yet achieved. The Nucleus Program: Building a Robust Developer Ecosystem Investor interest in Nillion is also growing because of another factor: the Nillion developer ecosystem. The developer ecosystem of Nillion is still in its infancy, but the Nillion team has already taken steps to push it toward vibrancy. What does this mean? Well, it means that Nillion is creating a state in which developers want to work on the platform (for high-value data) and to push forth with their creations, in and of itself a good thing for any network. Further, this could enhance a couple of the good reasons to think the price of Nillion’s token (NIL) could increase. The Nucleus program incentivizes app development, and it’s a two-for-one: Not only does it boost the Nillion network’s functionality and allow us to demonstrate what we can do, but it also increases the long-term investment potential, which is our focus currently. We want people to put money into Nillion, and as soon as possible, frankly. We have two major verticals for app dev right now. The first is building applications that work with us in delivering data to the kind of parity that you want in order to achieve a private cloud or in order to achieve some kind of functionality where you can deliver data loans to private institutions in a way that’s qualitatively different from anything they’ve had before. In addition, as the Nillion network develops additional applications, the corresponding need for $NIL tokens is likely to increase. This could act as an added upward force on the price of the token, providing even greater returns for early investors. And as those use cases expand, they too will align the Nillion network with the trend of blockchains and cryptocurrencies developing real-world applications, for which the value proposition in these projects has certainly been enhanced. Why Smart Money Investors Are Bullish on Nillion The increasing allure of Nillion among astute investors, especially on global centralized exchanges, is a direct outcome of these recent developments. Nillion’s innovation and its privacy-first, with the potential for AI-derived breakthroughs, make it a cryptocurrency space that stands out incalculably. And of course, there are reasons, big ones, that explain why smart money is seeking out the Nillion project. Chief among those reasons is investors’ clear, unmistakable attraction to the project’s tech edge and what that could mean for solving some of the urgent problems, privacy and data security, that lie at the heart of today’s digital economy. The Nucleus program provides a strong roadmap for growth, which makes Nillion an appealing long-term investment. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market keeps evolving; and in the space where our next-generation Nillion Network operates, the captured attention of retail and institutional investors seems to be increasingly focused on solutions to five high-demand issues: 1. The lack of real-world applicability for most cryptocurrencies. 2. Insufficient scalability of current blockchain solutions. 3. A need for increased and sustained innovation in the web3 space. 4. Privacy and the security of digital identities. 5. Artificial intelligence and its rapid development. To sum up, Nillion ($NIL), with its emphasis on private innovation, breakthrough AI research, and a thriving developer community, is carving out a space for itself as a leader in the twin worlds of privacy and AI. Its token price has surged recently (along with price charts for just about everything else in crypto), and interest in it from CEX smart money wallets has picked up considerably, both of which make it a token to watch.

According to local media , the five suspects, including one woman, were taken into custody following an investigation by the cybercrime wing of Odisha’s Crime Branch. The accused reportedly ran a scam using a bogus trading app called ZAIF, where they promised massive returns of up to 200% on digital currency investments. The trading platform was promoted as being based in Japan. It’s worth noting that ZAIF is the name of a legitimate Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, which suffered a $60 million hack in 2022. However, the platform used in this scam is likely unaffiliated and merely borrowed the name to appear credible. The fraud kicked off when the victim, an Indian businessman, was contacted on Facebook by a woman claiming to be a Hong Kong-based IBM software developer. You might also like: Indian police bust $2m RSN crypto scam with alleged ties to China She gained his trust and convinced him to invest in crypto via ZAIF. Over a month, he transferred more than INR 6 crore (approximately $$699,352) across various accounts controlled by the scammers. As is common in such crypto trading scams, the victim was initially shown fake profits on the platform to build trust. However, when the victim attempted to withdraw gains, the platform demanded an additional INR 89 lakh to unlock the funds — a tactic commonly referred to as an advance fee fraud . Once the victim refused, the scammers vanished, cutting off contact. Police tracked down the suspects through digital trails and banking records. Authorities seized phones, SIM cards, ID documents, and other incriminating materials during a raid. With cryptocurrencies still operating in a grey area , India remains a hotspot for scams and fraud targeting unsuspecting users. Earlier this month, police cracked down on a similar scam that promoted a fake token called RSN and promised 2% daily returns . Losses were estimated to be between $1.14 and $2.29 million.

The state has teamed up with LayerZero, a well-known interoperability protocol, to issue the token. WYST will be pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by a mix of cash, U.S. Treasury bonds, and repurchase agreements. The plan includes a strict 102% reserve requirement to ensure full support for each token issued. This will be the first stablecoin fully issued by a government entity in the United States. Wyoming is currently considering nine different blockchains to host the stablecoin, including Ethereum , Solana, and Polygon . The aim is to carry out a small-scale test of stablecoin technology with the hope that it may grow over time. Governor Mark Gordon announced the partnership at the DC Blockchain Summit. However, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal crypto advocate from Wyoming, appears not to be directly involved in this project. In the past, Lummis pushed for a state-level Bitcoin Reserve bill, but it failed in committee due to opposition from fiscal conservatives, who were against spending taxpayer funds on Bitcoin. The WYST project, however, is separate from the Bitcoin reserve debate. Its financial structure is built to avoid the need for new tax funding. Instead, the state plans to use the interest generated from WYST’s reserve assets to fund key public services such as education and infrastructure. Some lawmakers are still concerned. Fiscal conservatives in Wyoming may object to using existing state investments for the stablecoin. Still, the state already controls about $31 billion in assets , including cash and U.S. bonds. That means Wyoming could use a portion of these holdings for WYST without needing new funds. LayerZero stated that being chosen for this project is a sign of the future of finance . “There’s no clearer message about where money is going than a U.S. state putting the dollar onchain,” the company posted online. WYST will be a fully reserved, fiat-backed stablecoin, issued by the state and monitored under strict rules to protect its value. Wyoming’s move comes as stablecoins become a bigger part of national conversations. President Trump has recently said that stablecoins could play a big role in maintaining the U.S. dollar’s global power . This adds more weight to Wyoming’s experiment, as it could act as a model for other states. If the WYST stablecoin proves successful, it could inspire similar initiatives elsewhere. The goal is not only to test the technology but also to show how public finance can benefit from digital tools. A well-run state-backed stablecoin could provide a stable, trusted alternative to private crypto tokens while offering new ways to manage public money. Wyoming is trying something bold. If it works, WYST could open the door to a new phase in government finance —where states don’t just regulate crypto but actively use it to serve their citizens.",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-27 07:59:58

This is a significant change for the video game retailer, which is known almost exclusively for its physical stores and for being a meme stock. But therein, of course, lies part of the story: GameStop also used to be a company that was largely tied to the physical world. And it still is, even more than it is tied to the virtual world of cryptocurrency. So what should we make of the bold move that GameStop has just made? In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), GameStop disclosed that it has diversified its financial approach to cover not just traditional asset classes but also digital ones—as indicated by Bitcoin and USD stablecoins—that are rapidly becoming mainstream. This is one small step, one filing at a time, toward ensuring that GameStop is not just a retail meme but a sustainable business that prospects in an age of alternatives. Bitcoin and Stablecoins Now Part of GameStop’s Investment Strategy GameStop’s official filing indicates that the company may now hold Bitcoin alongside USD stablecoins in its treasury reserve assets. The company positioning itself to benefit from digital currencies while also perhaps diversifying fiat currency for the sake of enhancing its financial flexibility is a new development and, as such, calls for attention. The inclusion of Bitcoin in this move is especially significant since the cryptocurrency has achieved acclaim—despite its volatility—for possibly serving as a modern-day equivalent to gold. The filing, however, also confesses to the dangers of holding cryptocurrencies. GameStop stated unequivocally that it is on the same page as everyone else who fancies Bitcoin and other forms of digital assets. “You should understand that we’re probably just as uncertain about this investment as you are,” is the impression I get from this part of the filing. I suppose this is a necessary admission in order for GameStop to proceed with its shareholder-friendly crypto gambit. GameStop Adds Bitcoin to Treasury, Stock Surges 6.30% After Hours On Mar 25, @gamestop updated its investment policy, officially adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserve assets. The filing states: The company may invest in Bitcoin and USD stablecoins. Acknowledges… pic.twitter.com/8qWcVDjrQR — Followin (@followin_io) March 26, 2025 GameStop’s investment policy not only allows for the purchase of Bitcoin but also includes stable USD stablecoins. These stablecoins are designed to hold a steady value and are pegged to reserve assets like the US dollar, providing a simple, straightforward hedge against the wild price swings that can occur in other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. This decision comes when many firms in a range of sectors are diversifying their investment profiles to include digital assets. In particular, institutional investors have turned to Bitcoin as a vehicle for gaining exposure to the still-nascent cryptocurrency market. GameStop’s addition of both Bitcoin and stablecoins to its reserves suggests that the company is striving to be a financially progressive player in an increasingly digital ecosystem. Stock Price Reacts Favorably to the News After the announcement, GameStop stock surged, climbing 6.30% in after-hours trading. That took the price of GameStop shares to $25.40, and investors seemed to be quite pleased with the news as a potential step toward modernizing and diversifying the company’s strategy. The announcement likely drew in investors, many of whom have already been involved in the com any’s previous movements in the stock market and seem primed to enjoy all the ups and downs that any year-ender is likely to present. Before the past couple of years, GameStop was perhaps one of the most obvious targets for a short-seller. And that is because, for the most part, the company has not been growing, and its basic problem—the fact that people are not buying games in its stores—does not seem to have a solution. The company’s stock has been volatile, but its new inclusion of digital assets such as Bitcoin into its financial strategy could very well attract a whole new class of investors. These investors might be lured not just by the enormous potential returns, but also by the idea that the assets in question are actually business-ready. They’re meant to serve as a potential bridge between the old, stable, and somewhat dull world of traditional finance and the fast-moving, anarchic world of decentralized finance, which so far has no plan to save Crypto Industry failures. Future Outlook GameStop’s addition of Bitcoin to its treasury is a part of a larger trend in the corporate world, where companies are moving to adopt cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. This decision could herald a more profound transformation within the company, including possible partnerships with startups in the area of blockchain technology and digital finance. GameStop is obviously trying to stay in step with the times. The company is now offering crypto wallets, and they also plan to integrate digital assets into their finances. The willingness to push towards these innovative—and somewhat risky—crypto ventures signals that GameStop is trying to move beyond its current death spiral (and potential bankruptcy) and position itself as a relevant entity in a rapidly changing financial landscape. At this point, GameStop’s share price surge clearly reflects an optimism among investors that the company is transforming itself in a positive way—diversifying its revenue streams, for example—and that it is embracing what so many other companies are also busy doing: making the shift to the digital world, investing in all kinds of virtual assets (like this company’s new blockchain division), and pouring resources into something that a great many smart people believe is the future of money: digital currencies.

Rather than a passing trend, this reflects a clear shift in how younger investors are approaching risk, trust and financial planning. The report, which surveyed over 13,000 individuals across 13 countries, reveals that 62% of Millennial investors have crypto holdings making up at least a third of their portfolios. Among Gen Z investors, 35% allocate more than half of their portfolio to crypto, while 20% invest around one-third of their portfolio in digital assets. The @wef 2024 Global Retail Investor Survey, produced in collaboration with @RobinhoodApp and @BCG , identifies four structural shifts shaping individual #financial behaviours, preferences and market activity in #retail #investing . Explore them here: https://t.co/bcou9nSMUW pic.twitter.com/BKqYuC23Xy — World Economic Forum (@wef) March 26, 2025 These allocations often exceed their investments in stocks, mutual funds, or bonds—asset classes long considered cornerstones of a balanced portfolio. How Gen Z and Millennials Are Rewriting Investment Rules Young investors’ confidence in crypto appears to stem from a broader trend: many perceive it as easier to understand than traditional investments such as ETFs or bonds. This perception contrasts with the conventional view of crypto as a complex and high-risk asset. For digital-native generations, guidance now comes from crypto platforms, influencer content, and peer networks rather than traditional sources like licensed advisers or institutional analysts. This generational shift is also about values. The report notes that 70% of Millennials and 66% of Gen Z choose financial institutions based on personal values alignment. Crypto, often associated with decentralization and transparency, appears to resonate with those priorities. Image Source: WEF / Global Retail Investor Outlook 2024 At the same time, these younger investors are more likely to explore alternative assets and engage in shareholder activism, suggesting a broader appetite for influence and innovation. Crypto’s Rise in Emerging Markets Highlights Shifting Financial Access Emerging markets echo this enthusiasm. Investors from countries like India, Brazil, and South Africa show higher crypto adoption rates than their developed-market counterparts. In fact, 36% of emerging market investors hold crypto, compared to 27% globally. For some, crypto offers an accessible gateway to capital markets in environments where banking infrastructure remains underdeveloped. Technology plays a powerful role in shaping this trend. The report finds that 41% of investors globally—and nearly half of Gen Z and Millennial respondents—are willing to delegate financial decisions to AI-based advisers. These same cohorts are also the most active users of budgeting apps, robo-advisers, and fintech platforms, further embedding crypto into their daily financial lives. Still, the risks are real. The high concentration of portfolios in volatile assets raises concerns about long-term financial stability. Financial educators and regulators face a new challenge: how to guide a generation that prefers learning-by-doing and places more trust in YouTube than in brokerage whitepapers.

The bill now goes to President Donald Trump, who’s expected to sign it into law by Friday, making it the first crypto-related legislation to officially pass under his administration. The original rule—pushed during the Biden era—tried to force decentralized protocols to report to the IRS like traditional brokers. That meant developers and platforms would have to track user data and submit transaction reports, even though most DeFi tools don’t hold customer funds. That plan just got nuked. The final Senate vote came after the House of Representatives passed its own version of the bill on March 11. The Senate had already passed a similar version earlier this month, but budget bills have to start in the House, so it bounced back for final approval. Lawmakers, Trump team, and crypto firms reject the IRS rule The CRA was introduced in the Senate by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. He called the repeal “a victory for American innovation” after the earlier Senate vote. Trump’s AI and crypto adviser, David Sacks, confirmed the president supports overturning the rule, meaning Trump’s signature is now just a formality. This isn’t just a win for politicians. More than 30 crypto companies banded together the morning of the Senate vote to send a letter to lawmakers. They sent it to the Senate Banking and Judiciary Committees and the House Financial Services and Judiciary Committees, demanding answers on how the Department of Justice (DOJ) is interpreting money transmitter laws. The companies behind the letter include Coinbase, Kraken, A16z, Multicoin Capital, Paradigm, Exodus, and Ledger. The letter was led by the DeFi Education Fund, a policy group focused on defending decentralized systems. The group’s executive director, Amanda Tuminelli, said in the letter that the DOJ’s legal strategy could “expose software developers to criminal liability simply for writing code.” The companies pushed back against the DOJ’s view that DeFi tools fall under Section 1960 of the criminal code, which is meant to regulate centralized entities that move money without a license. The DOJ claims DeFi protocols can be considered “money transmitting businesses” under that law—even if the developer doesn’t touch customer funds. That interpretation, according to the crypto firms, goes against FinCEN’s 2019 guidance, which said developers aren’t considered money transmitters. The fight over this issue isn’t just theory. In August 2023, the DOJ filed criminal charges against Roman Storm, one of the co-founders of Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer. The DOJ accused him of running an unlicensed money-transmitting business and enabling money laundering. It was the first time criminal charges had been filed against a DeFi developer. That case spooked the entire crypto industry. Amanda Tuminelli called the DOJ’s move “regulation by criminal indictment.” She said the DeFi Education Fund’s top priority right now is to force Congress to clearly define Section 1960 to protect software developers. She also thanked the crypto companies that joined the effort to push back. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

According to social media posts from Armstrong himself, the emails led to a warrant being issued. He is currently being held without bond, meaning he cannot be released before trial , with no option to post bail. The arrest has caught the attention of the crypto community, many of whom initially speculated that the reason was a public disturbance or his past involvement with questionable crypto projects. However, these claims lack evidence. The real reason appears tied to his direct communication with the judge in an ongoing legal dispute. Five days before the arrest, Armstrong admitted online that a warrant had been issued because he had emailed Judge Childs while acting as his own legal representative. The judge has since deleted her Twitter account, which adds more focus to the incident. BitBoy referred to her as “dishonorable,” and if his messages were considered threatening or inappropriate, they may fall under criminal harassment. Armstrong is known for taking part in legal fights without proper legal counsel. In this case, representing himself and directly contacting a judge may have worsened the situation. This isn’t his first run-in with legal trouble—back in 2023, he was accused of harassing a lawyer involved in another case, although he wasn't arrested that time. His behavior has been widely criticized, both legally and online. Recent posts show him engaging in strange online rants, including targeting a young actor who shares his name. This pattern of erratic public behavior has raised concerns even among his supporters. For now, the emails that led to his arrest have not been made public . Until court proceedings begin, it’s unclear exactly what was said or how serious the accusations are. There’s no official timeline for when his next hearing will take place. The arrest could affect Armstrong’s reputation and career in crypto.

The token has been on quite the upward trajectory, rising over 50% in price today alone, which has propelled its market capitalization to a solid $13.5 million. This spike in value has drawn the attention of retail traders and memecoin aficionados, but what is the market trying to tell us with this sudden surge, and why is $PWEASE so dang popular all of a sudden? $pwease Surges Over 50%, Market Cap Hits $13.5M, Why? The Solana-based memecoin $pwease is gaining traction due to its parody culture linked to U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and strong grassroots support. Key Highlights: +50% price surge today Market cap: $13.5M … pic.twitter.com/8FHSm8P1RZ — Followin (@followin_io) March 26, 2025 The emergence of $PWEASE can only be understood by looking at the market forces driving its creation and the peculiar cultural corner it has managed to occupy. $PWEASE’s Memecoin Roots and Parody Culture $PWEASE, like many successful memecoins, is more than just a cryptocurrency—it encompasses a larger cultural and social movement within the cryptocurrency space. Memecoins are typically associated with humor and internet culture, often generating significant interest by appealing to grassroots communities and using elements of humor, inside jokes, or parody that resonate with the broader public. $PWEASE has carved out a cozy niche by parodying the current political and cultural scene. This particular form of meme culture that $PWEASE has sunk its teeth into is one that holds a mirror up to society and uses humor as a weapon. It is what $PWEASE does next, however, that really defines its place in the altcoin space: political parody and a direct association with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance. The meteoric rise of the memecoin can also be credited to its robust grassroots backing—a major trait of any successful memecoin, for that matter. Like many (if not most) memecoins, $PWEASE has effectively grown through community-driven efforts. Its followers consistently push the memecoin across social media platforms and crypto forums, where—and I’m not sure if this is a coincidence or not—virality and meme culture seem to rule the day when it comes to the perceived success of a project. This push has led to the kind of perceived success that sees a project maintain its buzz even when other projects are corrections or just plain dead. Key Milestones and Market Performance The recent uptick in $PWEASE’s valuation is not an isolated instance but part of a broader movement. The token’s market capitalization now rests at $13.5 million, which is a significant climb from its earlier 2025 form when it reached a high of $35 million in early March. This sharp descent, however, is par for the course in the memecoin market, where speculative trading and capricious market forces generate price swings that can make one dizzy. Predicting such phenomena lurches between the laughable and the ludicrous. The $PWEASE token has remained followed and favored under a community of loyal supporters. It has not weathered a crypto storm recently, but it has a semblance of calm in the midst of this particular crypto volatility. Today’s upward motion in $PWEASE is, in my estimation, a signal of ongoing interest in the token and a sign that this quiet token may just be quietly finding its wings. What’s Driving the $PWEASE Hype? $PWEASE’s recent price spike appears to have a single driving force behind it, and that’s the announcement by Vice President J.D. Vance of an upcoming diplomatic trip to Greenland on March 28. This is a trip that has stirred up no small amount of controversy, especially in Denmark, where Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has publicly expressed her strong opposition to Vance’s visit. The media has taken an interest in this political dust-up, and that interest, in turn, has given $PWEASE a bit more attention in the press, further solidifying its status as a memecoin. Connecting with the Vance story—and the memecoin’s ongoing efforts to use its political and cultural influence—has given new energy to its boosters. The token has shown an incredible ability to ride the wave of current events, making it not just relevant but increasing its visibility and trading volume to a point where it is starting to feel like a real asset. The political row over Vance’s trip to Greenland has roused a strong emotional response from backers and detractors alike, and $PWEASE has successfully aligned itself with that conversation. While this could easily be dismissed as a moment of memetic irrelevance, the very ability to adapt and align with trending topics is what makes the most successful memecoins in the current moment. The Future of $PWEASE and Memecoin Markets Like many memecoins, the future of $PWEASE is uncertain. And, by their very nature, memecoins are highly speculative and volatile. The price fluctuations provide excitement for traders but can also feel unpredictable. However, another defining characteristic of $PWEASE is a strong community that supports it, which adds to a level of resilience that many other memecoins lack. In the future, $PWEASE will almost certainly continue to be shaped by not only its parody culture but also by its connection to contemporary political matters. The token’s staying power will be determined by the number of ways it can remain relevant and hook into the larger cultural conversation. For as long as it keeps doing both of those things, $PWEASE could also see more upward movement in its price in the future. Nonetheless, it is vital to keep in mind that, as with other memecoins, $PWEASE is a dangerously speculative asset. Gains of recent times are beautiful; potential investors should, however, proceed with caution. Understand that you are dealing with an asset (a memecoin, in this case) that is highly volatile. You are dealing with the kind of asset that can give with one hand and take back with the other. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

After an elongated stretch of extreme fear and nearly record-setting lows that saw Bitcoin trading for as little as $78,000 at the beginning of March, the tide has turned; we find ourselves in a renewed era of at least mild optimism and what some traders are even calling a bull market. Bitcoin recently pushed back to $88,500, and the altcoins have followed suit by either holding their ground or churning back toward more favorable trading levels. Those were the good old days for hodlers and altcoin traders. What happened? Why the sudden shift? And can we believe it? Traditionally, the actions of retail investors have served as a good indicator for the direction in which the markets are heading. And right now, with the recent uptick in prices, everyone seems to have an opinion on what they think is going to happen next. Even more so than usual, the calls (and the confidence level of those making the calls) seem to be all over the place. Here’s a smattering of what some folks have been saying, from the clearly reasonable to the absurdly ludicrous. The Crowd’s Predictions and Market Psychology One of the most common occurrences in the world of cryptocurrencies is that the crowd tends to get its predictions wrong. This is especially true at moments of heightened optimism or extreme pessimism. The surge of recent price predictions, which have moved to a new range of $100,000 to $159,000, should serve as a cautionary signal for seasoned traders. The appearance of a consistent narrative among the masses that prices are going to increase quickly often foreshadows a market correction. And when the appearance of bullish sentiment is accompanied by isolated upward price spikes, the likelihood of an imminent market dip tends to increase. Market participants gripped by fear and negativity, and when the prevailing sentiment is “crypto is dead” or “Bitcoin is a scam,” it often indicates we’re at the bottom of a price cycle. These sentiments, which may seem counterintuitive, have been consistently observed over time, particularly during periods of market distress when panic sets in and prices plummet. As crypto has bounced nicely in the second half of March, traders have swung the pendulum back toward mild greed. After showing major fear in late February and early March following two stints of Bitcoin dipping as low as $78K, it appears that this rebound to $88.5K has… pic.twitter.com/WGvmvKSv2X — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 25, 2025 Individuals who have spent any significant amount of time trading in the crypto market know full well that it tends to act in the opposite manner to what traders expect. When the cry of “to the moon” goes up, or when traders are talking about how it’s nearly time to cash in big with “lambo time,” it’s almost a guarantee that a price correction is about to happen. When the market turns against us and has a collective meltdown, that’s usually when we should start loading up on more coins in preparation for the upside. The Role of Social Media and Retail Traders Market sentiment, especially in the world of cryptocurrency, is shaped in large part by social media. Price forecasts, whether rooted in thoughtful analysis or unbridled conjecture, often originate on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram. And while these platforms allow for almost direct conversation between traders about the conversation-starter price movements most traders live and die by, they also serve as amplifiers for the high and low emotions driving traders to make good decisions and bad decisions. This influence weighs heavily on a group that has little else to go on: retail traders, who make up a large portion of the cryptocurrency market and tend not to have the kind of resources employed by market makers or hedge funds. Price movements—significant ones, in either direction—tend to draw in retail traders, and over the last few years, we have seen how even the slightest bit of hype can drive them to unprecedented levels of euphoria or despair. From what we have seen thus far, a retail trader’s main weapon is an altcoin portfolio. As Bitcoin approaches its latest zenith, social media has once more been inundated by retail traders with gleeful projections of where the price might go next. Flooding in right beside this surge in bullish sentiment has been the almost obligatory call for an impending market correction, with some traders and pundits ready to see any signs at all of a market that might be overheating. For traders with several market cycles under their belt, this situation invites a critical reassessment of what might really be going on. A Word of Caution for Crypto Traders Recent changes in the market atmosphere should remind traders of the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency markets. The trading public—retail and institutional—reacts with the same emotions as every time in human history when the price of an asset rises: greed, envy, and lust. The Moon Boys of trading and the working masses react to the price of Bitcoin increasing with euphoria and elevate that feeling to collective sentiment. It is convenient to make fun of this in hindsight because the Bitcoin price is not at a new all-time high, but also just remember that the Bitcoin price was not at a new all-time high in June 2022 or in November 2022 either. Price movements in the cryptocurrency market often occur in a manner that goes against popular expectation. When retail traders grow overly bullish, the market tends to take a turn for the worse. When sentiment turns overwhelmingly negative, it is usually a sign that the market is bottoming out and poised to reverse. If you understand this pattern, you can make more informed decisions when trading and are less likely to become a victim of the emotional swings that characterize the cryptocurrency markets. In the end, the cryptocurrency trading that works best is the kind where the trader maintains a level head and follows a sound, well-thought-out strategy. Getting caught up in price rallies and the kind of bold predictions that are in no short supply when it comes to discussing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is quite easy. Even so, it remains of the utmost importance to keep in mind just how incredibly volatile these markets are and how the crowd’s expectations can serve as a pretty reliable indicator of what not to do if one is interested in doing something that will work.

The controversy involves a market titled “Ukraine agrees to Trump mineral deal before April?” which resolved as “Yes,” despite there being no official confirmation from U.S. or Ukrainian sources . Users are calling it the biggest manipulation case in the platform’s history, accusing insiders of using their power to influence the vote outcome. The rules for the market clearly said the result would be based only on official government sources. However, the resolution ignored this condition, and the outcome favored the “Yes” side. Many users lost money, and the crypto community is reacting with anger and suspicion. According to one user on X, two previous markets with nearly identical rules ended with a “No” result—yet they involved far less money, under $400,000 combined. In contrast, this manipulated market involved more than $7 million. The user claimed that a powerful participant used multiple accounts and cast votes with 5 million UMA tokens, representing 25% of the total voting power , to tilt the decision in their favor. Polymarket’s team responded in their Discord channel but refused to offer refunds. They explained the issue was not a platform failure but a unique situation they aim to prevent in the future. They promised improved systems and monitoring, but the explanation did little to calm users who lost significant funds. This is not the first time Polymarket has been accused of insider control. A detailed thread by crypto user Folke Hermansen outlined past cases of similar manipulation. He alleged that Polymarket insiders often write vague rules, place bets themselves, and work with verifiers to rig outcomes. One example involved a market about gold being missing from Fort Knox, which resolved to “No,” resulting in a $3.5 million loss for those who bet otherwise. In another case, Hermansen said the dispute option was quietly disabled during a critical window, preventing users from challenging a “No” resolution in a tariff-related market. A third example was a market about whether Trump would say “China” during a crypto event. Even though he said it, Polymarket clarified the rule after the fact and ruled “No,” which appeared retroactive and unfair. Hermansen points out that the UMA system used to verify market outcomes is flawed. Just two whales allegedly control over half the voting power. One person alone reportedly holds 7.5 million of the 20 million staked tokens. These whales are not neutral—they also place large bets, giving them both the power to vote and financial reasons to sway results. He explained that UMA is supposed to reward truth-seeking, but it really encourages users to vote with the majority to avoid losing staked tokens . This creates a system where large holders lead the vote, and others follow to avoid losses. That means truth doesn’t matter as much as following the crowd. Adding to the problem, challenging a market outcome requires a bond, usually $750 USDC. Large holders can afford to challenge or propose outcomes easily, while smaller users can’t risk the money. This keeps control in the hands of the few, with most disputes ending in near-total agreement—sometimes over 95%.

A wallet, 0x5a8, which is thought to belong to Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance, seems to have sold quite a lot of CRV tokens. This particular wallet sold 1 million CRV for 515048 USDC at an average price of $0.515. This might be the latest in a series of transactions aimed at liquidating Egorov’s assets, but it has raised quite a few eyebrows in the DeFi community. Significantly, 18 hours before the sale, Wallet 0x5a8 received 1.997 million CRV, valued at about $1.03 million, from Wallet 0x7a1, which most believe is linked to Egorov. After the sale of 1 million CRV, Wallet 0x5a8 now holds just under 1 million CRV, worth approximately $512,000. This recent transaction, combined with previous sales, suggests that Michael Egorov might be liquidating a large chunk of his holdings in the token. A Flurry of Sales in the Past 48 Hours This recent sale of 1 million CRV tokens is not an isolated event. In the past two days, Wallet 0x5a8 has likely sold a total of 1.469 million CRV for 753,229 USDC at an average price of $0.513. The combined value of these sales paints a picture of a significant liquidation of holdings, possibly signaling a change in strategy or a response to broader market conditions. Michael Egorov ( @newmichwill ), founder of #Curve Finance, appears to be selling $CRV again! 18 hours ago, he transferred 1.997M $CRV (worth $1.03M) to the wallet “0x5a8.” Just now, this wallet sold 1M $CRV for 515,058 $USDC at an average price of $0.515, leaving 997K $CRV … https://t.co/GXUzvBOhpe pic.twitter.com/5DalDRgHfv — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 26, 2025 The context is that the price of CRV has varied widely in recent months. For the last several days, the price of CRV has been hanging just over the $0.50 line, with a significant drop that possibly nudged Egorov to offload some of his stake. With CRV’s price in such a state of flux, watchers of these deals are trying to get a read on where the token might be headed next. What’s Behind the Recent CRV Sales? DeFi enthusiasts have been left wondering why Michael Egorov has sold off so much CRV, considering that he is the founder of Curve Finance, the decentralized exchange that is one of the top three in the ecosystem. The most straightforward explanation is that he needs money, that he has some personal financial situation that has not yet come to light. Another possibility is that he is doing some sort of financial engineering with his own CRV and that of other liquidity providers to boost the price of CRV at a time when zooming past $1.00 is indispensable for some sort of up-or-down scenario to play out. One potential rationale for the sale might be connected to the cryptocurrency and DeFi sectors’ larger market dynamics. For the past several months, the market has been in a state of turbulence, with many tokens’ values swinging up and down—notably, the price of CRV. Global financial markets’ current uncertainty, when mixed with the DeFi space’s volatile sentiment, could yield a pretty good covering fire for Egorov if he were selling as a way to secure some profits and/or reallocate his assets for improved risk management. Another possible explanation for the sale could be tied to personal finances. As a major player in DeFi, Egorov’s fiscal health and his role at Curve Finance are probably central to most people’s minds when they think about the market’s perception of CRV. If he’s in need of cash for some reason—be it personal or business—that could certainly account for these large-scale sales we’ve seen recently. Impact on Curve Finance and CRV Selling 1.469 million CRV tokens in just two days is a big deal for the person who did it and for the whole Curve Finance ecosystem. Curve is one of the biggest decentralized exchanges, and it counts a lot on the success and even more on the adoption of its native token, CRV. When key people in the project—especially the founder—do large-scale sell-offs, that can affect how investors feel about the project. And we all know that when investor sentiment shifts, increased volatility often follows. So this seems like a bad scene for CRV. So was this an urgent sale of CRV done mostly to keep from getting liquidated? Was Egorov acting out of caution? Or has he and Curve Finance cooked up a clever strategy here that’s going to pay off and send the CRV price skyward, while also helping keep the order book on this DEX from going belly up? Again, these developments might give some people a reason to rethink the future trajectory of Curve Finance. What’s Next for CRV? The future of Curve Finance and its token’s trajectory are, understandably, being called into question as Egorov sells off a portion of his holdings in CRV. What is happening with DeFi, and what will happen with it in the future, is anyone’s guess. But DeFi has not been a space of quietude, and it has not been a space of steadfast prices. When a project or its token has shown as much instability as Curve and CRV have lately, it is ever more understandable that questions might arise about how this situation could possibly improve. At present, CRV is experiencing a lot of downside pressure as a consequence of the recent sales. However, it is imperative to remember that the success of both Curve DAO and Curve’s corresponding DEX are inextricably linked to the future of Curve Finance and CRV. Despite its current straits, Curve Finance remains one of the most significant DeFi platforms in the crypto sphere, with an impressive liquidity pool north of a billion dollars and a customer base that stretches from all corners of the DeFi universe. The market will probably keep watching for more signals from Egorov and other important people in the project to figure out if this sale is an isolated event or part of a larger trend where they’re divesting from the CRV token. Is this move a sign of caution? Or is it, as some have speculated, a strategic reallocation of assets? Only time will tell, but it’s certainly a development not just investors but also enthusiasts of Curve Finance will be keeping a close eye on in the next few weeks. And we won’t have to wait long; the next couple of weeks could hold some important developments for both Curve Finance and the CRV token. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

(NYSE: GME) has announced plans to raise $1.3 billion through a private offering of convertible senior notes, with a portion of the proceeds earmarked for acquiring Bitcoin (BTC). Investment Policy Update and Funding Plans On Tuesday, GameStop’s board of directors unanimously approved the update to its investment policy, enabling the gaming retailer to allocate capital into Bitcoin. The company disclosed its funding plan in a Wednesday press release, stating: “GameStop expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy.” The move aligns with strategies employed by other corporations, most notably Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has accumulated billions in Bitcoin over the past year. GameStop’s decision marks another instance of a major publicly traded company integrating cryptocurrency into its financial strategy. Details of the Convertible Senior Notes Offering The company plans to issue $1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2030. Additionally, GameStop intends to grant initial purchasers an option to buy up to $200 million more in notes within a 13-day period from the first issuance date. GameStop confirmed that the notes will be general unsecured obligations, bearing no regular interest and with no accretion in principal amount. They are set to mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier. Upon conversion, the company has the option to settle in cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of both. The initial conversion rate and other terms will be determined at the time of pricing, with the U.S. composite volume-weighted average price of GameStop stock from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the pricing date serving as the reference for the initial conversion price. Regulatory Considerations and Offering Uncertainty GameStop emphasized that neither the notes nor any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws. As a result, they cannot be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption. The company further noted that there is no guarantee the offering will be completed as planned. However, if successful, GameStop will join a growing list of corporations diversifying their balance sheets with Bitcoin, signaling a continued shift toward cryptocurrency adoption in traditional financial markets.

Whale 0xce0 sold $7.81 million worth of Solana ($SOL) into the Kraken exchange. The latest transaction consists of 54,113 EIGEN tokens and is part of a larger move in which Whale 0xce0 has been managing and expanding its crypto portfolio. Reports from OnchainLens say that what we’ve seen so far this week is not just a single transaction but part of a larger episode in which Whale 0xce0 has been putting together a portfolio of all sorts of crypto assets. The deposit into Kraken that the whale made is just one of many moves that have solidified its position in the market. To date, the whale has transferred a massive 1,573,313 $SOL, worth around $293.26 million, in 2025 alone. The whale now holds 3,232,101 tokens of $SOL, giving it an impressive valuation of $469.1 million. A whale has been selling $EIGEN at a loss of $2M (-69%) over the past 2 days! From Oct 8 to 18, 2024, whale “0xce0” spent 1,198 $ETH (~$2.9M) to buy 772,450 $EIGEN at an avg. price of $3.76. After a 68% drop in price over the last 5.5 months, the whale unstaked and sold 780,132… pic.twitter.com/a5gxdtg5Df — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 26, 2025 A Dive into Whale 0xce0’s EIGEN Journey EIGEN began its journey with Whale on October 8, 2024, when Whale invested heavily in the token. Between October 8 and 18, Whale 0xce0 spent 1,198 ETH, worth around $2.9 million at the time, to purchase a substantial amount of 772,450 EIGEN tokens. The tokens were acquired at an average price of $3.76 each, and Whale 0xce0 immediately staked these tokens, presumably to earn rewards via EIGEN’s staking mechanism. This was a long-term investment play, seen as a move that would pay off if and when the EIGEN token grew in value. The staking rewards, if any, would simply sweeten the deal. When Whale 0xce0 purchased EIGEN, its price appeared to hold great promise in what seemed at the time to be an emerging bullish market. Subsequent events demonstrated, however, that the conditions were anything but bullish. EIGEN’s price plunged over the next few months—as did the prices of many, many other cryptocurrencies—while Whale 0xce0’s purchase couldn’t have been looking much worse. The Price Crash and Unstaking Present day, and the value of EIGEN has taken a massive hit. Over the last 5.5 months, the price of EIGEN plummeted by 69%, which undoubtedly shook the confidence of investors, particularly those with large holdings like Whale 0xce0. As the token’s value continued to slide, Whale decided to unstake and sell a significant portion of their EIGEN holdings. In the past day, Whale 0xce0 divested 780,132 EIGEN tokens, valued at roughly $919,000, at an average price of $1.178 per token. The transaction was split between 9.196 WBTC and 53.423 ETH. Whale 0xce0 purchased EIGEN back in May 2023. Their purchase price was $3.76 per token. Their recent sale, therefore, combined with the acquisition of WBTC, highlights a significant loss in value since their purchase. Although they tried to save some worth by turning their EIGEN assets into more stable currencies like WBTC and ETH, it is nevertheless a massive loss. It shows how much the crypto market can fluctuate and how inherently unstable it can be—this is not news to anyone. But the numbers are still jarring even for a market known for its ups and downs. Whale 0xce0’s decision to buy EIGEN at the peak on July 21, 2022, for a price of $6.75, along with the decision to hold it until now, has resulted in a massive unrealized loss of $4,572,954. The Implications of Whale 0xce0’s Actions Whale 0xce0 had a substantial amount of EIGEN tokens in their possession. They decided to sell and did so at a heavy loss, worth about half of what they had paid for the tokens. When a large holder like Whale 0xce0 sells and signals that they’re not confident in a token’s future, it raises eyebrows. A lot of people watch what the big players do and then take it as a sign to do (or not do) something with the token themselves. It’s important to note, though, that Whale 0xce0’s decision to unstake and sell may also reflect larger market conditions. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and tokens in the Einsteins Universe, like EIGEN, aren’t exempt from that treatment. They’ve also faced significant price corrections as part of a broader market trend. The loss of $2.01 million is absolutely a bummer, but if nothing else, it’s a reminder of the risks involved in trading cryptos, where market sentiment can shift on a dime and prices can move around a lot. EIGEN’s price drop might not only result from market conditions but could also derive from other sources, like these: – low liquidity in the EIGEN market, – movements in investor sentiment towards EIGEN, – broader trends in the DeFi space that might affect EIGEN’s price. Whale 0xce0’s experience shows that these factors can work in tandem or in parallel to produce price moves that can easily go against you in this volatile crypto world. Conclusion Whale 0xce0’s recent transaction, selling 389,523 EIGEN tokens for $457,000, highlights the cryptocurrency investment landscape’s risks and rewards. This whale’s initial decision to make a heavy investment in EIGEN at an average price of $3.76 now stands in stark contrast to their recent liquidation of the same asset at a much lower price of $1.173. And that, friends and family, is a not-so-cryptic way of saying that the unpredictable price action of the cryptocurrency market just bit this whale hard on the backside. As the market forms, the conduct of whales like 0xce0 will probably continue to occupy an important place in molding the feeling of EIGEN and other tokens like it. Can EIGEN come back from the recent downturn? The question remains open. But the significant losses suffered by Whale 0xce0 make for a cautionary tale that most of us can interpret in at least two ways. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The company is now bringing its own kind of innovation to the industry. Recently, Alon, one of PumpFun’s co-founders, shared some very future-forward plans for the platform with the folks at Bankless. Alon told the crypto media outlet that PumpFun is preparing to launch a feature called “Creator Revenue Sharing.” This initiative, Alon explained, is set to redefine what it means to be a creator on the PumpFun platform. In an interesting statement, Alon cleared up the misconception that he and his fellow YouTube stars are raking in the dough and living lavish lives. “We reinvest in product development almost all the revenue we generate (which is a decent amount but not what you might think). So, by the way, when this company is valued at $1 billion, it’s not because we’ve printed money and have a lot in our bank account. It’s because we’ve reinvested almost everything into development and we’ve got this amazing product that works super well for the people who use it. Alon’s comments highlight an important facet of PumpFun’s work: the company is not just in the business of making money from token trading or speculation. Rather, it is deeply committed to growing its platform, and its storyline in the crypto space is one of direct and obvious linkage between the development of its products and the kind of success that would make it a company of substance and not just a revenue-focused project. Alon, co-founder of PumpFun, said in Bankless that the Creator Revenue Sharing function will be launched. He claimed that all the $600 million in revenue was reinvested in product development and not distributed to investors. The team now has 45 to 50 people, mainly engineers.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 26, 2025 Currently, the PumpFun team comprises approximately 45 to 50 individuals, a large portion of whom are focused on engineering. This indicates that the company has a strong emphasis on technical development—a most favorable posture to take in the highly competitive cryptocurrency and blockchain universe. With the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and creator-driven ecosystems, PumpFun’s investment in its engineering team seems a shrewd way to ensure that it remains competitive. PumpFun’s Role in the Crypto Ecosystem What makes PumpFun different from many other players in the crypto world is its vision. The company is not just gathering up tokens for some future financial windfall; it’s building a platform that aims to give real power to creators and change the way they work with and earn from digital assets. One of the first steps on this path, which could take it in a number of different directions, is a new feature called Creator Revenue Sharing. Furthermore, the choice made by PumpFun to reinvest all of its earnings back into the platform instead of sharing it with profit investors like the usual in the crypto space reflects a long-term development strategy that seems to be working for the new decentralized online gaming platform. The usual in the crypto space is projects that share dividends with investors and promise imminent returns. PumpFun is not that type of project. Instead, it is clearly using its funds to grow and develop itself further. The firm holds a substantial amount of $SOL, one of the highest market cap cryptocurrencies, which indicates its belief in Solana’s long-term potential as a reliable platform. Solana is a rising star in the blockchain sector, largely due to its throughput, which is much greater than that of Ethereum; low fees; and reliable speed, which makes it compliant with the demands of “decentralized applications” and other blockchain-based services. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for PumpFun? As PumpFun keeps extending its portfolio and honing its platform, the next several months may well be pivotal for it in the fiercely competitive world of cryptocurrency. The successful launch of the Creator Revenue Sharing feature could give a handsome boost to the platform’s user base, bringing not just more users but also more creators into its ecosystem. And with an expanding team of engineers and an evident laser-like focus on product development, PumpFun is starting to look like a force to be reckoned with in the blockchain world. With total holdings of $469.1 million, PumpFun is positioned for the long haul. It’s not about to go quietly into that good night. The company told me its enhanced focus on reinvestment and innovation is enabling it to build out a “long-term” business model. Thus, while PumpFun hasn’t turned product development revenue into a near-term profit engine, the trajectory of the model might at some point turn this startup into a significant player in the still-emerging space of blockchain-based “creator economies.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Analysts warn that if BTC stumbles, CRV’s run could fizzle before it hits new highs. CrediBULL Crypto has highlighted a critical resistance zone for CRV. A clean break above this level could send the token soaring beyond $2. However, BTC’s stability remains a linchpin, with any sharp drop below $80,000 possibly derailing the rally. The Make-or-Break Levels for CRV In a recent post on X, CrediBULL shared a 4-hour chart showing CRV encountering significant resistance between $0.67 and $0.83. He described this area as the “LTF bull/bear line in the sand,” signifying the zone that needs to be crossed for a sustained upward trend. In the analyst’s opinion, clearing that line would suggest a confirmed bottom for CRV, opening the path for future gains. Conversely, a rejection at that level could trigger a temporary pullback, offering traders a fresh buying opportunity. Looking at the latest price data for CRV, the token has gained 30% over the past month, rebounding from lows around $0.40 to its current level above $0.52. This uptick seems to have largely been supported by Bitcoin’s recent climb past $88,000, which injected confidence into altcoin markets. However, even with the jump, CRV remains nearly 90% below its all-time high of $6.40. Bitcoin’s Crossroads Meanwhile, BTC has experienced some attrition in the last 30 days, losing slightly under 5% of its value. According to data from CoinGecko, its worst performance in the past month was on March 11, when prices hovered just above $77,000. However, since then, the asset has been on a steady upward trend, serving as a cornerstone for broader market sentiment. Its foray above $88,000 a couple of days ago placed it at a pivotal stage. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index (BCMI) remains below 0.5 , indicating the market isn’t yet overheated. This level leaves room for both a bullish continuation as well as a potential market correction. Observers like Santiment have warned of growing greed , with a spike in social media predictions placing BTC as high as $159,000 fueling speculative enthusiasm. In parallel, the integration of the number one cryptocurrency into corporate treasuries is making waves, especially after video game retailer GameStop put aside $1.3 billion to buy Bitcoin. So, as CRV navigates its resistance zone, traders will need to keep a close eye on BTC’s performance. A dip towards $80,000 could derail CRV’s momentum, while sustained stability may further push its ascent.

SHIB token dropped to a low of $0.00001443, down by about 55% from its highest point this year. It has plunged by over 65% from last year’s high. So, what next for the SHIB coin as its burn rate accelerates? Shiba Inu burn rate accelerates A potential catalyst for the SHIB price is the ongoing incineration. Data by Shiburn shows that the burn rate has jumped by over 57,0000% in the last 24 hours. This increase happened after one user moved 1 billion tokens to a dead address. At the current price, these tokens are worth over $14,500. This burn happened after another user incinerated 1 billion Shiba Inu coins. Another user burned over 2.1 million Shiba Inu coins on Thursday. Therefore, these token burns mean that the coin’s inflation will continue going down in the coming months. Data shows that there have been over 410 trillion Shiba Inu coin burns over the years. These burns have lowered the number of tokens in circulation to about 584 million coins, a number that will continue falling in the next few years. However, the reality is that the overall deflation is not all that big when you compare the size of Shiba Inu, which has a market cap of over $7 billion. Potential catalysts for SHIB coin There are several potential catalysts for the Shiba Inu coin. First, Donald Trump’s tariffs will likely lead to a recession in the United States. While a recession is a bad thing, history shows that risky assets bounce back after the initial drop. The main driver for these assets when there is a recession is that the Federal Reserve tends to intervene when markets crash. The bank does that by cutting interest rates and implementing quantitative easing policies that flood the market with money. At the same time, the federal government often intervenes by providing money to support key sectors. For example, in the 2008/9 crisis, the government spent over $700 billion in saving the banking sector. It spent trillions of dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fiscal and monetary interventions draw investors into risky assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks. Such a move will benefit cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Shiba Inu coin. Second, Shibarium, its layer-2 network may boost Shiba Inu price. Data shows that the network is nearing 1 billion completed transactions now that it has handled over 975 million coins. The number of accounts has grown to over 245k, while blocks have risen to 10.15 million coins. Shibarium is an important part of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem in that the fees generated in the ecosystem are converted into Shiba Inu and then incinerated. While Shibarium has not been all that successful, there is a likelihood that it will be in the future. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart by TradingView The weekly chart shows that the SHIBZ coin has been in a downward trend in the past few weeks. It has crashed from a high of $0.000035 to low of $0.00001525. Shiba Inu price has moved slightly below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a bearish view. However, on the positive side, it has formed a megaphone chart pattern, which is characterized by two ascending and broadening wedge pattern. It is one of the most popular bullish patterns in technical analysis. Therefore, the SHIB coin price will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the coming weeks, with the next key point to watch being at $0.00003395, which is about 130% above the current level.

It all started when Sam Altman changed his profile picture, sparking the Ghibli trend across social media. These unique images, often featuring real people, have been flooding the internet. What’s the Hype About? OpenAI’s new update with ChatGPT includes an AI tool that can transform regular images into a whimsical Studio Ghibli animation style. Whether it’s for fun, self-expression, or a meme, the Studio Ghibli style has captured the hearts of many, offering a glimpse into the potential future of AI in creative fields. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, joined the Ghibli-style portrait trend, creating images featuring himself, Stuart Alderoty, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Garlinghouse’s Ghibli picture with Alderoty sparked a humorous reaction from many online.

The firm has been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin , and according to a new report from Bernstein, its holdings could skyrocket to over 1 million BTC by 2033 if market conditions remain favorable. JUST IN: BERNSTEIN ANALYST PREDICTS STRATEGY’S BITCOIN HOLDINGS COULD DOUBLE TO 1M $BTC IN A BULL CASE SCENARIO, AND EXPECTS BITCOIN TO HIT $200,000 BY THE END OF 2025, $500,000 BY 2029, AND $1 MILLION BY 2033. Source: @Cointelegraph https://t.co/4wLVOvSbTs pic.twitter.com/7WmgXzIWzM — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) March 27, 2025 A Massive Bitcoin Accumulation Plan Currently, Strategy holds 506,137 BTC, already making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. But Bernstein’s bullish forecast suggests the company could more than double that, reaching 1,013,000 BTC—equivalent to 5.8% of Bitcoin’s current circulating supply. This projection assumes Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by 2025 , $500,000 by 2029, and eventually $1 million by 2033. To fund this aggressive expansion, Strategy would likely rely on the capital markets, potentially increasing its debt from $11 billion to a staggering $100 billion while raising $84 billion in equity. The analysts believe that lower interest rates and strong investor demand would be key to making this plan feasible. Where BTC Stands! While Bitcoin is still below $90K, the best recovery level as of now is seen as the $90,000 level where the market will get interested again, with options market makers expected to influence price swings. Data from Deribit shows that market makers are “short gamma” at this strike, meaning they’ll need to buy when BTC rises and sell when it drops, adding to market turbulence. Despite this, BloFin’s Griffin Ardern suggests that there is a possibility of a bullish move ahead. With Friday’s options settlement, BTC could stay quite volatile around this key level. What Happens if Bitcoin Slows Down? Not everyone believes Bitcoin will keep going up without setbacks. If Bitcoin reaches a peak in 2025 and then starts a long decline, Strategy might stop buying more BTC and hold around 514,800 BTC, which is just 2.6% of the total supply . In this case, the company might even have to sell some of its Bitcoin to handle its growing debt, which would still climb but to a smaller amount—around $51 billion. Investors Still See Growth Potential Despite the risks, Bernstein remains confident in Strategy’s long-term position, maintaining an “outperform” rating and setting a $600 price target—representing a 75% upside from current levels. The firm’s valuation model applies a 2x EV/sales multiple to Strategy’s software segment and a 55% premium on its Bitcoin holdings, in line with its average market valuation since pivoting to Bitcoin in 2020. Meanwhile, Strategy continues its Bitcoin buying spree. Between March 17 and March 23, the company added another 6,911 BTC for $584.1 million, further solidifying its commitment to Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. Whether Bitcoin soars or faces challenges, Strategy is going all in on its bet that digital gold is here to stay. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The firm also noted that there was currently a shift towards long-term holder accumulation, with wealth now transferring back towards price incentive investors. Coin Metrics analytics platform also reported that the share of supply held by long-term holders continued to rise, recently reaching around 63%.

Under the surface, a shift towards Long-Term Holder accumulation appears ongoing, with wealth now transferring back towards price… pic.twitter.com/S36DJfHjao — glassnode (@glassnode) March 26, 2025 Glassnode reported that short-term Bitcoin holders were currently facing increased financial pressure in the wake of challenging crypto market conditions. The firm revealed that BTC’s short-term holders have incurred realized losses of $7 billion over the past 30 days. The on-chain platform argued that the run of losses marked the most prolonged loss event of the current market cycle. Short-term holders’ unrealized losses also intensified, nearing the +2 standard deviation threshold, which is a level that has historically pointed to an increased risk of capitulation. Glassnode also argued that history showed short-term BTC holders were not in the worst position they could be in despite the mounting capitulation risk. Data revealed that current figures remained well below the $19.8 billion and $20.7 billion loss spikes witnessed during the 2021 to 2022 crash. The analytics firm also argued that losses were still aligned with patterns seen in the middle of previous corrections during bull markets. The firm’s outlook correlated with that of crypto analyst PlanB that Bitcoin is still in the middle of its bullish run. On-chain data from CryptoQuant indicated that BTC’s Bull Score Index had plummeted to 20, its lowest point in two years. The digital asset is currently exchanging hands at $86K at the time of publication, a 23% drop from its recent all-time high in January. The digital asset’s corrective phase also initiated a four-month low at $76,000 on March 11. Price rebounds have only occurred when the index climbs above 60. The analytics firm stated that the current low reading signaled that the crypto market is still trapped in uncertainty, where sellers are currently outpacing buyers in momentum. CryptoQuant also noted that sustained capital outflow from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds was a major contributing factor. The firm reported that more than $4.4 billion had flowed out of spot BTC ETFs since February. Data from SosoValue also indicated that spot ETF behavior shifted last week despite the heavy outflows, with consecutive days of net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Long-term Bitcoin holders show signs of bullishness Glassnode reported that long-term Bitcoin holders have continued to hold large amounts of the digital currency. The firm suggested that there were signs of a “unique market dynamic moving forward.” In a March 18 markets report, the analytics platform stated that long-term holder (LTH) activity remained largely subdued, with a notable decline in their sell-side pressure. Source: Glassnode Insights. Total supply held by Bitcoin long-term holders. The Binary Spending Indicator, which determines when LTHs are spending a significant proportion of their holding in a sustained manner, showed a slowdown in long-term holders activity. The indicator also showed that LTH supply was beginning to rebound after several months of decline. “This perhaps represents a shift in sentiment, with Long-Term Holder behavior moving away from sell-side distribution.” – Glassnode Insights Bull market tops are often followed by intense sell-side pressure and strong profit-taking among LTHs, which signals a shift to bearish momentum. Glassnode acknowledged that despite BTC’s drawdown in recent weeks, LTHs continued to hold a large portion of their profits, especially during the current later stage of the cycle. The firm also suggested that Bitcoin long-term holders might still be expecting more price upside later in the year. On-chain data from CryptoQuant revealed that new BTC whales, addresses holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin, were aggressively accumulating amid market downturn. The firm argued that it signaled strong conviction in the digital asset’s long-term outlook among the new large investors. CryptoQuant’s independent analyst stated on March 7 that the cohort collectively acquired over 1 million BTC since 2024, “positioning themselves as one of the most influential market participants.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In a new video update, Green says that Bitcoin may see a boost from US President Donald Trump’s support of crypto, helping to pump it to $150,000 this year. He also says that Trump’s tariff policies may create macroeconomic turmoil, driving investors to move their wealth into the safe haven asset golf. However, Green says some investors may also invest in Bitcoin, treating it like digital gold. “Bitcoin has the opportunity to do incredibly well. And of course, with the Trump administration and all the things that they’re doing, on one hand the positive of supporting crypto and backing it, and of course, looking for a digital future for America, and at the same time causing a little, perhaps, chaos if there are tariffs. Of course, that again makes many people concerned about what’s going to happen with emerging markets and what’s going to happen with other countries. Well, of course, when there is uncertainty, more and more people invest in gold. Yes, of course. But they also want an alternative, and Bitcoin gives that alternative. For me, $150,000 by the end of the year.” Bitcoin is trading for $87,163 at time of writing, flat on the day.

This move also follows a 200+% surge in the company's stock since it began buying Bitcoin in late 2024. GameStop saw a nearly 12% stock jump as well after announcing plans to invest in Bitcoin by using proceeds from a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining stocks fell after Microsoft reportedly scaled back its AI data center expansion plans, which caused doubt on miners’ diversification into AI infrastructure to offset post-halving revenue declines. The Blockchain Group Makes Biggest BTC Purchase France-based The Blockchain Group recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings by adding 580 BTC to its treasury in its largest purchase to date. The acquisition is valued at approximately $50.64 million at current market prices, and was disclosed after market hours on March 26. Blockchain Group’s stock price over the past 6 months (Source: Google Finance ) This move was made after an impressive 225% surge in the company’s stock price since it began investing in Bitcoin in November of 2024. The Blockchain Group describes itself as a global umbrella for companies focused on data intelligence, artificial intelligence, and decentralized technologies. Details about The Blockchain Group’s BTC acquisitions (Source: Euronext ) The firm’s Bitcoin buying strategy seems to align with certain key moments in the broader crypto market. Its first purchase of 15 BTC happened on Nov. 5, which coincided with Donald Trump’s US election win. The second was a 25 BTC acquisition that took place on Dec. 4 as Bitcoin hovered around $96,000, just before it hit six figures. While March 26 wasn’t a specific milestone for Bitcoin, it arrived just before the end of Q1 2025, which is a quarter in which Bitcoin underperformed compared to historical averages, and a few weeks ahead of the April 20 Bitcoin halving anniversary. The company says its Bitcoin strategy is intended to make use of excess cash and favorable financing options. The most recent purchase also happened as interest in corporate Bitcoin holdings seems to be gaining renewed momentum. This growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is drawing a lot of commentary from industry players. N7 Capital founder Anton Chashchin believes that it will be worth watching whether other companies follow suit. US angel investor Jason Calacanis agreed with this, and suggested that Bitcoin can serve as a viable asset strategy for public firms lacking robust business models. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor's firm Strategy recently surpassed the 500,000 BTC mark after buying 506,137 Bitcoin. This was part of the company’s 12-week buying spree from November through January. Bitcoin Bet Boosts GameStop Shares GameStop shares also jumped by close to 12% on March 26 after the company’s announcement that it plans to purchase Bitcoin. The move will be financed through debt, with GameStop unveiling a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering after the market closed that day. These convertible senior notes, which can later be turned into equity, will fund general corporate initiatives, including Bitcoin acquisition, which is in line with the company’s updated investment policy. On March 25, GameStop revealed that it will use part of its corporate cash or future financing to buy digital assets like Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins. The company’s cash reserves saw a massive increase, and stands at about $4.77 billion. This is up from $921.7 million the previous year. GameStop’s stock closed at $28.36 on the NYSE, posting an 11.65% gain for the day. GameStop stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The firm also reported a Q4 2024 net income of $131.3 million, which was more than double the $63.1 million posted during the same period the previous year. Despite a $511 million year-over-year drop in net sales, GameStop aggressively reduced its operating costs, including shutting down 590 stores across the US in 2024. The company was once the face of the 2021 meme stock phenomenon that saw retail investors drive its price sky-high in a dramatic short squeeze, and is now pivoting toward digital asset investment. GameStop’s move mirrors a broader trend of companies incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Japanese firm Metaplanet plans to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026, and it experienced a 4800% increase in its stock and a 6300% jump in market capitalization after embracing its Bitcoin strategy. Semler Scientific also reported a rise in its share price after disclosing its intent to buy Bitcoin. Metaplanet stock price rise over the past year According to data from CoinGecko , 34 publicly traded companies currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Bitcoin Mining Stocks Slide On the other hand, Bitcoin mining stocks took a hit after reports that Microsoft is scaling back its plans to invest in new artificial intelligence data centers in the United States and Europe. The news was first reported by Bloomberg and reflected in Google Finance data. In fact, it triggered share price drops of between 4% and 12% for major crypto mining firms including Bitfarms, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital, and Riot. The decline shed some light on the growing reliance of Bitcoin miners on AI-related revenue streams, particularly after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event that reduced mining rewards and tightened margins across the industry. Core Scientific stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google ) Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer thinks that while Microsoft’s decision was expected by some investors, the broader market reaction may be more closely tied to Bitcoin’s stagnant price and growing investor fatigue in the sector. Mining difficulty is also at historically high levels, compounding the challenges for miners already grappling with weaker crypto prices. To adapt, many mining companies started repurposing their infrastructure to support high-performance computing for AI workloads. A March report from Coin Metrics shared some details about this shift, and pointed out that miners are increasingly diversifying into AI data center hosting to boost revenue. In June of 2024, Core Scientific committed 200 megawatts of capacity to power AI models developed by CoreWeave. In August, asset manager VanEck projected that mining stocks could see up to $37 billion in added market capitalization if they invest in AI infrastructure. (Source: VanEck ) However, these plans may now face additional headwinds. Microsoft’s decision to cancel or delay data center projects adds a new layer of uncertainty. Analysts at TD Cowen attributed the move to a perceived oversupply of computing capacity for AI applications and a scaling back of some planned collaborations with OpenAI. Over the past six months, Microsoft reportedly abandoned multiple data center leases and may continue to decelerate investments into late 2025, once it completes $80 billion in previously planned developments. For now, this shift is the start of a more cautious phase for AI infrastructure spending and raises concerns for Bitcoin miners hoping to capitalize on the sector.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-27 09:18:15

No longer is it a pass-off game between various government bodies: Digital assets now have dedicated overseers in a lot of regions. One of the pioneers in the space is Dubai's crypto regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). What sets VARA apart is its ability to effectively communicate guidelines and regulation to crypto firms, according to its senior official. ""Set and forget does not work for crypto, it's all about feedback and open channels,"" said Sean McHugh, senior director of market assurance at VARA. ""Since we are exclusively focused on crypto, it allows us to get a little deeper into the tech and our rules are written for the modern-era."" Dubai has become a crypto darling, emerging as one of the preferred choice for non-native crypto firms to set up shop and gain access to the region and beyond. ""Dubai is seen as a great jumping off point. We've seen a lot of [crypto] firms from Europe and beyond coming here and the reverse is also true, we see a lot of companies from other side of Asia come here. It's a strategic move and the regulatory clarity helps them,"" McHugh added. Tokenization and beyond Real world tokenization, or RWA, is gaining lot of traction in Dubai and for good reason. The region's real estate agency, the Dubai Land Department (DLD), recently started a pilot to register and transfer property deeds on the blockchain. The tokenization initiative is being fostered by VARA and the Dubai Future Foundation (DFF). The integration of real-estate into blockchain could bolster the city's massive property market. DLD expects tokenized real-estate to jump to 60 billion dirhams ($16 billion) by 2033, accounting for 7% of Dubai's total property transactions. McHugh, speaking to CoinDesk at VARA's office, believes that real estate is just the beginning. ""It's very popular, not just in Dubai, but beyond. Dubai has the ability to get things done quicker,"" he said, adding that they are also seeing a lot of precious metal tokenization projects. VARA, with its nimble approach to regulation, is closely watching the space, he said. ""Whether it's real estate, precious metal, or some other asset, a big part of my focus on this is customer protection. So, especially when you get to fractionalization it brings in a lot of new capital and retail investors, that need to be protected,"" he said. ""We ask a lot of questions when it comes to RWA projects, what is the token? what exactly do I own? What does it trade and who is the liquidity provider? Cause for investors (institutional or otherwise) they need a liquidity event to get out. And these are the type of things we drill down with each project,"" McHugh emphasized. Interagency collaboration The Donald Trump administration has openly advocated for crypto in the U.S. and in the opinion of industry leaders pushed other regions to follow suit. That's not necessarily the case in the UAE, especially with VARA, which was created three years ago, long before the U.S. President became an open proponent of digital assets. McHugh believes that interagency cooperation will be key for global crypto regulation, but does not see any particular agency leading the charge. ""I don't think we'd see some super regulator, regional or otherwise. I think each agency is focused on its own customers,"" he said, adding that memoranda of understanding (MoU) and open communication between governing bodies is the way to successfully watch over crypto. Whether it's exchanges, Web3 or RWA, the future of crypto in Dubai looks bright and McHugh, who was the former chief compliance officer at Citadel, said he feels that one of the main reason for that is the pro-business and start-up nature of the city.",Policy|Vara|Dubai|Tokenization|Real Estate,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-27 09:19:34

Bitcoin has retracted from its $109K high, while altcoins have faced even steeper declines. According to Coinglass data, investor sentiment has shifted from a phase of “greed” to one of “fear,” sparking debate over whether this is merely a dip or the onset of a bear market. As trading risks increase, more investors are seeking stable and reliable passive income solutions. Centralized exchanges are competing to expand their wealth management offerings, and HTX Earn is leading the charge — delivering top-tier yields, an expansive range of supported assets, and constant product upgrades. Together, these features create a seamless and automated earning experience for crypto holders. Earn While You Trade: The Power of HTX Auto-Earn HTX Earn has recently launched a major upgrade to its Auto-Earn feature, enabling smoother, more flexible capital deployment with one-click subscription and redemption.

Cryptocurrency trading group HashKey has unveiled a new initiative to rate cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges in Hong Kong to help the local crypto businesses align with regulatory framework for virtual assets, issued by the Securities and Futures Commission. In an X post on Thursday, March 27, HashKey said it partnered with the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Rating Company, which will provide three key services: virtual asset ratings, exchange ratings, and virtual asset indices. According to HashKey, the initiative aims to build an “industry evaluation ecosystem” offering “objective quantitative standards” for both exchanges and investors. The goal is to strengthen market transparency and create compliance benchmarks, which, in turn, could help solidify Hong Kong’s role as a global virtual asset hub. Per HashKey, the ratings would provide risk indicators to help investors make more informed decisions.

However, the deal has not been officially announced yet and the source refused to be identified until the agreement goes public. A representative for Tether ( USDT ) has not responded to a request for comment regarding the deal with the Italian firm, neither has a spokesperson from Be Water. Founded in 2021 by financier and writer Guido Brera, Be Water is a broadcast media company based in Rome, Italy. It is the parent company of podcast production firm Chora Media and Instagram-based content company Will Media, as well as the distribution and production firm Be Water Film. It made its debut at the Cannes Film Festival last year and has partnered with major players from the Italian film industry such as screenwriter Stefano Bises and actor Alessandro Borghi.

Aside from multimedia companies, Tether’s investment portfolio covers a wide range of firms in various industries from Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining to commodity trading. At press time, USDT, has accumulated a market cap of more than $144 billion. While its daily trading volume currently stands at $23.8 billion, according to data from crypto.news.

Its daily trading volume has jumped by 27.5% to $3.37 billion, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Key catalysts driving the XRP prices lower today include: Failure to rally despite Ripple dropping its cross-appeal case against the SEC. Lack of enthusiasm among derivatives traders. A textbook bearish technical setup. Ripple’s dropped cross-appeal fails to boost XRP One of the most significant factors is the lack of a strong market response following Ripple’s decision to drop its cross-appeal in the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit. Key takeaways: On March 25, Ripple announced it would withdraw its appeal against the SEC, bringing its case with the agency to a conclusion. Ripple had appealed against a prior ruling, which included a $125 million fine for violating securities laws through institutional XRP sales. According to Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, the resolution reduced the fine to $50 million, with $75 million returned to Ripple, signaling the end of a four-year legal saga. Alderoty also highlighted that the agency will ask the judge to lift the injunction placed on Ripple in August 2024.

Under the new leadership led by acting Chair Mark Uyed, the agency has reversed most of its legal actions against crypto companies, including Coinbase , Kraken , Uniswap , and Immutable . However, XRP’s price has remained flat in the past few days. The absence of a rally indicates waning momentum and possible profit-taking by traders who expected more upside. Low Open Interest and negative funding rates XRP’s price action is also reflecting a lack of enthusiasm in its derivatives market, evidenced by low open interest and funding rates. Key points: Open interest (OI), the total number of outstanding futures and options contracts, remains subdued, indicating reduced trading activity. Currently, at $3.82 billion, the OI is 52% below its peak of $7.8 billion witnessed on Jan. 18, dropping 5% over the last 24 hours. Declining OI means less capital is entering the market, which can exacerbate the price decline as buying pressure dries up. XRP open interest across all exchanges. Source: CoinGlass Compounding this issue are negative funding rates in XRP perpetual futures markets. Funding rates represent the periodic payments exchanged between long and short-position holders. This metric flipped negative on March 27, dropping from 0.0088% to -0.0049% over the last 24 hours. When rates turn negative, shorts (bets against the price) pay longs to keep their positions open, suggesting bearish sentiment. XRP funding rates across all exchanges. Source: CoinGlass If buyers do not step in, these conditions can create a self-reinforcing cycle of selling pressure, further dragging the price down. XRP price validates bear flag pattern XRP has confirmed a bear flag pattern on the daily chart after closing below the lower boundary of the flag at $2.45. Key levels to watch: XRP is currently testing the support level at $2.30 after flipping the flag’s lower trendline into resistance. The $2.22 range low (from March 18) and the flag’s base at $2 are key levels. A high volume move below these support levels could drag XRP prices lower. The maximum loss target from the pole’s length indicates that XRP could revisit the $1.60 level over the next few days. This would represent another 31% descent from current levels.

As Cointelegraph reported , veteran trader Peter Brandt said that XRP is forming a textbook head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, projecting a possible 50% drop toward $1.07. Brandt explained that a rally above $3 would invalidate this pattern to avoid a potential 55% correction. “Below $1.9, I would not want to own it. H&S projects to $1.07.

DOGE, currently priced at $0.17, has been climbing past key resistance levels, fueling speculation of a breakout that could push it beyond $0.80 or even higher if market momentum holds. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum after launching its presale. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has sold over 80% and continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $5 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 7000 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $1 in the near future. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 7000 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $5 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $1 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continue to capture investor attention with their strong growth potential heading into 2025. While DOGE eyes a breakout past $0.80, Mutuum Finance is rapidly selling out its presale, with over 80% of Phase 3 already gone. This is the final chance to get in at $0.02 before the next surge, with the price set to rise by 25% in the next stage. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to secure early gains.

Right now, the spotlight is firmly fixed on Bitcoin. The latest reading from the CoinMarketCap (CMC) Altcoin Season Index is flashing a clear signal: it’s Bitcoin Season . What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial tool for crypto traders and enthusiasts, isn’t just another arbitrary number. It’s a meticulously calculated metric designed to gauge the prevailing sentiment and momentum within the crypto market. Think of it as a compass, pointing towards whether altcoins or Bitcoin are leading the charge. This index helps you understand the current market dynamics and potentially strategize your investment decisions. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know about the Altcoin Season Index : Data Source: It’s tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a reputable source for cryptocurrency data. Scope: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure reflection of market sentiment. Timeframe: It assesses coin performance over the past 90 days, giving a medium-term perspective on market trends. Scoring: The index ranges from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season Definition: An Altcoin Season is declared when at least 75% of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Bitcoin Season Definition: Conversely, a Bitcoin Season emerges when 25% or fewer of these coins have outperformed Bitcoin during the same period. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index sits at a mere 19, as of 00:30 UTC on March 27. This low score emphatically confirms that we are indeed in a Bitcoin Season . The index even nudged up two points from the previous day, further solidifying Bitcoin’s current dominance. Decoding Bitcoin Season: What Does an Index of 19 Really Mean for the Crypto Market? An Altcoin Season Index reading of 19 is a strong indicator of Bitcoin dominance . It signifies that Bitcoin is not just holding its ground, but actively outperforming the vast majority of altcoins in the market. But what are the underlying implications of this? Let’s break down the significance of Bitcoin Season : Capital Flow to Bitcoin: During Bitcoin Season , investors often rotate their capital back into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer and more established cryptocurrency, especially during times of market uncertainty or consolidation. Altcoin Underperformance: While Bitcoin thrives, many altcoins may experience slower growth or even price corrections as investor attention and capital shift towards Bitcoin. Market Sentiment: A Bitcoin Season can reflect a cautious or risk-off sentiment in the broader crypto market. Investors may be prioritizing security and established assets like Bitcoin over the higher volatility and potentially higher risk associated with altcoins. Potential for Future Altcoin Surge: Interestingly, Bitcoin Seasons don’t last forever. They can often pave the way for future Altcoin Seasons . As Bitcoin consolidates or corrects after a period of dominance, profits can then flow back into altcoins, potentially triggering a new altcoin rally. Is Bitcoin Dominance a Threat or an Opportunity? Whether Bitcoin dominance , as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , is a threat or an opportunity largely depends on your perspective and investment strategy. For Bitcoin maximalists and long-term Bitcoin holders: This is often seen as a positive sign, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as the king of crypto and validating its store of value narrative. For altcoin enthusiasts and traders: A prolonged Bitcoin Season might seem less exciting. However, it presents unique opportunities: Accumulate Altcoins at Lower Prices: During Bitcoin Season , many fundamentally strong altcoins may become undervalued. This could be an opportune time to strategically accumulate them for the next potential altcoin rally. Focus on Bitcoin Trading: Traders can capitalize on Bitcoin’s price movements and volatility during its dominant phase. Identify Strong Altcoins: Even in Bitcoin Season , some altcoins may still outperform. Identifying these resilient projects can lead to significant gains. Research is key to finding these gems. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Crypto Market in Bitcoin Season So, how can you navigate the crypto waters during a Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights: Reassess Your Portfolio: Evaluate your crypto portfolio in light of the current Bitcoin Season . Are you overweight in altcoins? Consider rebalancing to align with the prevailing market trend. Monitor the Altcoin Season Index: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index . A rising index could signal a shift towards altcoin momentum. Research and Due Diligence: Whether you’re focusing on Bitcoin or exploring undervalued altcoins, thorough research is paramount. Understand the fundamentals, technology, and adoption of any cryptocurrency before investing. Manage Risk: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Implement robust risk management strategies, including diversification and setting stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: The crypto landscape evolves rapidly. Stay updated on market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Embracing the Dynamic Nature of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index serves as a valuable reminder of the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin Seasons and Altcoin Seasons are part of this fascinating ebb and flow. Understanding these dynamics, utilizing tools like the Altcoin Season Index , and adapting your strategies accordingly are crucial for navigating the crypto market successfully. While Bitcoin dominance may be the current theme, the crypto narrative is constantly unfolding, promising exciting shifts and opportunities in the future.

Analysts suggest that for Dogecoin to solidify this upward momentum, it must surpass a crucial resistance level. Dogecoin Eyes New Bullish Trend Amid Market Recovery The recent price movements of Dogecoin have been influenced by broader market trends and macroeconomic factors, particularly the fallout from President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. After reaching a yearly high of $0.4350 on January 18, Dogecoin experienced a dramatic decline, plummeting 67% to a low of $0.1430 on March 11. However, the recent positive performance indicates that a new bullish wave may be emerging. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Analyst says There Is 100% Chance Of A Bullish Rally, Here’s Why Market analyst Ali Martinez has pointed in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter) to the SuperTrend indicator, a technical analysis tool that helps identify price trends, suggesting that Dogecoin could enter a bullish phase if it successfully breaks through the resistance level at $0.21. The analyst further identified the key support floor for the Dogecoin price at $0.177, which will be crucial in determining whether the token can sustain its recovery or if it will face another downtrend. Should Dogecoin fail to hold this support level, it could revisit once again the $0.14 price point, where significant buying pressure previously helped support the price. This scenario could erase the gains made over the last two weeks. Eyeing $0.50 And Potential All-Time High Of $1.60 Adding weight to Martinez’s analysis, data from Glassnode reveals that 7% of Dogecoin’s total supply is concentrated at the $0.20 mark, which is the third-largest concentration after $0.17 and $0.07. According to Glassnode, this concentration suggests that the $0.20 level may act as a formidable resistance point in the near term, as many wallets likely acquired their holdings at lower prices. In a more positive note for the token and despite the current uncertainties surrounding Dogecoin’s price, analysts remain optimistic about the memecoin’s long-term prospects. Related Reading: Bitcoin Marks 114 Weeks In Active Buy Signal On The SuperTrend Weekly, But Things Could Turn Bad If This Happens According to experts like AMCrypto, Dogecoin has recently tested a multi-year support trendline, indicating a potential for sustained upward movement. “Memes are slowly moving up now, and I expect DOGE to lead the rally,” one analyst stated, setting a target of $0.50 in the second quarter of the year. Other analysts, including ChartingGuy, have suggested that Dogecoin could aim for a new all-time high of $1.60, representing a staggering potential increase of 742% from its current levels and surpassing its previous record of $0.7316.

The case will become the first attempt in the European Union (EU) jurisdiction to apply VAT laws to social media platforms offering free services in exchange for user data. Italy is seeking €887.6 million ($961 million) in taxes from Meta, €12.5 million from X, and around €140 million from LinkedIn. Per Reuters, the figures represent the entire period under investigation , which varies by company but spans from 2015-2016 to 2021-2022. Still, the current tax assessment only covers 2015 and 2016, as claims for those years are set to expire. Why Italian tax authorities want social platforms to pay levies The case hangs on a legal argument that when users sign up for platforms like Facebook, X, or LinkedIn, they are effectively engaging in a barter transaction. Under EU VAT law, taxable transactions require a supply of goods or services for consideration. Italian authorities are convinced that users are offering non-monetary consideration by providing personal data in exchange for access to social media platforms, making the transaction subject to VAT. Investigations into Meta and X for alleged tax fraud had been previously reported, but the inclusion of Microsoft’s LinkedIn unit in the case was not publicly known until now. Mark Zuckerberg and his team have yet to comment on case specifics, but they insisted they will cooperate fully with authorities in accordance with EU and local laws. The company also opposed the idea that providing access to online platforms should be subject to VAT. LinkedIn told Reuters that it had “nothing to share at this time.” Elon Musk and X have not made any statement on the matter either. Legal proceedings with big repercussions Legal and tax experts suggest that if Italy’s approach is upheld, it could impact several businesses that keep user data across the EU, including airlines, supermarkets, and publishers. Any company linking free services to data collection could face similar tax liabilities. The three social media companies have 60 days to appeal before a judicial process can formally begin. If they request a settlement proposal from tax authorities, they will be granted an additional month, during which time three outcomes could follow. One option is for the companies to challenge the claims in court, a process that could take up to a decade given Italy’s three-tiered judicial system. Another possibility is for the Italian Revenue Agency to drop its claim, either for technical reasons or due to political considerations. Alternatively, a partial settlement could be reached and payments made while Italy seeks a ruling from the European Commission on a more defined legal framework. Italy freezes Starlink negotiations Italy and Starlink Service LLC CEO Elon Musk have a good relationship, although it may turn sour soon because of the trade tariff wars between the EU and the US. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto confirmed in an interview with La Repubblica on March 22 that Italy has halted negotiations with SpaceX over a potential Starlink agreement. According to a Ukrainian local news outlet, European officials fear the US could use control over Starlink to twist the hand of Kyiv into decisions favoring Russia and a reported minerals deal with Washington. On March 9, Musk denied that Starlink would be cut off from Ukraine, clashing with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over the legitimacy of these fears. “ To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals ,” Musk stated. Earlier this year, the Italian government was supportive of working with Starlink, but political opposition derailed discussions. “ It seems to me that everything has stopped … the topic has moved from Starlink to the statements of and about the person ,” Crosetto said. Negotiations are purportedly now on hold, and the Italian government wants security considerations in its defence contracts heard before making any deal. “ When the controversy and the times have calmed down, there will be a technical approach ,” the Italian Defence minister reckoned.

Now it looks as though XRP , the payments-focused cryptocurrency, can also be used as an indicator for bull-market peaks in bitcoin ( BTC ). Unlike meme tokens like DOGE and shiba inu ( SHIB ), XRP has utility. It is used by Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions, which places it in a bucket different from the memecoins. Even so, since 2017, XRP has been a contrary indicator for bitcoin bulls, tending to rally— often soaring several hundred percent in a short time — in the final stages of BTC bull runs, marking the point at which bitcoin ultimately peaked. XRP experienced a remarkable 10-fold rally from December 2017 to early 2018, coinciding with bitcoin's peak at around $20,000, before entering a bear market that lasted almost a year. A similar near-vertical spike in XRP occurred in early 2021, marking the peak of another bull market in bitcoin. And XRP's surge of approximately 240% in late 2024 foreshadowed bitcoin's bull market peak above $109,000, followed by a decline below $80,000. As the saying goes: ""Once is happenstance, twice is a coincidence, and three times is a trend.""

He made the threat on Truth Social, saying both countries would face “far larger” penalties if they attempt to damage the American economy. “If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!” Trump wrote . As Cryptopolitan reported , the warning came just one day after Trump announced a new 25% tariff on all vehicles not manufactured inside the U.S., which he said would go into effect on April 2. The White House confirmed the plan on Wednesday. The new tariffs will target foreign-made cars and light trucks and will pile onto the existing trade duties already enforced under Trump’s administration. Trump expands tariffs to include foreign car parts Will Scharf, a White House aide, said the new rules don’t just stop at cars. Starting in May, the administration will apply additional tariffs on engines, transmissions, and electrical parts brought in from outside the country. These components are often used in American car production. Scharf said the plan is expected to generate “over $100 billion of new annual revenue” for the United States. After the announcement, stock markets in the U.S. and Asia dropped sharply, especially shares tied to the auto industry. European automakers were expected to follow the same trend as their markets opened Thursday morning. The decision added another layer to the global trade war that has already affected several industries and regions. Trump, who has already put duties on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as across the board on steel and aluminum, continues to argue that the U.S. is being taken advantage of by its biggest trading partners. The new auto tariffs are the latest move in what he sees as a long-overdue correction of global trade imbalances. The White House defended the policy shift by saying it would “protect and strengthen” the American car industry. But many analysts said this could actually hit U.S. automakers as hard as it does foreign ones. That’s because most American carmakers depend heavily on imported parts to build their vehicles domestically. EU and Canada signal retaliation plans, automakers panic Neither the EU nor Canada has confirmed that they plan to work together against the U.S., but both have made it clear that they are considering responses to Trump’s new tariffs. On Thursday, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said the EU will continue looking for ways to negotiate while also defending its economy. “We will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests,” she said . “Tariffs are taxes — bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the U.S. and the European Union.” In Canada, newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney called the new auto tariff “a direct attack.” Speaking to reporters in Kitchener, Ontario, Carney said he planned to hold an emergency cabinet meeting that same day to decide how to respond. “We will defend our workers, we will defend our companies, we will defend our country, and we will defend it together,” he said. In Europe, carmakers are already feeling the heat. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association released a statement on Thursday saying it is “deeply concerned” about the move. The group said the timing couldn’t be worse, calling it “a watershed moment for our industry’s transformation and as fierce international competition mounts.” Ludovic Subran, Chief Economist at Allianz, said on CNBC Thursday that no one should be surprised that Trump is going after the car industry. “Cars are so political,” Subran said during the “Squawk Box Europe” show. He also said the industry is already under pressure, with registrations down since January. “You’ve seen the reaction of the stock markets, the car manufacturers. It comes at a time when there is a lot of uncertainty about car consumption, the registration of cars has slumped since the beginning of the year, so it is really another one of these major seismic waves of the Trump administration.” While Trump pushes ahead, economists are warning that the policy will cause more harm than good. Many said the tariffs are likely to make cars more expensive in the U.S. and drive up inflation at a time when consumer confidence is already shaky. Auto analysts from Wedbush Securities said the new rules could make some cars cost $5,000 to $10,000 more depending on the model and features. “In our view these initial tariffs (if they hold in their current form) would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many U.S.) automakers and ultimately push the average price of cars up $5k to $10k depending on the make/model/price point,” the firm said in an emailed note Wednesday. They added that this may still be a negotiation tactic by Trump rather than a final decision. “We continue to believe this is some form of negotiation, and these tariffs could change by the week, although this initial 25% tariff on autos from outside the U.S. is almost an untenable head-scratching number for the U.S. consumer,” they said.

Recently, we’ve seen a fascinating shift in Asia, where Asian currencies are showing resilience against the mighty US dollar. What’s fueling this change? The ripples from former US President Trump’s auto tariffs are still being felt, leading to a softening of the dollar and a subsequent uplift for Asia FX . Why is Asia FX Ticking Up? Decoding the Dollar’s Dip To understand why Asia FX is experiencing this positive momentum, we need to dissect the factors weakening the US Dollar . The story begins with trade policies, specifically the auto tariffs imposed during the Trump administration. While the intended goal might have been to bolster domestic industries, the unintended consequence is now playing out in the Forex market. Trade Tensions and Dollar Weakness: Tariffs, especially on major industries like automobiles, can create uncertainty in international trade. This uncertainty can sometimes lead to investors seeking alternatives to the US Dollar, perceived as potentially vulnerable to trade disputes. Economic Repercussions: While tariffs are designed to protect domestic industries, they can also increase costs for businesses and consumers. If these economic repercussions are perceived as negative for the US economy, it can dampen investor appetite for the US Dollar . Market Sentiment Shift: The Forex market is heavily influenced by sentiment. If traders and investors believe the US Dollar’s strength is waning due to policy decisions or economic indicators, they may start to move away from it, leading to a decrease in its value. Essentially, the lingering effects of trade policies, combined with evolving global economic perceptions, are contributing to the current easing of the US Dollar , creating a window of opportunity for Asia FX to strengthen. Which Asian Currencies are Benefiting? A Closer Look at Asia FX Performance The rise in Asia FX isn’t a uniform wave; some currencies are riding this tide more strongly than others. Let’s examine which Asian currencies are showing the most significant gains against the backdrop of a softer US Dollar : The Chinese Yuan (CNY): As a major player in the Asian economy, the Yuan’s movement is closely watched. A weaker US Dollar often provides breathing room for the Yuan, allowing it to appreciate slightly. This is particularly relevant given the ongoing trade dynamics between the US and China. The Japanese Yen (JPY): Often considered a safe-haven currency, the Yen can react in complex ways to global economic shifts. However, in this scenario, a softer US Dollar can reduce pressure on the Yen, potentially leading to some appreciation. The South Korean Won (KRW): The South Korean economy is heavily export-oriented, and the Won’s value is sensitive to global trade conditions. A weaker US Dollar can make South Korean exports more competitive, potentially bolstering the Won. Emerging Asian Currencies: Currencies like the Indian Rupee (INR), Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), and Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) can also benefit. These emerging market currencies are often more volatile but can see upward movement when the US Dollar loses some of its shine. It’s important to note that the extent of gains varies for each currency based on their individual economic fundamentals and domestic policies. However, the overarching theme is that the easing US Dollar is providing a tailwind for a broad spectrum of Asia FX . Trump Tariffs and Forex: Understanding the Lingering Impact The term “ Trump tariffs ” evokes a specific period of global trade policy. But why are we still talking about them and their impact on the Forex market ? The reality is that trade policies have long-lasting effects. Here’s how Trump tariffs continue to influence the current Forex market landscape: Aspect Impact of Trump Tariffs on Forex Trade Relationships Tariffs strained relationships with key trading partners, creating lasting uncertainty about future trade flows. This uncertainty can weigh on the US Dollar . Supply Chains Tariffs disrupted global supply chains, forcing businesses to re-evaluate their sourcing and production strategies. This can lead to shifts in currency valuations as trade patterns adjust. Inflationary Pressures Tariffs can contribute to inflationary pressures by increasing the cost of imported goods. Inflation expectations can influence central bank policies and, consequently, currency values. Investor Sentiment The era of Trump tariffs fostered a sense of protectionism and trade friction. This legacy continues to shape investor sentiment regarding global trade and currency risk. While new administrations may bring policy changes, the economic architecture shaped by previous trade actions, like Trump tariffs , takes time to unwind. Their impact on the Forex market , particularly on the strength of the US Dollar and the performance of Asia FX , remains relevant. Navigating the Forex Market: Actionable Insights for Traders For those involved in the Forex market , understanding these dynamics is crucial. What actionable insights can we glean from the current situation where Asia FX is ticking up as the US Dollar eases? Monitor Asian Currency Trends: Keep a close eye on the performance of Asian currencies against the US Dollar . Look for sustained upward trends and identify which currencies are showing the strongest momentum. Assess Trade Policy Developments: Stay informed about any shifts in trade policies, both in the US and in Asia. Changes in tariffs or trade agreements can have a direct and often immediate impact on currency valuations. Analyze Economic Data: Pay attention to economic data releases from both the US and Asian economies. Indicators like GDP growth, inflation, and employment figures can provide clues about the relative strength of currencies. Consider Risk Management: Forex market trading involves risk. Use appropriate risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, to protect your capital. Diversification across different currency pairs can also be a prudent approach. Seek Expert Analysis: Consult with experienced Forex market analysts or financial advisors to gain deeper insights and informed perspectives on trading strategies. The current Forex market scenario presents both opportunities and challenges. By staying informed, analyzing trends, and employing sound risk management, traders can navigate these shifts effectively. The Future Outlook: Will Asia FX Continue its Ascent? Looking ahead, the question on everyone’s mind is: will Asia FX continue to strengthen against the US Dollar ? While predicting the future with certainty is impossible, we can consider some key factors that will likely shape the outlook: Global Economic Recovery: The pace of global economic recovery will play a significant role. If the global economy strengthens, particularly in Asia, it could provide further support for Asia FX . US Monetary Policy: The future direction of US monetary policy is crucial. If the Federal Reserve maintains a dovish stance, keeping interest rates low, it could continue to weigh on the US Dollar . Geopolitical Stability: Geopolitical events can always inject volatility into the Forex market . Stability in key regions and trade relationships will be conducive to a more predictable currency environment. Asian Economic Reforms: Ongoing economic reforms and structural changes within Asian economies can enhance their long-term growth prospects and currency strength. In conclusion, the recent uptick in Asia FX as the US Dollar eases is a multifaceted phenomenon rooted in the lingering effects of trade policies and evolving global economic dynamics. While the future trajectory will depend on a complex interplay of factors, understanding the underlying drivers of these currency movements is essential for anyone navigating the global Forex market .

This is one of two major concurrent developments, with the other being the completion of a sold-out Immortal Statue NFT sale just days before Immortal Rising 2’s Token Generation Event (TGE) , which started on March 27. Planetarium Labs is a community-focused Web3 gaming company that creates highly moddable blockchain-powered gaming experiences that feature immersive gameplay in player-driven economies. It is at the forefront of the decentralized gaming revolution and is redefining what is possible within the Web3 gaming ecosystem. The latest $3 million raise was driven by participation from some of the best-known players and investment firms in the Web3 blockchain gaming space, including the Spartan Group, Immutable, MARBLEX, Comma3 Ventures, Sovrun, 32-Bit Ventures, Notch Ventures, Cristian Manea, Niels de Ruiter , and other prominent angel investors. With this fresh capital injection, Planetarium Labs and the development team will be able to continue expanding the Immortal Rising 2 ecosystem while simultaneously enhancing gameplay mechanics and strengthening community engagement. These activities will help further solidify the studio’s position as a leader in – and the global face of – next-generation blockchain gaming. A Vision for the Future of Web3 Gaming The backing from these key investors highlights the industry’s confidence in Immortal Rising 2’s Play-to-Airdrop (P2A) model, which merges true digital ownership with engaging gameplay. Robbie Ferguson, the Co-Founder and President of Immutable , emphasized the game’s unique positioning by stating that Immortal Rising 2, with almost nine million downloads, has already proven its product-market fit. He also said that the title sits at the intersection of three major trends: Asia’s booming gaming market, the dominance of mobile gaming, and the seamless integration of Web3 mechanics. With Immutable zkEVM’s scaling solutions and Immutable Play , which is Immutable’s distribution platform, investors say they are excited to help bring this game to an even larger global audience. Other investors echoed similar sentiments, recognizing Immortal Rising 2 as a pioneering force in blockchain gaming. Kelvin Koh, a Co-founder & Partner at the Spartan Group , said that he sees the project as a milestone in decentralized gaming. He said that Immortal Rising 2 is setting new standards by offering players true ownership and meaningful rewards. He also stated that Planetarium Labs is at the forefront of this shift, and gave the unwavering support of the Spartan Group to Planetarium Labs in order to continue driving innovation in the Web3 blockchain gaming space. Finally, Jin-pyo Hong, the CEO of MARBLEX , pointed to the growing connection between Web2 and Web3 gaming by saying that Immortal Rising 2 bridges traditional and blockchain gaming in a way that makes sense for both gamers and investors. He said that MARBLEX is excited to partner with Planetarium Labs in this journey and to fully support the future of Immortal Rising 2. Sold-Out NFT Sale Sets the Stage for TGE Alongside the successful funding round, Immortal Rising 2’s Immortal Statue NFT sale has sold out, underscoring strong demand from not just players but collectors as well. These exclusive NFTs grant premium in-game rewards, token airdrops, and elevated status within the Immortal Rising 2 ecosystem. The NFT sale follows the game’s Play-to-Airdrop (P2A) launchpool, where the community has already claimed over 9 million SoulBound Tokens (SBTs). SBTs are digital assets tied exclusively to players’ achievements. Because SBTs unlock hidden rewards at the campaign’s conclusion, they add new layers of engagement with players. Token Generation Event (TGE) With both the funding and NFT sale secured, all eyes are now on Immortal Rising 2’s TGE that officially unlocks new opportunities for players and investors. This marks a crucial milestone in the game’s expanding economy and governance model, setting the foundation for a fully decentralized gaming future.For more details on the TGE and upcoming game developments, follow Immortal Rising 2 on X (Twitter) and Discord .",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|AIRDROP|ASIA|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 09:50:33

Volume: A 9.4% increase in the trading volume over the past week. Tron On-chain data & market sentiment – 290.4 M+ total TRX addresses with the growth of 2.1% monthly. – Daily active users at 1.5 M+ with an increase of 5.3% MoM increase. – Transaction volume on the verge of 10.2B daily which is increased by 8.5% MoM. Whale transactions ($ 500 K+): increased by 12% MoM, suggesting institutional participation. Fee revenue monthly at $53.16M – significantly higher fees than both Solana & Ethereum. Market sentiment: Bullish; TRX’s social engagement increased by 7.2% WoW. Will TRX reach $0.40? The increasing network fees on TRON, increase in whale accumulation, and new users participating in TRON’s ecosystem lead to a bullish setup, however, for TRX to reach $0.40 it must break and hold the $0.30 level. A close below support at the $0.22 level could open the door to a retest of the $0.20 level as well. TRON’s recent upgrades solidify any bullish thoughts one might have. The launch of AI-integrated features on the Sun Pump platform is a major key milestone that has granted AI integration for real-time automation and modification of process parameters related to AI and TRON. The added features will broaden TRON usability while trying to scale competitive advantage as more user adoption occurs. To add to that Bullish outlook, TRON recently announced tthat hey have partnered with Bitget, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. That expands the TRON ecosystem while user adoption increases. All of these upgrades add value to the TRON network, which may be key catalysts towards price appreciation in TRX. Suggested trade strategy for April: – Buy zone – $0.22 – $0.23 (200 day SMA support) – Profit targets – $0.25, $0.30, $0.40 – Stop loss – $0.18 With whale activity growing and volume trending up, traders should wait on confirmation of a breakout past the $0.30 for possible upside continuation.

The predominantly bearish momentum took its toll on this rally, and BTC failed to continue upward. The rejection was particularly violent on Wednesday as bitcoin dropped beneath $86,000 after a price decline of almost three grand. Nevertheless, it defended that level and quickly rose back above it. Moreover, it now trades at around $87,500, which is over a grand and a half higher than yesterday’s low.

According to a recent poll by Zuban Córdoba, nearly 58% of Argentinians expressed distrust in Milei, marking a significant blow to his public image. The survey, conducted between March 12 and 14, polled 1,600 participants with a 95% confidence level. When asked, “How much do you trust Milei today?” 57.6% of respondents disapproved of him, while only 36% maintained their support. The remaining 6.4% were unsure. This was the first time Zuban Córdoba included this specific question in their poll, but broader metrics also indicate that Milei’s popularity is slipping. For instance, the president’s national management approval rating dropped from 47.3% in November to 41.6% in March. Zuban Córdoba’s report noted that public dissatisfaction with Milei’s leadership is “slowly but steadily” increasing as political scandals continue to surface. Mixed Polls Reveal Divided Sentiment Despite Zuban Córdoba’s findings, not all surveys portray Milei’s approval in freefall. A separate poll by the University of San Andrés, conducted between March 11 and 20 with 1,020 respondents, found Milei’s approval rating at 45%. Meanwhile, data from Morning Consult, collected between February 27 and March 5—after the Libra scandal emerged—showed Milei still holding a 62.4% approval rating. However, the Libra controversy has clearly impacted his credibility. Following his controversial February 14 post on X, which many interpreted as an endorsement of the Libra token, the cryptocurrency briefly soared to a $4.6 billion market cap. It soon collapsed by nearly 94%, leaving many investors in the lurch. Though Milei denied promoting the token , claiming he merely “spread the word” about it, he is now facing fraud lawsuits over the incident. LIBRA Scandal Looms Over Upcoming Election The Libra scandal adds further volatility to Argentina’s already polarized political landscape, with the next presidential election slated for October 26. Although opposition parties have called for Milei’s impeachment, their efforts have so far gained little traction. Despite the fallout, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party remains the frontrunner for the upcoming election, with 36.7% of respondents supporting the libertarian party. The rival Unión por la Patria trails slightly behind at 32.5%. Nonetheless, public dissatisfaction with Milei’s economic policies continues to mount. Only 43% of Argentinians believe he has effectively controlled inflation, while 63% oppose his attempts to secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

With the legal uncertainty largely resolved, analysts and firms like Bitwise are weighing the possibilities for XRP's future — from a potential surge in value driven by institutional adoption and real-world asset tokenization, to more conservative or bearish scenarios if those opportunities fail to materialize. XRP ETF Optimism Surges as Ripple-SEC Legal Battle Ends, Community Bets on 2025 Approval The crypto community is abuzz with renewed optimism over the potential approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP, following the long-awaited conclusion of Ripple’s landmark legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After more than three years of court proceedings, Ripple has finally emerged victorious, setting the stage for what many believe could be the next major milestone for the digital asset: the launch of an XRP ETF. On March 19, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on X that the SEC had officially dropped its appeal in the case against the company. The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, alleged that Ripple had conducted a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens. The case cast a long shadow over Ripple and XRP’s potential in the US financial markets, creating legal uncertainty that hindered institutional adoption. The conclusion of the lawsuit has reignited speculation around the regulatory path forward for XRP, particularly the possibility of an ETF backed by the token. Shortly after the case was dropped, Nate Geraci, president of advisory firm ETF Store, took to X to declare that an XRP ETF now appears inevitable. Geraci, a prominent voice in the ETF industry, also speculated that financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity could be among the first asset managers to file for or manage an XRP ETF. These firms have already shown substantial interest in crypto-backed ETFs, most notably through their filings and involvement with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF applications. If history repeats itself, XRP could be the next major crypto asset to gain ETF approval, potentially joining the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated investment products. The bullish sentiment around a potential XRP ETF is not limited to crypto insiders. On decentralized prediction market Polymarket , bettors are placing significant wagers on the approval of an XRP ETF by the end of 2025. As of March 26, Polymarket showed an 86% probability that the SEC will greenlight an XRP ETF before Dec. 31 of this year. However, when it comes to short-term expectations, the outlook is more reserved. Polymarket users only gave a 42% chance that the ETF would be approved before July 31, suggesting that while optimism is high for 2025, traders anticipate a slower regulatory process in the first half of the year. Despite being a gambling site, Polymarket has built a strong reputation for accurate forecasting. Data from a Dune Analytics dashboard indicates that Polymarket predictions have historically had over 90% accuracy a month prior to market resolution — giving added weight to the platform’s current odds. Price Action Muted Despite Major Win Surprisingly, XRP’s price reaction to the legal victory was relatively muted. According to Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, the modest price action was likely due to the legal resolution already being priced in by investors. This reaction echoes broader crypto market behavior, where even significant news can often be front-run by insider speculation or reflected early in price movements. With the regulatory cloud lifting, Ripple may now be able to pursue more aggressive expansion plans in the US and abroad. The company has long argued that XRP is not a security and has advocated for clearer digital asset regulations. The case’s conclusion may now serve as a precedent in future crypto-SEC disputes, especially regarding the classification of tokens. More immediately, attention will shift to whether Ripple or a third-party asset manager files for an XRP ETF. If Geraci’s forecast is correct and firms like BlackRock or Fidelity jump into the ring, XRP could soon have the legitimacy and market access that only regulated ETFs can provide. An ETF would offer traditional investors a seamless way to gain exposure to XRP without needing to hold or manage the token directly. This could open the floodgates to institutional capital and spark a new growth cycle for XRP — especially if macro conditions and regulatory clarity continue to improve. Bitwise Predicts XRP Could Soar to $29 by 2030 in Best-Case Scenario, But Warns of Collapse to $0.13 if Adoption Fails In related news, Bitwise, a leading cryptocurrency index fund manager, has released a bold price forecast for XRP, estimating that the Ripple-affiliated token could reach an eye-watering $29.32 by the end of this decade. However, the firm also cautioned that XRP could just as easily plummet to $0.13 if the blockchain fails to secure traction in key target markets, including payments and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The wide-ranging forecast was based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), a traditional financial valuation framework adapted to assess cryptocurrency valuations in emerging sectors like blockchain infrastructure and tokenized finance. Bitwise’s most optimistic projection envisions XRP securing a “meaningful” share of the global payments and tokenization markets. Under this “max scenario,” XRP’s market cap would balloon to $2.9 trillion by 2030 — surpassing even Microsoft’s current valuation of $2.89 trillion and making XRP one of the most valuable digital assets in history. This level of growth would require XRP to become a critical backbone for institutional-grade payments and tokenized financial instruments, potentially powering transactions across banks, central banks, fintechs, and decentralized finance ecosystems alike. In such a scenario, XRP would be priced at $29.32 — a staggering leap from its current valuation hovering below $3. Bitwise believes this outcome, while ambitious, could materialize if Ripple succeeds in expanding XRPL (XRP Ledger) adoption among major financial institutions and if tokenization becomes a core pillar of the next generation financial infrastructure. While the “max scenario” projects a massive price explosion, Bitwise’s “bull scenario” offers a more conservative yet still bullish outcome. In this case, XRP could reach $12.70 by 2030. This forecast assumes continued growth of the XRP network with steady user adoption and infrastructure improvements — but without XRP gaining dominant market share in either payments or tokenization. In other words, XRP would still thrive as a utility token with real use cases, but not become the central player in cross-border transactions or the asset tokenization boom. This scenario also requires minimal regulatory or technical setbacks, especially in maintaining the XRPL’s speed, cost-efficiency, and decentralization. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Bitwise’s bear scenario paints a grim picture: if XRP fails to penetrate the payments or tokenization industries and institutional enthusiasm for the XRPL dwindles, the token’s price could collapse to as low as $0.13 by the end of the decade. Bitwise’s outlook factors in the potential XRP ETF, which could act as a powerful catalyst for price appreciation. The firm itself filed for an XRP ETF in October and has since maintained that regulatory approval is only a matter of time. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store and a vocal advocate for crypto ETFs, recently said that firms like BlackRock and Fidelity are likely to enter the XRP ETF race as well. This would follow their participation in the spot Bitcoin ETF market, which gained traction after the SEC approved several applications in early 2024. With the legal uncertainties largely resolved and increasing attention from major financial players, the stage could be set for a regulatory green light that ushers XRP into the ETF spotlight — a move that could significantly increase its exposure to institutional and retail investors. Tokenization: The Multi-Trillion-Dollar Opportunity Bitwise’s projections are grounded in the idea that tokenization — the conversion of real-world assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities into blockchain-based digital tokens — will be a multi-trillion-dollar industry by 2030. Should XRP and the XRP Ledger become one of the key infrastructures for this tokenized financial future, the upside potential is massive. Ripple’s long-standing relationships with banks and payment providers, coupled with XRPL’s reputation for speed and low transaction fees, position it well in this emerging sector. However, competition is fierce. Ethereum, Solana, and newer tokenization-focused chains are all vying for dominance.

The digital frontier just got a whole lot clearer. The Digital Chamber (TDC), a prominent U.S. cryptocurrency lobbying group, has dropped a bombshell – the U.S. Blockchain Roadmap . This isn’t just another whitepaper; it’s a comprehensive strategy outlining six pivotal policy recommendations designed to shape the future of digital assets and blockchain technology in the United States. For anyone navigating the complex world of crypto, this roadmap is essential reading. Let’s dive into the key takeaways and explore what this means for the future of crypto in the USA. Decoding the U.S. Blockchain Roadmap: 6 Pillars for Crypto’s Future The Digital Chamber’s roadmap isn’t just a wish list; it’s a structured plan to integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into the very fabric of the U.S. economy and governance. Let’s break down the six core policy recommendations: Strengthening Financial Stability Through Digital Assets: How can digital currencies contribute to a more robust financial system? Protecting Financial Freedom and Decentralization: Why is decentralization crucial, and how can policy safeguard financial autonomy in the digital age? Leading Global Capital Markets with Regulatory Clarity: What kind of regulations are needed to position the U.S. as a leader in the global digital economy? Advancing Energy Security Through Bitcoin Mining: Can Bitcoin mining be leveraged to enhance energy independence and grid stability? Modernizing the U.S. Banking System: How can blockchain technology revolutionize traditional banking and financial services? Exploring Blockchain Applications for Government Innovation and National Security: Where can blockchain drive efficiency and security in government operations and national defense? These aren’t just abstract concepts; they are actionable areas where policy changes can unlock significant potential. Let’s delve deeper into each pillar. Navigating Cryptocurrency Regulation: Charting a Course for Clarity One of the most pressing issues in the crypto space is the lack of clear cryptocurrency regulation. The Digital Chamber’s roadmap directly addresses this, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity to lead global capital markets . But what does this actually mean? Clear Guidelines: Businesses and innovators need well-defined rules to operate confidently within the U.S. market. Ambiguity stifles innovation and drives talent overseas. Investor Protection: Robust regulations are crucial to protect investors from scams and market manipulation, fostering trust in the digital asset ecosystem. Global Competitiveness: Proactive and sensible regulation can position the U.S. as a hub for crypto innovation, attracting investment and talent. The roadmap advocates for a balanced approach – one that encourages innovation while mitigating risks. This includes: Passing Stablecoin Legislation: Providing a clear legal framework for stablecoins, which are vital for everyday crypto transactions. Enacting Bitcoin Legislation: Establishing a legal status for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to encourage adoption and innovation. Imagine a future where crypto businesses can operate with the same legal certainty as traditional financial institutions. This roadmap aims to pave the way for that reality. Unlocking the Potential of Digital Assets: Beyond Cryptocurrency The roadmap’s scope extends beyond just cryptocurrencies to encompass the broader realm of digital assets. This is a crucial distinction. Digital assets include everything from NFTs and security tokens to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The Digital Chamber recognizes the transformative potential of these assets to: Modernize the U.S. Banking System: Blockchain technology can streamline payments, reduce transaction costs, and enhance the efficiency of financial operations. Strengthen Financial Stability: Digital assets can diversify investment portfolios and potentially offer hedges against traditional market volatility. Protect Financial Freedom and Decentralization: Digital assets offer individuals greater control over their finances and can reduce reliance on intermediaries. However, realizing these benefits requires careful consideration of policy. The roadmap emphasizes the importance of: Reforming the Federal Reserve’s Master Account Process: Ensuring fair access to the Federal Reserve system for crypto-focused financial institutions, fostering competition and innovation. Exploring Blockchain Applications for Government Innovation and National Security: Investigating how blockchain can enhance government efficiency, transparency, and security across various sectors, from supply chain management to digital identity. Think about government services becoming more efficient and transparent through blockchain. This roadmap envisions a future where blockchain is not just about finance, but about transforming how government and society function. Bitcoin Mining and US Policy: Powering the Future Responsibly The inclusion of Bitcoin mining in the roadmap might raise eyebrows for some, but it’s a strategic move. The Digital Chamber highlights the potential of advancing energy security through Bitcoin mining . How? By: Utilizing Excess Energy: Bitcoin mining can absorb excess energy from renewable sources or during off-peak hours, improving grid efficiency and reducing energy waste. Supporting Energy Infrastructure: Mining operations can incentivize investment in energy infrastructure, particularly in remote or underutilized areas. Promoting Innovation in Energy Consumption: The energy demands of Bitcoin mining are driving innovation in energy-efficient mining technologies and sustainable energy solutions. However, it’s crucial to address environmental concerns. The roadmap likely implies a focus on responsible mining practices and the use of renewable energy sources. This is about harnessing the potential of Bitcoin mining in a way that aligns with broader energy and sustainability goals. The conversation needs to shift towards sustainable Bitcoin mining, and policy can play a crucial role in incentivizing green practices. US Policy in the Digital Age: A Roadmap for Action Ultimately, the U.S. Blockchain Roadmap is a call to action. It’s a framework for policymakers to engage with the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and digital assets. The roadmap isn’t just about reacting to trends; it’s about proactively shaping the future. It emphasizes the need for US policy to be forward-thinking and adaptable to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by this technology. The key takeaways are: Proactive Engagement: Policymakers need to actively engage with the crypto industry and understand the nuances of blockchain technology. Balanced Regulation: Regulations should be carefully crafted to foster innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. Strategic Vision: The U.S. needs a clear, long-term vision for its role in the global digital economy, and blockchain technology must be a central part of that vision. This roadmap is a significant step towards establishing the United States as a leader in the blockchain and digital asset space. It’s a framework for informed discussions, collaborative policymaking, and ultimately, a more prosperous and innovative future powered by blockchain technology. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the Blockchain Revolution? The Digital Chamber’s U.S. Blockchain Roadmap is more than just a document; it’s a starting point. It sets the stage for crucial conversations and actions needed to integrate blockchain and digital assets into the U.S. economy. The success of this roadmap hinges on collaboration – between industry leaders, policymakers, and the public. It requires open dialogue, a willingness to learn, and a commitment to building a regulatory environment that fosters innovation and protects consumers. This roadmap offers a hopeful vision for the future of crypto in the US, a future where innovation thrives within a clear and supportive regulatory framework.

He also urged parliament that the country needs to consider what’s best for Japan’s national interest. Tokyo plans to put ‘all options on the table’ in response to U.S. tariffs Japan's Prime Minister says ""all options"" are on the table after US President Trump announced 25% tariffs on all auto imports, targeting the world's biggest suppliers including key Asian allies Japan and South Korea. The latest. https://t.co/09KRJXHjIB pic.twitter.com/O973YYqNWP — Kristie Lu Stout✌🏽 (@klustout) March 27, 2025 Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged that Tokyo was ready to put “all options on the table” in tackling the Trump administration’s heightened trade policies. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks from Japan to the U.S. starting next week. “Japan is a country that is making the largest amount of investment to the United States, so we wonder if it makes sense for (Washington) to apply uniform tariffs to all countries. That is a point we’ve been making and will continue to do so.” – Shigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan The President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) revealed that the country was “putting all options on the table” in considering the most effective response. He did not specify the possible steps Tokyo may take in combating Washington’s trade policies. Data from the Ministry of Finance revealed that automobiles made up 28.3% of Japan’s total exports to the United States in 2024, the biggest ratio among all items. The data also showed that the auto industry makes up around 3% of Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP). Tokyo’s auto industry has been the driver of recent wage hikes in the country, as automakers distribute the huge profits they reaped overseas to their employees. Executive economist at Nomura Research Institute (NRI) Takahide Kiuchi believes that a 25% increase in U.S. auto tariffs will push down Japan’s GDP by roughly 0.2%. Kiuchi maintained that “the Trump tariff has the potential to immediately push Japan’s economy into deterioration. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker by delivery, plummeted by 4% in Tokyo, while Honda Motor Co. sank as much as 3%. Nissan Motor Co. lost about 3.5%, while Mazda Motor Corp retreated by more than 5% after Trump’s tariff announcement. Automakers also performed the worst on the Topix Transportation Equipment index since automobiles and auto parts account for more than a third of Japan’s export products. The tariffs on automakers might lead to higher car prices for U.S. consumers, about half of whose purchases come from abroad. President and CEO of Autos Drive America Jennifer Safavian argued that “The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Trump ramps up trade war with 25% tariffs on automobiles *TRUMP ANNOUNCES 25% AUTO TARIFFS ON ALL CARS NOT MADE IN US Look on the bright side. If your Toyota Camry costs 25% more, maybe Japan will finally be incentivized to secure our southern border. — Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) March 26, 2025 United States President Donald Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on imported cars and car parts. He said at the Oval Office on Wednesday that tariffs would “take back” money from foreign countries that have been “taking our jobs” and “taking our health.” The President pledged to revive manufacturing in the U.S. and argued that tariffs would “spur growth like you haven’t seen before.” Trump also mentioned in a fact sheet that the tariffs set to take effect on April 2 would “protect and strengthen” the U.S. auto industry. He also argued that the industry had been undermined by excessive imports that threatened America’s domestic industrial base and supply chains. Trump highlighted that foreign automobile industries, bolstered by unfair subsidies and aggressive industrial policies, had expanded while U.S. production remained stagnant. He also suggested that importers bringing in vehicles and parts under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would have the chance to certify what portion of their products are U.S.-made so that they only pay the tariff on “non-U.S. content.” President of the European Union Ursula von der Leyen said , “Tariffs are taxes – bad for business, worse for consumers, in the U.S. and the EU.” Leyen also maintained that the EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions while safeguarding its economic interests.

After the recent market manipulation incident on Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) involving the Jelly Jelly (JELLY) token, the derivatives exchange decided to delist JELLY and reimburse affected users. Shortly after, Binance listed JELLY futures, followed by OKX . This was likely a move to seize the opportunity created by the token’s extreme price swing, which made it highly attractive for speculative trading. On March 26, the price of JELLY spiked from around $0.0095, where the exploiter opened his short position, to a high of $.0.050, marking approximately 426% increase. Given that high volatility drives trading volume, both exchanges stand to profit considerably from trading fees on JELLY perps. Source: Arkham Intelligence’s X However, some believe Binance and OKX’s move isn’t just about potential profit from fees, but also about wiping the competitor. One user even called it a “pure move to try and bury a competitor,” comparing it to Binance’s alleged role in FTX’s collapse, adding it “rewrites the history of what happened to FTX.” Interestingly, blockchain investigator ZachXBT pointed out that the two accounts linked to the manipulation 0x20e8 and 0x67f were funded via Binance. Source: @zachxbt Meanwhile, the price of JELLY has retraced to $0.020, according to CoinGecko .

The total amounted to $7.17M. Hyperliquid just got exploited. What happened? A trader deposited $7.167M on 3 separate Hyperliquid accounts within 5 minutes of each other. He then made leveraged trades on an illiquid coin, JELLYJELLY. However, he ended up losing money, and is down almost $1M unless… pic.twitter.com/uNyMwLS5Sc — Arkham (@arkham) March 26, 2025 Then, the trader aggressively bought JELLY on decentralized exchanges. Since liquidity on DEXes is low, their buying activity quickly drove JELLY price up. After the token’s price increased by over 400%, the $4.1 million short position was supposed to be liquidated. However, the liquidation was too large to be executed immediately, so it was transferred to HyperLiquid’s automated market-making vault , the Hyperliquidity Provider. At the same time, the trader quickly withdrew funds from their other two accounts with unrealized profit from the JELLY 400%+ price increase as a result of their DEX buying activity. According to Arkham, the trader managed to withdraw $6.26 million, with ~$900K still remaining in the accounts. At this point, HyperLiquid caught on to what was happening and restricted the trader’s accounts to reduce-only mode, freezing their ability to withdraw funds. With withdrawals blocked, the trader then started selling JELLY on the market. This selling helped them recover some of the funds, but it didn’t fully salvage their position because HyperLiquid then closed the market at $0.0095, the same price at which they opened their short trade. As a result, all floating PnL on the first two accounts were wiped. According to Abhi, founder of Web3 company AP Collective, said that if Hyperliquid didn’t close the position, it would’ve faced full liquidation if JELLY reached $150M market cap. After the incident, Hyperliquid’s decided to delist JELLY perpetuals. The decision was made by a consensus between Hyperliquid’s validators, sparking outrage from crypto community due to centralization concerns. Arthur Hayer said that HyperLiquid clearly wasn’t able to handle the situation with JELLY and that it’s time to stop pretending that HyperLiquid is a decentralized platform. $HYPE can’t handle the $JELLY Let’s stop pretending hyperliquid is decentralised And then stop pretending traders actually give a fuck Bet you $HYPE is back where is started in short order cause degens gonna degen — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 26, 2025 Echoing his sentiment, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen commented : “The decision to close the $JELLY market and force settlement of positions at a favorable price sets a dangerous precedent,” Chen said. “Trust—not capital—is the foundation of any exchange and once lost, it’s almost impossible to recover.” You might also like: Bitget CEO says Hyperliquid could become FTX 2.0 amid JELLY incident",News|Derivatives|fraud|Meme Coin,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BNB|ZRX,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-27 10:00:44

XRP displays a bearish divergence on its 3-day chart, suggesting significant price jumps are unlikely soon. Conversely, SOL is positioning for a rebound from its recent decline, facing an initial resistance at $136.03. The BlockDAG (BDAG) community’s enthusiasm is sky-high as the much-awaited Keynote 3 draws near. The network’s presale has exploded beyond $207 million, driven by a spike in purchases, with participants anticipating pivotal updates from the event that could catalyze a dramatic price surge! XRP Price Analysis: Bearish Divergence Suggests Caution XRP price analysis reveals a bearish divergence on the 3-day chart, hinting that substantial upward trends may not be on the horizon. Currently, it’s testing the support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. A recovery from this range might push the price towards $2.65 to $2.80, though encountering resistance at $2.50 may hinder progress. Should the price dip below $2.25, it could fall to between $1.95 and $2.05. Presently, XRP price analysis indicates a lateral trading pattern, with short-term movements remaining unpredictable and no immediate signs of a breakout. Solana (SOL) Technical Outlook: Is a Recovery in Sight? Over the last day, Solana has seen a decline of 4.97%, but SOL’s technical outlook now suggests a potential rebound. Starting at $135.3, SOL dropped to $128.90 and briefly plummeted to $125.38, yet there are emerging indicators of an upward trend. Immediate resistance is found at $136.03, with subsequent levels at $152.77 and $178.63. Support lies at $125.38, extending to $113.18 and $110.6. If SOL manages to surpass the $136.03 resistance, it might climb 10.49%, potentially reaching $139.66 in the upcoming month. Countdown to BlockDAG Keynote 3: Presale Rockets to $207M! With just few hours until BlockDAG’s Keynote 3, the buzz within the community is skyrocketing. Anticipation is building with the 2025 mainnet debut in sight, featuring contributions from a renowned Hollywood producer. The event is expected to unveil new features, provide exclusive advantages for early adopters, and share deeper insights into BlockDAG’s ambitious growth plans. The fervor is mirrored in the ongoing presale of BlockDAG, having amassed $207 million with over 18.9 billion coins snapped up. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting a surge in BDAG’s value to $1 by 2025—a staggering potential return of 3932%. This surge in interest suggests BDAG could be a top contender for the best crypto for 2025, as enthusiasts rush to acquire coins before the keynote, hoping the revelations will boost BDAG’s market price. Past keynotes have significantly shaped BlockDAG’s trajectory, boosting its global profile. The imminent Keynote 3 is poised to amplify this impact, potentially accelerating the journey towards a $600 million target. With Batch 27 nearing sell-out, those keen on capitalizing on the current rates need to move quickly. Seize the Top Crypto Pick of 2025 Before It’s Gone! XRP’s price analysis indicates a static trend, with resistance capping gains at $2.50, while Solana’s (SOL) technical outlook suggests a possible uplift, with a breakthrough above $136.03 potentially yielding a 10.49% increase. Yet, for those targeting the best crypto for 2025 , BlockDAG emerges as a frontrunner with projections hitting $1. Currently valued at $0.0248 in batch 27, the potential for a 3932% return is massive. With Keynote 3 on the horizon, BlockDAG is poised to draw even greater attention, potentially fast-tracking it to meet its ambitious $600 million presale goal. With Batch 27 nearly depleted, quick action is advised for those aiming to secure shares at present rates for remarkable future gains.

However, an official statement from Binance is still missing, so the situation remains unclear. The Reports and the Confusion Reports say that Binance has explained its decision not to list Pi Coin due to several reasons. These include Pi Network still being too centralized and not having an open mainnet. Binance has stated that Pi Coin can only be listed once these issues are fixed, with decentralization and an open mainnet being key to the process. Pi Coin fans and investors have quickly reacted on social media, saying that the reports are false. Many believe that Binance’s claims about the mainnet being closed are incorrect. “The mainnet is open! It launched on February 20,” one Pi Coin supporter pointed out.” Some people argue that because Binance hasn’t officially confirmed anything, this news may just be a rumor. “There’s no official statement from Binance saying they rejected Pi Coin, so that shows there might not be any truth to the reports,” one person said. What’s Going on with Pi Network? Pi Network officially launched its open mainnet on February 20, 2025, promising better decentralization and infrastructure. The Pi Network community has been working hard to grow and improve its platform, but there are still challenges ahead, such as getting more recognition and liquidity. Without an official statement from Binance, no one knows for sure whether Pi Coin will be listed. Some are hopeful that Binance will eventually recognize Pi Coin’s progress, while others remain skeptical. If Binance really has rejected Pi Coin, it could be a big setback for the project. On the other hand, if Binance is just waiting for more progress, Pi Coin’s supporters might still have hope.

Imagine earning yields not just from the potential price appreciation of Bitcoin, but also from traditional financial instruments like U.S. Treasuries. Avalon Labs, the innovative force behind the BTC-backed stablecoin USDa, is making this a reality by supporting BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). This strategic move promises to redefine how you can grow your Bitcoin holdings. Let’s dive into how this integration is set to create a revolutionary Bitcoin yield opportunity. Unlocking Enhanced Bitcoin Yield with Real World Assets (RWA) Avalon Labs has officially announced its support for BlackRock’s BUIDL fund via the Securitize platform. This isn’t just another partnership; it’s a significant leap towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. By integrating with BUIDL, Avalon Labs is injecting real-world asset (RWA) yields into its yield-bearing Bitcoin stablecoin, sUSDa. But what does this actually mean for you, the Bitcoin enthusiast? Essentially, holding sUSDa now becomes even more lucrative. It’s no longer just about the inherent potential of Bitcoin; it’s about earning a dual yield. Let’s break down the magic: BTC On-Chain Yield: sUSDa, being Bitcoin-backed, inherently participates in the on-chain yield opportunities within the Bitcoin ecosystem. RWA Yield from U.S. Treasuries: Through the integration with BlackRock’s BUIDL, sUSDa holders gain exposure to the yields generated from U.S. Treasury bills, brought into the digital realm. This combination creates a powerful “dual-yield engine,” offering a compounded return that traditional Bitcoin holding simply can’t match. For those looking to maximize their Bitcoin’s earning potential, this is a game-changer. Why is RWA Tokenization and BUIDL a Big Deal? The concept of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization is gaining massive traction, and for good reason. It’s about bringing tangible assets from the traditional financial system onto the blockchain, unlocking new levels of efficiency, accessibility, and yield generation. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund is a prime example of this in action. Consider these benefits of RWA tokenization and BUIDL: Access to Institutional Grade Yields: BUIDL provides access to yields from high-quality assets like U.S. Treasury bills, typically reserved for institutional investors. Now, through sUSDa, even individual Bitcoin holders can tap into these yields. Increased Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology inherently brings transparency and efficiency. Tokenizing RWAs on platforms like Securitize enhances these aspects, making transactions and ownership more streamlined. Diversification of Yield Sources: Relying solely on crypto-native yields can be volatile. RWA tokenization diversifies yield sources, potentially offering more stable and predictable returns, especially from assets like U.S. Treasuries. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Initiatives like BUIDL are crucial in bridging the gap between Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). This integration can lead to greater adoption and innovation across both sectors. BlackRock’s entry into the RWA tokenization space with BUIDL is a strong validation of the technology’s potential. Avalon Labs supporting this initiative further solidifies the narrative that RWAs are not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental evolution in finance. Stablecoin Yield: sUSDa Leading the Charge In the competitive world of stablecoins, finding an edge is crucial. sUSDa is differentiating itself by not just being pegged to the US dollar, but by actively seeking to provide superior yield opportunities for its holders. The integration with BlackRock’s BUIDL is a testament to this commitment to enhance stablecoin yield . Here’s what makes sUSDa stand out in the stablecoin landscape: Feature sUSDa Typical Stablecoin Yield Source Dual: BTC On-Chain + U.S. Treasury RWA Primarily Lending/Staking within Crypto Ecosystem Asset Backing Bitcoin (BTC) Fiat Reserves, Cash Equivalents, Commercial Paper Yield Stability Potentially more stable due to diversification with U.S. Treasuries Subject to crypto market volatility Risk Profile Combines crypto and traditional finance risks Primarily crypto-native risks By offering exposure to U.S. Treasury yields, sUSDa is aiming to provide a more robust and potentially less volatile yield compared to stablecoins relying solely on crypto-native yield strategies. This approach could attract a broader range of users, including those traditionally hesitant about the risks associated with purely crypto-based yields. Avalon Labs USDa: A Smart Move for Bitcoin Holders? Is integrating with BlackRock BUIDL a smart move for Avalon Labs and USDa? Absolutely. For Bitcoin holders, the benefits are clear. Avalon Labs USDa is positioning itself as a forward-thinking stablecoin project that understands the evolving needs of the crypto investor.

Warren’s Ire Ahead of Confirmation Hearing,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/03/26/trump-sec-pick-paul-atkins-crypto-ties-draw-sen-warren-s-ire-ahead-of-confirmation-hearing,"Ahead of his confirmation hearing in front of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee tomorrow, Paul Atkins — President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — disclosed having up to $6 million in crypto-related assets, prompting Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to cry foul. In a Sunday letter to Atkins, Warren stressed that the former SEC commissioner’s background as a consultant and lobbyist for the financial industry could create “significant conflicts of interest” if he is confirmed. “You also have served as an expert witness hired by Wall Street firms accused of engaging in Ponzi schemes and other misconduct that you would now be responsible for investigating as SEC Chair. Furthermore, you have served as a Board Advisor to the Digital Chamber, a registered lobbying group for the crypto industry. In these roles, you and your firm were paid by the same companies that you would now be responsible for regulating,” Warren wrote. “This will raise serious concerns about your impartiality and commitment to serving the public interest if you are confirmed to serve as the next SEC Chair.” Warren urged Atkins to consider mitigating these potential conflicts of interest by recusing himself from any SEC matters involving his former clients, and agreeing not to do any lobbying, consulting or other work for any companies in the industry regulated by the SEC for at least four years after his departure from the agency. Her letter requests a written response from Atkins by Thursday. Another letter, also dated Sunday, asked Atkins a series of questions about how he believed the cryptocurrency industry should be regulated, alongside other matters before the SEC's purview. Atkins’ recent financial disclosures revealed a $328 million family fortune, according to Reuters , largely stemming from his wife’s family ties to roofing supply giant TAMKO Building Products. His risk consultancy firm, Patomak Global Partners — though which Atkins has done consulting for a range of companies, both crypto and traditional finance, and from which he has promised to divest if confirmed — was valued at between $25 and $50 million, Reuters reported. Atkins’ crypto-related assets were valued at up to $6 million, according to a report from Fortune , and include a combined $1 million in equity in crypto custodian Anchorage Digital and tokenization firm Securitize (Atkins held a board seat at Securitize until February). Atkins reported having up to a $5 million stake in the crypto investment firm Off the Chain Capital, where he is a limited partner. Off the Chain’s investments include private shares in big crypto companies like Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Kraken, as well as Mt. Gox bankruptcy claims. In a Tuesday filing with the Office of Government Ethics, Atkins pledged to divest from Off the Chain Capital within 120 days of his confirmation. He has also resigned from his position on the board of the Digital Chamber of Commerce and the Token Alliance of the Chamber of Digital Commerce according to the same filing. Atkins crypto ties are a stark contrast to his predecessor, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was known for his so-called “regulation by enforcement” approach to crypto regulation. Ahead of Atkins’ confirmation, the SEC’s current leadership, spearheaded by Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce, have been overhauling the agency’s crypto regulation strategy, inviting industry players to roundtable discussions at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. and backing down a considerable number of investigations and open litigation against crypto companies. However, not everyone that the SEC went after under Gensler is off the hook — the agency has not yet shut its probes into Unicoin or Crypto.com, both of which received Wells notices (a heads up of forthcoming enforcement charges) from the SEC last year. The SEC has shut down investigations into companies including Immutable, OpenSea and Yuga Labs, and ended litigation against companies like Coinbase, Kraken and Ripple since Uyeda took over the agency as acting chair.",Policy|SEC|Paul Atkins|Sen.

XRP, currently priced at $2.45, remains a dominant performer in cross-border payments and could see further gains as institutional adoption rises. Cardano (ADA), trading at $0.72, continues to attract attention with its methodical development and smart contract capabilities. However, the wildcard is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aiming to steal the spotlight. The project is in Phase 3 presale. Investors acquired more than 7200 presale tokens to produce a dynamic level of investor support worth $5.4 million. Mutuum Finance Phase 3 has already sold out over 80% of it. Those entering now can expect 200% returns worth $0.06 during the exchange launch period. Investors have a limited period remaining before the phase closes. Ripple (XRP) vs. Cardano (ADA): Utility vs. Vision XRP and ADA function as top cryptocurrencies but their fundamental market worth and expansion prospects remain distinct from one another. The payment system XRP exists at a market price of $2.45 to provide banks with efficient cross-border solutions. Ripple’s success depends on bank acceptance and defined regulatory rules and these factors have improved due to the company’s legal victories. The current price per ADA token amounts to $0.72 while Cardano works to present itself as a future-proof blockchain platform that delivers secure decentralized solutions with improved scalability features. XRP should appeal to institutional entities through its short-term potential but ADA employs long-term strategies because it targets the disruption of complete industries with its smart contract functionality. The selection between these cryptocurrencies depends on what type of blockchain system users need – whether they require instant functionality or complete ecosystem development in the future. Mutuum Finance Presale During the pre-sale phase investors achieved an outstanding milestone by providing more than $5.4 million in funding for reaching 7200 participants. The token value of Mutuum Finance tokens showed growth during Phase 3 initial stages and continues increasing toward its launch price expectation of $0.06. Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework which combines Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish straight loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P exchanges because this system represents a superior way of managing worldwide assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) all present strong investment cases for 2025, but Mutuum Finance’s explosive presale growth makes it the standout opportunity. With over $5.4 million raised and more than 7,200 investors already onboard, Phase 3 is now over 80% sold out, and the price will soon rise by 25%. Investors entering now could see 200% gains by the launch price of $0.06. Don’t wait to secure your MUTM tokens before this phase closes and maximize your profit potential.

In his tweet, Mekras reflected on the early vision for XRPL, particularly its potential to reshape financial transactions and reduce government control over monetary systems. The interview provides historical insight into Schwartz’s perspective on financial decentralization and the technological advancements introduced by XRPL. This interview by @JoelKatz from 2013 is really one of the most inspiring I have seen about XRPL. The OG vision was so amazing. ""For the first time, individuals, exchanges, payment systems, and merchants can be directly interconnected. That’s a major shift in the status quo.""… pic.twitter.com/iI5vgzBlyp — Panos {X} (@panosmek) March 24, 2025 Interconnecting Financial Systems In the interview, Schwartz described XRPL as a financial system that, for the first time, allowed individuals, exchanges, payment systems, and merchants to be directly interconnected. He explained that traditional payment systems operated in isolated silos, similar to how email functioned in its early days when users on different providers faced difficulties in communicating across platforms. Schwartz noted that XRPL was designed to solve this fragmentation by enabling seamless interactions between different financial entities, allowing payments to function more efficiently across borders and currencies. This vision represented a fundamental shift in financial infrastructure. At the time, payment systems were often controlled by banks and centralized intermediaries, limiting accessibility and interoperability. Schwartz emphasized that XRPL’s approach could reduce dependence on these intermediaries by offering a decentralized solution where transactions could be settled efficiently and transparently without third-party oversight. XRPL’s Role in Financial Freedom Another key point highlighted by Schwartz in the interview was XRPL’s potential to make it more difficult for repressive governments to use financial systems as tools of control. He compared XRPL’s impact to that of the Internet, which made it nearly impossible for authoritarian regimes to prevent access to external media and online discussions. According to Schwartz, XRPL could similarly prevent governments from enforcing the use of national currencies that they could manipulate or devalue. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mekras emphasized this aspect of the interview in his tweet, noting that XRPL was originally referred to as Ripple, Ripple Protocol, or Ripple Network before the company Ripple Labs was known by its current name. He clarified that in the early days, Ripple Labs was called OpenCoin Inc., a detail that provides historical context for Schwartz’s statements. The Ongoing Relevance of XRPL’s Original Vision The 2013 interview underscores XRPL’s initial goal of fostering a more open and decentralized financial ecosystem. Schwartz’s perspective on financial autonomy remains relevant today, as debates around digital assets, monetary policy, and government intervention continue. By revisiting these foundational ideas, Mekras highlighted how XRPL was designed to provide an alternative to traditional banking systems , allowing for a more inclusive and censorship-resistant financial infrastructure. Mekras’s post is a reminder of XRPL’s long-term mission. As Schwartz articulated, the early vision focused on financial accessibility, efficiency, and resistance to centralized control. As blockchain technology evolves, XRPL helps shape the future of digital transactions, reflecting the principles set out more than a decade ago.

On Tuesday, OpenAI introduced image generation capabilities to its GPT-4o model, allowing users to create AI-generated visuals directly within ChatGPT. Almost immediately, social media platforms were flooded with artwork mimicking the aesthetic of Studio Ghibli, the animation powerhouse behind films such as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro . Crypto KOLs using Ghilbi-images Among the notable names that jumped into the Ghilbi-inspired image train are billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who have shared AI-generated portraits of themselves in the Ghibli style. X CEO Musk, who has previously influenced memecoin markets of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) through his posts, shared a Ghilbi-fied version of a picture in the popular 1994 musical cartoon film The Lion King, which shows Rafiki the mandrill holding up Mufasa.

According to data from DEX Screener, GHIBLI reached a market capitalization of $20.8 million just 19 hours after going live. The memecoin is now changing hands at $0.01788, a whopping 30,382% uptick in the last 24 hours. GHILBI/SOL price chart. Source: DEX Screener DEX Screener also shows that the memecoin recorded nearly $77 million in trading volumes within the first 24 hours of going live from over 250,000 individual trades. The token’s liquidity pool holds just over $330,000 worth of SOL, indicating the maximum amount GHIBLI holders can exchange their holdings for, pending price declines. At least 20 other Ghibli-related tokens have emerged in the past 24 hours, each seeking to capitalize on the trend. Still, several members of the crypto community are convinced the coins will all plummet when the “fun element” of the images wears off. “Praying the memecoin runs to $100M to bring some hope into these markets. Severely needed,” said one crypto trader on X. Did OpenAI violate copyright laws in training ChatGPT? Ghibli-style AI art may have given the internet reasons to laugh, but it has also raised concerns about OpenAI ’s data practices. Like many of its AI competitors, the company has not disclosed the specific datasets used to train its models. Still, users are questioning the accuracy with which its system easily replicates Ghibli’s hand-drawn aesthetic in a matter of minutes. They believe OpenAI may have trained its model on copyrighted content without permission. An OpenAI spokesperson has released a statement to address these allegations, explaining that the company simply wants to provide users with creative freedom and has employed restrictive policies to prevent them from misusing the product. “We continue to prevent generations in the style of individual living artists, but we do permit more studio styles, which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations,” the spokesperson wrote. “We’re always learning from real-world use and feedback, and we’ll keep refining our policies as we go.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This ensures that your investment could be further boosted by the scarcity created, making it even more attractive to investors. At the launch price of $0.008, the projected ROI from the 16th phase to launch price could be astronomical. Already, over $2 million has been raised in the meme coin presale , showcasing strong investor confidence. As Arctic Pablo continues its “travel” through different locations, the price per token will only increase. Moo Deng: The Latest Buzz in the Crypto World Moo Deng has been making waves recently, thanks to its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). With a focus on utility and scalability, the coin has garnered significant attention in the crypto community. As it continues to expand its features and partnerships, Moo Deng’s value is expected to rise steadily in the coming months. While it may not be at the same stage as Arctic Pablo Coin, Moo Deng remains a strong contender for anyone looking for growth within the DeFi sector. Dogwifhat: A Promising Meme Coin on the Rise Dogwifhat, another meme coin contender, has been gaining traction due to its strong community backing and promising roadmap. The coin’s appeal lies in its strong meme culture, but it’s also expanding into more utility-driven features, setting it apart from other meme coins. While the project is still in its early stages, Dogwifhat’s dedicated team and growing community suggest that it could soon be a top player in the meme coin market. Final Remarks: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out Among the Rest In conclusion, while Moo Deng and Dogwifhat are showing promise, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers the most exciting opportunity for high returns right now. With features like staking, referral incentives, and an innovative token burn mechanism, Arctic Pablo has the potential to disrupt the meme coin market.

Demirors, a general partner at the investment firm Crucible Capital, says on the social media platform X that there’s “apathy and complacency everywhere.” “Zooming out, BTC volumes are lower than they were pre-election, and implied volatility in options markets is also very depressed – meaning there’s low demand for leveraged bets on Bitcoin by savvy traders. So, what’s the outlook on flows? 2024 ripped – between ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and the Trump Pump and the persistent strategy bid – it was a mega year for inflows. We have Gox moving coins, not really much forced sell pressure but not much demand either. We’ll be sideways for a bit. I still think we have a lot of pain left in this cycle and outcomes going forward will be binary. There’s $800 million of tokens unlocking every week. Show me the bid. Show me liquid funds who haven’t been carried out. No feelings, these are the facts.” Source: Meltem Demirors/X Demirors says this week’s crypto market price jump is a “relief bounce” driven by retail traders and algorithmic commodity trading advisors (CTAs).

This investment will accelerate the development of Solix’s groundbreaking MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (MCP) technology, which enables intelligent bandwidth sharing without affecting users’ internet experience. Founded with the mission to transform how internet bandwidth is shared and monetized, Solix has created a platform where users can contribute their unused bandwidth and earn rewards through a simple browser extension. This approach addresses critical challenges in today’s internet landscape, including bandwidth inequality and inefficient resource allocation. “We designed Solix with simplicity and accessibility as core principles,” said David Rodriguez, CEO of Solix DePIN. “By removing technical barriers to entry, we’re enabling anyone with an internet connection to participate in the decentralized economy and be rewarded for sharing resources they already have.” The MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL at the heart of Solix’s technology represents a significant advancement in the DePIN space.

Web3 is undergoing a seismic shift. Some of the industry’s biggest and most established players—including giants like Uniswap and Kraken —are beginning to outgrow general-purpose blockchains, like Base and Solana, that have long been considered central pillars of DeFi. They are part of an accelerating movement toward custom-built appchains that will pave the way for a more tailored and efficient era of blockchain infrastructure. You might also like: Web2 has failed the planet—It’s up to web3 to fix it | Opinion The hard ceiling on general-purpose blockchains General-purpose blockchains were instrumental in the rise of web3. Ethereum, Solana, and Base provided the liquidity of users and foundational ecosystems that allowed decentralized applications to flourish. These platforms connected developers and communities, creating the network effects necessary to bootstrap the early stages of web3 innovation. However, as the industry matures, the inherent limitations of general-purpose chains become increasingly evident. Shared infrastructure, high fees, and rigid tokenomics often force large-scale projects to compromise on performance, costs, or user experience. Uniswap’s recent launch of UniChain , a custom L2 designed for optimized functionality, is a clear example of this shift. Similarly, Kraken’s move to build an Ethereum L2 Superchain underscores the growing need for tailored infrastructure. These companies have reached a scale where the benefits of shared blockchains are increasingly not worth the costs. This is not an isolated trend. Once projects hit a critical mass, the economics and control offered by custom appchains, or application-specific blockchains, become too compelling to ignore. The appchain advantage By designing their own appchain infrastructure, projects can optimize for performance, reduce costs, and align more effectively with their specific needs. One of the most notable advantages of appchains is scalability. On general-purpose blockchains, applications must compete for blockspace and operate within predefined constraints, which can lead to congestion and unpredictable fees. Appchains remove these limitations by giving projects a dedicated environment where they can fine-tune performance, integrate custom features, and scale without external bottlenecks. A gaming studio, for example, could eliminate transaction delays by designing an appchain that prioritizes high-speed interactions and removes fees that disrupt player immersion, ensuring a more seamless and engaging gameplay experience. Cost efficiency is another critical factor. Operating on a shared blockchain often means high gas fees, particularly during periods of network congestion. Appchains let projects control their own cost structures, optimizing for throughput while keeping transaction fees low—or even eliminating them entirely. This is particularly valuable for applications that require frequent on-chain interactions, such as automated trading platforms, NFT marketplaces, or play-to-earn games. Appchains are also opening the door for web2 companies looking to integrate blockchain technology. Businesses accustomed to tightly controlled and highly optimized infrastructure often find general-purpose blockchains too restrictive. In web2, seamless user experience is paramount, and companies can’t afford to compromise performance for the sake of decentralization. Appchains allow them to adopt blockchain technology on their own terms, preserving the flexibility and reliability they need. A loyalty rewards program, for example, could build an appchain that allows users to seamlessly earn, trade, and redeem points while preserving the slick user experience their customers expect. This would be much more difficult to achieve on a congested general-purpose blockchain Historically, one of the biggest concerns with appchains was the risk of ecosystem fragmentation. Critics argued that launching independent chains would lead to a balkanized project landscape, reducing accessibility and liquidity. However, advancements in interoperability solutions, such as LayerZero and Avalanche’s subnets, have eliminated this concern. Appchains can now seamlessly connect with broader blockchain ecosystems, enabling assets and data to move freely between networks. This means projects can enjoy the benefits of a dedicated chain without sacrificing cross-chain connectivity—making appchains a superior alternative to general-purpose blockchains for both startups and established enterprises. Entering the L1 appchain era As more projects join in the transition toward appchains, we will see a new era of purpose-built blockchains, each optimized for a unique set of goals and challenges. Within this appchain revolution, projects will continue seeking more control over their infrastructure, communities, and tokenomics, ultimately gravitating toward L1 appchain solutions. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, which impose fixed incentive models, appchains allow projects to design custom tokenomic models tailored to their long-term goals. This flexibility enables them to align incentives across users, builders, and validators. In so doing, they foster community loyalty while minimizing fragmentation and creating a foundation for sustainable growth. Embracing the appchain revolution The migration from general-purpose blockchains to custom appchains is not just a trend—it’s an inevitability. And it’s a positive shift for the industry. By embracing appchains, projects can achieve a level of scalability, efficiency, and alignment that was previously out of reach. For web3 builders, the time to act is now. Overreliance on shared infrastructure and general-purpose chains ultimately stands to limit growth potential, locking projects into inflexible ecosystems and capping their potential. By investing in custom appchain infrastructure now, projects can future-proof their tech stack and position themselves as leaders in the next era of blockchain innovation.

About 58% said they do not trust him due to his involvement in the $4.6 billion Libra (LIBRA) cryptocurrency scandal. Since the scandal broke, public opinion on Milei’s approval has been divided. According to a recent survey , 36% still believe in him, and more than half remain skeptical. Milei’s approval rating drops as public sentiment worsens Zuban Córdoba conducted a study of 1,600 participants between March 12 and 14, with a 2.45% sampling error and a 95% confidence level. For the first time, the polling platform included a question assessing trust in President Javier Milei. Several key metrics have recently declined, including Milei’s reputation and national management approval rating. Zuban Córdoba reported that negativity concerning Milei’s leadership seemed to have no end as it rose gradually but consistently. “The change in tone and evaluation of the government is consolidating as more and more problematic fronts appear on the political agenda,” the polling platform said. Meanwhile, Milei’s approval rating fell to 45% in another University of San Andrés survey that 1,020 respondents filled out between March 11 and 20. Milei’s approval remains divided amid Libra scandal fallout President Milei is portrayed differently in each poll, though. According to Morning Consult data collected between February 27 and March 5, Milei’s approval rating was 62.4% following the Libra scandal. Since the scandal, Milei has distanced himself from Libra, claiming in a controversial X post on February 14 that he simply “spread the word” about the LIBRA token rather than promoting it. Meanwhile, fraud lawsuits against his claim continue to pile. Shortly following Milei’s X post, the Libra token surged to a $4.6 billion market cap before experiencing a serious, constant decline of nearly 94% over the following few hours. Although they have not succeeded, Argentina’s opposition party demanded that Milei be removed from office. Milei’s crypto scandal threatens political alliances and popularity President Javier Milei’s meme coin scandal has ailed his attempts to forge political alliances before the congressional midterm elections and tarnished his popularity. The dispute started in February when Milei backed the new token Libra in a post on X. Libra’s price jumped to $5 after his endorsement, and hours later, it was back to around $1. Milei’s critics accused him of being a rug-pull scammer who pumped up the value of an asset before a leading figure cashed out. The president deleted the post soon after. Milei’s administration denied any connection to the cryptocurrency industry, saying he had been deceived. At the same time, a federal judge opened an inquiry into the token’s release and Milei’s possible involvement in it. Although his hardline economic policies and anti-corruption measures gained him public support, the crypto scandal has undermined his previously staunch support.

The company is aggressively scaling operations, targeting 650-800MW hosting and 33 EH/s mining capacity by FY25, supported by recent low-cost power acquisitions, including a 51MW site at $0.03/kWh. A two-year framework agreement with BITMAIN for up to 80,000 next-gen miners ensures a steady hardware supply with flexible payment terms, reinforcing BitFuFu’s long-term scalability. While trading at a premium 16.86x EV/EBITDA, BitFuFu's expansion plans and potential entry into AI/HPC hosting position it for further growth, providing a fresh catalyst for valuation upside. BitFuFu ( FUFU ) has been the recent breakout miner and has shown impressive growth and expanding market presence. From being a recently listed mining stock, BitFuFu has so far cemented its place among established Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), MARA Holdings ( MARA ), CleanSpark ( CLSK ), and Hut 8 ( HUT ). I'll be doing a peer metric comparison between FUFU and these peers later in this article. BitFuFu is a Bitcoin mining and cloud computing company that was created from an early incubation of the cloud mining division at Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer BITMAIN. BitFuFu's flagship offering - cloud mining platform - is a Bitcoin mining model where users can purchase mining power without needing to own or maintain physical mining rigs. The company's board comprises several former BITMAIN employees and c-suite execs. Their wealth of experience seems to have paid off so far, as BitFuFu has gained solid ground among Bitcoin miners in a short time. These days, in every mining performance metric, BitFuFu has strong figures and stacks up competitively against its peers. Earlier this month, BitFuFu was included in the newly launched Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF ( OWNB ), an ETF that tracks publicly traded companies holding at least 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries. FUFU made the top 10 holdings of the ETF and had a 4.03% allocation at the ETF launch. Results are in for full-year 2024, and BitFuFu has shown exceptional financial and operational performance, with impressive revenue growth, expanding hashrate and power capacities, and better liquidity position. BitFuFu FY24 Operational and Financial Highlights For FY24. BitFuFu Increased its revenue by 63.1% YoY to $463.3 million, up from $284.1 million in 2023. Net Income surged by an impressive 414.3% to $54.0 million, compared to $10.5 million in FY23. And adjusted EBITDA grew by 181.8% to $117.5 million, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency. The company's cash position also increased by ~130% compared to FY23. BitFuFu now holds $175 million in cash and digital assets. Cloud mining remains the main revenue driver for the company's top line and was $271.5 million in FY24 - 58.5% of the total revenue generated in FY24. Self-mining contributed $157.5 million to total revenue in FY24, representing about 34.0% of the total revenue. Sales of mining equipment amounted to $30.5 million, making up 6.6% of total revenue. While hosting services and others amounted to $4.3 million, which is 0.9% of total revenue. On the cost front, the average cost to mine per BTC grew by 63% for BitFuFu, from ~$28,000 to ~$47,000, mainly due to the halving event of April 2024 and the increased Bitcoin mining difficulty. While SG&A costs jumped 583.8% YoY, due to the company incurring $17.6 million in share-based compensation expense as well as a $2.3 million increase in legal and consulting expenses. Cloud mining grew by almost 100% YoY, to 600,000 users. Operationally, BTC production was lower in both cloud mining and self-mining, due to last year's halving event and increased network difficulty. BitFuFu's Bitcoin stockpile, however, increased despite lower production. Miners have seen revenue stabilization post-halving. And in Q4 there was a rebound in miners' revenue, recovering from the drop seen in Q2 and Q3 last year. These factors contributed greatly to BitFuFu's stellar performance. Q4 was the inflection point of the 2024 fiscal year. Coin Metrics With FY25 having a more favorable outlook for miners, I believe BitFuFu would be able to sustain its financial growth this fiscal year. One of the latest developments for a positive outlook for miners in FY25 is the SEC clarifying that Bitcoin PoW mining and mining pools activities do not violate securities laws. And for BitFuFu, being heavily focused on cloud mining, this development is an important step towards validation of its business model and potentially creates a favorable market environment. moving forward. BitFuFu FY25 Outlook Looking ahead to 2025, we are well-positioned for another year or robust revenue growth. We expect our mining capacity to reach approximately 33 EH/s and hosting capacity to be in the range of 650MW to 800MW by year-end Leo Lu, CEO BitFuFu While the CEOs target and positive outlook to expand BitFuFu's mining and hosting capacity is a step in the right direction, the main takeaway for me in the earnings calls was the strategies the company is implementing to achieve economies of scale across the board and to lower operational cost as well as the average cost to mine per BTC. These strategies include acquisitions of power capacity and relocation of leased and self-owned mining machines from higher-cost facilities to lower-cost facilities. The relocation strategies have begun yielding results so far. In Q4, BitFuFu achieved a 25% reduction in average hosting costs due to the relocation strategies and acquisition of 164 MW capacity. The acquisition and relocation strategies have continued to progress well into FY25. Last month, BitFuFu acquired a majority stake in a 51 MW operational Bitcoin mining data center in Oklahoma, which offers competitive electricity costs averaging $0.03 per kWh. The miner also plans to deploy AntMiner S21 miners, which run at an efficiency of ~$16 J/T, at this facility. The last two power capacity acquisitions, 164 MW in Q4 last year and 51 MW so far this year, I believe BitFuFu's goal of reaching the target 650MW - 800MW power capacity by the end of FY25 is feasible. With the current cash and cash equivalent and BTC stash amounting to $175 million of liquid assets, I also think BitFuFu has a clearer path toward adding its targeted 1GW of incremental capacity by the end of 2026. There is also a two-year framework agreement with BITMAIN for up to 80,000 S-series miners (signed in January this year), including the S21 XP and S21 Pro models. The mining machines will be used for self-mining as well as for BitFuFu's other mining models, like cloud mining, and hosting services. The purchase terms with BITMAIN are flexible and will depend on market conditions and BitFuFu's ongoing capacity needs. The agreement also includes flexible payment terms, which allows BitFuFu to pay part of the purchase price in shares or defer some cash payments interest-free after delivery. The long-standing relationship with BITMAIN is an edge in securing cutting-edge mining hardware at scale and helps BitFuFu maintain competitiveness among peers, and this also means the path to achieving the 33 EH/s capacity target for FY25 is pretty clear. Data by YCharts Though some miners have turned profitable, I'd still lean towards EBITDA for peer valuation comparison. These mining stocks are too influenced by Bitcoin volatility to rely on forward P/Es. BitFuFu currently trades at a premium relative to its EBITDA compared to mining peers, as reflected in its higher EV/EBITDA multiple (shown in the above chart). FUFU jumped about 22% on yesterday's earnings release. FUFU now trades at 16.86x EV/EBITDA. The market seems to be pricing in stronger growth and expansion prospects for BitFuFu. Without a doubt, BitFuFu has clear visibility on scaling operations and fresh expansion opportunities ahead. The company has not even implemented HPC yet, and that has been mentioned as a potential future revenue stream, which is a fresh catalyst for future valuation upside. With the recent power capacity acquisitions mentioned earlier and the agreement with BITMAIN for 80,000 next-gen miners over the span of two years, BitFuFu has clear visibility towards achieving their mining capacity target and power capacity target. This clear scalability potential is what I think the market is pricing. Risks Ambitious expansion targets lead to higher spending. We can see how SG&A expenses jumped in FY24 due to share-based compensation. Not ruling out additional future share-based compensation as BitFuFu's relocation and expansion strategy will most likely be needing specialized high-cost talent. This has the potential to be dilutive. Also, if BitFuFu pays part of its BITMAIN miner agreement in shares, it could also be dilutive to shareholders. Takeaway BitFuFu's premium valuation relative to peers, shown in its higher EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples, shows that the market is pricing in strong growth prospects and a clear path to expansion. The company's recent power capacity acquisitions, its agreement with BITMAIN for up to 80,000 miners, and its liquid assets of $175 million provide clear visibility toward achieving its mining capacity targets. Also, BitFuFu is yet to enter the HPC and AI hosting space officially, which several peers have already implemented and are recording sales from. This presents a fresh growth catalyst for FUFU that could further support the valuation premium. However, ambitious expansion plans come with higher spending, and with share-based compensation and the potential for share payments under the BITMAIN agreement, investors should keep an eye on the structure of these share issuances.",BTC-USD|FUFU,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-27 11:52:15

Challenges and Considerations for TGE Participation While participating in a Token Generation Event like the KiloEx TGE can be exciting, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: High Demand: TGEs on platforms like Binance Wallet can attract significant interest, potentially leading to high demand and quick sell-outs. Be prepared to act promptly at the TGE start time. Subscription Cap: The 3 BNB subscription cap might limit the amount of KILO tokens individual users can acquire. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. The value of KILO tokens post-TGE could fluctuate. Conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before participating. Project Risks: As with any new crypto project, there are inherent risks associated with KiloEx and the KILO token. Project development, adoption, and market conditions can all influence the success of the token. Actionable Insights and Final Thoughts The Binance Wallet hosting the KiloEx TGE presents a compelling opportunity for those interested in gaining early access to the KILO token and supporting a new DEX on the BNB Smart Chain.

The bet, which speculated on whether Ukraine would agree to a mineral deal with U.S. President Donald Trump before April, saw its ""yes"" probability surge from 9% to 100% between March 24 and 25, despite no official agreement being reached. Polymarket relies on UMA, an optimistic oracle system, to determine the outcomes of its prediction markets. In this system, anyone can propose a resolution by staking a $750 USDC.e bond, which can then be challenged. If a dispute arises, UMA token holders vote to settle the matter. In this case, the bet resolved as ""yes,"" leading many users to suspect manipulation by a ""UMA whale"" — a holder of a large number of UMA tokens capable of influencing the vote. Polymarket responded via its Discord server, admitting the resolution was unexpected but denying it constituted a ""market failure"" that would warrant refunds. It clarified that the market was resolved too soon, as no deal between Ukraine and the U.S. has been confirmed, yet it stood by the UMA voting process to correct the outcome. Polymarket has since turned to its community for suggestions on preventing future issues, promising clearer rules and forthcoming updates, though it has yet to detail specific changes.

Will this behavior push Ethereum price to crash below $2,000? Is this a short-term panic from ETH whales, or will this become a trend that kickstarts a deep crash? Ethereum Price Likely to Crash as Whales Sell ETH According to data from Santiment , Ethereum whales holding between 1000 to 10,000 ETH offloaded 110K tokens worth $214M at the current ETH value of $1,950 per ETH. Likewise, 10K to 100K addresses shed 380K worth $741M and 100K to 1M cohort reduced their holdings from 19.59M to 19.2M ETH. This en masse sell-off from high net worth investors indicates a bearish outlook and hints at an incoming crash for Ethereum price. ETH Supply Distribution Why does this matter? Typically, whales sell during uptrend but not after huge crashes or capitulation events. Data from Santiment shows two major capitulation events on March 7 and March 21, where large quantities of ETH were sold at loss. During such events, whales tend to buy, which makes the current whale sell-off since mid-March unusual. ETH Capitulation Does this hint at a bearish Ethereum price forecast ? Let’s explore ETH price analysis and analysts’ take on the current outlook. Ethereum Price Analysis Does this mean Ethereum price will crash below $2,000? Due to the increased selling pressure and uncertain outlook from Bitcoin (BTC) price, there is a high chance ETH price will crash below $2,000.

The upper range of the value area at $1,926 also coincides with poor lows, aka liquidity, making it a good place for booking profits, if investors have entered short position. ETH Time Price Opportunity chart The recent sell-off from Ethereum whales, despite two capitulation events, is a bearish indicator that hints at an incoming crash for Ethereum price. With increased selling pressure and an uncertain outlook from Bitcoin (BTC) price, there is a high chance that ETH price will crash below $2,000. Investors should exercise caution and consider the potential risks and opportunities in the market.

In a letter sent on March 26 to key congressional committees, including the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, the group argued that the DOJ’s stance threatens the future of software development in the US digital asset industry. The letter was spearheaded by the DeFi Education Fund and backed by major industry players, including Kraken and Coinbase. The crypto firms criticized the DOJ’s use of money-transmitting laws to charge Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov with money laundering in August 2023. According to the coalition, this interpretation disregards existing guidance from the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and creates a dangerous precedent. DOJ’s Interpretation Sparks Legal Concerns The letter highlighted how the DOJ’s position hinges on two sections of the US Code—Title 31, Section 5330 and Title 18, Section 1960—which define and criminalize unlicensed money-transmitting businesses. However, the crypto firms argue that FinCEN’s 2019 guidance makes it clear that software developers who do not control customer funds should not be considered money transmitters. By ignoring this guidance, the DOJ is essentially contradicting FinCEN, creating legal ambiguity that could ensnare law-abiding developers. The coalition warned that if left unchallenged, this interpretation could stifle innovation, as developers may fear criminal prosecution simply for publishing non-custodial software. The coalition also cited the DOJ’s recent prosecution of Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill on similar charges, calling it part of a growing trend of regulatory overreach. Both developers have pleaded not guilty. Call for Clarity and Protection The letter called on Congress to intervene, warning that the DOJ’s stance risks driving crypto innovation out of the US. It argued that without clearer legal protections, the mere act of writing or releasing DeFi-related code could expose developers to prosecution. The growing legal battle has also prompted individual action. In January, Coin Center fellow Michael Lewellen sued US Attorney General Merrick Garland, seeking a legal declaration that his release of non-custodial crypto software is protected under the Constitution. As the crypto industry faces increasing regulatory pressure, the coalition’s letter underscores mounting frustration over conflicting interpretations of financial laws, which many argue are being misapplied to decentralized technologies.

On March 27, the country’s Ethics Commission for Government Officials reportedly disclosed that more than 20% of the surveyed public officials hold 14.4 billion won ($9.8 million) in crypto. This means 411 of the 2,047 officials subjected to the country’s disclosure requirements hold crypto assets. The highest amount disclosed was 1.76 billion won ($1.2 million) belonging to Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young. The officials held different crypto assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Luna Classic (LUNC) and others. South Korean public officials disclosed crypto holdings The disclosure of public officials’ crypto assets follows calls for transparency from its prime minister. In 2023, South Korean Prime Minister Han Deok-soo said in a news conference that high-ranking government officials must include crypto in their property disclosures. The official said crypto should be treated similarly to other assets like precious metals. On May 25, 2023, South Korea passed a bill mandating public officials to include crypto in their public asset disclosures. The new system granted South Koreans access to the crypto holdings of at least 5,800 public officials starting in 2024. In June 2024, crypto exchanges in the country launched information provision systems to simplify the registration of information about crypto holdings.

While prosecutors requested a six-month prison sentence for Kim, the lawmaker was eventually acquitted after a judge ruled that crypto assets were not subject to public disclosures at the time Kim made the transactions.

The BOJ had planned to raise interest rates at the May 1 conclusion of its next board meeting, but economists argue that the recent U.S. trade policies might prevent that possibility. He also argued that the BOJ should carefully examine the impacts of the tariffs on the economy. Takeda believes that “there is now way they can finish that by the May meeting.” Trump’s auto tariffs reduce the likelihood of rate hikes by BOJ Look, Trump is wavering the tariff flag and everyone is scared and if you look at what people project the impact of his tariffs on inflation is, well, it's somewhere between 0 and 1%. The BOJ JPY policy has been a bigger tariff on imports – it popped inflation to 4% in Jan and… — Trinh (@Trinhnomics) March 21, 2025 Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute, acknowledged that the new auto tariffs from the U.S. reduced the likelihood of the Bank of Japan raising its interest rate at its next board meeting. Takeda said that “the likelihood of a May rate hike has gotten even lower.” Trump’s heightened trade policies came at a time when the BOJ was seeking the right opportunity to lift rates as consumer inflation continued to exchange hands above its target. The economist said that the 25% tariffs will weigh on Japan’s auto sector and will have the potential to ripple across a broader set of industries. Katsutoshi Inadome, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, argued that the 25% tariffs on cars imported into the U.S. were a headwind for the BOJ to raise interest rates early. Inadome also believes that long-term interest rates could fall below 1.5% once the tariffs take effect. A Bloomberg survey in February revealed that most economists expected the BOJ to wait until June or July to raise their base case scenarios. The research also found that around half of the economists said the earliest timing for the move would be May 1. “With automakers – whose pay decisions set a benchmark for corporate Japan – likely to take a hit to the bottom line, the central bank will be on guard for damage to wage growth more broadly – which could impact its view on inflation.” -Taro Kimura, Bloomberg economist. Kimura also argued that lawmakers could urge the BOJ to pause stimulus withdrawal amid the growing external risks to the economy ahead of an election in July. U.S. tariff on Japan impacts its economic growth The U.S. president announced that the fresh tariffs will go into effect on April 2 for all cars that are not made in the United States. Japan’s autos and auto parts were the biggest exports in 2024, accounting for a little over one-third of its exports to the U.S. Japan’s currency has been trading around 150 to the dollar, which is lower than its 10-year average of around 121. The yen reacted higher to the higher tariffs on Thursday morning after increasing by 0.19% to 150.8600 from 150.5740 in the previous trading session. Takeda maintained that Japan is yet to see whether the levies will actually be implemented in April as announced. He also believes that the ultimate impact on the economy may not be that severe due to Japanese automakers’ relative competitiveness in the U.S. market. The economist argued that this intensifies downside risks for the economy, “but it probably won’t push the economy off the path of gradual recovery.” Data from the Ministry of Finance showed that automobiles made up 28.3% of the country’s total export to the U.S. in 2024. The data also indicated that the auto industry made up roughly 3% of Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP). The industry has also been the cause of recent wage hikes caused by automakers distributing the huge profits they make overseas to their employees. Goldman Sachs analysts believe that the auto tariffs might shave only a little over 0.1 percentage points off Japan’s GDP growth rate. The analysts argued that the nation’s automakers won’t lose relative competitiveness as the extra levies are applied to all nations. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association noted that auto-related companies employ 5.58 million people in the country or 8.3% of the total workforce. Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated on Thursday that the government won’t rule out issuing countermeasures against the U.S. An associate professor at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan, believes that the damage to the Japanese automotive industry would be extensive. He also argued that the same would apply to the whole automotive industry. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that the U.S. imported $214 billion worth of passenger cars in 2024.

The latest list introduces three rising stars—Maple (SYRUP), Geodnet (GEOD), and Story Protocol (IP)—while removing Akash, Arweave, and Jupiter. With the crypto market facing turbulence, Grayscale is betting big on new trends that could reshape the industry. Grayscale’s Market Insights for 2025 As per the Grayscale Research report , the first quarter of 2025 saw a decline in the cryptocurrency market, similar to the drop seen in tech stocks and other high-risk assets. While Bitcoin network activity remained steady, demand for meme coins, especially on Solana, has dropped. Despite this, Web3 applications in DeFi, AI, and infrastructure sectors have generated over $2 billion in revenue. The grayscale report even highlight s that Sui (SUI) is one of the most promising smart contract platforms. It offers fast transactions and low fees without needing extra scaling layers like Ethereum. Currently, Sui holds just 3% of Grayscale’s Smart Contract Platforms index. For Q2 2025, Grayscale is focusing on three key areas: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN), Real World Assets (RWA), and Intellectual Property Tokenization (IP). Some new projects have been added to its Top 20 list. Grayscale’s New Picks for Q2 2025 The latest update sees three fresh names added to Grayscale’s watchlist: Maple (SYRUP): A lending platform for institutional clients with over $600 million in total value locked (TVL). It has generated $20 million in fees in the last month and aims to surpass $2 billion in TVL by 2025. Geodnet (GEOD): A decentralized infrastructure project providing real-time, highly accurate positioning data. It now operates in 130+ countries with over 14,000 devices and has crossed $3 million in monthly fee revenue. Story Protocol (IP): Aiming to tokenize the $70 trillion intellectual property market, this project is making waves by bringing top artists, including Justin Bieber and BTS, onto the blockchain. Grayscale warns that these assets remain highly volatile and risky. GEOD, in particular, lacks major exchange listings, making it an even riskier bet. Which Projects Were Removed? Grayscale has removed three assets from its list, including Arweave (AR), Akash (AKT), and Jupiter (JUP), from its Top 20 list due to their poor performance. However, the firm will continue monitoring its potential. Additionally, Grayscale noted a decline in overall market capitalization and a weakening of the Consumer & Culture sector, driven by the decline of memecoins and Solana’s ecosystem.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AR|BUSINESS|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 12:16:55

42478351,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143939,1743078008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Linear Finance Shutdown: Unpacking the LINA Crypto Collapse and DeFi Project Closure,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/linear-finance-shutdown-crypto/,"In a dramatic turn of events, the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is reeling from the announcement that Linear Finance (LINA), a prominent decentralized asset protocol, is ceasing operations. Did you see this coming? Probably not. But the official announcement on X has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, leaving many investors and users in disbelief and seeking answers. Let’s delve into the details of this unexpected Linear Finance shutdown and explore what it signifies for the future of DeFi and your crypto portfolio. What Led to the Shocking Linear Finance Shutdown? Linear Finance cited “ongoing challenges in generating sustainable revenue” as the primary reason for its decision to shut down. In the fast-paced and fiercely competitive world of DeFi, projects constantly battle for user adoption and revenue streams. While Linear Finance once held promise with its synthetic asset platform, it appears these challenges became insurmountable. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast? Let’s break it down: Revenue Struggles: The core issue seems to be the inability to consistently generate enough income to sustain operations. This is a stark reminder that not all crypto projects, even those with innovative ideas, can achieve long-term financial viability. Market Competition: The DeFi landscape is incredibly crowded. New protocols and platforms emerge constantly, vying for user attention and liquidity. Linear Finance likely faced intense competition from established players and newer, more agile projects. Changing Market Conditions: The broader crypto market is known for its volatility. Bear markets and shifts in investor sentiment can significantly impact DeFi projects, affecting trading volumes and overall platform activity, which directly influences revenue. This LINA crypto collapse serves as a stark warning. The crypto space, while full of potential, is also fraught with risks. Projects can fail, and investments can be lost. This isn’t just about Linear Finance; it’s a broader lesson for everyone involved in cryptocurrencies. Decoding the DeFi Project Closure: What Does it Mean for You? The closure of any DeFi project, especially one with the profile of Linear Finance, raises crucial questions about the sustainability and risks inherent in decentralized finance. Are DeFi project closure events becoming more common? What can we learn from this situation? Let’s explore the implications: Impact on LINA Token Holders If you are holding LINA tokens, you’re likely concerned about what happens next. Typically, when a project shuts down, the value of its native token plummets, often to near zero. While the specific details of Linear Finance’s shutdown process are still unfolding, history suggests a challenging road ahead for LINA holders. It’s crucial to stay informed about any announcements from the Linear Finance team regarding token redemption or any potential next steps. However, realistically, the prospects for recovering significant value from LINA tokens appear grim. Broader Implications for the DeFi Ecosystem Linear Finance’s exit isn’t just an isolated incident. It highlights some critical vulnerabilities within the DeFi space: Challenge Description Impact Sustainability Maintaining long-term financial viability in a rapidly evolving market. Project closures and investor losses. Risk Management Assessing and mitigating the inherent risks of DeFi protocols. Potential for hacks, exploits, and economic failures. Regulatory Uncertainty The evolving regulatory landscape adds complexity and risk. Compliance challenges and potential legal hurdles. This DeFi project closure emphasizes the need for robust due diligence when investing in DeFi. It’s not enough to just chase high yields; understanding the project’s fundamentals, team, tokenomics, and risk factors is paramount. Navigating Decentralized Finance Risks: Lessons from Linear Finance The Linear Finance situation throws decentralized finance risks into sharp relief. While DeFi offers exciting opportunities for financial innovation and empowerment, it also comes with a significant degree of risk. What can we learn from this episode to better navigate the DeFi landscape? Understanding the Risks Smart Contract Risks: DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts, which, if flawed, can be exploited, leading to loss of funds. Economic Risks: Tokenomics can be poorly designed, leading to inflationary pressures or unsustainable models. Market volatility and liquidity risks are also significant factors. Operational Risks: Project teams may lack experience, or governance structures may be weak, leading to poor decision-making and operational failures. Systemic Risks: Interconnectedness within DeFi means that the failure of one project can have cascading effects on others. Actionable Insights for DeFi Users Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research any DeFi project before investing. Understand its technology, team, tokenomics, and risk factors. Risk Management Strategies: Diversify your DeFi portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Use stop-loss orders and other risk management tools where appropriate. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with developments in the DeFi space. Follow reputable news sources and project announcements. Start Small: If you are new to DeFi, start with small amounts and gradually increase your exposure as you gain experience and understanding. By acknowledging and understanding decentralized finance risks , you can make more informed decisions and protect yourself in this dynamic and often unpredictable space. The Broader Crypto Market Volatility and Project Sustainability Linear Finance’s shutdown also reflects the inherent crypto market volatility and the challenges it poses for project sustainability. The crypto market is known for its boom-and-bust cycles, and these cycles can significantly impact the fortunes of crypto projects. How does market volatility contribute to project failures like this? Impact of Market Swings Reduced Trading Volumes: Bear markets typically see a significant drop in trading volumes, impacting the revenue of DeFi platforms that rely on transaction fees. Decreased Asset Values: The value of crypto assets can plummet during market downturns, affecting the collateral value in DeFi protocols and potentially triggering liquidations. Investor Sentiment: Negative market sentiment can lead to decreased user adoption and investment in crypto projects, making it harder for them to attract capital and grow. Building Resilience in a Volatile Market For DeFi projects to thrive in the long run, they need to build resilience to crypto market volatility . This includes: Sustainable Revenue Models: Developing diverse and robust revenue streams that are less dependent on market speculation. Strong Community and User Base: Cultivating a loyal and engaged community that supports the project through market cycles. Prudent Financial Management: Managing treasury funds responsibly and building reserves to weather market downturns. Continuous Innovation: Staying ahead of the curve by constantly innovating and adapting to the evolving needs of the market. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for DeFi? The shocking Linear Finance shutdown is undoubtedly a significant event in the DeFi space. It serves as a potent reminder of the risks, challenges, and the ever-present need for caution and due diligence in the world of cryptocurrencies. While DeFi continues to offer transformative potential, it is not without its perils. This incident should encourage both project developers and investors to prioritize sustainability, risk management, and informed decision-making. The future of DeFi hinges on building robust, resilient, and truly sustainable projects that can weather the storms of market volatility and deliver long-term value.

Analyst Dark Defender has forecasted that an $8 price target for the crypto looms right over the horizon. In the wake of XRP ETF and Ripple IPO odds gaining substantial weight, traders and investors are highly optimistic that this bullish prediction will be accurate. Market Expert Predicts XRP Price To $8 Despite Turbulence XRP price is currently trading at the $2.35 level, down nearly 4% in the past 24 hours. The American blockchain payment company’s crypto bottomed at $2.33 intraday. Notably, the weekly chart for the coin further shows a nearly 6% dip in value. However, despite the broader waning action, market experts believe price can rally ahead. According to analyst Dark Defender’s X post on March 27, Ripple’s coin is targeting $5.85 and $8.076 shortly ahead. The analyst cites these bullish targets based on price analysis of a 3-month time frame chart. Taking into consideration January, February, and March, the analyst highlights that a 3-month candle will close by this month’s end. “When you zoom out, you can see a clear bullish momentum” for the coin, the analyst added based on his analysis. Source: Dark Defender, X For context, while larger time frames (like 3-month charts) are often used to assess the overall trend, smaller ones are used for short-term trading. In conclusion, after a broader time frame analysis by Dark Defender, the analyst strongly believes that XRP price target for the 3rd wave remains ultimately at $8. Can $8 Prediction Come True? Ripple IPO & XRP ETF Odds Spark Optimism Simultaneously, broader market advancements for the Ripple community have added to hopes of a looming bull run. In a riveting turn of events, following the SEC lawsuit settlement, market participants are now eyeing a Ripple IPO (Initial Public Offering). CoinGape reported that although there have been no official announcements yet, experts believe such a feat will happen in the next 12 to 18 months. While this mover could fuel a remarkable bull run for XRP price, soaring Ripple ETF odds have added further optimism. Recent Polymarket data indicated that there is an 85% chance of an ETF approval by this year (2025). In turn, bullish market sentiments surrounding the crypto continue to rise. Also, it’s worth mentioning that the RLUSD stablecoin-fueled hype has injected further optimism for future movements. XRP Derivatives Market Overview Meanwhile, Coinglass data indicated that XRP futures OI rose from the $2 billion level and closed in on $4 billion since March 12 to date. This data indicated renewed market interest in the crypto amid broader advancements. Source: Coinglass Simultaneously, the coin’s derivatives volume was also up 24% today, reaching $5.35 billion. Overall, market watchers remain highly bullish on the crypto’s long-term prospects due to the broader dynamics.

With this move, it is entering the market that has already established players operating as crypto exchanges such as eToro, BitoPoro, MaiCoinGroup, MAX Exchange among others. Though it has not immediately started offering its services in the crypto market of Taiwan, JuCoin has initiated the process by applying for mandatory regulatory licenses. Further, it has also announced launching the “Taiwan Web3 Accelerator” program of 200 million TWD if its users base in the country exceed the number of 100,000. What are the Benefits for the crypto market of Taiwan? ​ As JuCoin prepares to enter Taiwan’s crypto market, users can anticipate access to a comprehensive suite of services such as its advanced trading platform which supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, enabling users to diversify their portfolios effectively. The users will also get access to its Launchpad function which can help in assisting emerging crypto projects with their token launches. Notably, it also plans to introduce JuOne, a Web3 AI-powered cryptocurrency smartphone that integrates top Web3 features, AI-driven intelligence, and a 5G IoT network. Enhancing its presence in the crypto market, it is also developing its JuChain, an independent and permissionless public blockchain that facilitates the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and the issuance of assets, including fungible tokens (FTs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) of Taiwan released a draft of new… pic.twitter.com/hwSjnrv8kC — JuCoin (@Jucoinex) March 27, 2025 Entry Amid New Crypto Regulations in Taiwan JuCoin Exchange is entering the crypto market of Taiwan only a day after Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) released a VASA Act draft for regulating the operations of Virtual Asset Service Act (VASA) providers on March 25 and the country’s cryptocurrency industry. The proposed framework seeks to establish clear guidelines for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), enhancing investor protection and ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Key aspects of the draft include mandatory registration for VASPs, requiring all crypto exchanges operating in Taiwan to obtain a license. The FSC also introduces segregation of customer funds, ensuring that user assets are stored separately from company funds to prevent mismanagement. Additionally, foreign crypto firms must register locally to serve Taiwanese users, reinforcing government oversight. Notably, between Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, crypto market of Taiwan experienced a 43% increase in cryptocurrency ownership, with a significant upward trend in adoption. And now these new legislation enforces strict AML measures, requiring platforms to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and report suspicious transactions. Furthermore, the FSC seeks to ban unregistered platforms from operating within the country, ensuring a more secure trading environment. What’s Next? Building the Taiwanese version of ‘Web3 Silicon Valley’ Apart from marking its entry in the crypto market, JuCoin has also announced its future plans for the evolving crypto landscape in the country by aspiring to build a Taiwanese version of ‘Web3 Silicon Valley’. The company has pledged investing 200 million TWD to empower the Taiwanese community which will fund its to-be launched “Taiwan Web3 Accelerator” initiative. The Developer Support Fund will provide up to $500,000 in seed investments to support local AI, DePIN, and RWA projects, with priority listings on JuCoin Launchpad. This funding basically aims to accelerate blockchain innovation and encourage local startups to develop cutting-edge solutions. In collaboration with National Taiwan University and the Blockchain Association, JuCoin will also be establishing the “Web3 Talent Training Camp” to train 500 compliance and technical professionals annually. Thus, with another new player entering the crypto market of Taiwan, we can expect more advancements and adoption as the new regulation also takes shape.

Discover early-stage projects with strong adoption potential and investor momentum. Presales continue to be a key opportunity for crypto investors aiming to get in early on promising blockchain projects. From meme coins with evolving utility to AI-powered analytics tools and scalable infrastructure solutions, 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for early-stage crypto. Below are six noteworthy presales that reflect different trends and sectors within the industry. HexyDog (HEXY) Leading the pack is HexyDog (HEXY) — a presale project that has quickly captured investor attention by blending meme coin appeal with genuine utility. HexyDog is designed to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the pet care industry by enabling smooth cryptocurrency transactions for pet-related goods and services. This unique use case sets it apart from meme coins driven purely by hype. Since launching its presale, HexyDog has already raised over $280,000, signaling strong early momentum. The token is currently priced at $0.0023, offering a limited-time opportunity for early participants before the next price stage. HEXY holders can also stake their tokens to earn passive income, while the ecosystem offers a zero-tax model, cross-chain compatibility, and a community-first development roadmap. With its real-world focus, growing community, and strong early traction, HexyDog is one of the top crypto presales of 2025 gaining momentum due to its utility-driven approach. Mind of Pepe (MIND) Mind of Pepe blends meme culture with artificial intelligence. Its core innovation lies in an AI agent that continuously analyzes social and blockchain data to identify potential crypto trends. Token holders gain access to this evolving insight engine, including early alerts and AI-generated token concepts. Though still in development, the project taps into increasing interest in predictive analytics and sentiment-driven trading. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) BTCBULL introduces a milestone-based reward model that distributes Bitcoin to token holders whenever BTC hits key price targets like $150,000 or $200,000. This structure adds a gamified reward layer tied directly to Bitcoin’s performance. It may appeal to long-term BTC supporters seeking an alternative incentive system while holding through market cycles. Best Wallet Token (BEST) BEST powers Best Wallet, a non-custodial crypto wallet aiming to provide users with full control over their assets. With nearly $11 million raised so far, the project is gaining visibility among users who prioritize privacy, multi-chain access, and future DeFi integration. Best Wallet’s roadmap includes support for NFTs and token swaps, making it a contender in the growing self-custody space. Meme Index (MEMEX) MEMEX aims to simplify meme coin investing by offering ETF-style exposure to curated indices of memecoins. Investors can choose from multiple options depending on their risk tolerance — from balanced allocations to highly speculative mixes. MEMEX could be a useful tool for those wanting broader access to meme tokens without committing to just one. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG is tackling blockchain scalability through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture — a structure that enables high throughput and low latency. Its presale is drawing attention from technically minded investors interested in infrastructure-focused projects. While still early, BlockDAG’s approach has potential for enterprise-level decentralized apps and could address long-standing limitations in traditional blockchain models. Conclusion The 2025 presale landscape is already proving to be one of the most diverse in recent years — ranging from meme coins with real utility to AI, DeFi, and infrastructure plays. Among them, HexyDog clearly emerges as a standout, thanks to its relatable use case, early adoption metrics, and well-structured ecosystem. Investors looking for early-stage opportunities with both vision and traction may want to take a closer look — especially while HEXY tokens are still in presale pricing.

In a statement shared on X, the Linear Finance team explained that despite years of development, their project failed to generate sustainable revenue. The protocol saw a brief period of profitability following its 2019-2020 launch but struggled in subsequent years. The final blow came when Binance announced the delisting of LINA, effective March 28, 2025. This triggered a sharp 65% decline in the token’s market capitalization, reducing Linear Finance’s remaining operational runway. The project had been primarily funded through personal contributions from its founder and token liquidations, an unsustainable model that ultimately led to the decision to wind down operations. “Our Operations Team will be in touch shortly with clear timelines and step-by-step instructions for users with active positions across our dApps,” the announcement stated.

Whales have accumulated 240 million ADA last week, reducing the circulating supply and potentially signaling a bullish move. Buckle up for Potential Turbulence Cardano’s ADA has hovered between $0.69 and $0.77 in the past week, currently trading at approximately $0.73 (per CoinGecko’s data). According to one essential metric, the price volatility may increase substantially in the near future . The indicator in question is the Bollinger Bands, which has squeezed on the 12-hour chart (according to the popular X user Ali Martinez). The technical analysis tool, developed by John Bollinger in the early 1980s, assists traders in detecting when an asset may be overbought or oversold and spot potential price breakouts or reversals. Typically, tightening its bands suggests that the token has experienced relatively low volatility as of late, which could be followed by a huge resurgence or an intense pullback in the short term. Earlier this week, the market observer using the X moniker Lucky told their more than two million followers that ADA might witness “another big move” in the following months. “Strong fundamentals and increasing adoption make Cardano a reliable choice. The ecosystem continues to expand, solidifying its market position,” the analyst stated. The Whales Activity An important element suggesting that ADA’s price may soon rally is the recent buying spree from large investors. Martinez revealed that whales purchased 240 million tokens last week, which equals more than $175 million (calculated at current rates). Such accumulations generally suggest that a price pump could be on the horizon. After all, they decrease the circulating supply of ADA on the open market, which could be followed by a resurgence (assuming demand remains the same or heads north). In November 2024, large investors scooped up millions of ADA when the token’s price stood at around $0.90. Just a few days later, the valuation briefly jumped beyond $1.30. Massive sell-offs, on the other hand, can have the opposite effect. At the start of February, whales offloaded more than 330 million ADA (worth almost $250 million at the time ). While Cardano’s native token was hovering above $0.80 at the moment of the selling spree, it gradually declined to as low as $0.70 in the following days.

The AI infrastructure firm was previously expected to raise $3 billion at a $30 billion valuation, according to the story , but the size has been cut and the valuation lowered to just $23 billion. A separate story from Bloomberg said CoreWeave is now looking to raise only $1.5 billion. CoreWeave is in close partnership with bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ), which was expected to profit from the IPO if the results are positive and sustain strong revenue growth over the next few years. In early U.S. trading, CORZ is up fractionally, but down sharply over the past month and for 2025 as a whole. AI-related tokens NEAR, ICP, RENDER have added modestly to earlier losses. CoreWeave saw $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024 amid surging demand for AI services. However, some believe that CoreWeave’s new $12 billion deal with AI giant OpenAI could have bigger implications for the company than its IPO plan. CoreWeave’s pullpack comes as tech stocks have lagged other market sectors since the start of this year, partially as a result of on-and-off tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and concerns about the spending of AI companies. CoreWeave will debut on the Nasdaq on Friday, becoming the first AI company to hit the stock market.

The Web3 security tool was an on-chain firewall project offering tools against exploits. Harpie, the Web3 tool against exploits, announced it would shut down services immediately. The product protected wallets from malicious interactions as Web3 wallets suffered increasingly sophisticated attacks. Harpie shut down access to its site with a message on discontinuing its operations. “ We attempted to create a theft-free crypto ecosystem, but unfortunately could not create a sustainable business model around it. We hope that we created an impact and inspired new companies to take that torch and solve this tough problem,” explained the project’s team. Harpie offered an on-chain firewall to prevent scams and theft. The service monitored transactions for potential attack vectors and moved funds away to safety before they reach the attacker’s wallet. The project’s shutdown surprised the community, as Harpie was seen as potentially one of the most useful projects for Web3. Damn bros – I hate to hear it. One of the products that I felt had a true win-win setup, but it seemed few people understood the benefits. — BREAD | ∑: (@0xBreadguy) March 27, 2025 Previously, Safe Wallet offered similar services to screen out bad addresses but proved insufficient in the case of the Bybit hack . Users urged to remove Harpie from all Web3 wallets Former users of Harpie may see their transactions failing. The team warned users to disconnect their wallet from the service manually. In the coming days, the Web3 security tool will also put a withdrawal service on its website for any remaining vaulted assets. Influencers that have promoted the service on social media are now warning their audience to remove the tool from any Web3 wallets. The rapid shutdown of Harpie caught the crypto community by surprise, as the project was active with promotion and its airdrop seasons until the last. Harpie was in the middle of a point farming period, where users scanned their wallets for threats. The project also ran an influencer campaign and a referral program. Before finally shutting down, Harpie will distribute all airdrop awards and bonuses from its referral program. It is a tokenless protocol, so no assets were affected by the shutdown. Harpie launched during the 2022 bear market, aiming to offer utility for Web3 services. The project managed to raise $4.5M, with backing from Coinbase Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, and Opensea Ventures. After the shutdown, the space is looking at alternative tools for wallet protection . Those include GoPlus Security and Kerberus Sentinel3. Former Harpie users claim the app flagged a wider list of threats, which not even the OKX Web3 wallet and Rabby could intercept. There is still demand for wallet protection, as heists target individual addresses with malicious links. Blacklisting and warnings are key for preventing Web3 scams and phishing. Crypto projects also face extinction Harpie’s removal coincides with two more projects wrapping up their activity. Vite Labs and Linear Finance announced they would also abandon support and shut down services after their assets were delisted from Binance. These service shutdowns happen at a time when some projects continue to persist despite having no viable product. Meanwhile , a handful of previously hot products have completely stopped operating. Those include multiple Web3 games and SocialFi products like Friend.tech. Several NFT markets also did not survive the 2022-2023 bearish period. Just days ago, the Moccosi NFT project also announced it is shutting down due to insufficient user interest. However, the Harpie service was widely used and applicable, as users were still mining points in the last few days.

They are a Utah-based fintech with a “cash to crypto” platform that offers a crypto debit card, free instant international P2P, and crypto trading. With thousands of customers using the CoinZoom Visa debit card across 50 countries, the data shows something remarkable: 51.5% of all CoinZoom Visa transactions are completed using crypto directly from users’ wallets. Tether (USDT) is the #1 spending cryptocurrency, followed by Bitcoin (BTC). That’s a significant shift in consumer behavior – and a clear sign that crypto is breaking through as a true medium of exchange, not just a speculative asset. From Coffee to Cross-Border Payments: Crypto is Being Spent Everywhere Everyday purchases like coffee, transportation, and groceries are now being made in crypto. And it’s not just the big names. While USDT and BTC dominate, other top-spending cryptocurrencies this year include XRP and Litecoin (LTC) – showing just how broad and flexible people are in choosing what to spend. In fact, CoinZoom users have tapped into an impressive mix of coins in their wallets to make purchases. Top Cryptocurrencies Spent: BTC | ETH | USDT | XLM | LTC | PEPE | DOGE | HNT | XRP | USDC | SOL | HBAR | SHIB | UNI | AVAX | AAVE | TRX | TUSD | MATIC | LINK | ADA | TRUMP | XTZ | EOS This usage signals that customers are making informed choices about which currencies to spend, depending on transaction type, timing, or market conditions. In many cases, they’re even spending small “dust” balances — using every coin in their wallet to their advantage. Whether it’s micro-transactions under $10 or major purchases like flights and electronics, crypto is being used globally as real spending power. Todd Crosland, CEO and Co-Founder of CoinZoom, said, “This data really questions the contention that crypto has no role as a 'means of exchange'. Our customers have demonstrated month on month that having a 'blended wallet' with both cash and crypto gives them real power and choice. Since we launched our metal card for our Black Account holders, they have been getting over $300 a month in free crypto rewards, so this is a win, win, win for the future of payments.” About CoinZoom CoinZoom is a U.S.-based financial platform enabling users worldwide to send, spend, save, and invest seamlessly. As a U.S.-registered Money Services Business and Money Transmitter, CoinZoom is available in 45 states and operates with a SOC2 Type II Certification, recognized for stringent security standards.

This change in mood has led market participants to revisit familiar names, including SHIB. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction indicates a gradual increase, as opposed to sudden spikes. However, the significant opportunity may lie with BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its BDAG800 promotion, giving an additional 400% in coins, is concluding soon, prompting a rush among purchasers. Those who acquired BDAG early experienced a rise of 2,380%, and as the price increases with each release, BDAG is fast becoming the top crypto to buy before prices rise further. Stellar (XLM) Price Rally Bolstered by Legal Victory Following the dismissal of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the Stellar (XLM) price rally has accelerated, rejuvenating enthusiasm in related currencies. In just 24 hours, XLM’s price jumped by 11%, breaking through a significant resistance level at $0.29, igniting talk of a further 60% increase. Trading volume soared by 135% in the same timeframe, indicating a resurgence of interest. Analysts are keenly observing, with targets placed at $0.37 and $0.48. As technical indicators align and leveraged positions increase, the Stellar (XLM) price rally could persist if bullish momentum continues. Shiba Inu Price Outlook: Will SHIB Maintain Its Drive? The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction for the upcoming months remains measured, with analysts forecasting a stable ascent rather than abrupt increases. Currently, SHIB trades at $0.0000129, with potential to reach $0.0000279 if the market conditions stay favorable. Yet, a jump to $0.50 in the next 30 days is considered highly unlikely given the token’s vast circulating supply. The ongoing development of Shibarium and steady community backing are vital in maintaining SHIB’s attractiveness. With sustained upward pressure, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction suggests a steady climb rather than rapid surges. Final Days to Claim BlockDAG’s 400% Coin Bonus as Prices Rise The countdown is on for BlockDAG’s BDAG800 bonus, which is quickly approaching its conclusion, taking with it the most substantial reward offered during BlockDAG’s presale. This fleeting offer grants a 400% bonus in BDAG coins, turning a $2,000 purchase into $10,000 in BDAG coins. This is a crucial moment to secure the highest possible returns before the next price increase, as the opportunity for early-stage benefits begins to fade. Overlooking this chance might mean missing out on one of the year’s most lucrative entry points into the crypto market. Since the start of its presale, BDAG has seen an increase of 2,380%, escalating from $0.001 to $0.0248 through 27 releases. Such performance is rare, particularly in presale phases. The figures speak volumes—over 18.9 billion coins have been sold, with the crypto presale amassing $207 million and attracting over 170,000 holders. It’s clear why BlockDAG is now seen as a top crypto to buy, particularly for those who recognize how early momentum can lead to tangible gains. Looking forward, analysts predict a promising trajectory that could elevate BDAG to $1 by 2025 and possibly $30 by 2030. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, these forecasts underscore the potential benefits of early participation. However, as each new batch is released, prices are climbing, and once the BDAG800 bonus concludes, such an opportunity for significant value addition may not reappear. Final Thoughts As excitement grows, the Stellar (XLM) price rally continues to capture interest, with many anticipating a significant breakthrough past pivotal resistance points. Shifting to meme coins, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction suggests a steady, community-supported growth in the near future. Yet, the most compelling prospect at the moment is BlockDAG (BDAG). Its presale has already generated substantial gains, and with just a few days remaining to claim the BDAG800 bonus—which provides a 400% boost in coins—new participants are swiftly taking action to capitalize on the early benefits. Currently available at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, BDAG still presents considerable growth potential, making it a standout choice for those searching for the top crypto to buy ahead of the next price surge.

After a steady climb, the price now stands at a decisive point—will buyers have enough strength to push through, or will sellers step in to defend this barrier once again? Recent price action suggests that positive sentiment is gaining traction, with increasing trading volumes and strong support levels forming beneath. However, past attempts to breach $2.82 have resulted in pullbacks, making this level a significant test for the market. A confirmed breakout could trigger a fresh rally to higher targets, while failure to overcome this hurdle may lead to renewed selling pressure. Chart Patterns And Technical Indicators: Signs Of A Breakout? SUI price action is showing promising signs of an impending breakout as it continues to test the critical $2.82 resistance level. Looking closer at the chart reveals the formation of bullish ascending candlesticks, a pattern characterized by higher lows and a steady resistance ceiling. This structure suggests that buyers are building momentum, increasing the likelihood of an upward breakout. Related Reading: SUI Poised For Price Rally? Ascending Channel Suggests Move Toward $2.50 Technical indicators further support this outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above 50, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has shown a bullish crossover. Additionally, trading volume is rising, a key factor often preceding a breakout move. The price has also broken above the bearish trendline, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. This breakout suggests that selling pressure is weakening, allowing buyers to regain control. A successful breakout from a bearish trendline usually indicates the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a possible upward movement. If SUI surpasses the critical $2.82 resistance level with a strong trading volume, it could ignite a significant rally, pushing the price toward $3.50 and beyond. Breaking above this level would indicate that buyers have gained control, invalidating previous resistance and setting the stage for further upside momentum. Rejection And Possible Pullback Levels For SUI While SUI’s bullish strength is building, the $2.82 resistance remains a formidable barrier, and failure to break above it might lead to a downside move. If buyers fail to sustain momentum, sellers may step in, triggering a rejection that could send the price back toward key support levels. Related Reading: SUI Bearish Grip Tightens As Price Eyes $2.8 Retest Amid Market Pressure The first critical support to watch lies around $2.36, a level where buyers previously defended against deeper declines. If selling pressure intensifies, SUI could drop toward $1.59. A break below this level may expose the price to deeper corrections, with $1.42 acting as a crucial defense zone for bulls.

42482029,https://blockworks.co/news/grayscale-memecoins-impact-crypto,1743084273,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,How memecoins impacted crypto last quarter: Grayscale,https://blockworks.co/news/grayscale-memecoins-impact-crypto,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . So no one’s surprised that the first quarter of the year wasn’t exactly a stellar one, right? (If it makes you feel better, tech stocks also sank, according to Grayscale’s Research Insights .) Overall, the crypto sector’s price index fell 18% during the quarter, which ended on March 21. Source: All charts from Grayscale If you break it up by segments, “Consumer & Culture” had it bad. Some memecoins — like DOGE — were included in this segment, which helps explain the dramatic decline. A look at Solana active users That’s also the case for smart contract platforms, because Solana’s pretty popular with the memes. But despite the slowdown, Solana still managed to generate roughly half of the estimated total fees for the segment ($390 million) last quarter. If folks continue to lose interest in memecoins throughout this quarter, then — as Lightspeed’s Jack Kubinec noted earlier this week — “Solana’s validators, stakers and probably even token holders are in for some harder days ahead.” The flipside is that it perhaps allows for some expectation resets and, if we’re going to stay narrative-driven, then maybe a new interest can take the place of memecoins. Or perhaps it has already, given the fresh conversations around stablecoins and RWAs. Grayscale’s Research team even noted that, for the current quarter, they’re focused on tokens tied to RWAs and DePIN. Funny that. Specifically, they’re looking at Maple and Geodnet. Both should be familiar to our readers, given that Geodnet is one that Ryan Connor of Blockworks Research previously told Empire readers to watch, and we talked about bitcoin margin loans with Maple CEO Sid Powell a few months back. On the other hand, despite the negativity last quarter, bitcoin network activity measures were “generally healthy,” analysts noted. Always look on the bright side, right? “In contrast, monthly active onchain users were about unchanged from the prior quarter, at 11 million. The growing difference between these two indicators suggests that recent demand for bitcoin has likely come from users interested in its function as a ‘store of value’ rather than a ‘medium of exchange,’” they wrote. Outside of bitcoin, RWAs and DePINs, the analysts continue to keep an eye on DeFi and staking solutions, Ethereum scaling solutions, and the intersection of crypto and AI.

However, the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant says these funds are currently at a critical turning point, especially with BTC’s price reacting to macroeconomic uncertainty. In a series of tweets, CryptoQuant explained that institutions and individuals who invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs are reshuffling their funds and de-risking because of the macro environment’s unfavorable state. The firm elaborated on the market’s state using four charts. ETFs at Turning Point The first chart shows a drawdown from Bitcoin ETFs’ all-time high (ATH). According to it, flows into these funds have reversed sharply since the beginning of the year. The BTC investment products saw a strong accumulation phase in the last few months of 2024 and the first few weeks of 2025; however, the chart shows a 12% drawdown (nearly $5 billion in withdrawals) from the ATH. At this point, the outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs are no longer minor, as seen on multiple occasions last year. The second chart compares the net cumulative inflows into the spot ETFs by year. Steady growth in 2024 drove the inflows to $30 billion. While 2025 started strong, inflows have stalled and reversed , falling into negative territory. In the third chart, it is evident that daily net flows into the ETFs are stabilizing after several weeks of outflows; however, there is neither strong demand nor supply. This shows that the flows are currently in a choppy state and could easily head in positive or negative directions. Flows Are Stabilizing From the last chart, it can be seen that spot Bitcoin ETF holders are still in profit despite the massive outflows witnessed in the previous weeks. This chart shows the realized price of ETF holders, which refers to their average cost basis. Data from CoinMarketCap shows BTC changing hands at below $87,000 at press time. With the ETF Realized Price hovering around $72,546, investors are sitting on an average unrealized profit of 17%. With Bitcoin ETF flows becoming more positive with time, investors may soon be sitting on more unrealized profits. The funds have already witnessed inflows exceeding $800 million in the last eight trading days. Meanwhile, BTC is up 2.4% weekly after trading range-bound in the past few days.

Let’s unpack what’s really fueling these moves in a fragile market. Table of Contents Markets on the edge AltLayer (ALT) Linear Finance (LINA) Avalon Labs (AVL) Delysium (AGI) Smooth Love Potion (SLP) FAQs Markets on the edge As of Mar. 27, the crypto market is undergoing a period of heightened volatility amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading near $87,000, reflecting a modest 2% gain over the past week. However, this comes after a broader pullback from BTC’s January 2024 peak of approximately $109,000, signaling a cautious outlook rather than a sustained uptrend. Ethereum ( ETH ), by contrast, is struggling to hold above the critical $2,000 support level. Currently priced at $2,013, ETH has declined nearly 40% since the start of the year, marking one of its weakest openings in recent memory. The drop has also pushed the ETH/BTC ratio to its lowest point since 2020, indicating a shift in investor preference toward Bitcoin over riskier altcoins. Meanwhile, the global crypto market cap has declined to around $2.84 trillion, down roughly 21% from its January level of $3.60 trillion. Recent developments such as tariff threats and signs of economic fragility have contributed to a risk-off environment, with investors gravitating toward perceived safe-haven assets within the crypto space, primarily Bitcoin. Against this backdrop, let’s take a closer look at some of the top trending cryptos that offer insight into how different assets are performing, what’s driving investor interest, and how underlying project fundamentals are holding up in a cooling market. You might also like: Top 10 cryptos to buy for winning in a Bitcoin bear market AltLayer (ALT) AltLayer ( ALT ) is trading near $0.04, marking an 11% gain over the past week. It has outperformed the broader crypto market during this period, recently breaking out of a downtrend amid a notable increase in trading volume. AltLayer is a layer-2 scaling platform that provides “rollups-as-a-service,” enabling developers to deploy custom blockchain rollups on Ethereum or other base chains. These rollups are designed to handle high transaction volumes more efficiently and at lower cost, easing congestion on the main network. The platform supports both optimistic and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups and incorporates a “restaking” model—reusing staked ETH to help secure the rollup chains, adding an additional layer of security for projects launching decentralized applications such as games or DeFi protocols, without relying heavily on Ethereum’s base layer. ALT’s recent performance has been driven by renewed interest in Ethereum scaling solutions, along with favorable technical signals. On-chain data reinforces this momentum. Active addresses and trading activity increased around AltLayer’s recent token unlock on Mar. 25, when 240 million ALT — approximately 8.6% of the total supply — was released. While such events often introduce selling pressure, the price has remained stable, suggesting investor confidence in the project’s long-term prospects. ALT’s sustained traction will depend on AltLayer’s ability to execute on its roadmap and attract more decentralized applications to its ecosystem. For now, ALT stands out as a small-cap altcoin gaining attention within the growing layer-2 market. Linear Finance (LINA) Linear Finance (LINA) is currently trading near $0.0005616 after plunging nearly 70% over the past week. On Mar. 27, it recorded a new all-time low following a sharp sell-off, marking one of the steepest declines among major tokens in an otherwise mixed market. Linear Finance is a decentralized finance platform focused on synthetic assets. The protocol allows users to create and trade tokens that replicate the value of real-world assets, including commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies. Users deposit collateral to mint ℓUSD, a platform-native stablecoin , which can then be exchanged for various synthetic assets within Linear’s ecosystem. The LINA token serves multiple roles within the protocol. It is used for governance, staking, and as collateral backing the synthetics. The recent collapse in LINA’s price appears closely tied to a delisting announcement from Binance . The exchange stated it would remove all LINA trading pairs by Mar. 28, citing low liquidity as part of a broader review of underperforming assets. The decision triggered a wave of selling, amplified by concerns over Linear’s user engagement and platform activity. In response, the Linear Finance team announced it will cease operations, citing sustained financial difficulties and an unsustainable funding model. The decision was accelerated by Binance’s delisting of LINA, which sharply reduced the project’s remaining runway. Notice of Closure After careful consideration, Linear Finance has made the difficult decision to cease operations. Despite our ongoing efforts to innovate and build throughout the years, the project has struggled to generate sustainable returns. Outside of a brief period of… — Linear Finance (@LinearFinance) March 27, 2025 Avalon Labs (AVL) As of this writing, Avalon Labs (AVL) is trading near $0.44, reflecting a 7% increase over the past week. Despite being down roughly 70% from its early February high of $1.44, the token remains over 90% above its launch-month lows. Avalon’s market capitalization stands at approximately $69 million, supported by steady trading activity across exchanges. Avalon Labs positions AVL as the foundational token of a Bitcoin-focused DeFi ecosystem. The platform is building an on-chain financial infrastructure tailored for Bitcoin holders, offering services such as BTC-collateralized loans, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin called USDa, yield-bearing savings products, and a crypto credit card linked to Bitcoin reserves. The underlying idea is to enable Bitcoin holders to make their assets productive — whether by borrowing against BTC, earning yield, or minting stablecoins — through a decentralized and scalable framework. Originally known for issuing the largest volume of BTC-backed collateralized debt positions, Avalon has since evolved into a broader suite of DeFi services for Bitcoin users. Its recent traction can be traced to several high-profile developments. In early March, Avalon Labs secured a credit facility exceeding $2 billion from a consortium of prominent Asian firms to strengthen its BTC lending operations. One of the largest capital injections in the crypto lending space to date, this facility provides Avalon with significant liquidity and suggests growing institutional interest in Bitcoin-backed financial products. More recently, on Mar. 27, Avalon announced integration with BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (ticker: BUIDL). The partnership enables yield from U.S. Treasuries to be incorporated into Avalon’s USDa stablecoin. Avalon Labs Announces Support for BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund Avalon Labs has officially announced its support for @BlackRock 's BUIDL Fund, launched through the Securitize platform. The firm will integrate RWA yields into its yield-bearing Bitcoin stablecoin, $sUSDa . By holding… pic.twitter.com/dQrcEdQKJR — Avalon Labs 🎩🔮 (@avalonfinance_) March 27, 2025 As a result, users minting USDa can now earn passive income from both crypto-based and traditional assets, further aligning DeFi with real-world financial instruments. Although AVL has retreated from its earlier speculative highs, the recent developments suggest that its core fundamentals are improving. This may help explain the token’s relative resilience amid broader market volatility. Delysium (AGI) Delysium (AGI) — distinct from SingularityNET ( AGIX ) — is currently trading around $0.12, following a sharp rally. Over the past week, AGI has gained nearly 18%, making it one of the few notable outperformers amid a generally weak altcoin market. Just two weeks ago, the token was fluctuating between $0.06 and $0.07. Delysium positions itself as an AI -powered virtual world and gaming ecosystem. At its core is a metaverse concept where artificial intelligence agents and human players interact in a shared environment. The platform features AI-driven characters and digital assistants — such as “Lucy” — as well as the YKILY Network (“You Know I Love You”), which appears to function as an AI-based social layer within the game. The project outlines an ambitious long-term vision: a virtual society comprising one billion human users and 100 billion AI agents. AGI serves as the native token supporting this ecosystem. While specific token utility details are still evolving, it is expected to power in-game transactions, reward participants, and potentially serve governance functions as the platform decentralizes. Backing from major technology firms has also added to Delysium’s visibility. The project has reported funding or support from companies such as Microsoft, Google, and NVIDIA — an unusual level of institutional attention for a GameFi initiative. In January 2025, the team launched “Delysium ONE,” a product designed to support the broader adoption of AI agents on-chain. As AI continues to dominate broader tech conversations, crypto projects with credible AI components have drawn renewed attention. In this context, Delysium is seen as one of the more substantive entries in the AI-GameFi space. Smooth Love Potion (SLP) Smooth Love Potion (SLP) is currently trading at approximately $0.0018, reflecting a marginal 1% gain over the past week. The token has remained within a narrow range between $0.0017 and $0.0019, and continues to trade more than 99% below its all-time high reached during the peak of the Axie Infinity ( AXS ) boom in 2021. SLP functions as the in-game reward currency for Axie Infinity, one of the earliest and most recognizable play-to-earn blockchain games. Players earn SLP by engaging in battles using digital pets called Axies, with the primary utility of the token being the breeding of new Axies—a process that consumes SLP in the game economy. However, the token is infinitely mintable through user activity, making it structurally inflationary. During the height of Axie’s adoption, strong demand temporarily supported SLP’s price, pushing it close to $0.42, but once user growth slowed, token supply quickly outpaced demand, leading to a prolonged decline. It’s important to understand that SLP is not a governance token or traditional investment asset. Rather, it operates more like arcade tickets — its value is tied directly to its in-game use and the level of player engagement within Axie Infinity. In recent weeks, SLP has attracted renewed attention, largely driven by updates to the Axie ecosystem aimed at revitalizing player activity. Most notably, Axie Infinity: Classic (Season 8) launched this month, reintroducing SLP rewards for players. These rewards had previously been reduced or removed from certain game modes in an attempt to limit inflation, but community feedback prompted the team to restore them in the Classic version. Outside of these game-specific updates, SLP has limited exposure to the broader crypto development space. Its performance is almost entirely dependent on changes within Axie Infinity’s gameplay structure, reward mechanisms, and community activity. FAQs What crypto is trending right now?

The incident, developed on March 26, sparked debates about decentralization and market integrity in crypto. The drama unfolded when a trader exploited Hyperliquid’s system, forcing the platform to reimburse most users via the Hyper Foundation. This swift action followed suspicious activity that rattled the decentralized exchange’s native token, HYPE , and its Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP). Essentially, the trader opened a $6 million short position on JELLYJELLY, as detailed by several media outlets. They then pumped the Solana-based memecoin’s price on-chain, surging it over 400%, according to Arkham Intelligence .

Neuner criticized how institutions like OKX and Binance dealt with the issues, highlighting the differences on how they dealt with Bybit’s hack. “Today’s reaction from @okx and @binance was appalling and a clear declaration of war between CEX and DEX. Unlike when @Bybit_Official was hacked and all the CEX’s chimed in to help, this time their mission was to destroy! I expected more from two leading companies in the crypto world where we should all be fighting for decentralization.” HYPE price analysis HYPE, Hyperliquid’s base token, is trading at $14.10 by press time, down 26.24% in a month. The downfall is marked by a sharp drop yesterday, following the drama that developed around the platform. This echoes a prior $4 million HLP loss earlier in March, signaling recurring vulnerabilities. Hyperliquid (HYPE) price chart.Source: Finbold Critics, including Arhur Hayes, co-founder of BitMex, called Hyperliquid’s decentralization “fake,” predicting further HYPE price declines. Hyperliquid’s response averted a deeper crisis, but the drama exposes flaws in high-leverage DeFi trading. Centralized exchanges like Binance and OKX listing JELLY futures, as @daynnightclub posted , may intensify pressure. While refunds soften the blow, trust in Hyperliquid’s model hangs in the balance—true decentralization remains an elusive goal in this volatile space.

As of March 27, the Federal Bureau of Prisons website showed Bankman-Fried was being housed at the Federal Transfer Center (FTC) in Oklahoma City, suggesting that he may be moved from the facility where he largely spent the majority of his time awaiting trial and moving forward with an appeal of his conviction. Carlson remotely interviewed SBF from the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn on March 5 — a reportedly unsanctioned event that resulted in the former FTX CEO being sent to solitary confinement. Former FTX CEO’s status as of March 27. Source: US Bureau of Prisons The reason for the move to the Oklahoma transit facility was unclear. After Bankman-Fried’s 2023 conviction on seven felony charges and 2024 sentencing to 25 years in prison, a federal judge recommended that the former CEO remain in the New York area to assist during his appeals process. He was briefly transferred to FTC Oklahoma City in May 2024 before being returned to MDC Brooklyn. Bankman-Fried has been housed in various facilities since a judge revoked his bail in August 2023 following allegations the former CEO attempted to intimidate witnesses before his criminal trial. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, he was set to be released in November 2044 but could serve less time based on his behavior in prison.

Over the past week, the price has shown a 6.63% increase, hinting at a potential recovery. However, the monthly trend remains negative, with a 14.05% decline, indicating underlying bearish pressure. The market is at a turning point—will bulls push the price higher, or will sellers regain control? Key Price Levels: The Battle Between Buyers and Sellers VeChain (VET) movement in the coming days will depend on whether key support and resistance levels hold or break. Support Levels (Where Buyers May Defend the Price) $0.0258 – A critical level that has held as support in recent sessions. $0.0252 – If selling pressure increases, this is the next zone to watch. $0.0243 – A deeper support that, if broken, could trigger more downside. Resistance Levels (Where Sellers May Step In) $0.0285 – A key level; breaking above could trigger more bullish momentum. $0.0326 – A strong resistance that has rejected price movements in the past. $0.0382 – A breakout above this would confirm a shift to bullish dominance. Market Indicators: What the Charts Are Revealing Bullish Harami Cross: A candlestick pattern suggesting potential reversal, but confirmation is needed. Elliott Wave Projection: A potential transition from corrective movement to a new upward trend. Fibonacci Analysis: The 38.2% retracement level at $0.0285 aligns with resistance, making it a key decision point. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Predicted Price Action for the Next Week Based on technical signals, there are two likely scenarios: Bullish Breakout: If VET maintains support at $0.0258 and pushes above $0.0285, it could gain momentum toward $0.0326. Increased volume and positive market sentiment would fuel this move. Bearish Continuation: If the price fails to hold above $0.0258, sellers may push it down to $0.0243. A breakdown here could indicate further downside. A Defining Week for VeChain (VET) VeChain (VET) is approaching a decisive moment . The next breakout or breakdown will dictate the short-term trend.

However, ETH is set to face major resistance at $2,100, a level which it needs to break out from as it targets new highs. Ethereum Price Faces Major Resistance At $2,100 In a TradingView post, Ben Gray revealed that the Ethereum price is facing a key resistance level at $2,160 even as it eyes a rally to new highs. Despite this development, the analyst asserted that ETH’s market is bullish. While noting that the leading altcoin is fluctuating between $2,044 and $2,080, he remarked that there are signs that Ethereum initially formed a bottom. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Mirroring Bitcoin’s 2018-2021 Cycle Amid Record Selling Based on his analysis of the 4-hour candlestick chart, Gray stated that the Ethereum price is attempting to break through upwards, with the key resistance level at $2,160. He further showed his optimism for ETH in 2025 by stating that the expected range is between $2,904 and $4,887, although that puts the altcoin below its current all-time high (ATH). Meanwhile, the crypto analyst mentioned that the Ethereum price has shown a strong and positive performance this week. Going forward, he stated that the key focus should be on whether ETH can break through the resistance level of $2,160, which would play a key role in determining the altcoin’s trajectory in the short and mid-term. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently highlighted the $2,300 level as another resistance level to watch out for the Ethereum price. He noted that with ETH reclaiming $2,040, the next key hurdle is this $2,300 level, where the pricing bands suggest strong resistance. Why ETH Has Bottomed In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Ethereum price is showing signs of bottoming. He revealed that the weekly Stochastic RSI bullish crossover is in oversold territory, a development that has often signaled market bottoms for ETH. His accompanying chart showed that the leading altcoin could rally to as high as $6,000 as it records a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum, Dogecoin, And The Altcoin Market: Why Up-Only For 217 Days Is Possible Crypto analyst Crypto Caesar also stated that the Ethereum price is currently bottoming out and that ETH is “heavily undervalued.” He added that in every bull cycle, there is always a moment when most market participants think that the altcoin will never recover after a big bearish event. However, Ethereum always recovers and ends up making new highs. As such, the analyst believes this time won’t be different, and ETH is ready to stage a bullish reversal. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,022, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Table of Contents ADA is in a short-term uptrend Cardano ignites interest Solaxy is making waves: Next 100X crypto? Is it too late to buy SOLX in the presale? Cardano (ADA) just broke key resistance levels to cross $0.7. The move has sparked optimism among crypto investors. The new milestone hints at a potential breakout that could further gain strength in a favourable broader market. With the market still unpredictable, can the ADA price keep up the momentum? You might also like: Solaxy ICO races past $15m, prepares to explode like Solana ADA is in a short-term uptrend Technical indicators give a mixed outlook for the ADA price, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently at 60. It suggests that the asset is closing in on overbought conditions. However, the Cardano price has yet to touch that, leaving room for returns for those who take quick actions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows the MACD line slightly above the signal line. Although it indicates a potential bullish trend, the Average Directional Index (ADX) points to a weak trend strength at 20. ADA is trading above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.725, strengthening the bullish sentiment. However, it is slightly below the 200-day SMA of $0.750. This means bullish confirmation has yet to be established.​ ADA appears to be in a consolidation phase with a slight bullish bias. In the large bearish market, it remains to be seen if ADA can defy the broader trends. The positive sentiment around Cardano will grow stronger if the altcoin manages to rise above the 200-day SMA. But if it slips below the 50-day SMA, bearish sentiments will take over. Cardano ignites interest It is unlikely that the Cardano price will make a major move until the crypto market recovers. Long-term investors are still confident in the altcoin’s potential. The reason is the ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem. If the network continues to launch upgrades, including the Hydra scaling solution, it could further expand its user base. Improvements to the smart contract functionality are also expected to boost adoption and create sustained demand for ADA. Institutional investments could provide a long-term boost to the project once the market gets back on its feet. A major challenge ahead for the ADA price is its slow pace of development. Competition from new blockchains poses a threat to its adoption. The fact that Ethereum and Solana are improving doesn’t help either. While Ethereum has long had layer-2 solutions, scalability innovation is also happening on the Solana network. Solaxy (SOLX) is a layer-2 solution dedicated to Solana. With the network development progressing rapidly, early investors are flocking to the SOLX presale before it hits major exchanges. The token presale just broke the $28 million milestone. Solaxy is making waves: Next 100X crypto? Solaxy is designed to tackle network congestion and failed transactions on Solana. It makes this possible by processing transactions off the main chain and finalizing them on the mainnet. The system will improve Solana’s efficiency without compromising security. It is predicted to be a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem, especially during busy markets. Solaxy is being compared to industry leaders like Arbitrum and Optimism. While these crypto giants cater to the Ethereum ecosystem, Solaxy is the first of its kind dedicated to Solana. Solaxy is currently under development. The scaling solution is set to go live after the presale and the debut exchange launch of SOLX. Regular updates from the team have strengthened investor confidence. Solaxy has set aside 30% of its total token supply to build the scaling solution. 15% is allocated for marketing efforts to drive product adoption and token awareness. According to industry experts like Austin Hilton, Solaxy could be big, judging by its presale momentum and tech backing. Is it too late to buy SOLX in the presale? The SOLX presale will be live for a few more days. But the presale price increases with each new phase. SOLX, the native token of the Solaxy ecosystem, is used for a wide range of purposes. For example, it will fuel transaction fees and other payments. Investors can stake the token starting from the presale phase to earn passive income. In addition, token holders will have governance rights. The passive income program aims to encourage long-term holding.

The recent rejection from the $88,000 resistance level raises questions about whether BTC price could drop further over the next few days. BTC/USD four-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Could Trump’s tariffs drive Bitcoin prices lower? On March 26, 2025, President Trump announced a 25% tariff on all cars and light trucks imported into the US, set to take effect on April 3. Market participants are concerned this might trigger another sell-off in cryptocurrencies, pushing prices lower. Key takeaways: The 25% tariff on automobile imports targets major trading partners like Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Germany. While Trump touts this as a boon for the American automotive industry, the immediate fallout will likely rattle global markets. For instance, when Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China in early March, Bitcoin dropped from $105,000 to $92,000 overnight before partially recovering. These broader auto tariffs could amplify this effect, especially as markets brace for retaliatory measures from affected nations. Commenting on the current risk-asset landscape, trading firm QCP Capital emphasized the effects of US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, saying that they could escalate trade tensions. “Any further retaliation from these target economies risks injecting a fresh wave of uncertainty into an already volatile global trade landscape,” it wrote in a Telegram note to investors. QCP also pointed out that “sentiment remains subdued despite headline-grabbing catalysts” such as GME’s surprise $1.3 billion capital raise for potential Bitcoin purchases. The only positive catalyst is the steady inflow into spot BTC ETFs , totaling $944.9 million since March 11, adding: “This presents a telling divergence that reflects the market’s bifurcated institutional conviction.” Bitcoin could drop further on waning demand Demand for Bitcoin remains relatively low, implying a decline in risk appetite for potential investors, according to market intelligence firm Glassnode. Related: Bitcoin price prediction markets bet BTC won't go higher than $138K in 2025 What to know: This week’s onchain report from Glassnode highlights a contraction in Bitcoin’s demand measured by assessing the volume of realized profit and loss locked in by investors. This provides important information on the sell-side forces occurring across spot markets. Bitcoin’s combined realized profit and loss volumes have “experienced a major contraction” since the all-time high above $109,000 , collapsing by 85% from $3.4 billion to $508 million on March 26. This metric is now at similar levels seen during the 2024 accumulation zone between $50,000 and $70,00, suggesting a similar demand profile. Bitcoin: Absolute realized profit and realized loss. Source: Glassnode Sustainable bull markets are typically characterized by consistent and growing inflows of fresh capital entering the network (capital inflow from new investors). The difference between long-term holder (LTH) profit taking and short-term holder (STH) loss realization has dropped sharply since the $109,000 record high and returned to a “neutral zone.” This means that an equivalent volume of STH losses is now offsetting LTH profits, the report explained, adding: “This suggests a relative stagnation in new capital inflows, weaker demand-side forces, and a slowing but still meaningful volume of profit taking acting as resistance.” Bitcoin: Difference between LTH realized profit and STH realized losses. Source: Glassnode Glassnode concludes that while the STH cohort is dominating losses taken, the LTH cohort is transitioning back into a period of accumulation, which could be a precursor to Bitcoin’s recovery. “We expect their aggregate supply to grow in the coming weeks and months as a result.” As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin LTHs continued to hold profits despite the recent sell-off, indicating a strong belief that the bull market rally would eventually resume. Key Bitcoin levels to watch Traders are now focused on key areas around the $88,000 level. Notably: Bitcoin's key levels to watch immediately on the downside are the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $85,500 and the major support at around $82,700. The first area of interest lies between two recent range lows: $81,138 (formed on March 18) and $76,600 (formed on March 11). BTC will potentially target the liquidity cluster around these levels if support at $82,000 is lost. An immediate reprieve for the bulls would be a sharp reversal from this range, indicating buying interest below the 200-day SMA. If support is lost, BTC could test the next area of interest between $72,200 and $74,500 before filling the fair gap below it toward $70,000. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The chart above also shows a key resistance zone between $88,700 and $92,000 (where the 50-day and 100-day SMA currently sit). Overcoming this barrier would confirm the end of the downtrend as bulls set their eyes on $100,000 and beyond. Popular analyst Decode said the 20-weekly exponential moving average (EMA) at $88,600 is the “most important level right now for Bitcoin.” For co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, Keith Alan, Bitcoin has to reclaim the 2025 yearly open at around $93,300 to confirm a continuation of the bull cycle.

Moves to the upside are limited, and at present, involve multiple unsuccessful attempts to breach local resistance levels before a decisive break ultimately occurs. The leading cryptocurrency, which was trading at $86,470 at press time, is down 9.74% since the start of the year. BTC price year-to-date (YTD) chart. Source: Finbold Prices have bounced off of resistance between $88,470 and $88,200 three times in the past week, while a level of support has been established in the $86,220 to $86,460 range. Despite the occasional spike in short positions , data suggests that long-term BTC holders, who have significantly reduced their liquidations since the start of the year, maintain a strongly bullish outlook. On the whole, however, sentiments surrounding BTC’s near-term prospects remain mixed. A closer look at the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart could reveal additional insights. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart analysis The Bitcoin Rainbow chart is a visual tool that leverages a logarithmic growth curve overlaid over price action to describe investor sentiment. It is divided into nine color-coded zones, each of which corresponds to a specific price range at any given time. These descriptively-named color-coded zones range from ‘Bitcoin is dead’ at the low end to ‘Maximum Bubble Territory.’ At present, prices are at the higher end of the fourth zone from the bottom, in the ‘Still Cheap’ zone. A move above $92,411 would place the cryptocurrency in the ‘ HODL !’ zone. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart zone distribution on April 30, 2025. Source: Blockchain Center So, what can the colorful logarithmic growth curves of the Bitcoin rainbow chart tell us? For BTC to stay in the ‘Still Cheap’ zone on April 30, it would have to trade in the $73,358 to $95,164 range. Those two figures correspond to a 15.16% downside and 10.05% upside, respectively. Should sentiment turn more bullish, the cryptocurrency could find itself in the ‘HODL!’ zone — which would equate to the $95,164 to $125,174 range at the end of April. In contrast, if the digital asset’s price falls below $73,358 by that point, a more attractive opportunity for investors looking to go long will have appeared. What is the most likely outcome? Since the start of the year, BTC has been either in the ‘Still Cheap’ or ‘HODL’ zones. In addition, both breaking above local resistance and even retesting the asset’s all-time high (ATH) price of roughly $108,000 would place it firmly within the ‘HODL!’ zone. Therefore, the $95,164 to $125,174 range appears to be the most realistic forecast for April 30.

Solana ( SOL ), the sixth-biggest player in the crypto industry, was trading at $140 on Thursday, down by over 50% from its highest point this year. The recent rally ended after Donald Trump surprised markets by announcing sweeping tariffs targeting the automobile sector. These tariffs have triggered concern among market participants due to their scale and potential economic impact. Some analysts caution that his upcoming Liberation Day tariffs will lead to a recession in the US. This explains why Bitcoin ( BTC ), altcoins, and the stock market dropped on Thursday. You might also like: Pi Network price crash intensifies: Can Pi coin rebound? Solana has faced ongoing headwinds in recent months as concerns about its broader ecosystem linger. Many Solana-based meme coins have crashed, largely due to insider exits, leaving retail investors holding the bag. This meme coin collapse has negatively impacted Solana’s decentralized exchange (DeX) ecosystem and its network fees. According to DeFi Llama, Solana’s DeX platforms processed over $8.7 billion in assets in the last seven days, much lower than Ethereum and BSC Chain handled. On the positive side, there are signs that some meme coins are crawling back. Bonk has jumped by 20% in the last seven days, while Fartcoin, Popcat, Cat in a dogs world, Gigachad, and Book of Meme have surged by over 10% in the same period. Solana price technical analysis SOL price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows SOL is still at risk of a deeper bearish breakdown. On February 25, the token formed a death cross pattern, when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossed, a widely watched bearish signal. More recently, SOL has formed a bearish flag pattern, consisting of a steep vertical drop followed by a consolidation phase. It has been forming the flag section for the past two weeks. If Solana breaks below the key support at $120, a level it has tested multiple times since April last year, the next target may be $100, which would mark a 30% decline from current prices. This bearish scenario would be invalidated if the token climbs above the $170 resistance level, the lowest swing point from January 25.

These tariffs came ahead of April 2, his Liberation Day when he will implement reciprocal tariffs. This article provides BTC, ETH, and SHIB price predictions after a popular economist warned of a recession. Moody’s Economist Warns of a US Recession Mark Zandi, a popular economist at Moody’s warned that the US was careening towards a recession. He said this after the US Conference Board published a report showing that consumer confidence crashed this month and is down by 17 points in the last three months. Zandi’s favorite recession indicator happens when the consumer confidence figure falls by 20 points within a three-month period. This happens because consumers, the engine that drives the US economy, stops spending money. Zandi noted that his recession indicator was flashing a bright yellow and could soon turn red. Mark Zandi Recession Forecast The main catalyst for a recession is Donald Trump’s auto tariffs, that will charge imports a 25% levy. He will then reveal his reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday, which he has enthusiastically named his Liberation Day. A recession would be a bad thing for the UK economy, but a good one for risky assets like BTC, ETH, and SHIB prices. That’s because the crypto market would react positively to Fed actions to contain it. The Fed has reacted to the past recent recessions by cutting rates and quantitative easing. SHIB Price Prediction: Technical Analysis The weekly chart shows that the Shiba Inu price has collapsed after soaring to $0.000035 in November. It dropped to a low of $0.00001125 this month. This was a crucial level since it coincided with the ascending trendline linking the lowest swings since March 2021. The SHIB price has formed a rising broadening wedge pattern, commonly known as a megaphone. This pattern is usually bullish, meaning it may rebound in the next few weeks. If this happens, the next target will be at $0.000025, up by 65% from the current level. A drop below the ascending trendline will invalidate the bullish Shiba Inu price prediction , and point to more downside to $0.000070. SHIB Price Predictions BTC Price Technical Analysis Bitcoin is usually the main driver for the crypto market, which explains why its recent rebound has pushed more coins higher. The risk, however, is that the BTC price has formed a rising wedge pattern and retouched the neckline of the double-top pattern. These are two risky patterns that point to a reversal soon. BTC has also resisted moving above $90,000. If this happens, the most likely Bitcoin price prediction is where it drops to the year-to-date low of $76,890. The bearish outlook will become invalid if the coin rises above $95,000. BTC Price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis Ethereum price faces two technical risks. It formed a triple-top pattern at $4,000, and has now crashed below its neckline at $2,120. It has now formed a bearish flag pattern, comprising a tall vertical line and a rectangle pattern. ETH Price Chart That is a sign that the Ethereum price will crash in the coming days. If this happens, it may crash to the support at $1,746, the YTD low. A move above the psychological point at $2,500 will cancel the bullish ETH price prediction .

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/after-strategy-and-metaplanet-another-company-continues-to-accumulate-bitcoin-they-made-their-biggest-purchase-here-are-the-details/,"Blockchain Group has purchased 580 BTC in its largest Bitcoin purchase to date, significantly expanding its crypto holdings as part of its ongoing Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Blockchain Group Makes Largest Bitcoin Purchase Ever, Adds 580 BTC to Treasury The French technology consultancy firm announced in a press release that the latest acquisition is a major step in its commitment to increase Bitcoin per share. The company's previous purchases were much smaller amounts of 15 BTC and 25 BTC respectively, and this purchase represents a significant leap in its investment strategy. The 580 BTC were purchased through the firm’s subsidiary The Blockchain Group Luxembourg SA at an average price of €81,550 ($87,874) per Bitcoin. The purchase was funded with proceeds from a convertible bond issuance announced on March 6. With this addition, Blockchain Group now holds a total of 620 BTC worth over $54.2 million at current market prices. Stock Price Growth and Strategic Vision According to Euronext data, the company’s stock price has increased by over 220% since it announced its Bitcoin accumulation strategy on November 5, 2024. On Wednesday, the stock continued its upward trend, closing 3.54% higher. CEO Alexandre Laizet attributed the firm’s success to its Bitcoin-focused approach, noting in an X post that the company follows the playbook of large institutional Bitcoin holders like Strategy and Metaplanet. Currently, The Blockchain Group ranks as the 28th largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, with its peers continuing to accumulate the cryptocurrency despite a price correction in late 2024. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Among Public Companies The move by Blockchain Group comes as more companies are integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. On Tuesday, video game retailer GameStop (GME) announced plans to offer $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes to fund its own Bitcoin buying strategy. The announcement sent GME’s shares soaring 11% during regular trading hours. With increasing institutional and corporate interest in Bitcoin treasury strategies, Blockchain Group is positioning itself as a major player in the evolving landscape of crypto-focused public companies. *This is not investment advice.

More tokenized offerings are expected to follow. “Bringing the needed infrastructure to Republic in order to offer its investors access to never-before reachable assets is what BitGo is all about,” said Mike Belshe, chief executive officer and co-founder of BitGo. “BitGo is most known for custodying digital assets, but our infrastructure is also able to power regulated securities, whether tokenized onchain or on pieces of paper offchain.” You might also like: Telos taps Stargate, Circle and BitGo to unlock liquidity and DeFi growth With financial markets increasingly moving on-chain, BitGo is positioning itself to be “the backbone of that transition,” Belshe added.

Quantum threat Topping the list of potential problems is quantum computing, Castle Island Ventures general partner Nic Carter succinctly answered : ”Quantum computing.” His view received widespread support. ”I agree with it more and more. That was the catalyst for my question,” Lyn Alden admitted in her response to Carter. Why it matters. Future quantum computers could potentially break the encryption algorithms that protect bitcoin, including the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) that secures bitcoin wallets. Given enough power, a quantum computer would be able to forge digital signatures, allowing attackers to steal bitcoins from any public-key bitcoin wallet. According to River's research, a quantum computer with 1 million qubits is capable of cracking a bitcoin address. Microsoft has already announced that their new chip called Majorana is paving the way to this milestone. This begs the pressing question: how long does bitcoin have before it must become quantum-resistant? While the threat of quantum computing is serious in itself, some experts believe that the real problem is not the technology, but community management: will the bitcoin community have time to agree among themselves and implement the necessary quantum-resistant solutions before quantum computers become a real threat? ”The problem is that there may not be enough time to reach a consensus on implementing a quantum-resistant hashing algorithm,” commented Stillbigjosh, a former cybersecurity expert at Flutterwave. 51% attack However, BlockTower founder Ari Paul pointed out that the bitcoin network faces a more immediate risk as the cost of an attack has dropped significantly, ”Someone could sell more than 10% of bitcoin's market capitalization and then spend about 1/10 of that amount to gain 51% hashrate control and mine empty blocks indefinitely, effectively shutting down the network. You can fork the PoW algorithm, but that means attacking a new network will now cost less than 1/1000 of the previous one.” Conflict between decentralization and regulation Beyond the technical challenges, some investors fear that government and institutional intervention will be the biggest risk to bitcoin over the next 5-10 years. ”The involvement of governments and institutions completely changes the incentive and motivation system,” commented investor Shinobi. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows that over the past five years, the volume of bitcoins owned by private companies, public companies, governments and ETFs has grown more than 12-fold: from 210 000 BTC to over 2.6 million BTC. As a result, regulatory intervention could create legal pressure or unwanted changes in bitcoin's fundamental operations. ”The biggest risk is the tension between bitcoin's decentralized philosophy and the growing pressure of centralized regulatory oversight. In fact, as governments and large institutions tighten oversight and enforcement, the network may be forced to compromise on its core principle,” warned investor MisterSpread. The discussion sparked by Lyn Alden's question highlighted the risks that could trigger ”black swans” for bitcoin. It also reflects a growing awareness among industry leaders and investors of bitcoin's systemic risks in an era shaped by political stability and artificial intelligence.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-27 15:44:44

At the IIF Europe Summit in Brussels on Thursday, Wunsch said that without tariffs, the outlook for ECB policy looked on track, but the new trade measures now add uncertainty to the equation. “We were going in the right direction. And I was actually quite relaxed,” Wunsch told CNBC’s Karen Tso . He explained that if tariffs were not part of the picture, the situation would have been more about fine-tuning the pace of rate cuts and finding a stable landing point for policy adjustments. Instead, the additional layer of tariffs has complicated what would have otherwise been a predictable policy course. Wunsch in an interview with Karen Tso. Source: CNBC Wunsch was clear in noting that tariffs would likely be bad for economic growth and could be inflationary. However, he cautioned that the precise impact remains uncertain. The effects will depend on factors such as possible retaliatory measures from other countries and the way exchange rates adjust to the new duties imposed by the United States. These comments come just a day after President Trump announced a 25% tariff on all cars “not made in the United States.” This new measure is set to take effect on April 2. In a post on the social media platform Truth Social , Trump also warned that he might impose “far larger” tariffs on the European Union and Canada if they join forces to oppose U.S. duties. While the exact details and future adjustments remain fluid, April 2 is now marked as a key date when a wide range of duties will come into effect. The ECB is scheduled to finalize interest rates on 17th April The timing of these tariff measures could have significant implications for the ECB. The central bank is scheduled to make its next interest rate decision on April 17. A At present, market data from LSEG indicates that there is roughly a 79% chance of a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the ECB next month. By that time, Wunsch said, the ECB should have a better idea of how the tariffs are affecting the economy, and this could play a role in the bank’s decision making. Wunsch added that while the trade policy may not have an immediate effect, it will certainly have a medium-term impact. According to him, the ECB would likely consider pausing rate cuts if tariffs result in reduced growth and inflationary pressures. It is still unlikely that the bank would have to hike rates in the near term. He said, “I think the likelihood is still limited that we would have to hike, but there might be a case for a pause.” In addition to trade policy, Wunsch also pointed to shifts in fiscal policy within Europe that might help counterbalance the negative effects of the tariffs. Earlier this month, Germany adjusted its constitution in a move described as a fiscal U-turn. The changes allowed for higher defense spending and resulted in the creation of a 500 billion euro infrastructure special fund. At the same time, the European Commission has indicated plans to mobilize up to 800 billion euros for a major defense expenditures package aimed at boosting security spending across the bloc. Wunsch said that the measures taken by Germany could, to some extent, or perhaps even largely, help offset the negative economic impact of the U.S. tariffs over the medium term. If fiscal expansion manages to balance out the trade disruptions, the main remaining risk from the tariffs could be an upward pressure on inflation. He warned that “the risk might be on the upside on the inflation front,” indicating that while fiscal policy might cushion the growth outlook, the inflationary effects could still pose a challenge for the ECB.

This came following Atkins’ nomination hearing before the US Senate Banking Committee. Paul Atkins To Prioritize Regulatory Clarity For Crypto Industry During his Senate Banking Committee nomination hearing, Paul Atkins stated that a top priority of his chairmanship will be to work with his fellow commissioners and Congress to provide a “firm regulatory foundation for digital assets through a rational, coherent, and principled approach. This comes just as CoinGape reported that the US SEC plans to shift its focus from crypto enforcement actions to traditional cases. Under past Chair Gary Gensler, the Commission adopted the regulation by enforcement approach instead of providing clarity for the industry. However, Atkins is looking to change that, with his mission already aligning with the moves the agency, under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, has made so far to create a regulatory-friendly environment for the industry. During the hearing, Committee Chairman Tim Scott alluded to the backlash that the SEC faced under Gensler. Paul Atkins admitted that all prior issues were disturbing and committed to working on boosting the agency’s image. He added that he wants to go back to the basics and ensure that the Commission works in line with its mission. Atkins Crypto Holdings Revealed Coingape recently reported that Paul Atkins holds almost $6 million in crypto investments , according to a disclosure released on Tuesday. Between $250,000 and $500,000 is equity in crypto custodian Anchorage Digital. Meanwhile, the US SEC Chair nominee previously held a board position at the BlackRock-backed tokenization firm and had nearly $250,000 to $500,000 in call options. $1 million to $5 million of these investments came from stakes in Off the Chain Capital, where he is a limited partner. It is unclear if Paul Atkins will offload these crypto investments if the US Senate confirms him as the next US SEC Chair. However, Senator Elizabeth Warren described his financial conflicts of interest as “breathtaking.” The post US SEC Chair Nominee Paul Atkins To Prioritize Regulatory Clarity For Crypto Industry appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News|paul atkins|US SEC|US SEC Chair,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-27 15:53:14

Doshi believes gold could rise another 8%-10% by the end of 2025 if current macroeconomic and US tariff conditions persist. Goldman Sachs also raised its gold price forecast for the end of 2025, increasing its target from $3,100 to $3,300 per ounce due to stronger-than-expected exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and sustained central bank demand. On the other financial side, stock markets in Asia followed Wall Street’s downward trend on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2%, while South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 1.39%. Japanese and South Korean automakers, which have significant exposure to the US market, suffered sharp losses. Toyota Motor shares tumbled 4%, Mazda Motor dropped 5%, and Subaru slid 6%. The downtick comes after President Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported cars. US automakers General Motors slumped 8%, while Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis saw shares decline by about 4.5% each. In currency markets, the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar bore the brunt of the impact, declining 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, climbed 0.5% overnight to 104.71, its highest in three weeks, before settling at 104.58 on Thursday. US Treasury yields benchmark rates are holding steady at 4.354% after gaining five basis points overnight. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP tread on negative lines The broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), is in a bloodbath. The leading digital asset by market cap had inched up 1% to $87,500 in early morning trading sessions but dropped to $86,800 by noon, a 1.1% fall from its intraday highs. On the hourly chart , Bitcoin was respecting the $87,061 pivot level after bouncing from its $86,500 support. The structure showed signs of strengthening momentum, with higher lows forming, while the 20-day moving average (MA20) at $84,232 acted as support. BTC price chart. Source: TradingView Still, it faces resistance at the 50-day moving average (MA50) at $89,780. The asset remained trapped in a compression zone between MA20 and MA50, with decreasing buy-side pressure. According to Coingecko data , Ethereum (ETH) continued to face selling pressure, trading at $2,019.70 after a 2.14% drop over the past 24 hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency is still on a four-month-long downtrend, declining 17.15% over the past 30 days and nearly 40% over the past 90 days. XRP was trading below both its 50-day moving average ($2.42) and 200-day moving average ($2.55), confirming that bears have control. The asset has failed to break above the $2.58 resistance level multiple times, leading to a lower-high pattern that suggested weakening bullish momentum. XRP Technical analysis chart.

For a bullish reversal to materialize, XRP would need to break and close above $2.45 with strong volume and reclaim its 50-day moving average. Until then, the cryptocurrency could uphold a bearish consolidation phase, with downward pressure outweighing buying interest. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The crypto market sentiment has also plunged into fear, which often precedes a spike in selling activity. The declining prices and waning investor interest have pushed many altcoins into oversold regions. In this article, we explore three high-potential cryptos to invest in before March 31 for significant gains. 3 High Potential Cryptos to Invest In Before March 31 Data from Coinglass reveals several altcoins with a heavily oversold RSI. When most cryptos reach oversold levels, it suggests that they have hit a local bottom where selling pressure is exhausted. This makes such coins high-potential cryptos that can rally. These altcoins include Ripple (XRP), Kaspa (KAS) and Melania (MELANIA). Ripple (XRP) XRP price trades at $2.31 at press time after a 5.5% decline in 24 hours. The RSI has plunged to 33 on the daily chart, which is close to oversold levels. Moreover, this RSI is at its lowest level in nearly three weeks. An oversold RSI usually precedes a trend reversal to the upside. Moreover, Ripple is defending the $2.23 immediate support level, indicating that a bullish reversal remains likely. As long as XRP defends the make-or-break support of $1.90, it is possible to make a reversal. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart Besides the technical setup, positive narratives around Ripple make it the best crypto to buy during the dip. The end of the Ripple case has increased the odds of XRP ETF approval according to top market analysts. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is also one of the oversold crypto tokens with high potential. Kaspa price today trades at $0.074 with a 4% decline in 24 hours. The RSI has made a lower low after falling to 38 due to intense selling pressure. However, this altcoin continues to defend the support level at $0.073, which suggests that it can avoid further dips despite being in an oversold state. The Bollinger bands on the Kaspa price chart are also tightening, which could also precede a bullish Kaspa price prediction . If traders begin to buy this dip, and KAS confirms a breakout past the $0.082 resistance, it can rally higher, which makes KAS a top crypto to buy. KAS/USDT: 4-hour Chart Melania Meme (MELANIA) The other best crypto to invest in with high potential is MELANIA. This Solana-based meme coin is leaning towards being oversold with an RSI of 33. Moreover, this indicator is at a two-week low, suggesting selling pressure has been notably high. At press time, MELANIA trades at an all-time low of $0.64. This presents an opportunity for traders to buy the dip in case of a reversal. Additionally, the BBTrend histogram bars are fading, which is indicative of a weakening bearish trend making it a top crypto to buy. MELANIA/USDT: 1-hour Chart Meanwhile, top meme coins on Solana have also seen a surge in activity after volumes on the PumpFun exchange surged by nearly two times this week. This could also bode well for MELANIA. Summary XRP, KAS, and MELANIA are the best high potential cryptos to invest in today. These crypto tokens are heavily oversold according to the RSI indicator, which shows that sellers have reached a point of exhaustion. If traders accumulate this dip, it could fuel a trend reversal.

On March 27, Optimism announced that the dollar-pegged USDT0 is now live on the OP mainnet. The crosschain stablecoin’s first deployment was on Ink, Kraken’s DeFi-focused layer-2. USDT0 is essentially a bridged version of Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) designed to extend the stablecoin’s adoption across various blockchains. Tether launched USDT0 in January in collaboration with the interoperability protocol LayerZero. One month later, Tether selected Arbitrum as the main infrastructure provider for USDT0. Superchain is a network of layer-2 chains designed to scale Ethereum through Optimism’s OP Stack. The collective currently accounts for 52% of Ethereum layer-2 transactions, according to data tracked by Superchain. Since September, Superchain’s L2 dominance has grown from 36.6% of all transactions to 51.9%. Source: Superchain Health Dashboard In February, Optimism’s chief growth officer, Ryan Wyatt, told Cointelegraph that Superchain will likely account for 80% of Ethereum L2 transactions this year. At the time, Superchain secured more than $4 billion in total value — a figure that has since grown to $4.2 billion. Related: Celo, Chainlink, Hyperlane launch crosschain UDT on OP Superchain Stablecoin adoption heats up Superchain said that deploying USDT0 is expected to attract “more top-tier assets, applications and partners” to the collective, which highlights the role stablecoins play in fueling DeFi adoption. The total value of all stablecoins in circulation has reached nearly $228 billion, having increased 3.3% over the past 30 days. According to RWA.xyz, there are more than 155 million stablecoin holders worldwide. Ethereum accounts for 58% of the total stablecoin supply. In terms of market cap, Ethereum is by far the largest network for stablecoins. Tether’s USDt is the most widely used stable asset. Source: RWA.xyz Tether has long had a first-mover advantage in the stablecoin market. The company has emerged as one of the world’s largest holders of US Treasury assets, which has helped fuel its record-breaking profits in recent years. With President Donald Trump in the White House, dollar-pegged stablecoins have become a major policy drive r in the United States. The head of Trump’s council on digital assets, Bo Hines, recently told a conference in New York that comprehensive stablecoin regulations could arrive on the president’s desk within two months .

42486038,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=700779,1743091200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42486038.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Likened To Solana (SOL) & Cardano (ADA) As It’s Poised To Become The Leading DeFi Lending Platform,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-likened-to-solana-sol-cardano-ada-as-its-poised-to-become-the-leading-defi-lending-platform/,"Emerging as a decentralized finance juggernaut, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already being compared to the region’s powerhouses, such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), due to its novel lending solution. Now at Phase 3 in its 11-phase presale, the project has already pulled in $5,400,000 from more than 7200 investors. Phase 3 is the cheapest you will get, priced at just $0.02, and is 80% sold out while everyone waits for Phase 4, which will raise the token price from $0.02 to $0.025 — a 25% increase. As early adopters stand to gain a 200% explosion upon launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a focal point for shrewd investors hunting for exponential gains. Presale Momentum Accelerates The quick embrace of Phase 3 highlights growing confidence in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) model. Pre-sale investors can secure a 25% gain as soon as Phase 4 ignites, with forecasters calling for even more momentum once the launch is fully signed off. Without the help of the platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism, the merit of this momentum only persists: a fraction of protocol revenue buying MUTM from the market and redistributing tokens to stakers. This sustains demand and prevents sell-offs, whilst rewarding long-term holders. Together with its overcollateralized lending system—borrowers must deposit assets that exceed the value of their loan—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates more stable ground, hardly seen among speculative crypto markets. Such mechanics have driven speculation of a post-launch rally to $1.50 dollars, a potential 7,400% return for Phase 3 participants. Tokenomics Powered by Real Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has real market financial utility. Users deposit cryptocurrencies such as ETH or stablecoins, and receive interest-bearing mtTokens (e.g. mtETH) that generate interest and grow in value over time. These tokens are transferable between DeFi platforms, where they create increased liquidity and give passive income. Meanwhile, lenders also earn dynamic yields based on the pool utilization rate and borrowers go for undercollateralized loans through p2p negotiation, which extends to niche assets such as meme coins. As such, it fulfills an important role in traditional lending within a multi-lending ecosystem, paving a way forward for MUTM as a yield generating channel and as a foundation of decentralized liquidity. Focus on Security and Scalability The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team prepares for a smart contract audit by Certik as this move intends to build trust between investment and exchange listings. The platform’s resistance to attacks will become known to investors when the audit’s final results are shared through official communication channels. The project team pursues development of an overcollateralized stablecoin that draws support from user deposits to stabilize the ecosystem. Similar to MakerDAO yet more decentralized, this approach would bring stability to the system. The project’s innovative spirit aligns with its goal of risk reduction which stands as an uncommon achievement throughout crypto market volatility. Seizing the Presale Window Phase 3 is gradually closing, and urgency rises amongst investors who want to be in at the current $0.02 entry price. As Phase 4 approaches a price upsurge, delays threaten to lose not just the 25% presale surge but the exponential growth predicted post-listing too. Many early participants have already seen their holdings double in value from previous phases, and this will only continue as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gears up for full-scale mainstream adoption. The project’s combination of loan-taking utility, tokenomics and market mechanics positions it to outperform competitors – just like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) during their explosive climbs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new DeFi that actually works. While comparing it to leading layer-1s by presale performance and real-word applications is fair and justified, its niche as a lending-innovator is what it most resembles. Within the rapidly shrinking window of Phase 3 lies a unique prospect for investors looking for the next revolutionary in DeFi. Act now where are what will be the next price increase—and ahead of the market clamor to catch up to Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) potential. Join the 7200+ investors backing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) today. Purchase tokens at $0.02 in Phase 3 before the price climbs to $0.025. Visit the official website to participate now.

42486333,https://blockworks.co/news/world-launches-mini-apps-1-2,1743091200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,"Sam Altman’s World launches Mini Apps 1.2, lets devs build-to-earn",https://blockworks.co/news/world-launches-mini-apps-1-2,"Tools for Humanity, the for-profit firm behind Sam Altman’s crypto-powered World Network , has updated its “Mini Apps” with Mini Apps 1.2. The company is also launching a $300,000 Developer Rewards pilot program, Tools for Humanity exclusively shared with Blockworks. Mini Apps version 1.2 makes mini apps load faster within the World mobile app , adds haptic feedback, enables customization, and allows you to pin your favorite mini apps to your phone’s home screen without needing to open the Worldcoin Wallet app, according to the company. Mini apps will also be accessible through the search bar on iOS. The app is currently available in 30 countries, including the US. World now supports more than 150 mini apps, according to data provided to Blockworks. The vast majority of those are from third-party developers. Tools for Humanity’s Developer Reward pilot program starts April 1, letting devs earn from a pool of $300,000 worth of Worldcoin or WLD to develop and update a mini app. WLD price over time, from Blockworks Research Devs can earn up to $25,000 a week in Worldcoin if they’re building a top-performing app, Tools for Humanity Chief Product Officer Tiago Sada told Blockworks. Rewards will be distributed based on the number of World ID-verified users engaging with each mini app. “Games have been popular,” Sada said of what’s been trending within the World ecosystem. AI apps/assistants, finance apps, lending apps, airdrop apps, payment apps that let you pay with WLD, and eSIM apps have also been gaining traction. They can be used with stablecoins or WLD, and transactions take place on World’s Ethereum L2, World Chain. Transactions on World Chain, per World Sada said many of these mini apps are rewarding users as well, as opposed to extracting funds from them. User monetization will come eventually, but that’s not the focus right now. Concepts like play-to-earn, tap-to-earn and move-to-earn have been challenging to balance over time, with token prices often crashing as earners cash out (like Pegaxy’s PGX, Notcoin, or Stepn’s GMT). “It was really difficult to have a sustainable system,” Sada said, adding that now we’re seeing the emergence instead of apps “that are able to reward users for actions that are actually valuable for something, and developers can pay for that because it’s not going to be gamed.” For now, the transactions side of things can be a bit tricky because of Apple and Google’s app store rules. Apple’s rules on mini apps, for example, state that in-app purchases are required for “digital goods or services to end users.” “All the transactions that we support in mini apps go directly to developers. There’s some kinds of transactions — for example, buying an NFT — that would require in-app purchases. We do not currently support in-app purchases on mini apps,” Sada explained. But he said transactions such as buying a plane ticket or an eSIM card with a credit card within a mini app wouldn’t incur the so-called “Apple tax” within the World app. The main appeal of World right now over Telegram or X/Twitter is that it’s easier to tell who is — and isn’t — a bot. Telegram can also feel a bit overwhelming if you’re new to that world, and X is a sea of politics, memes, bots and chaos these days. When I asked Sada for his thoughts on competitors like Telegram embracing bots across its app, he said: “I think chatbots and AI are awesome.

This confirms stable market conditions, as the bulls secured a comeback. Technical indicators, however, continue to support the sellers. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $6.07 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is under bullish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price increased up to $0.912 gaining 0.55% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.61 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2029. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2030. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $6.97, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $6.97 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38.

Investors quickly shifted their focus to the nation’s precarious fiscal position and the broader risks of rising global borrowing costs. UK gilts under pressure as rising yields threaten Reeves’ fiscal buffer Gilts declined across the curve, underperforming their European counterparts and pushing the benchmark 10-year yield up by as much as eight basis points to 4.81%—its highest level since mid-January when a global bond selloff severely impacted Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s fiscal flexibility. Although Reeves yesterday restored her fiscal buffer to exactly where it was in October, firms including BlackRock Inc., Allspring Global Investments and Fidelity International say the UK bond market remains very much at the mercy of external forces. Lauren van Biljon, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, noted: “Reeves has very limited headroom, and potential domestic and international shocks are numerous.” The concern is that rising global bond yields, persistent inflation, and weaker-than-expected growth could trigger another selloff in UK bonds, once again eroding Reeves’ fiscal buffer. The Office for Budget Responsibility cautioned that this headroom could vanish entirely if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes 20% tariffs on global trade or if borrowing costs increase by just 0.6%. UK fiscal woes cast a shadow over gilts ahead of autumn budget Vikram Aggarwal, fixed-income investment manager at Jupiter Asset Management, said the deterioration in UK public finances can’t be underestimated. He noted that the cheapness of gilts doesn’t make them an attractive buy. The fragile state of the UK’s finances is heightening expectations that the government may need to raise taxes or implement further spending cuts in October’s Autumn Budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates a 46% chance that Reeves will breach her fiscal rule requiring taxes to cover day-to-day spending. Shamil Gohil, fixed-income portfolio manager at Fidelity International, said that Gilts will probably remain in no man’s land until the Autumn budget. He added that they will likely see some fiscal slippage and buffer erosion. UK bonds rally on borrowing plan, but fiscal risks loom large Market movements have been erratic, with gilts experiencing sharp fluctuations driven by shifting investor sentiment. On Wednesday, UK bonds posted one of their strongest performances of the year following the Debt Management Office’s announcement of a smaller-than-expected borrowing plan. Yields on 30-year notes dropped by as much as nine basis points—their biggest decline since early February. Pooja Kumra, senior UK and European rates strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank, attributed Wednesday’s bond rally primarily to the favourable issuance figures. However, she emphasized that the underlying reality remains unchanged, with the UK still trapped in a difficult fiscal position. Some funds, including Vanguard, took confidence from the government’s firm re-commitment to its fiscal rules, saying the relative cheapness of gilts outweighed the risks around the UK’s economic trajectory. Ales Koutny, head of international rates at Vanguard, reinstated his long-dated gilts position against Germany. He noted that Reeves’ firm stance on fiscal rules being non-negotiable has helped ease concerns about shrinking fiscal headroom. He expects UK bonds to realign with U.S. yields in the coming months. Markets have wavered for months in their approach to UK gilts, shifting between buying for their high yields and selling over fears that the Labour government may struggle to manage the nation’s deficit. Vivek Paul, UK chief investment strategist at BlackRock, noted that the country’s borrowing costs remain highly vulnerable to spikes, suggesting gilts could face renewed pressure.

A Look at On-Chain Data Trends,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-repeating-history-a-look-at-on-chain-data-trends/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price movements have raised speculations about the possible end of the bull market and the onset of a bear season. Investors are wondering if the leading digital asset is entering a period of continued downturn and sideways movement, but analysts still insist there is hope. The on-chain analyst and bitcoin insights provider IT Tech believes data from previous market cycles could help predict the future of this bull market and reveal if BTC has peaked for the season. The firm focused on bitcoin’s transaction volume across previous bull and bear cycles. Historical Bitcoin Trends During the bull cycle of 2016-2017, when BTC rallied to roughly $20,000, the market witnessed rising activity in large transactions, which are transfers greater than $1 million. As bitcoin’s price climbed, large investors accumulated heavily, driving the market to new highs. By the bear market of 2018-2019, institutional activity had dwindled; however, investors were still accumulating at a slower pace while BTC was consolidating. On the other hand, smaller investors gradually stepped in to buy the dip. Then came the bull run of 2020-2021, during which institutional adoption drove BTC to $69,000. IT Tech revealed that the euphoria at the time was driven by massive transaction volumes in the >$1 million range, indicating that the market saw significant interest from big players. More Room for Growth Following the 2022 crash, BTC consolidated around $20,000. Large investors were still accumulating; however, transaction volumes hovered below the peaks seen in 2020 and 2021. Analyzing data in the current cycle, IT Tech noted the emergence of new activity in low-value transactions, that is, those between $0 – $1 and $100 – $1,000. Smaller BTC investors are now increasingly active , highlighting a season of retail fear of missing out (FOMO). While small investors continue to participate in the market, trading volumes for larger transactions have yet to reach levels seen in previous bull cycles. IT Tech said this suggests that whales and institutions are still quietly accumulating BTC. It also means that the market is yet to see the euphoric phase of this bull cycle. According to IT Tech, an explosive growth in the >$1 million range could signal the beginning of market euphoria. Until that happens, the current level of accumulation indicates that the market still has room for growth. Nevertheless, the on-chain analyst insists that mid-sized transactions ($1,000 – $10,000) are just as important in this cycle because an increase in this range often comes before a broader market rally.

TON, SUI, and Pi have emerged as top performers in the market by recording impressive growth during the previous 24-hour period. The value of Bitcoin (BTC) remains near $87,000 at present. These altcoin to sell have driven the price movement of today’s market performance. The current state of the cryptocurrency market demands careful investment decisions since these digital assets seem to have achieved their maximum value for the time being. Making a profit through selling becomes advisable just before major market adjustments take place. Keep track of market dynamics because this current increase might prove short-term in nature. Crypto enthusiasts who want to benefit from recent increases are currently prioritizing the identification of altcoins to avoid. Altcoins to Sell: PI Nertwork (PI) The Pi price achieved a 5% growth during the last 24 hours. The market rise positions Pi Network among the strongest altcoins to sell right now because additional downward movements are expected. The short-term price increase fails to negate the prevailing downward movement of the market. The price for Pi Network reached its highest point at almost $3 one month ago yet has since settled at $0.80. The Pi has suffered over 20% deficit during the previous week. Millions of cryptocurrency investors cannot access Pi coin because the coins are not available on key exchanges including Binance, Coinbase and Upbit. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin (TON) experienced a 7% price increase during the recent 24-hour period and currently ranks among the leading performers. The cryptocurrency keeps delivering better performance than the overall market mainly because The Open Network blockchain successfully obtained over $400 million in funding. At the time of writing, the TON price was trading at $3.85, making a strong surge in the past day. The price surge of Toncoin came shortly after Pavel Durov left France leading to greater project acceleration. Expert opinions indicate Toncoin will experience a price correction while speculators must assess if it will join the group of lucrative altcoins that should be sold before it reaches its peak value. Source: TradingView Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) has just broken out from a downward-sloping resistance trend line which suggests a major shift in directional trends. The current market price of SUI stands at $2.70 with a 5% rise in value. The price has recently broken above a declining short-term resistance line but the unbroken long-term trend keeps demonstrating that the major trend is still in play. SUI maintains strong momentum from its upward trajectory however its price may experience an upcoming correction. The market position of SUI is demonstrated by its $1.24 billion total value locked amount. Before investing, individuals should evaluate the market conditions.

BTC ETF minimizes fee impact over time, and this makes it more aligned with Bitcoin’s long-term value compared to its peers. I see this Bitcoin dip as a pullback, not the start of a bear market—based on both cyclical and statistical analysis. It’s not like holding Bitcoin on-chain and storing it on a Ledger—there’s always some ""external risk"", but at least it’s measurable, since it’s regulated. I’m talking about BTC, but I’m referring specifically to Grayscale’s latest ETF: the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) ETF. A great choice in terms of ticker, I must say, clear and unmistakable, especially considering we’re talking about a Bitcoin ETF. In fact, I believe it’s one of the best Bitcoin-themed passive funds on the market right now. But I’m not saying anything new, I've already covered much of this in my previous article on GBTC. This time, though, I’d like to focus more closely on BTC, the “mini” version of GBTC, and explore its actual role in a portfolio. So I wonder: “Can BTC ETF be used as a standalone solution to gain Bitcoin (SPOT) exposure?” Spoiler: It might, at least partially. It is BTC, but it is an ETF Let’s start with what Grayscale clearly wants to highlight on its official page : BTC ETF is a (mini) low-cost ETF. Sounds a bit awkward, doesn’t it? The way it's phrased almost makes it sound like “low” refers to quality rather than cost, and “mini” like a stripped-down version of the original (GBTC). But in truth, it really is low-cost, and “mini” only refers to the fee: with an expense ratio of just 0.15%, it easily outshines most other Bitcoin replication ETFs on the market. I have to admit, BTC ETF easily passed my initial screening: It has $3.55B in AUM, and it’s growing. It holds approximately 38,012.91 BTC, which translates to about 0.0004431 Bitcoin per share, based on the 85,769,963 shares listed in the latest fact sheet. The Bitcoin is held in custody by Coinbase Custody Trust Company (which, to be honest, I’m not a big fan of, we’ll get to that later). The benchmark is transparent and trackable, and the price is tightly linked to NAV, tracking the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) . For those new to this, don’t make the mistake of confusing BTC ETF with GBTC. Profile (GBTC - BTC) (Seeking Alpha) GBTC was a closed-end trust prior to its 2024 conversion into an ETF, and was widely known for its illiquidity and significant deviations from NAV. With the transition to an ETF, many inefficiencies were resolved, but for some reason, it still carries a 1.5% fee. Price return (GBTC - BTC) (Seeking Alpha) That’s why I genuinely appreciate Grayscale’s initiative here. They’ve launched a clean, low-cost, and straightforward solution like BTC ETF, mini in fees only, not in quality. Peer analysis It has competitors, but I prefer to consider only those with higher AUM, especially since BTC ETF is still one of the relatively newer instruments on the market (though issued by one of the most established names in the crypto space). Here’s my peer table for reference. Profile (peers) (Seeking Alpha) In ETFs like BTC, where the underlying asset has exponential growth potential, fees become a critical metric to properly weigh in one’s calculations. Each share represents a fraction of BTC, and to cover expenses, the fund will (naturally) sell part of its Bitcoin holdings over time. This means the number of BTC per share will gradually decrease, and the higher the ETF’s fee, the more impactful this effect becomes. Price return (peers analysis) (Seeking Alpha) Considering Bitcoin’s historical nature, high-growth and long-term compounding, this could represent a significant cost over the years. That’s why I truly appreciate BTC ETF: it minimizes this risk. Over the long run, it could very well be the ETF where fee impact is the least noticeable, maintaining a smaller performance spread compared to its competitors. In fact, there isn’t a big gap between NAV and price, no obvious imbalances. That is certainly a comforting sign, and one that distinguishes BTC ETF even more from its long ""lost cousin"" (and now peers), GBTC, which became known for destroying value. BTC ETF NAV (Grayscale) In my opinion, the market will soon realize this, and we’ll likely see its AUM grow significantly over time. AUM of BTC Peers (chart) (Seeking Alpha) My outlook on BTC Now that we’ve identified the instrument, the next step is to assess whether the recent pullback should be viewed as an opportunity, or as the start of an inevitable bear market. Personally, I remain bullish on Bitcoin pretty because I tend to favor a statistical perspective, because, at the end of the day, Bitcoin is a mathematical asset. My view is built on 2 practical assumptions: Cyclical analysis based on the most widely used mathematical models still points to higher end-of-cycle price targets. I talked about it here. Statistical models suggest that the likelihood of a new bear market remains low. I talked about it here. Risk Since I’ve already discussed Bitcoin and its risks in depth, I’d rather highlight an aspect I believe is important to know about Grayscale’s BTC ETF: the custody service provided by Coinbase Custody Trust Company. It’s a solution regulated by the State of New York and includes high-profile institutional clients, so what I’m about to mention is naturally a very minor risk, but still a real one: operational or legal issues related to the service. This brings up the classic “not your keys, not your crypto”, or rather, a revised version of it. In fact, the crypto is yours, but it’s held through instruments you don’t directly control, like a ledger. True, this isn’t a risk comparable to that of a traditional CeFi exchange, in fact, it’s measurable due to its greater transparency. My opinion So, I conclude that for those seeking traditional access and wanting to avoid the operational complexities of blockchain, the cost of BTC ETF is the minimum price to pay for a complete product. Naturally, a purist wouldn’t agree; although these funds physically hold Bitcoin, there will never be full control like with native solutions such as a Ledger. Being aware of the risk of having to pay a potentially expensive fee over time, I believe that, while this issue does exist, it is minimized in BTC ETF.",GBTC|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|WALLET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-27 17:11:33

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the POL price from an immediate surge. However, if POL’s price successfully breaks above $0.2469, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2885. POL Price Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, POL’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2258, resulting in a correction to $0.2019. Is POL a good investment? POL token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is POL price up today? Following overall buying demand in the market, POL price triggered a recovery rally above $0.25. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on POL Indian telecom leader Jio Platforms released its JioCoin on the Polygon network, expanding its digital services. Starting January 16, Jio integrated JioCoin into its JioSphere browser following a collaboration with Polygon Labs to incorporate Web3 and blockchain technologies. POL price prediction March 2025 Following Donald Trump’s election victory, the crypto market witnessed a robust price surge. However, the recent announcement on Tariffs on China, Mexico has triggered bearish pressure in the altcoin market. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following the crash. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.22 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.28 in February. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction March 2025 $0.22 $0.28 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

The company has entered into an agreement with Circle Internet Financial to explore the use of its USDC stablecoin and USYC, a tokenised money market fund, across ICE’s trading and market infrastructure. The collaboration signals a shift in how legacy finance views blockchain-based digital assets—not just as speculative tools, but as potentially foundational components of modern market plumbing. ICE tests stablecoins in trading and clearing The ICE-Circle agreement will focus on evaluating where and how USDC and USYC can be used across ICE’s global network of exchanges, clearinghouses, and data services. These include some of the most critical components of global capital markets, such as the NYSE derivatives exchange and ICE Clear. USDC, currently the second-largest stablecoin with a market cap exceeding $30 billion, is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and backed by short-term US government securities and cash-equivalent reserves. Circle @circle · Follow One of the most influential institutions in global finance and parent of the NYSE, @ICE_Markets , announced an agreement with us to explore product innovation using USDC and USYC.Stablecoins are officially entering the next chapter in TradFi. circle.com/pressroom/ice-… 6:05 PM · Mar 27, 2025 38 Reply Copy link Read 6 replies The token is issued by Circle, a regulated US financial technology company. USYC, on the other hand, is a newer offering—a tokenised version of a money market fund that Circle acquired through its purchase of asset manager Hashnote. Unlike USDC, which is designed for payments and on-chain settlements, USYC aims to give institutional investors exposure to regulated, interest-bearing short-term US Treasury instruments, using blockchain rails. Institutional demand for tokenised assets grows ICE’s partnership with Circle highlights growing momentum among large financial players to incorporate blockchain-based assets. The move follows similar experiments from other giants in the sector. CME Group, a major ICE competitor, is also exploring blockchain applications, while Fidelity has developed its own stablecoin framework and tokenised asset initiatives. This institutional trend is being driven in part by the rapid rise in tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), which Boston Consulting Group forecasts could become a $16 trillion market by 2030. From bonds and equities to money market funds, financial institutions are actively investigating how tokenised versions of traditional securities can increase efficiency, reduce costs, and enable 24/7 settlement. Circle, which previously partnered with BlackRock to support the reserve management for USDC, has been a central player in this space. Its acquisition of Hashnote and subsequent launch of USYC signals its intent to expand from payments into broader tokenised capital markets. Regulatory checks before product launch While the agreement between ICE and Circle does not yet involve the rollout of specific products, both firms have confirmed plans to evaluate legal, operational, and regulatory requirements across jurisdictions before proceeding further. Any launch of financial products based on USDC or USYC would need approval from relevant regulatory bodies, including the SEC and CFTC in the US. The potential applications span multiple segments of the financial infrastructure. For example, ICE could use USDC to enable near-instant settlement on certain trades or clearing operations, bypassing traditional banking rails. Similarly, USYC could offer an on-chain alternative to standard short-term treasury exposure, with possible integration into ICE’s clearing platforms or institutional custody solutions. USDC and USYC may change settlements If successfully implemented, ICE’s adoption of USDC and USYC would mark one of the most significant integrations of digital tokens into legacy market infrastructure to date. It could also pave the way for other exchanges and market operators to adopt similar tools, particularly as regulators around the world issue clearer guidance on digital asset frameworks. Circle’s stablecoin technology is already being used across various DeFi and TradFi applications, but its entry into ICE’s ecosystem indicates broader institutional validation. According to on-chain data, USDC currently settles over $100 billion in monthly transaction volume across Ethereum and other supported blockchains. For ICE, which processes trillions of dollars in derivatives and securities trades each month, incorporating stablecoins and tokenised funds could lead to a new phase of operational efficiency—while for Circle, the partnership provides access to some of the deepest liquidity pools in global finance.

Gabe Amo issued a press release stating that Rep. Amo and Rep. Kim (R-CA) reintroduced a bipartisan resolution supporting the use of distributive ledger technologies (DLT), including blockchain, to “support democratic governance, human rights, freedom of information, transparency, and innovation around the world.” The resolution (the full text of which was not linked to in the press release) urges federal agencies to explore and support DLT and expresses Congress’ commitment to advancing responsible innovation on this technological front. Rep. Kim commented on the importance of this technology in the press release. “U.S. leadership in emerging technologies like blockchain not only improves Americans’ lives but also helps us advance transparency in U.S. foreign assistance, human rights, and freedom across the globe,” said Rep. Kim. “This legislation is vital, especially as we see the Chinese Communist Party exporting its surveillance technologies and authoritarianism abroad. I am proud to join Congressman Amo to lead this bipartisan resolution to ensure the United States shines as a beacon of hope, freedom, and innovation on the world stage,” she added. The press release also cited how, in Screven County, Georgia, the Bitcoin blockchain was used to safeguard election election results and provide transparency to voters, linking to this article , which tells the story of the event. Simple Proof , the company that helped Screven County officials commit its vote tallies to the immutable Bitcoin blockchain also recently helped Republicans in Williamson County, Tennessee do the same with the results of its Republican leadership vote . Simple Proof put itself on the map when it helped to secure the results of the most recent presidential election in Guatemala, the story of which is told in the short documentary Immutable Democracy . Thanks to the vote tallies from the election being safeguarded on the Bitcoin blockchain, the integrity of the election was upheld, despite efforts made to tamper with physical votes once voting had concluded. The work that the company has done both in the U.S. and abroad is a testament to a point Rep. Amo made in the press release. “Innovative technology like blockchain helps promote transparency and strengthen democratic institutions around the world,” said the congressman. While the press release provided evidence of the Bitcoin blockchain being used to preserve democratic values, it didn’t differentiate between Bitcoin and other blockchains , many of which, by design, are less secure.

But some projects have consistently captured the attention of developers, businesses, and digital asset enthusiasts alike. Qubetics , Hedera , and Immutable X stand out as some of the most innovative and promising blockchain platforms for 2025. These projects bring something unique, whether Qubetics can tokenize real-world assets, Hedera ’s blazing transaction speeds, or Immutable X ’s commitment to gas-free NFTs. As we dive into these projects and see why they are among the top coins to join today for massive return potential . While Hedera and Immutable X have already gained significant adoption, Qubetics is quickly making waves with its presale success and breakthrough features. The Qubetics presale is already in its 27th stage , selling over 504 million TICS tokens , and with its roadmap focused on blockchain interoperability, it’s becoming one of the hottest tickets in crypto. Qubetics: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Interoperability and Asset Tokenization When considering the top coins to join today for massive return potential , Qubetics is making a strong case. The project concerns blockchain interoperability , a crucial development in an ecosystem where various blockchains often struggle to communicate. Qubetics solves this problem by offering an easy-to-use platform that makes it simple for businesses, professionals, and individuals to perform transactions across different blockchain networks. This breakthrough technology could have massive implications for industries that rely on multiple blockchains to operate seamlessly. Moreover, Qubetics is also pushing the envelope in real-world asset tokenization , which has remained largely untapped by many of the most prominent players in the blockchain industry. By tokenizing physical assets such as real estate and commodities, Qubetics is opening up new possibilities for businesses to leverage blockchain technology for efficient trading and investment. Tokenizing assets makes them more liquid, accessible, and easier to trade on the blockchain. What really sets Qubetics apart is its decentralized VPN . Traditional VPNs rely on centralized servers, which can be compromised or hacked. Qubetics’ decentralized VPN takes control out of the hands of third-party providers, ensuring that users can maintain complete privacy and security online. This feature alone could change the way we think about online security, making Qubetics one of the most promising projects in the space. Qubetics Presale Details and Analyst Predictions The Qubetics crypto presale is in its 27th stage , and so far, the project has made significant strides in its early fundraising efforts. With over 504 million TICS tokens sold to more than 23,900 holders , the presale has raised over $15.5 million , showing strong interest and support from the community. At this stage, the price of TICS tokens is $0.1300 , making it an attractive opportunity for those looking to get in early. As the project grows, analysts predict impressive returns for those who purchase TICS tokens during the presale. Some key analyst predictions include: Current Price : $0.1300 per TICS token . After the Presale : If TICS reaches $1 , investors could see a 669% ROI . At $5 : A potential 3745% ROI after the presale. Post Mainnet Launch : If TICS hits $15 , it could lead to an 11,436% ROI . With these exciting predictions and the presale’s successful track record, Qubetics presents a compelling case as one of the top coins to join today for massive return potential . Immutable (IMX) Surges 8% After SEC Closes Investigation Immutable (IMX) saw a notable 8.05% surge in price, reaching $0.6785, following the news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had closed its investigation into the project without filing any charges. This decision fueled strong buying momentum, driving the token’s market cap to $1.21 billion and a significant 118.36% increase in trading volume, reaching $120.59 million. With the regulatory risk removed, IMX is experiencing an upward trend, with technical indicators suggesting potential gains if it breaks through the $0.70 resistance level. However, the token is also showing signs of mild weakness, with some caution needed if it fails to maintain support at $0.63. As the NFT market continues to boom, Immutable X is definitely one of the top coins to join today for massive return potential , especially for those interested in the future of digital art and collectibles. Hedera Introduces HIP-991 and Expands Ecosystem with New Collaborations Hedera Hashgraph has recently made significant strides in enhancing its network and expanding its ecosystem. On March 21, 2025, Hedera introduced HIP-991, enabling permissionless revenue-generating topic IDs for topic operators, thereby enhancing the Hedera Consensus Service’s capabilities .

SlowMist discovered the bug, allowing ReachMe to retain its regular fee structure. The crypto world has another currency – attention. ReachMe aims to filter that demand by creating a fee-based model to reach Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). Recently, the Slow Mist investigation team found a bug on ReachMe, which allowed users to reach KOLs for a much lower fee. A team of white hack hackers managed to test the bug and alert the team for patching. Shoutout to @im23pds , @T41nk_ , and the @SlowMist_Team for catching a bug in @reachme_io ! Whitehats like you keep the space safe—much respect! — Rand (@Rand0x) March 27, 2025 The ReachMe service launched this Thursday and has already attracted big names in the crypto space. The app focuses on verified X accounts among crypto influencers, giving them a way to tokenize their outreach. KOLs have already received outsized attention for their paid shilling of projects. For some, the reach fee may be an additional obstacle or a way to earn more from their social media clout. ReachMe will work as a tokenless protocols, and the team has warned against any token launch announcements. The service uses BNB for its fees, with three major price tiers. All verified accounts can also alter their fees to reflect demand. Despite this, there are multiple attempts to present new tokens as belonging to ReachMe. Binance’s ‘CZ’ Zhao draws attention to ReachMe ReachMe gained popularity after Binance’s founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao added a link to his profile a few days ago. Zhao picked the project for explicit endorsement and is also seen as the inspiration behind ReachMe, suggesting the idea of paying with crypto to increase the chance of a response. Zhao explored the idea of pay-to-reach in a recent blog , aiming to filter and limit requests and irrelevant information. Later, Zhao received the pitch for ReachMe, an already working prototype for paid communication. The influence of Zhao was already big on X, leading to multiple contact requests. He tested different pricing tiers on ReachMe, raising fees up to 1 BNB ($625.30) for message requests. Previously, fees of 0.1 BNB and 0.04 BNB led to a flood of hundreds of messages. Zhao explained he tried to answer as many questions as possible, though finding the task overwhelming after opening his inbox for a lower fee. Zhao explained his goal is to set the price high enough to receive just 10 daily requests for outreach. He announced all proceeds from ReachMe will go toward supporting projects in the Binance ecosystem, or for buying tokens as a sign of support. Alternatively, the proceeds may go toward charity. For all the fees or donations in BNB I receive on my public address, I will donate or use them to help BSC community projects. I may simply buy some tokens with them. It's probably the simplest way to help BSC projects. For tokens on this address, I will ignore them for as long… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 27, 2025 Zhao said he liked the ReachMe system, and it could be useful for multiple crypto KOLs. Similar pay-to-reach systems have been set up with fiat, but this is the first crypto-only app that has the chance of becoming the main hub for the crypto community. ReachMe is already hosting several tiers of KOLs, with fees starting from 0.01 BNB. The highest fee was set by @Llamaxbt, asking for 69 BNB. Medium fees range from 0.5 to 1 BNB, as Zhao is still in this category. The new service is still testing the attention of users. Some of the accounts ended up receiving advertisements , which somewhat justified the fees. ReachMe’s popularity and fee potential depend mostly on X account outreach. Zhao’s account has been targeted mostly for Binance’s business opportunities. The flood of messages made Zhao request shorter communication with clear points while directing requests to the Binance team for technical questions. ReachMe is not the only service for paid influencer inboxes. Pay To Reach launched on March 24, also claiming to be inspired by Zhao’s post. The project offers point mining in addition to a paid inbox. The service, however, is still attracting KOLs and has not grown its list of influencers. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The asset has been consolidating in a defined accumulation zone, and several traders believe this phase could lead to a strong upward movement later this year. The Pectra upgrade, which introduces wallet improvements and efficiency enhancements, is tentatively scheduled for April 30, 2025, according to core developers. With Ethereum trading near the $2,000 level, experts say the asset is preparing for a breakout that could target much higher prices. Ethereum Price Consolidation Suggests Accumulation Phase Ethereum price has remained in a sideways pattern since 2023 and this consolidation has been described by analysts as an “accumulation box.” It refers to a period when traders and institutions gradually build positions while prices remain stable. Technical analysts have also identified a falling trend line that can be considered a major obstacle. According to them, the breaking of this price level is expected to trigger the start of the bull run for Ethereum. Based on this analysis, Crypto Patel believes that an Ethereum price macro breakout may occur after April, and this is supported by cyclical structures and on-chain data. Therefore, in the high timeframe (HTF), Patel has kept his bullish price prediction of Ethereum to $10,000 as definitive. Meanwhile, as per crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, “Really looking forward to the speed of the breakout above $2,150 for $ETH.” Pectra Upgrade to Launch on April 30 The Pectra upgrade, expected to take place on April 30th, is a significant event in the Ethereum ecosystem. This upgrade is meant to introduce a major increase in Ethereum’s throughput and transaction speed. Speaking of Pectra, Ethereum core developer, Terence, has reaffirmed that the upgrade is on track, and will be implemented unless the next core developers’ meeting has something different to say on the matter. The upgrade is expected to lessen the network load, increase rate per second, and increase security. ethereum wallets 2.0 coming next month in the pectra upgrade. → no token approvals → gasless transactions → passkey support → no re-sign for each transaction game-changer for ethereum’s ux with one signature to convert your current wallet into a smart wallet. now… — rip.eth (@ripdoteth) March 27, 2025 The Pectra update will also include features such as no-gas transactions and passkey integration and no token approval. The following changes are expected improve the usability of Ethereum as well as strengthen the platform’s standing in the industry. By so doing, Ethereum is expected to handle more volumes and accommodate more users as it scales. The update is not only positive in terms of technicality; it has added a new feature that allows people to pay gas fees using other tokens besides Ethereum. This could increase the utility and versatility of Ethereum even more and hence, attract more users and developers to it. Whale Accumulation Increases as Testnet Deployment Succeeds Following the successful deployment of the Pectra upgrade on the Hoodi testnet, Ethereum has seen significant whale accumulation. According to data from Lookonchain, several large whale addresses withdrew nearly 16,000 ETH, worth around $32 million, from major exchanges after the testnet upgrade. This move has sparked optimism in the market, with many viewing whale activity as a signal of potential bullish momentum. Whales often play an influential role in market sentiment. Their actions are closely watched by retail investors, and their accumulation typically triggers more buying interest. As Ethereum’s technical improvements are set to take effect, the optimism surrounding the Pectra upgrade is likely to fuel further price increases. Despite this positive sentiment, the Ethereum price faced a brief correction back to the $2,000 mark at press time. This correction is a typical market cycle following large price movements, but does not negate the overall bullish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. Analysts remain optimistic that Ethereum will regain momentum after the upgrade goes live.

This decision followed Binance’s delisting of Linear’s native token, LINA, causing a sharp decline in its market value. According to the protocol , the unexpected delisting worsened its existing issues, making it impossible to keep operating. Binance Delisting Sparks Linear Finance Token Price Crash Recall that Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, recently removed trading pairs for LINA. This decision caused a significant sell-off. Meanwhile, Linear Finance affirmed it did not receive a prior warning before Binance’s decision, leaving the protocol unprepared for the market reaction. Following LINA’s delisting announcement, its market value dropped from around $14 million to under $5 million. Unfortunately, the drop weakened the protocol’s financial stability. At the time of writing, LINA’s price has fallen about 28% in less than 24 hours. Linear Finance makes it easy to trade synthetic assets across different blockchains. However, since it launched, the platform has had difficulty attracting users and generating steady returns. Although the team has not provided a clear timeline for shutting down operations, users and investors are advised to withdraw any remaining funds from the platform. DeFi Sees Rising Institutional Interest Institutional investors are increasingly doubling their crypto ambitions , with 83% planning to boost their digital asset holdings in 2025. According to a report by Coinbase and consultancy firm EY-Parthenon, nearly three-quarters of the surveyed firms already hold cryptocurrencies beyond the usual Bitcoin and Ethereum staples. In parallel, decentralized finance platforms are also gaining traction. Although only 24% of institutions currently use DeFi, the reports predict this figure will triple to nearly 75% within the next two years. Institutions cited staking, derivatives, and lending as their primary use cases, followed by cross-border settlements, yield farming, and altcoin access. CFTC Crackdown on 3 DeFi Protocol Operations Meanwhile, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has cracked down on three DeFi protocols for neglecting to register the derivative trading they offer. As reported by TheCoinRise, the US commodities body placed orders on Opyn, ZeroEx, and Deridex protocols. The three companies were accused of providing unauthorized leveraged and margined retail commodities transactions in digital assets. According to the CFTC’s orders, Opyn, ZeroEx, and Deridex were asked to pay fines of $250,000, $200,000, and $100,000, respectively.

42488728,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/dogecoin-price-prediction-the-super-trend-indicator-reveals-whats-next-for-doge,1743096249,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/42488728.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Prediction - The Super Trend Indicator Reveals What’s Next For DOGE?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/dogecoin-price-prediction-the-super-trend-indicator-reveals-whats-next-for-doge,"The crypto market is poised for a major rebound in the second quarter, and Dogecoin appears all set to be among the top performers. With a 30% bounce-back since its March 11th bottom, DOGE is extremely close to a bullish monthly and quarterly close above $0.207. Top analysts warn that staying underexposed to the leading meme coin could mean leaving serious gains on the table. However, the key question now is whether sidelined investors have one last dip to take advantage of or should they buy Dogecoin at its current price. The Super Trend Indicator has the answer. Dogecoin Price Prediction — What’s Next For DOGE? Prominent analyst Ali Martinez has leveraged the popular Super Trend Indicator to forecast Dogecoin’s next move. According to his analysis, DOGE is set to enter a bullish phase once it decisively flips the $0.21 resistance level — a key barrier it has yet to overcome. The SuperTrend indicator suggests that #Dogecoin $DOGE could enter a bullish phase upon breaking the $0.21 resistance level. pic.twitter.com/5AcHM00mzS — Ali (@ali_charts) March 26, 2025 Similarly, Martinez has used the UTXO Realized Price Distribution to highlight $0.207 as a key resistance for Dogecoin, with $0.177 acting as a crucial support. Indeed, the $0.20–$0.22 zone is a critical range for DOGE to flip, as it houses both the 50-day EMA and SMA, along with the 50-week EMA and SMA — making it a confluence of key support and resistance levels. Considering that the Dogecoin price rejected from $0.204 on Wednesday, it could retest the falling wedge it broke out from earlier this week. The overbought RSI in the 4-hour chart supports this thesis. Sidelined investors may have one final opportunity to buy Dogecoin near the $0.18 mark before the meme coin’s parabolic breakout. Indeed, DOGE has a plethora of bullish narratives to rally on. The new pro-crypto SEC is expected to green light spot Dogecoin ETFs this year. Don’t mind Ethereum’s underwhelming inflows. Dogecoin has extreme mainstream popularity and the ETFs could prove to be a massive catalyst for its push towards new all-time highs. Meanwhile, Elon Musk continues to back DOGE — recently using ChatGPT’s new Studio Ghibli-style image generator to depict himself in the iconic ‘Presentation of Simba’ scene from The Lion King. Unsurprisingly, prominent analysts continue to be extremely bullish in the long term. Highlighting an ongoing formation of its 2014 - 2017 style rounding bottom, Trading Tardigade’s Dogecoin price prediction has the meme coin hitting $8 in the coming months. #Dogecoin Massive Moves 🔥 $Doge pic.twitter.com/4VnauS9xyA — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) March 26, 2025 While $8 may be a distant dream, there is a strong consensus that the Dogecoin price could hit $1 in 2025. Dogecoin Could 5x in 2025, While Solaxy Eyes a 10x Surge Besides Dogecoin, smart money investors are also betting on new meme coins with a unique value proposition. For instane, Solaxy (SOLX) continues to grab six-figure investments from whales and has surged past the $28 million mark in its presale, despite the broader market uncertainty. In a crowd of utility-less meme coins, Solaxy is the first prominent Solana layer-2 coin. Its scaling solution has already impressed investors with its cutting-edge design, which includes a ZK rollup, a deterministic sequencer, a Hyperlane-powered multi-chain bridge and data availability solutions like Celestia. While Solana isn’t commonly associated with L2s, its extreme network congestion during meme coin seasons has created a significant demand for one. With the next meme coin mania just around the corner, Solaxy promises low-latency fast transactions, high network throughput and zero downtime on both chains. The top Layer-2 projects in the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems have billion-dollar valuations. Experts, therefore, believe that SOLX is undervalued during its presale and could 10x following its launch.

Ripple’s Garlinghouse Confident Of XRP’s Inclusion To U.S. Stockpile After Landmark Legal Victory,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-moon-time-ripples-garlinghouse-confident-of-xrps-inclusion-to-u-s-stockpile-after-landmark-legal-victory/,"Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, anticipates a “wave of XRP ETF approvals” in 2025 and also sees XRP as part of the Donald Trump administration’s proposed digital asset stockpile. Garlinghouse’s optimism came after the favorable resolution of Ripple’s protracted legal brawl with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which concluded with the securities watchdog wrapping up its case against the blockchain firm last week. XRP In Line For ETFs In Second Half Of 2025 Several XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will go live in the second half of this year, said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a March 19 interview with Bloomberg Crypto. “I have immense confidence in the ETFs,” Garlinghouse posited when asked about his confidence in XRP’s prospects. As of March 20, roughly 10 companies had filed for spot XRP ETF vehicles in the US, including major issuers such as Bitwise, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, among others. American asset manager Franklin Templeton became the latest to join the XRP ETF race. Despite the increasing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — the largest spot Bitcoin ETF issuer — has yet to submit paperwork for its own XRP-based investment vehicle. “I think those will be live in the second half of this year,” Garlinghouse predicted. The Ripple boss noted that XRP exchange-traded products outside the United States are already seeing inflows while other crypto-based ETPs bleed investor cash. “I think that’s because you had this false negative pressure from the SEC, this kind of an exogenous hand holding things down that’s now being released,” he explained. The SEC’s dismissal of its years-long lawsuit against Ripple , ending over four years of legal action against the company for an alleged $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering, sparked a notable market reaction. In the immediate aftermath, the price of XRP surged by double digits to peak at $2.57, according to CoinGecko data. XRP also briefly overtook USDT to become the third-biggest crypto by market cap, behind only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). XRP Inclusion In U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile Discussing President Donald Trump’s planned crypto stockpile, Garlinghouse dismissed speculation of the exclusion of XRP, voicing confidence in the token’s inclusion: “XRP was named by the President of Truth Social. (He said) there’s gonna be a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a crypto stockpile that will include things like XRP. The CEO of Ripple told Bloomberg’s Sonali Basak that seized digital assets, including XRP, would create a crypto stockpile separate from the strategic Bitcoin reserve. The president’s executive order signed in early March explicitly indicates that the government would not purchase additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through criminal seizures.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BTC|ETH|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-27 17:26:53

While ETH remains a blue-chip crypto, this whale believes the emerging token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow stronger since its launch. Phase 3 of the presale has already sold out over 80% giving investors once in a lifetime opportunity before it ends. Over $5million has been accumulated and 7200 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.02 because the value will reach $0.025 as part of Phase 4. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 200% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. MUTM could hit $8.4 with the 14,000% Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 7200 investors put $5.4 million into the presale. During Phase 3 which presents the current trading value of $0.02 investors can expect a 25% price increase in Phase 4 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $8.4 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering a million-dollar giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining traction as a top DeFi contender, with Ethereum (ETH) whales recognizing its immense growth potential. With over 7,200 investors contributing $5.4 million and Phase 3 nearly sold out, early adopters have a rare chance to secure MUTM at $0.02 before the next price increase. The platform’s dual-lending system, secure stablecoin model, and lucrative incentives position it for explosive growth, with projections soaring to $8.4. Don’t miss out, invest in MUTM today and capitalize on this 14,000% upside before 2025.

42488909,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143984,1743096614,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive Growth: Sonic Labs Soars to $1 Billion TVL Milestone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sonic-labs-billion-tvl-milestone/,"In the ever-evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), milestones are constantly being achieved, but some truly stand out. Recently, Sonic Labs, formerly known as the Fantom Foundation, announced a monumental leap, catapulting into the DeFi big leagues by hitting a staggering $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). This is not just a number; it’s a testament to the platform’s growing influence and the trust it has garnered within the crypto community. Let’s dive into what this explosive growth means and why it’s such a significant achievement for Sonic Labs and the wider DeFi ecosystem. What is Total Value Locked (TVL) and Why Does $1 Billion Matter? Before we celebrate Sonic Labs’ incredible feat, it’s crucial to understand what TVL represents in the context of DeFi. Total Value Locked is essentially the aggregate value of all the crypto assets deposited in a particular DeFi protocol. Think of it as the lifeblood of DeFi platforms – the more value locked, the healthier and more robust the protocol is generally considered to be. Why is $1 billion in TVL such a big deal? Reaching this milestone signifies several crucial factors: Strong User Confidence: A high TVL indicates that a large number of users are entrusting their assets to the platform. This trust is earned through security, reliability, and the perceived potential for returns. Platform Maturity: Crossing the $1 billion mark often suggests that a DeFi protocol has moved beyond its initial stages and has established itself as a serious player in the market. Increased Liquidity: More TVL generally translates to greater liquidity within the platform. This is beneficial for users as it facilitates smoother trading and more efficient operations. Attracts Further Investment: Such a significant TVL figure acts as a magnet, attracting even more users and developers to the platform, creating a positive feedback loop for growth. In essence, $1 billion TVL is a psychological and practical threshold that validates a DeFi platform’s success and potential for future expansion. Sonic Labs: From Fantom Foundation to DeFi Powerhouse For those familiar with the crypto space, the name Fantom Foundation rings a bell. Now operating as Sonic Labs , this entity has been a key contributor to the Fantom ecosystem. The rebranding to Sonic Labs signals a strategic evolution, perhaps indicating a sharper focus on innovation and development within the DeFi space. This transition appears to be paying off handsomely, as evidenced by their rapid ascent to the $1 billion TVL mark. Sonic Labs has been instrumental in developing and supporting various projects within the Fantom network. Their expertise and commitment to building robust DeFi infrastructure have likely played a pivotal role in attracting projects and users to their ecosystem. This achievement isn’t just about reaching a number; it’s about the underlying technology, community, and vision that Sonic Labs embodies. Decoding the Factors Behind Sonic Labs’ Billion Dollar TVL Triumph What propelled Sonic Labs to this impressive $1 billion TVL milestone? Several factors likely contributed to this surge: Innovative DeFi Solutions: Sonic Labs likely offers compelling DeFi products and services that resonate with users. This could include high-yield farming opportunities, efficient lending and borrowing protocols, or unique staking mechanisms. Strong Community Support: A vibrant and engaged community is vital for any DeFi platform. Sonic Labs may have cultivated a loyal following through transparent communication, active engagement, and a user-centric approach. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with other key players in the crypto space can significantly boost a platform’s visibility and credibility. Strategic alliances could have broadened Sonic Labs’ reach and appeal. Fantom Network Advantages: The Fantom network itself, known for its speed and low transaction costs, provides a solid foundation for DeFi growth. Sonic Labs benefits from these inherent advantages, attracting users seeking efficient and affordable DeFi experiences. Market Momentum: Positive market sentiment and an overall bullish trend in the crypto market can contribute to increased TVL across DeFi platforms. While market conditions play a role, Sonic Labs’ underlying strengths are crucial for capitalizing on such trends. It’s likely a combination of these elements, executed effectively by the Sonic Labs team, that has led to this remarkable achievement. Benefits of Sonic Labs Reaching $1 Billion TVL The benefits of Sonic Labs achieving $1 billion in TVL extend beyond just the platform itself. This milestone has positive implications for various stakeholders: For Users: Increased opportunities for yield generation, enhanced liquidity, and a more robust and reliable DeFi ecosystem to participate in. For Developers: Validation of the Fantom network and the potential for building successful DeFi applications within the Sonic Labs ecosystem. This attracts more developers and innovation. For the Fantom Network: Strengthened reputation and increased adoption of the Fantom blockchain as a leading platform for DeFi. For the DeFi Space: Demonstrates the continued growth and maturation of the DeFi sector as a whole, showcasing its potential to become a significant part of the global financial landscape. Ultimately, Sonic Labs’ success contributes to the overall advancement and credibility of decentralized finance. Navigating the Challenges Ahead While reaching $1 billion TVL is a phenomenal achievement, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges that Sonic Labs , and indeed all DeFi platforms, face. These challenges include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The evolving regulatory landscape poses a significant challenge for DeFi. Platforms must navigate complex and often unclear regulations to ensure compliance and sustainability. Security Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities and potential exploits remain a constant threat in DeFi. Maintaining robust security measures is paramount to protect user funds and maintain trust.

Meme coins are still on fire, and 2025 is already proving that they’re not just a trend—they’re an entire vibe. From low-cap gems to serious community-driven tokens, the hunt for the next big meme coin is real. But with so many names flying around, the real challenge is figuring out which ones are actually worth betting on this week. Enter BTFD Coin. It’s not just riding the meme coin hype—it’s helping build it. With a 90% APY staking system, a thriving Bulls Squad community, and a presale that’s already raised over $6.42 million, BTFD is turning heads fast. But what’s adding serious FOMO right now? The 100% LAUNCH100 bonus that’s about to expire. BTFD Coin isn’t alone though. MOG, MEW, and NEIRO are also drawing attention—and together, these four projects make up some of the best meme coin presales to buy this week . BTFD Coin: The Staking Powerhouse With 2900% ROI Potential BTFD Coin is in its 15th presale stage, and things are getting spicy. With a current price of just $0.0002, over 72 billion tokens already sold, and a community of 11,600+ holders, this meme coin isn’t slowing down. The presale has brought in over $6.42 million—and there’s just one stage left before it hits the open market at a projected price of $0.0006. For those doing the math, a $7,000 investment now could turn into $21,000 at listing. But that’s not where the real story ends. If BTFD hits its moon target of $0.006 post-launch, that same $7,000 could transform into $210,000. That’s a wild 2900% ROI. Now here’s where it gets even better—staking. BTFD Coin offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY staking reward, which means users aren’t just holding tokens, they’re growing them. By locking in your tokens, you’re earning rewards passively, and with this kind of APY, the upside potential is enormous. The Bulls Squad—BTFD’s dedicated community—is all about maximizing these staking rewards and building long-term hype around the project. The project’s Play-to-Earn game, launched on January 1, 2025, adds a fun twist to the utility. Players earn tokens through gameplay, blending entertainment with passive income. But the hottest thing right now? That 100% LAUNCH100 bonus. Every buyer who enters the meme coin presale and uses the code “LAUNCH100” before March 30 will receive double the tokens. Two-for-one in crypto? That’s a rare opportunity. Wondering how to buy BTFD Coin? It’s simple. Just connect a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with ETH or BNB, then head to the presale page , enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code in all caps, and complete your purchase with your preferred currency. Once the presale ends, you’ll be able to claim your tokens and start staking. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD’s 90% APY on staking, $6.42M raised, and the limited-time double token bonus make it one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week. And with the final stage looming, this is the moment to lock in that potential 2900% gain. MOG: Humor Meets High Speed MOG started as a joke in July 2023—but it didn’t stay a joke for long. Built with a mission to inject fun into the often-intense world of crypto, MOG quickly carved a niche for itself with its quirky branding and ultra-fast transaction speeds. It’s not just a meme coin—it’s a whole meme culture. What makes MOG especially appealing to the community is how user-friendly it is. New investors love how easy it is to use, and longtime holders appreciate the steady vibe the project gives off. Plus, its community is highly active on social platforms, constantly creating and sharing content that keeps MOG in the spotlight. Why did this coin make it to this list? MOG’s blend of humor, branding, and smooth functionality has helped it stand out. It deserves a place among the top 4 alongside one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week. MEW: A Cat Breaking Into Dog Territory Cat in a Dog’s World—aka MEW—is exactly what it sounds like. A meme coin on the Solana blockchain that’s boldly entering the dog-dominated meme space. While most meme coins chase the usual canine clout, MEW is out here doing its own feline thing. Since its late March 2024 debut, MEW has gained traction fast. It’s got style, a solid token economy, and it’s riding the wave of Solana’s growing popularity. The brand’s rebellious personality and playful approach make it a favorite among younger investors looking for something different. Why did this coin make it to this list? MEW is challenging the status quo and doing it with flair. In a field crowded with bark, it’s the purr that caught attention—and that’s why it’s joining BTFD Coin as one of the best meme coins to buy this week. NEIRO: A New Spin on a Meme Classic NEIRO is a meme-based project that takes its inspiration from the OG—Dogecoin—but brings a modern twist. Launched on Ethereum and backed by a strong community, NEIRO gained traction quickly after listing on major exchanges. It’s clean, meme-savvy, and geared for viral growth. It’s also riding the Ethereum wave, with its smart contract stability and growing popularity in the DeFi space. NEIRO’s supporters believe in the coin’s narrative: fun meets functionality. Its roadmap includes community incentives, interactive memes, and limited NFT drops, helping it build momentum. Why did this coin make it to this list? NEIRO channels the spirit of early meme coins with a fresh face and Ethereum efficiency. That combo earns it a spot right alongside BTFD. The Final Thoughts The meme coin space in 2025 is bursting with opportunities, and the four coins above bring something special to the table. From the staking strength and P2E ecosystem of BTFD Coin to the cultural flair of MOG, MEW, and NEIRO, this lineup offers a spectrum of value that goes beyond pure speculation. BTFD Coin, in particular, is the only meme coin presale currently running—and it’s nearing the end of the line. With over $6.42 million raised, more than 72 billion tokens sold, a growing 11,600-strong holder base, and the 100% LAUNCH100 bonus ending March 30, time is running out to double your tokens and stake at 90% APY. BTFD isn’t just another project—it’s the one bringing energy back into the meme coin space. Don’t sleep on this. Join the best meme coin presales to buy this week —start with BTFD. FAQs What is the current stage of BTFD Coin’s presale? BTFD Coin is in Stage 15 of its presale, with one final stage to go before listing. What makes BTFD Coin’s staking unique? Its 90% APY staking lets users grow their token holdings rapidly while they wait for launch, making it a huge draw for early adopters. How do I apply the LAUNCH100 bonus for BTFD Coin? During checkout on the presale page, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in the bonus field, and confirm your transaction to receive 2X tokens. Are any of the other coins in presale too? No, BTFD Coin is the only project currently in a meme coin presale. The others are live and trading. What’s the expected ROI if BTFD Coin hits $0.006? If you invest $7,000 at $0.0002 and BTFD hits $0.006, that could grow into $210,000—an estimated 2900% ROI.

After the bullish rally, investors switch to demand for passive income. Tokenized securities have been growing in the past two months, following Bitcoin (BTC) record prices. Research by Messari shows a shift toward tokenized securities, which grow their supply following a market peak. Tokenized bonds are the most reliable basis for tokenization, while stocks lag due to regulatory doubts and general market fluctuations. Tokenized treasuries serve as risk-off assets, offering low but secure passive income. Messari’s data shows that the crypto market is currently in the expansion stage for tokenized securities. Tokenized treasuries tend to rise after crypto market tops, indicating a shift to yield-bearing assets when sentiment dips. In contrast, stablecoins align closely with market prices, acting as a proxy for liquidity demand, while tokenized treasuries indicate a move towards… pic.twitter.com/0OixaHLS2O — Messari (@MessariCrypto) March 27, 2025 The most common type of tokenized security is US treasury debt, which is used within RWA protocols in addition to stablecoins. Tokenized debt grows independent of the supply of stablecoins, which expands and contracts based on general market cycles. The growth of tokenization happened despite the slowdown of Ethereum (ETH) and the fall of BTC from a top above $109,000. Demand for tokenized treasuries comes from protocols that are shifting their volatile crypto earnings into more secure holdings. Tokenized US treasuries lead the way Tokenized US treasuries are the fastest-growing type of RWA after private debt. In the past months, tokenized treasuries expanded to $4.6B, based on data by RWA.xyz. Messari’s approach estimates a higher number, up to $4.8B in tokenized treasuries. Tokenized government bonds or T-bills were the fastest-growing tokenization category after private debt. | Source: RWA.xyz The sector has grown about 20% in the first quarter of 2024, marked by a drawdown for all other crypto assets. According to Ondo Finance, the growth of tokenized securities is even faster than the initial expansion of stablecoins. The current supply was achieved in just two years, while stablecoins took more than four years to grow to that level during the early stages of the crypto market. On-chain data shows there are a total of 23 government security products, most of which serve as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto tokens. Most of the issuance of tokenized US treasuries is linked to six entities , with BlackRock’s BUIDL among the most prominent token offerings. Other top issuers include Hashnote, Franklin Templeton, Ondo Finance, Securitize, Superstate, and Spiko. The top 5 issuers carry more than 78% of all bond-backed tokens. The tokenization market has also grown more diverse in the past few quarters. At the initial stage, most of the market was covered by BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Recently, new tokenization inflows came from Securitize and Hashnote. The landscape of tokenized US treasuries is shifting based on demand. Even BlackRock’s BUIDL decreased its supply to around 370M tokens, spread among 37 holders, after lowered demand. At the same time, other issuers expanded their products. The tokenized bonds product landscape became more diverse in the past quarter. | Source: Dune Analytics Those large-scale issuers use yield-bearing stablecoins to wrap their security offerings, achieving risk-free fixed income. The yield-bearing stablecoins are not widely used for crypto tasks, payments or DeFi, but are instead a part of the portfolio for other projects and funds. Additionally, a handful of smaller startups have tokenized around $200M in US and international debt. Tokenized debt has still not reached retail buyers and is mostly used by whales and protocols to support other assets or as a strategic reserve. Currently, BENJI by Franklin Templeton is the only fund available for US-based retail buyers. On-chain data shows products are often used at the protocol level to back up new types of stablecoins for DeFi lending or other tasks. The availability of tokenized US T-bills allows protocols to park their earnings from bull markets into a secure cash-like asset with additional passive income. The tokenization of reliable securities also legitimizes the crypto market and on-chain assets. Tokenized security issuers mostly use Ethereum for their tokenization as a legacy network with sufficient users and liquidity. Franklin Templeton uses the most diverse set of chains, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, and Stellar. Recently, BlackRock’s BUIDL also added Solana as the next tokenization platform.

Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as the selling influx was abruptly taken, suppressing the price to $2.306 during the day. The RSI decreased up to 46.40 at the same time but remains in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.85 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $16.69 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Ripple announced that it is partnering with BDACS in Korea. BDACS will use Ripple custody for secure infrastructure for XRP, RLUSD, and other crypto assets. The network said the partnership will help institutional and XRPL developer growth. XRP partners with BDACS XRP is one of the most trending cryptocurrencies at the moment. XRP’s recent surge in popularity has ignited speculation of a price jump to $100 among enthusiasts, while some analysts remain skeptical.

XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP achieved a peak price of $3.19 and was trading near the $2.90 level in February, while it has stepped down to $2.1 in March.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-27 17:35:08

42489296,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143985,1743097210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Bank of America’s ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’ Signal – Crypto Opportunity?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sell-dollar-rallies-crypto-opportunity/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and forex trading, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. Imagine a scenario where a major financial institution like Bank of America Securities issues a clear directive: ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’. For those invested in or closely watching the crypto markets, this isn’t just Wall Street jargon; it’s a potential power shift signal that could reshape investment strategies. What does this bold advice mean for your crypto portfolio and the broader financial landscape? Let’s decode this critical market insight. Decoding ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’: What Does It Really Mean? When Bank of America Securities recommends to ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’, it’s essentially a strategic call to action for investors. But to truly grasp its significance, we need to break down what ‘dollar rallies’ are and why selling them might be a prudent move. A ‘dollar rally’ refers to a period where the US dollar experiences a strengthening in its value against other currencies. This can be triggered by various factors, including positive US economic data, increased demand for safe-haven assets, or shifts in interest rate expectations. However, Bank of America’s advice suggests a perspective that these rallies are likely to be short-lived and unsustainable. It implies an anticipation of underlying weaknesses in the dollar’s fundamentals that will eventually lead to a reversal of these upward movements. In simpler terms, they’re saying: ‘Don’t be fooled by temporary dollar strength; the bigger picture points to a weaker dollar in the medium to long term.’ Key takeaways from ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’ advice: Anticipation of Dollar Weakness: It’s a strong signal that a major financial player foresees a weakening US dollar, despite any temporary gains. Strategic Trading Opportunity: For traders, it suggests opportunities to profit by betting against the dollar when it rallies. Broader Economic Implications: A weaker dollar can have far-reaching effects on global trade, inflation, and, importantly, cryptocurrency markets. Why the US Dollar Outlook is Turning Bearish? To understand the rationale behind advising to ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’, we need to delve into the factors influencing the US dollar outlook . Several key elements are contributing to a potentially bearish sentiment on the dollar: Factors Weighing on the US Dollar: Factor Description Impact on USD Federal Reserve Policy Expectations around interest rate cuts or a slower pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve can diminish the dollar’s appeal. A dovish stance tends to weaken the currency. Negative US Economic Data Weaker-than-expected economic indicators, such as GDP growth, employment figures, or inflation data, can erode confidence in the US economy and, consequently, the dollar. Negative Geopolitical Risks (Paradoxically, sometimes positive for USD, but changing) Traditionally, geopolitical uncertainty often drives investors towards the safe-haven dollar. However, evolving global dynamics and alternative safe havens might be reducing this effect. Furthermore, some geopolitical events might negatively impact the US economy. Potentially Negative (Shifting Dynamics) Growing National Debt The expanding US national debt and concerns about fiscal sustainability can exert downward pressure on the dollar over the long term. Negative (Long-term) Currency Diversification by Central Banks Some central banks globally are exploring diversification away from the US dollar in their reserves, which could gradually reduce demand for the dollar. Negative (Long-term) These factors collectively paint a picture where the tailwinds that previously supported dollar strength might be diminishing, paving the way for a potentially weaker dollar environment. The Ripple Effect: How a Dollar Sell-Off Could Fuel Crypto Markets? Now, let’s connect the dots to cryptocurrency. Why is a potential dollar sell-off relevant to the crypto world? The relationship is multifaceted and potentially very beneficial for digital assets: Crypto as an Alternative Asset Class: Inverse Correlation: Historically, there has often been an inverse correlation between the US dollar and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When the dollar weakens, assets priced in dollars, such as Bitcoin, can become more attractive to investors holding other currencies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: A weaker dollar can contribute to inflationary pressures. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin with its limited supply, are often viewed as a hedge against inflation. If investors anticipate dollar devaluation and rising inflation, they might turn to crypto as a store of value. Risk-On Sentiment: A declining dollar can sometimes signal a broader ‘risk-on’ sentiment in markets. Investors may become more willing to move capital into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies, moving away from the perceived safety of the dollar. Global Liquidity: A weaker dollar can ease global financial conditions, increasing liquidity in emerging markets and potentially freeing up capital that could flow into crypto markets. Essentially, if Bank of America’s ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’ advice is prescient and a dollar sell-off materializes, it could act as a significant tailwind for the cryptocurrency market, potentially driving prices higher and attracting new investment. Navigating Forex Market Trends in a Weak Dollar Scenario? For those actively involved in forex and crypto trading, understanding how to navigate forex market trends in a potentially weak dollar environment is crucial. Here are some strategies and considerations: Strategies for a Weak Dollar Forex Market: Long Positions in Other Currencies: Consider taking long positions in currencies that are expected to strengthen against the dollar. This could include currencies of countries with strong economies, rising interest rates, or those benefiting from commodity booms. Examples might include the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, or Canadian Dollar depending on the specific global economic context. Commodity Currencies: Currencies of commodity-exporting nations (like AUD, CAD, NZD) often benefit from a weaker dollar as commodities are typically priced in USD. A weaker dollar can lead to higher commodity prices, boosting these economies and their currencies. Emerging Market Currencies (Selective Approach): Some emerging market currencies might become attractive as investors seek higher yields in a low-dollar environment. However, this requires careful selection and risk assessment as emerging markets can be more volatile. Gold and Silver: Precious metals, like gold and silver, often have an inverse relationship with the dollar and can act as safe-haven assets and inflation hedges in a weakening dollar scenario. Diversification: Diversify your portfolio across different currencies and asset classes to mitigate risk and capitalize on various market opportunities. Don’t be overly reliant on any single currency or asset. USD Forecast and Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors? Predicting the future with certainty is impossible, but considering expert opinions like Bank of America’s ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’ advice and analyzing current economic indicators can help formulate a reasonable USD forecast and actionable strategies for crypto investors. Potential USD Forecast and Crypto Actions: Scenario: Gradual Dollar Weakening: If the dollar weakens gradually over time due to the factors discussed earlier, this could create a sustained positive environment for cryptocurrencies. Action: Consider a strategy of accumulating crypto assets, particularly fundamentally strong projects, on dips. Diversify across different types of cryptocurrencies. Scenario: Sharp Dollar Sell-Off: A rapid and significant dollar sell-off, perhaps triggered by a major economic event or policy shift, could lead to a more immediate and dramatic surge in crypto prices. Action: Be prepared for increased volatility. Ensure you have appropriate risk management strategies in place. Consider taking some profits if prices surge rapidly, but maintain a core long-term crypto portfolio. Scenario: Dollar Recovers Unexpectedly: It’s crucial to acknowledge that forecasts are not guarantees. If the dollar unexpectedly recovers strength, perhaps due to unforeseen positive US economic developments or a shift in Fed policy, crypto markets could face downward pressure. Action: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Maintain a balanced portfolio that includes assets outside of crypto. Use stop-loss orders to protect against significant downside risk. Regularly reassess your investment thesis based on evolving market conditions. Ultimately, the ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’ advice from Bank of America Securities serves as a potent reminder to pay close attention to macroeconomic trends and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. A weakening dollar could indeed be a significant catalyst for crypto growth, but navigating this landscape requires informed decision-making, strategic diversification, and a keen awareness of both opportunities and risks. In conclusion, the call to ‘Sell Dollar Rallies’ isn’t just forex advice; it’s a potential green light for crypto enthusiasts. By understanding the drivers behind a potentially weaker dollar and its implications for alternative assets, investors can position themselves to potentially capitalize on the evolving financial landscape. Keep a watchful eye on the dollar’s trajectory – it could be the key to unlocking the next chapter of crypto growth.

The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum after reaching this level, dipping to a low of $85,842. BTC is down over 1% and trading around $86,250. BTC continues to face selling pressure closer to the $90,000 mark. However, the shallow pullback suggests bulls are not ceding ground, and traders view the price dips as buying opportunities. Bitcoin bulls have maintained consistent pressure as they look to push the price above $90,000. There have been several positive signs in favor of Bitcoin bulls, including consistent inflows in US Bitcoin ETFs, indicating that institutional interest in the asset is picking up again. Blockchain Group Purchases 580 BTC The Blockchain Group, A tech firm based in France, has announced the purchase of 580 BTC valued at $50.64 million, significantly strengthening its position among global Bitcoin holders. The latest acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to 620 BTC and aligns with its long-term strategy of accumulating and holding BTC as a reserve asset. The Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy began in November 2024, when the firm started purchasing the asset to optimize its cash reserves. The latest purchase was made through its subsidiary, The Blockchain Group Luxembourg SA, and was financed using proceeds from a convertible bond issuance in early March. The firm has said its Bitcoin acquisition strategy is driven by the asset’s unique attributes of security, unparalleled scarcity, and decentralization. “The Blockchain Group confirms the acquisition of 580 BTC for ~€47.3 million, the holding of a total of 620 BTC , and a BTC Yield of 709.8% YTD. Confirmation of the acquisition of 580 BTC for ~€47.3 million at ~€81,550 per bitcoin. Total group holdings of 620 BTC for ~€50.5 million at ~€81,480 per bitcoin.” GameStop Stock Slides After Company Announces Bitcoin Plan GameStop (GME) stock dropped over 6% in premarket trading on Thursday after the company announced plans to raise over $1 billion to buy Bitcoin. The company plans to raise the funds through convertible senior notes. The news comes after GameStop stocks soared over 12% after the company announced its board had unanimously approved an update to its investment policy, allowing it to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The planned investment in the flagship cryptocurrency comes after several reports suggested GameStop was planning cryptocurrency investments. However, Wall Street analysts are hesitant to conclude that GameStop’s investment in Bitcoin would give the video game retailer’s stock upside. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter stated, “The company's strategy, which has changed about six times in three years, is they're going to buy cryptocurrency and be just like MicroStrategy. The problem with that thinking is MicroStrategy trades at about two times their Bitcoin holdings. If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their $4.6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings,] the stock would drop five bucks.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Analysts have concluded that Bitcoin ( BTC) retains a $138,000 price target for 2025 as the market stages a recovery from the US trade tariffs. According to data from Polymarket, BTC could still gain 60% from current levels. Bull market predictions have taken a backseat this year, with the crypto market being battered by multiple adverse events. According to the latest assessment, the bull market may be capped at around 60%. The results were uploaded on X and showed that price bets extended all the way down to $59,000. The user who posted the results stated, “The great thing about this analysis is that it not only provides a market sentiment score, like the Fear and Greed Index but also attaches to it the expected price target for both bearish and bullish scenarios. This offers a reference to compare one's price prediction with the market's.” The user also deconstructed the methodology used to analyze the odds across multiple Polymarket arenas, leading to a potential price range extending from $59,000 to $138,600. “The $138k Bitcoin price target may not seem bullish to most Bitcoiners, who are accustomed to hearing hyperbolic valuations. However, the market remains conservative as it recovers from the Trump tariff uncertainty.” Meanwhile, BTC’s price action hit a wall of resistance this week, draining bullish momentum as the flagship asset struggles to surpass the resistance between $88,000 and $90,000. BTC registered a substantial increase on Wednesday as markets rallied, surging over 5% to cross the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $86,878. However, the rally was short-lived as BTC was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 3%, slipping below the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $84,215. Price action remained bearish on Friday and Saturday as the price registered marginal declines and settled at $83,822. Sentiment changed on Sunday as buying pressure returned. As a result, BTC rose nearly 3%, crossing the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $86,116. Source: TradingView BTC surged to an intraday high of $88,839 on Monday as it started the week on a bullish note. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $87,523, ultimately registering an increase of 1.63%. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday as it encountered selling pressure and volatility, resulting in a marginal decline. Volatility and bearish sentiment persisted on Wednesday as the price dropped 0.54% to $86,942. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Buyers will look to retain control and push the price towards $90,000. A break above $90,000 could set BTC on a course to $100,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency could slip below the $85,000 support level if sellers regain control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42489809,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=701248,1743097509,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42489809.jpeg,Crypto billionaire Justin Sun graces the daily cover of Forbes,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/justin-sun-graces-the-daily-cover-of-forbes/,"Justin Sun, the 34-year-old founder of Tron, landed the daily cover of Forbes after dumping over $80 million into Donald Trump’s crypto startup, World Liberty Financial, helping the U.S. president and his family pocket around $400 million. The cash came in during a chaotic stretch—Trump had just returned to the White House, and Sun was facing an SEC lawsuit over fraud and securities violations. The Trump project had been spiraling. The company’s pitch deck, called the “Gold Paper,” featured Trump painted gold and posed like a comic book hero. It offered no real product, no liquidity, no equity, and no legit leadership. Justin still wired $30 million in November 2024, only three weeks after Trump won the election. “I see WLF as a strong player in the financial technology space,” he said at the time. He then called Trump a “cheat code for crypto” and threw in $45 million more, with 75% of that going straight to Trump, per company terms. Sun injects millions while SEC backs off The entire WLF token structure meant that any money over $30 million raised would mostly go to the Trump family. That’s exactly what happened. Then Trump launched $TRUMP, his meme coin, in January 2025. Justin put even more cash in. He didn’t profit much—he couldn’t even access the funds—but the Trump family walked away with hundreds of millions. Senator Chris Murphy said on the Senate floor in March, “This is essentially Trump posting his Venmo for anyone to secretly wire him as much money as they want.” Forbes cover with a portrait photo of Justin Sun. Source: Forbes Justin got something in return. The SEC dropped lawsuits against crypto companies like Coinbase and Kraken right after Trump returned to power. The agency also paused its case against Justin. He had been accused of wash trading and pushing unregistered tokens through celebrities like Jake Paul and Lindsay Lohan. Those charges are still live, but they’re now frozen. Justin was immediately named an advisor to World Liberty Financial. His early interest in Trump came from watching The Apprentice reruns in middle school in Huizhou, a city in southern China. His teacher told the class to learn English from TV, and Justin used BitTorrent to download Trump episodes—years before he owned BitTorrent himself. He said he admired Trump’s showmanship, competition mindset, and oversized ego. “It was natural for The Apprentice to become popular in China,” Justin said. He saw Trump’s branding style as an asset. And when Trump’s crypto company started falling apart, he jumped in. Tron copies Ethereum, outgrows it in payments Justin has always moved fast. He created Tron in 2017, claiming it was faster and cheaper than Ethereum. He bought Poloniex and HTX exchanges after watching what Binance and FTX did. He created SunSwap after watching Uniswap grow. By copying other projects and using low fees, he grew Tron’s user base to 300 million. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao helped push Tron. In 2017, Binance managed Tron’s $70 million ICO just before China banned ICOs. In 2018, Binance added Tron to its Gold Label Project, which made it the default for USDT stablecoin transfers. That drove a massive increase in usage. By the end of 2019, Tron had over $1 billion worth of Tether moving across it, jumping from $100 million in just a few months. Binance helped by offering 16% interest on Tether held on Tron and removing withdrawal fees. Even when Binance paid over $4 billion in penalties to the U.S. in 2023, and CZ did a prison stint in 2024, Tron was already too deep in the system to slow down. Chris Maurice, CEO of Yellow Card, said, “Any time I refer to stablecoins, you can just assume that about 70% of it is USDT on Tron.” Yellow Card operates in 20 African countries. Tron’s low fees made it perfect for people sending small amounts, especially in emerging markets. In 2024, Tron’s transaction volume hit $500 billion monthly. Illicit crypto transactions flood Tron But with volume came dirty money. TRM Labs reported that 58% of illicit crypto activity in 2024 happened on Tron. That includes over $10 billion in illegal flows, more than both Bitcoin and Ethereum combined. Inca Digital reported that Hezbollah and Hamas used Tron to move at least $2 billion. Justin said he’s trying to fix that. In September, Tron, Tether, and TRM Labs formed the T3 Financial Crime Unit, which claims to have frozen $130 million in bad funds. Still, U.S. firms aren’t buying it. Circle cut ties with Tron. In December 2024, Coinbase delisted wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), saying in court, “Mr. Sun’s affiliation with—and potential control over—wBTC presented an unacceptable risk to its customers and the integrity of its exchange.” Justin’s companies, Tron and BitTorrent, were accused by the SEC of fabricating trading volume to pump the price of TRX. The agency said employees created multiple accounts to fake demand. Sun also allegedly paid celebrities to shill the tokens without disclosing payments. He didn’t comment on the SEC case. But by giving Trump a financial lifeline right after the election, he may have bought himself breathing room. While he hasn’t met Trump himself, Justin has spent time with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who run World Liberty alongside Steve Witkoff’s son. Justin is banking on Trump’s reach to boost crypto’s reputation. “$TRUMP really breaks the boundaries between Web3 and the traditional world,” he said. He also claimed that after $TRUMP launched, his exchange HTX gained 1 million users in one week—mostly from China, where crypto is banned. He added, “The Chinese government doesn’t want to be seen as banning Trump. I think they are afraid of somebody telling Trump that the Chinese government is banning your coin.” Forbes values Sun at $8.5 billion, but warns it could be much higher Justin told Forbes his net worth is over $40 billion, including crypto, art, and an Airbus 330 jet. He said he owns a Warhol, a Picasso, and big stacks of bitcoin and ether. But Forbes estimates the number at $8.5 billion, since many of his assets are unverifiable or stored in other people’s names. Even so, with the SEC stepping off, his real number might climb. He was born in 1990 in Qinghai, near Tibet, and moved to Guangdong at age 4. His mother was a sports journalist, and his father reported on politics. He was into literature, won a national writing contest in 2007, and entered Peking University to become a writer. He later switched to global history. “Because of this, I see the world as a unified place,” Justin said. In 2011, he went to the University of Pennsylvania, where Trump also studied, and got a master’s in political economy. In 2012, after reading about Bitcoin, he got obsessed, joined online forums, and ended up as Ripple’s chief rep in China by 2013. But even there, he rubbed people the wrong way. A former Ripple colleague said, “He always said he had connections to the Chinese Communist Party and the government, but to be honest, I don’t think any of those connections were helpful at all… He is money-hungry.” Justin left Ripple in 2015 and launched Tron in 2017. Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin accused Tron of stealing text from Ethereum’s white paper. Juan Benet, founder of Filecoin, said nine pages were lifted from his own docs. Vitalik once tweeted, “Control+C + Control+V much higher efficiency than keyboard typing new content.” Justin didn’t deny the similarities and said, “Ethereum compatibility was very important.” Sun eats bananas, buys meme coins, and plans for AI Justin has a long record of making weird headlines. In 2019, he paid $4.6 million to win a lunch with Warren Buffett, then canceled last minute. He later did the lunch a year later. In 2021, he paid $28 million to ride Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin spaceship, then missed the launch over “scheduling.” In November 2024, he paid $6.2 million for Maurizio Cattelan’s “The Comedian,” a banana duct-taped to a wall—and then ate it in front of reporters in Hong Kong ten days later. Justin Sun eating his banana at a press conference. Source: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images He calls himself “His Excellency,” a title from his appointment as WTO ambassador for Grenada. He also claims to be prime minister of Liberland, a self-declared microstate on the Danube River. On citizenship, he told Forbes, “I think we can put St. Kitts, probably.” When asked why he pulls these stunts, Justin said, “Most people probably think I do these things because I want to get everybody’s attention. But actually, when I do things in crypto that come to reality, that is when I get most of it.” Behind the show, his businesses are growing. His DeFi platform SunSwap, built on Tron, saw over $4 billion in wrapped token trades in December 2024 alone. His meme coin generator SunPump, a copy of Solana’s meme factory, has launched 97,000 tokens since August. They’ve made $37 million so far, compared to Solana’s $600 million in 2024. Justin says Asia will drive the next meme wave. “I think meme coins are capitalizing the internet itself,” he said. He’s now thinking about how crypto can power AI systems. He said that when AIs hire each other, traditional payments can’t keep up. “That’s gonna take probably six months to do it in the first place,” he said. “But on a highly scalable network, everything can be done in five minutes or five seconds.” As for what happens next, Justin made it clear: “I want to be a builder of the future world. But first, we have to imagine what the future world will be.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

42489654,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143996,1743097806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breaking: SEC Chair Nominee Atkins Abandons Crypto Lobbying Ahead of Crucial Hearing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-chair-nominee-atkins-crypto/,"In a significant development for the cryptocurrency world, Paul Atkins, President Trump’s pick for the next U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, has made a noteworthy move. Just ahead of his crucial confirmation hearing, Atkins has officially resigned from prominent crypto lobbying groups. This decision is generating buzz and raising eyebrows across the digital asset landscape. What could this mean for the future of crypto regulation in the United States? Let’s dive into the details. Why is the SEC Chair Nominee’s Resignation a Big Deal? For those unfamiliar, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a pivotal role in shaping the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. As the chair of this powerful body, Paul Atkins would be at the forefront of decisions impacting everything from ICOs and crypto exchanges to digital asset classifications. His background and affiliations are therefore under intense scrutiny, especially as the crypto industry seeks clearer regulatory guidelines. Atkins’ nomination itself was already a point of discussion. Now, his resignation from the Digital Chamber of Commerce and the Token Alliance, two influential organizations advocating for the crypto industry, adds another layer of intrigue. These groups work to promote understanding and acceptance of digital assets and blockchain technology. His prior involvement suggested a potential understanding, if not outright support, for the crypto space. So, why the sudden shift? Unpacking Atkins’ Departure from Crypto Lobbying The timing of this resignation is particularly noteworthy. With his confirmation hearing scheduled for March 27th, Atkins’ decision to sever ties with these crypto lobbying groups signals a clear attempt to avoid any perceived conflicts of interest. Disclosing a substantial $328 million in assets, Atkins is demonstrably taking steps to ensure a smooth confirmation process and maintain public trust in his impartiality. Let’s break down the key organizations he’s stepping away from: Digital Chamber of Commerce: A leading trade association representing the digital asset and blockchain industry. They advocate for policies that foster innovation and growth in the sector. Token Alliance: An initiative of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, specifically focused on promoting the responsible growth of the token economy. They work to educate policymakers and the public about tokens and digital assets. By resigning from these positions, Atkins is sending a strong message: he intends to approach the SEC chair role with objectivity and without undue influence from his past affiliations. This could be interpreted as a strategic move to gain bipartisan support during his confirmation process. Confirmation Hearing: Scrutiny and Financial Disclosures The upcoming confirmation hearing is now even more significant. Senators will likely probe Atkins on his views regarding cryptocurrency regulation, especially in light of his recent resignations. His financial disclosures, revealing $328 million in assets, will also be under the microscope. Transparency is crucial in such high-profile appointments, and Atkins appears to be proactively addressing potential concerns. Beyond resigning from lobbying groups, Atkins has also pledged to: Step down as CEO of Patomak Global Partners: His consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners, provides regulatory and strategic advice to financial services companies. Leaving this role eliminates another potential conflict of interest. Divest stock options in Securitize: Securitize is a company involved in tokenizing securities. Divesting from stock options in this firm further demonstrates Atkins’ commitment to avoiding conflicts related to digital assets. These actions collectively paint a picture of a nominee meticulously preparing to address any ethical questions that might arise during his confirmation. But what does this all mean for the future of crypto regulation itself? Implications for Crypto Regulation: A Shift in Stance? Atkins’ resignation from crypto advocacy groups might suggest a more cautious or even potentially stricter approach to crypto regulation than some in the industry might have hoped for. While his past involvement with the Digital Chamber of Commerce and Token Alliance might have initially signaled a crypto-friendly stance, his recent actions introduce an element of uncertainty. Here are a few possible interpretations: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: His distancing from lobbying groups could indicate an intention to enforce stricter regulations and oversight on the crypto market to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Neutral Stance: It might simply reflect a commitment to impartiality. As SEC chair, Atkins needs to be seen as neutral and fair to all stakeholders, not just crypto advocates. Resigning from these groups could be a way to project that neutrality. Strategic Maneuvering: This could be a calculated move to ensure a smoother confirmation process. By preemptively addressing potential conflict-of-interest concerns, Atkins may be aiming to garner broader support from senators who might be wary of crypto industry influence. Ultimately, the precise implications will depend on Atkins’ actions and policies if he is confirmed as SEC chair. His confirmation hearing will provide valuable insights into his regulatory philosophy and his vision for the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. Stay Informed and Adapt to Evolving Crypto Regulation The developments surrounding Paul Atkins’ nomination and resignation underscore the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of crypto regulation. For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, staying informed and adaptable is more critical than ever. Whether you are an investor, a developer, or a business operating in the crypto sector, understanding the regulatory landscape is paramount for navigating the future. Key takeaways for navigating this evolving environment: Monitor Regulatory News: Keep a close watch on announcements and developments from the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Seek Legal Counsel: Consult with legal professionals specializing in cryptocurrency and securities law to ensure compliance. Engage in Industry Discussions: Participate in industry forums and discussions to stay abreast of emerging trends and regulatory interpretations. Prepare for Different Scenarios: Develop contingency plans to adapt to various regulatory outcomes, whether they are more lenient or more stringent. The crypto industry is at a crucial juncture, and the leadership of the SEC will significantly shape its trajectory. Paul Atkins’ decisions in the coming weeks and months will be closely watched by the entire crypto community. In conclusion, Paul Atkins’ resignation from crypto lobbying groups is a significant event that adds complexity to his SEC chair nomination. While it may signal a potentially more cautious regulatory approach, it also demonstrates a commitment to transparency and avoiding conflicts of interest. The confirmation hearing will be a pivotal moment for understanding his vision for crypto regulation and its future impact on the digital asset space. The crypto world awaits with bated breath.

This seizure was part of a terrorist financing operation that laundered over $1.5 million in virtual currency since October 2024, according to the DOJ. According to court documents, Hamas supporters used an encrypted platform to distribute at least 17 cryptocurrency addresses for donations. The funds were laundered through exchanges and brokers before being funneled into operational wallets. The seizure targeted assets held in accounts registered to Palestinian individuals in Turkey and other locations. “Hamas is responsible for the deaths of many U.S. and Israeli nationals, and we will use every legal tool at our disposal to stop their campaign of terror and murder,” said U.S. Attorney Edward R.

Despite the magnitude of this event, Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers predicts volatility will remain low. On Deribit alone, expiring contracts account for 45% of the platform’s open options. There is currently $27 billion of open interest in Bitcoin contracts on the exchange, with a put/call ratio of 0.52, suggesting a slight pessimism among traders. In options trading, call options give buyers the right to buy an asset at a predetermined price before expiration and typically signal bullish sentiment. Conversely, put options allow investors to sell at a specified price before expiration and are often used as a hedge against price declines. Analysts at Singapore-based crypto trading desk QCP Capital have set $85,000 as the maximum loss point for this expiration. Related News: BREAKING: Unexpected Listing from Coinbase - They List Rival Surprise Altcoin on Futures Deribit’s Implied Volatility Index (DVOL), a key measure of expected price fluctuations over the next 30 days, currently stands at 47. Strijers noted that this level is relatively low and comparable to what was seen in February and August 2024. This suggests limited expectations for large price swings. DVOL functions as the cryptocurrency equivalent of the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which measures expected volatility in the stock market based on S&P 500 index options. Even after US President Donald Trump announced that he would impose a 25% tariff on vehicle imports, DVOL fell to 46, reinforcing the view that market movements were limited. Macroeconomic uncertainty persists despite relatively calm options markets. “Uncertainty around U.S. tariffs remains high and lack of clarity is causing anxiety in the equity market,” Strijers said, adding that the U.S. dollar and gold prices remain elevated. Additionally, the potential impact of Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin movements remains a topic of debate. The dormant exchange transferred “large amounts” of Bitcoin this month, some of which was redirected to Kraken. While Glassnode analysts report that there is no significant on-chain evidence to suggest that creditors will be repaid anytime soon, the possibility remains. *This is not investment advice.

Berachain ( BERA ) price rose to $8.60 on Thursday, up 60% from its lowest point in March. The ongoing surge has come as network growth gains momentum. A good example is the decentralized exchange industry, where protocols built on Berachain are gaining traction. DeFi Llama data shows that the weekly volume handled by these protocols rose by 105% to $519 million. This increase has pushed the cumulative volume handled by the network to $2.17 billion, with most of the activity coming from BEX, which processed $364 million in the past seven days. Volumes on other DEXs within the Berachain ecosystem, such as Kodiak, Bulla Exchange, and Amped Finance, also rose by over 100%. Berachain’s total value locked in DeFi is also rising, making it the seventh-biggest chain in crypto. Its assets have jumped by 40% in the last 30 days to $2.94 billion, while its stablecoin market cap crossed the $2 billion milestone. Berachain’s growth in the DeFi and DeX industry has grown at a time when other large chains like Solana ( SOL ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Tron ( TRX ) are slowing. The TVL of these three chains has dropped by over 20% in the past 30 days. BERA has also surged following the launch of proof of liquidity, a feature that helps decentralize the network.

It rose from this month’s low of $5.2830 to a high of $9.50, and remains slightly above the 50-period moving average. Most importantly, the token has formed a cup and handle pattern, with the upper side at $9.16. The recent pullback has formed the handle portion of this pattern. This cup had a depth of 38%, and measuring this distance from the upper side implies a potential move to $12.60, which is about 50% above the current level.

42490012,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144006,1743098402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Boosted US Economy: GDP Growth Exceeds Expectations, Crypto Market Eyes Opportunities",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/boosted-us-economy-gdp-growth/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The U.S. economy just delivered a surprising punch of resilience, and it’s got everyone in the financial markets, including the crypto sphere, buzzing with anticipation. The latest data reveals that the U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter wasn’t just good; it was better than expected, potentially setting the stage for interesting times ahead for digital assets. Why is US GDP Growth Exceeding Forecasts a Big Deal? Let’s break down why this latest US GDP growth figure is making waves. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) dropped the final estimate for Q4, and it landed at a solid 2.4% annual growth rate. Now, experts were predicting 2.3%, so while it might seem like a small jump, in the world of economics, beating forecasts is always a positive sign. Think of it like this: the economy was expected to do well, but it actually did even better. This suggests underlying strength and momentum, which can have ripple effects across various sectors, including our beloved crypto market. To really understand the significance, remember that GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is essentially the broadest measure of a country’s economic activity. It’s the total value of goods and services produced. When GDP grows, it generally means the economy is healthy, businesses are doing well, and people are spending money. This positive economic environment can influence investment decisions and risk appetite, factors that are crucial for the crypto market. How Does Economic Growth Impact the Crypto Market? You might be wondering, “Okay, the U.S. economy is growing – great! But what does this actually mean for my crypto portfolio?” It’s a valid question! Here’s how robust economic growth can potentially influence the crypto landscape: Increased Investor Confidence: A strong economy often boosts investor confidence. When people feel secure about the economic outlook, they are more likely to take on investments, including those in higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Think of it as a ‘risk-on’ sentiment taking hold. More Disposable Income: Economic growth can lead to increased employment and higher wages. This translates to more disposable income for individuals, some of which could find its way into investments like crypto. When people have more money to spare, they are more likely to explore different investment avenues. Institutional Investment: Positive economic signals can attract institutional investors to various markets, including crypto. Institutions often look for stable and growing economies to deploy capital. Strong GDP figures can make the U.S. economy, and by extension, its digital asset market, more appealing. Inflationary Pressures (and Crypto as a Hedge?): While growth is good, rapid growth can sometimes lead to inflation. Historically, some have viewed cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential hedge against inflation. If strong economic growth triggers inflation concerns, we might see renewed interest in crypto as a store of value. Decoding Market Expectations: Were Analysts Surprised? The fact that the GDP figure exceeded market expectations is noteworthy. Economists and analysts constantly make predictions about economic indicators, and these predictions are baked into market prices. When the actual data comes in better than expected, it can lead to market adjustments. In this case, the slightly higher-than-anticipated GDP growth suggests that the U.S. economy might be more resilient than previously thought. This surprise element can inject optimism into the financial markets . While a 0.1% difference might seem minor, it represents billions of dollars in economic activity and signals a slightly stronger momentum than anticipated by the consensus market expectations . Navigating the Financial Markets: What’s Next for Crypto? So, what actionable insights can we glean from this GDP report, especially for those invested or interested in the crypto market ? Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on how the crypto market reacts to this news. Positive GDP data can contribute to a bullish sentiment, but it’s crucial to observe actual price movements and trading volumes. Consider Broader Economic Indicators: GDP is just one piece of the puzzle. Pay attention to other economic data releases like inflation figures, employment reports, and consumer spending data to get a holistic view of the economic landscape. Stay Informed About Regulatory Developments: Economic conditions can influence regulatory decisions. Be aware of any policy changes or regulatory updates that could impact the crypto market in light of the economic outlook. Diversification Remains Key: While positive economic news can be encouraging, remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. Diversification across different asset classes remains a prudent strategy to manage risk. Looking Ahead: Sustained Growth or Temporary Surge? The million-dollar question is whether this 2.4% GDP growth is a sign of sustained financial markets strength or just a temporary surge. Economists will be closely watching upcoming data to determine the trajectory of the U.S. economy. Factors like interest rate policies, global economic conditions, and geopolitical events will all play a role in shaping the future economic landscape and, consequently, the performance of the crypto market. For now, the final Q4 GDP figure offers a dose of optimism. It suggests that the U.S. economy is proving to be more resilient than some forecasts indicated. This resilience, if sustained, could create a more favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

The analyst had also earlier raised the possibility of the flagship crypto dropping to as low as $22,000. Expert Reveals Why He Is No Longer Bullish Amid Bitcoin Price Drawdown In an X post , Severino alluded to market cycles and the Elliott Wave Theory to explain why he is no longer bullish on BTC and other crypto assets. In his accompanying chart, he highlighted the fact that the Bitcoin price recorded a 100% on both Wave 1 and Wave 5 in this bull run , which dates back to around November 2022. The expert explained that this suggests the top is in, as Wave 1 and Wave 5 typically record similar price gains. However, the analyst noted that there is still the possibility of the Bitcoin price going higher since it could record a similar gain to the one recorded in Wave 3 after the Bitcoin ETFs launched last year. Based on Elliot Wave Theory, at least two of the Waves must have similar price gains, which makes it a possibility that Wave 5 could replicate Wave 3’s performance. However, Severino looks to be betting against that happening as he also highlighted the euphoria around Donald Trump’s inauguration as another reason why the top is likely in and why he is no longer bullish on the Bitcoin price. He noted that the euphoria phase always comes just before the cycle top. The technical expert admitted that the euphoria around Trump’s inauguration wasn’t as much as he expected. However, he proceeded to highlight a pattern with the cyclical crests , which is another reason he is no longer bullish on BTC and other crypto assets. Severino noted that Wave 1 and Wave 3 topped right at the cyclical crest. As such, he remarked that it makes sense that Wave 5 will also top at the cyclical crest. Other Indicators Which Suggest BTC Has Topped Tony Severino also alluded to other chart patterns and indicators, suggesting that the Bitcoin price has topped and explaining why he is no longer bullish on BTC. He highlighted a curve trendline on another chart, which showed that the flagship crypto has reached the point of maximum financial opportunity in this market cycle. The technical expert went on to highlight indicators like the Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse), which suggests that the Bitcoin price’s parabolic phase in this cycle has stopped and that a reversal may be imminent. Another indicator he alluded to is the Average Directional Index (ADX), which Severino remarked shows that BTC’s uptrend strength is weakening. He affirmed that the upward momentum for the Bitcoin price is weakening, and it doesn’t look like it will get back up anytime soon. The expert highlighted the Logarithmic MACD as another indicator that proves that momentum for the flagship crypto in this market cycle is declining.",Bitcoin News|ADX|Average Directional Index|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|Elliot Wave Theory|Logarithmic MACD|parabolic SAR|Stop And Reverse|Tony Severino,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-27 18:00:28

With a 24-hour volume of $22,187,634,129, and a total of 469 cryptocurrency assets along with fiat pairs, Binance is one of the most popular exchanges in the world. Review With features including P2P trading, margin trading, and staking, Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange that lets users buy, sell, and trade a variety of cryptocurrencies. The Maker/Taker trading fees on Binance range from 0.1000%-0.1000% to 0.0110%-0.0230%, which entirely depends on your VIP level , which is determined by your 30-day trading volume. With overall security, customer support, and user-friendly features, Binance is ranked at the top in our list and on almost all other online reputed sources. Trustpilot review of Binance is surprising as it stands at 1.4 out of 5 stars, calculated after 5096 reviews which is a bad score for a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange. 2 Kraken Rated 4 out of 5 The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken allows users to buy and sell different cryptocurrencies using fiat money. According to CoinMarketCap, Kraken was ranked sixth for spot and futures trading as of October 2024. Its 24-hour trading volume for both the spot and futures markets, stands at $1,447,468,03 at the time of writing. Review Investopedia ranks Kraken as the best crypto exchange for low fees. Its Maker fees range from 0.00% to 0.25% and Taker fees range from 0.10% to 0.40%. Kraken has a user-friendly interface, round-the-clock customer care, security features, digital wallets, custodial services, a mobile app, and a range of same trading goods, services, and financing alternatives as its rivals Coinbase and Binance. Trustpilot review of Kraken stands at 1.4 out of 5 stars, calculated after 2750 reviews which indicates a lack of customer support from the crypto exchange. 3 OKX Rated 4 out of 5 Ranked as the fourth exchange on CoinMarketCap, OKX (formerly known as OKEx) has gradually built up its reputation and is now a common sight in the top five crypto exchange rankings. With a 24-hour volume of $3,531,776,478, and a total of 346 cryptocurrency assets along with fiat pairs, OKX is a big name in the Middle East and now expanding rapidly all over the world. Review The Maker/Taker fee on Poloniex exchange ranges from 0.080%-0.1% to -0.010%-0.015% depending on your 30-day trading volume. This makes OKX as one of the best fees crypto exchange offerings as well. Trustpilot review of OKX stands at 3.5 out of 5 stars, calculated after 1650 reviews which is a decent score for a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange. 4 Bybit Rated 4 out of 5 Ranked as the second exchange on CoinMarketCap, just behind Binance, Bybit’s rise to the top has been a quick one in recent years. With a 24-hour volume of $3,478,351,746, and a total of 758 cryptocurrency assets along with fiat pairs, Bybit offers more variety in crypto trading pairs than the top rated exchange, Binance. Review Bybit was founded in 2018 with the goal of serving both retail and professional traders seeking a more sophisticated platform. Aside from its emphasis on derivatives, Bybit appeals to both novices and specialists due to its array of tools and services, such as its demo account and copy trading. The Maker/Taker trading fees on Bybit range from 0.1000%-0.1000% to 0.0100%-0.0000%, which entirely depends on your VIP level, which is determined by your 30-day trading volume. The best part about Bybit fees is that there are many tiers where the trading fees go out of the picture, however, significant trading volume is required to reach those levels. Trustpilot review of Bybit stands at 3 out of 5 stars, calculated after 3650 reviews which is a decent score for a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange, considering the recent hack it went through and still managed to survive. 5 Poloniex Rated 3 out of 5 While Poloniex exchange ranking is at the 92nd spot as per CoinMarketCap rankings, it makes it to our list because of its unique feature of automated trading. With a 24h volume of $819,969,007, and tradeable assets (including fiat pairs) ranging to 772, Poloniex is one of the best automated crypto trading platforms out there. Review The Maker/Taker fee on Poloniex exchange ranges from 0.2000%/0.2000% to -0.0050%/0.1000% depending on your 30-day trading volume. Poloniex is a great platform if you’re interested in Grid trading, Strategy trading, Future copy trading, or simply spot trading. While the normal fees of this exchange may not be the best among other crypto exchanges, it is still a decent option considering its customer support and other features highlighted above. Trustpilot review of Poloniex stands at 1.3 out of 5 stars, calculated after 335 reviews which is a concerning sign for the exchange. 6 Coinbase Exchange Rated 4 out of 5 Ranked as the third exchange on CoinMarketCap, Coinbase has its main presence in the US market but it has gradually made a name for itself in other parts of the world as well. With a 24-hour volume of $3,436,840,812, and a total of 290 cryptocurrency assets along with fiat pairs, Coinbase has a strict process of listing coins and hence it doesn’t have a lot of pairs to trade among thousands of cryptocurrencies. Review The Maker/Taker trading fee on Coinbase exchange ranges from 0.00% to 0.6% depending on your 30-day trading volume. Trustpilot review of OKX stands at 3.9 out of 5 stars, calculated after 15822 reviews which is a decent score for a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange.

This is where the choice can become easy for a crypto user. For example, beginners can start with Binance or Coinbase depending on their location as both these exchanges have some geo-restrictions. These two exchanges are user friendly and best for beginners. Meanwhile, if you are into meme coins and want to trade them on a reputed exchange, then Bybit is the way to go as it lists many meme coins and tokens that other exchanges don’t.

The “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act,” would prohibit the Fed from offering certain products or services directly to American individuals, a key component of any CBDC. The Texas Republican’s bill can be considered a companion bill to Minnesota Republican Representative Tom Emmer’s anti-CBDC legislation , which was reintroduced on March 6. A companion bill is a piece of legislation that is similarly or identically worded to another bill, and introduced in the other chamber of Congress. Both bills state that the prohibition should not include any dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private and “preserves the privacy protections of United States coins and physical currency.” Sen. Ted Cruz’s anti-CBDC bill. Source: Ted Cruz Since 2020, the Federal Reserve has been exploring a digital version of the US dollar. According to the CBDC Tracker, at least four research projects are currently underway by various Federal Reserve entities. Cruz has been a vocal opponent of CBDCs since at least 2022, when he introduced legislation that would ban the Fed from introducing a direct-to-consumer CBDC. He followed it up with similar legislation in 2023 , and in 2024 sought to block the attempt by then-President Joe Biden’s administration to create a CBDC. Emmer said at a congressional hearing that “CBDC technology is inherently un-American” and warned that allowing unelected bureaucrats to issue a CBDC “could upend the American way of life.” Related: North Carolina Senate overrides governor veto, passes bill banning CBDC Critics denounce CBDCs While CBDCs have some purported benefits, critics of the technology have long said that digital currency issued directly to citizens could pose privacy infringement and government overreach. However, some nations and regional governments are still exploring this technology. While European consumers show little interest in CBDCs , lawmakers in the region are pushing to create a digital Euro . Israel has released a preliminary design to create a digital shekel , and Iran will reportedly launch a CBDC in the near future . In the US, the creation of a CBDC has been met with more resistance. President Donald Trump has vowed to “never allow” a CBDC in the country , and Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, has said that the Fed will not issue a CBDC while he is in charge. Though CBDCs could modernize legacy financial systems and make them more efficient, they would also centralize the money supply.

These purchases will be made to bolster the nation’s crypto enterprises, according to Reuters. Historically, Bpifrance has invested €150 million in blockchain-related ventures, including modest investments in cryptocurrencies. However, this marks the bank’s first initiative to establish a dedicated fund for direct crypto purchases.

Caudoux emphasized the significance of this initiative, especially as the United States accelerates its own crypto strategy. He noted that Bpifrance’s entry into the crypto space began before the recent U.S. policy shift. He also suggested that Bpifrance could help token projects secure exchange listings, giving them a stronger foothold in the global market. The resurgence of interest in cryptocurrencies has been notable since U.S. President Donald Trump’s election victory in November. Trump has expressed support for the industry, pursued policy reforms, and even introduced his own crypto products. In contrast, European finance ministers have raised concerns that the U.S.’s growing embrace of cryptocurrencies could threaten eurozone monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Caudoux remarked that current U.S. policies are drawing crypto firms overseas. He stressed the importance of retaining European engineering talent and companies, stating that a strong domestic ecosystem is “crucial for the future,” according to Reuters.

This surge in institutional interest has fueled overwhelmingly positive sentiment toward Solana, with Santiment reporting a near-record high 18:1 positive-to-negative sentiment ratio. Institutional Backing Boosts Solana’s Appeal In a March 26 post on X, Santiment noted: “With news that institutions like GameStop and BlackRock are integrating Bitcoin and launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on Solana, crypto’s #5 market cap asset is seeing an astounding level of bullish sentiment pouring in on social media.” According to the analytics platform, the high level of positivity is driven by the belief that institutional backing could speed up Solana’s adoption and strengthen its market position. Many see BlackRock’s decision to integrate Solana into its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, as a major endorsement of the blockchain’s capabilities. Since its launch in March 2024, BUIDL has grown to $1.7 billion, commanding the tokenized U.S. treasuries market and outpacing rivals like Ondo and Franklin Templeton. GameStop has also dipped its feet into the crypto pool, announcing plans to raise $1.3 billion to buy Bitcoin. The move mirrors Strategy’s aggressive BTC accumulation, further validating digital assets as institutional-grade collateral. Meme Coin Frenzy Contributes to Solana’s Growth Apart from institutional influence, Solana’s meme coin space seems to have been revitalized after a brief lull partly occasioned by the LIBRA debacle, in which investors lost more than $250 million after insiders cashed out early, causing the token’s value to plummet 85%. Pump.fun, which recently launched a native decentralized exchange (DEX) to compete with Raydium, recorded more than 34,000 meme coin launches on March 24, dwarfing the 20,190 created at the beginning of the month. The sparkling performance of the newly launched meme coin Ghiblification (GHIBLI) has further brightened the space. Inspired by a wave of Studio Ghibli-style images shared by ChatGPT users on social media, the token shot up by an eye-popping 35,000% at one point since going live. Meanwhile, SOL’s price has responded positively to the changing sentiment. The asset was trading at $138.60 at the time of this writing, which, despite a 4.4% pullback in the last 24 hours, reflects a 3.8% gain over the past week. As things stand, SOL is outperforming both BTC and the broader crypto market, with the number one cryptocurrency by market cap up just 2% in seven days.

On March 26, GameStop tipped plans to use proceeds from a $1.3 billion convertible debt offering to buy Bitcoin — an increasingly popular strategy for public companies looking to boost share performance. GameStop’s announcement came a day after it proposed building a stockpile of cryptocurrencies , including Bitcoin and US dollar-pegged stablecoins. Investors initially celebrated the news, sending shares up 12% on March 26. Shareholders’ sentiment reversed on March 27, pushing GameStop’s stock, GME, down by nearly 24%, according to Google Finance. GameStop’s stock reversed gains on March 27. Source: Google Finance Related: GameStop buying Bitcoin would ‘bake the noodles’ of TradFi: Swan exec Chilly reception Analysts say the chilly reception reflects fears GameStop may be seeking to distract investors from deeper problems with its business model. “Investors are not necessarily optimistic on the underlying business,” Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro, told Reuters on March 27. “There are question marks with GameStop's model. If bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” The sell-off also highlights investors’ more bearish outlook on Bitcoin as macroeconomic instability, including ongoing trade wars, weighs on the cryptocurrency’s spot price. Bitcoin is down around 7% year-to-date, hovering around $87,000 as of March 27, according to Google Finance. Bitcoin’s “price briefly jumped to $89,000 but has now reversed its trend,” Agne Linge, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol WeFi’s head of growth, told Cointelegraph.

Over the past week, ETH has exhibited a descending triangle pattern, indicating a potential bearish continuation unless a breakout occurs. Weekly Chart Analysis On the weekly timeframe, ETH has been forming lower highs, suggesting increasing selling pressure. However, strong horizontal support around $1,970 has prevented further decline, making this a critical level for traders to watch. Key Support and Resistance Levels Immediate Support: $1,970 – Holding this level could lead to a short-term bounce. Second Support: $1,929 – A breakdown below $1,970 may lead to a test of this level. Major Resistance: $2,065 – A move above this could signal bullish strength. Second Resistance: $2,119 – A breakout beyond this point would indicate a stronger uptrend. Technical Indicators RSI (Relative Strength Index): Nearing oversold territory, suggesting ETH may soon reverse to the upside. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Showing bearish momentum but nearing a potential crossover, hinting at a possible trend shift. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Next Move Prediction Ethereum is currently at a make-or-break level. If ETH maintains support above $1,970, a rebound toward $2,065 is likely, with a potential breakout leading to $2,119-$2,160. However, if ETH breaks below $1,970, bearish momentum could push prices toward $1,929 or even $1,875. Bullish scenario: A break above $2,065 could trigger a rally toward $2,119-$2,160. Bearish scenario : A drop below $1,970 may push ETH toward $1,875 before finding new support. Traders should closely watch price action near support zones to determine the next big move.

This happened weeks after he gave an unauthorized video interview with Tucker Carlson from jail in Brooklyn. Earlier today, the Federal Bureau of Prisons updated its website, confirming that Bankman-Fried was transferred to the Oklahoma City Federal Transfer Center. This is part of the process of moving him to a permanent prison, where he will serve his 24-year sentence for fraud. His expected release date is set for November 17, 2044. SBF Moved to Federal Transfer Prison According to the Wall Street Journal, prison officials in the New York facility woke Bankman-Fried up around 3 a.m. on Wednesday but did not tell him where he was going. The convicted FTX CEO is now held at the Oklahoma City facility, a central hub in the U.S. federal prison system. This facility temporarily holds inmates before they are sent to their final prison locations. The prison is also part of a transportation network known as Con Air, which moves prisoners across the country. Sam Bankman-Fried Claims Innocence in Prison Interview, Crisis Manager Quits Before his transfer, Bankman-Fried made another attempt to clear his name. In his interview with Tucker Carlson, he insisted he had been wrongfully convicted. This interview was reportedly part of a broader effort by his family to seek clemency for him, especially as presidential pardons gain attention . Bankman-Fried’s crisis manager, Mark Botnick, resigned after the interview when prison officials confirmed that the interview was not approved. Notably, Botnick has handled SBF’s crisis management since FTX collapsed in November 2022. Meanwhile, this was not the first time SBF spoke publicly from prison. In February, he gave an interview to the New York Sun, where he discussed his shift toward conservative politics. Some people think he is trying to get on President Donald Trump’s side since the president had spoken against unfair treatment in politics. Bankman-Fried also claimed FTX was never truly bankrupt, and the exchange would have had $100 billion in assets today, far more than its $15 billion in debts. SBF’s Final Destination Still Uncertain Bankman-Fried’s final prison location has not yet been confirmed despite his transfer. When he was sentenced, Judge Lewis Kaplan recommended that he serve his time at a lower-security prison in California. This would place him closer to his parents, who live near Stanford University. Bankman-Fried has been in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center since August 2023, but this was never meant to be his final prison. For now, Bankman-Fried remains in transit. His fall from being a crypto billionaire to a prisoner continues, with little chance of reversing his fate.

SEC’s Ripple Settlement: A Catalyst For XRP Stability The prolonged legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs has reached a decisive conclusion. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, confirmed the agreement on social media . This SEC resolution has provided much-needed stability to XRP, Ripple’s native crypto, which has seen its price steady above $2. The SEC’s decision to withdraw its appeal and agree to a $50 million fine marks a significant shift in the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. This settlement alleviates the legal uncertainties surrounding XRP and reinforces its legitimacy in the market. As a result, Ripple’s XRP has maintained a stable position, with its price holding firm above the $2 mark. While XRP’s stability boost by the SEC resolution is worthy of note and shows its resilience, the crypto market is abuzz with discussions about WallitIQ (WLTQ). Dubbed the ‘AI crypto wonder,’ this new AI coin garners significant interest from crypto insiders and whales who view it as a potential game-changer. This Ethereum-based powerhouse is currently in its presale phase, offering tokens at $0.0420 . Smart investors are seizing this opportunity, anticipating substantial gains as the star altcoin positions itself to dominate the crypto landscape in 2025. ​ WallitIQ (WLTQ): The AI Altcoin Set To Eclipse XRP As the crypto community celebrates Ripple’s legal victory, attention is swiftly shifting to WallitIQ (WLTQ), an AI-driven altcoin making waves in the presale market. With a groundbreaking approach integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, the powerhouse AI crypto is attracting diverse investors, from institutional players to retail enthusiasts. The presale’s rapid progression, with over $7 million raised, underscores the immense confidence in this coin’s potential. Several key features set WallitIQ (WLTQ) apart in the crowded crypto space. The platform has undergone an audit by SolidProof, assuring investors of its robust security and transparency for its users. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has also launched its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) wallet management app, offering upgraded functionalities that surpass traditional wallets like Trust Wallet. In addition, it recently launched its Beta platform with upgraded AI features for better performance. One standout feature is the Physical 2 Digital (P2D) technology , which uses scan and QR code payment technologies to simplify transactions and bridge the gap between physical assets and digital currencies. Beyond its wallet innovations, WallitIQ (WLTQ) integrates AI-powered anomaly detection technology , an advanced security layer that continuously scans transactions for unusual activity. This real-time monitoring system helps prevent unauthorized access and fraudulent behavior, offering users unparalleled security compared to traditional crypto wallets. With security concerns growing in the digital asset space, this feature reinforces WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) status as a safe and reliable investment. Another standout feature is Escrow Connect , a built-in smart contract mechanism that facilitates secure peer-to-peer transactions. By automating escrow services, WallitIQ (WLTQ) eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, making sure that transactions are only completed when both parties fulfill their conditions. These innovations boost user experience and position WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a trailblazer in the AI-crypto convergence. Analysts predict this project’s unique offerings could lead to exponential growth, potentially outpacing established cryptocurrencies like Ripple’s XRP in gains. The current presale price of $0.0420 presents a ground-floor opportunity for investors to partake in what many anticipate to be the next big surge in the market amid the SEC-Ripple victory buzz. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The AI Altcoin Poised For Unmatched Growth As XRP Gains Stability ​ In conclusion, while the SEC’s settlement with Ripple has ushered in a new era of stability for XRP, the spotlight is increasingly turning to WallitIQ (WLTQ). This AI-powered altcoin captures the crypto community’s imagination and offers a tangible opportunity for substantial returns. With its presale rapidly advancing and tokens priced at an accessible $0.0420 , now is the opportune moment for investors to secure a stake in WallitIQ (WLTQ). As the crypto landscape evolves, this Ethereum trailblazer altcoin stands poised to lead the charge, potentially eclipsing XRP and redefining the boundaries of digital asset innovation.

In a recent post on X, Ardoino announced this milestone while emphasizing the company’s adoption from the bottom up. He said that they’ve always concentrated on the adoption from the ground up, working in the streets, among other people, while traditional finance was watching from their ivory towers. The move comes amid Tether’s continued diversification of its presence outside cryptocurrency markets. This can be seen through ventures in media and farming. Ardoino’s statement highlighted the firm’s ambition of reaching one billion users. Today Tether USDt has (conservatively) more than 400 million users across the world. Soon 1 billion. We always focused on the adoption from the ground up, working in the streets, among other people, while traditional finance was watching at us from their ivory towers. That's… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) March 27, 2025 Media acquisitions expand Tether’s digital content reach Tether is moving beyond cryptocurrency with a substantial investment in Italian media. With this, the company became the second-largest shareholder of Be Water, the parent company controlling Will and Chora Media. The stablecoin issuer has secured a 30.4% stake in the media company following a €10 million capital increase and purchase of shares from other partners. This investment positions Tether behind only founder Guido Maria Brera in ownership stake, and ahead of co-founder Mario Calabresi. Be Water specializes in social media information and podcast content, giving Tether influence in digital media distribution channels. According to a statement about the partnership, Tether plans to collaborate with Be Water to enhance the distribution of digital content, integrate new technological solutions, and support the international expansion of its brands. The media investment represents a diversification for Tether, which has traditionally been known primarily for its USDT stablecoin. Agricultural investment signals move into traditional markets Tether’s growth strategy now incorporates a foray into farm production with a transaction agreement with Adecoagro S.A., which is a leading sustainable production firm in South America. The deal, unanimously ratified by Adecoagro’s Board of Directors, will have Tether begin a tender offer to acquire up to 49,596,510 common shares at $12.41 per share in cash. This target acquisition would account for about 70% of Adecoagro’s outstanding common stock. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, such as the valid tender of sufficient shares to provide Tether with at least 51% ownership on a fully diluted basis. Adecoagro is engaged mainly in South America’s agricultural industry, emphasizing sustainable production practices. This investment is Tether’s largest entry into conventional markets beyond the financial technology sector. This deal is a different kind of expansion strategy than Tether’s investments in media. While the Be Water investment provides Tether with control over content distribution and blockchain media uses, the Adecoagro investment offers partial control over physical production assets and farming operations. User growth strategy focuses on “ground up” adoption Tether’s approach to getting more users is really different from traditional banks, according to Ardoino’s comments. The CEO highlighted their approach to building usage “from the ground up” and “working in the streets.” This is really different from traditional finance that watches “from their ivory towers.” This grassroots movement has been incredible in its success, with the claimed 400 million users equating to a huge percentage of the world’s users of cryptocurrency. Ardoino labeled the claimed figure as “conservative,” indicating that there may be an even greater number of users, and he also bragged about a lofty target of “soon 1 billion” users. The focus on street-level adoption mirrors stablecoin use patterns in most markets. Further, USDT has emerged as a widely used remittance tool, savings instrument, and everyday transaction currency in nations suffering from currency instability or restricted access to banking. Focusing on use cases rather than institutional adoption, Tether seems to have developed its user base organically through utility. A new era begins : the stablecoin multiverse. Hundreds of companies and governments are launching (or will soon) their stablecoins. I'm very proud to see such massive adoption of a technology that Tether created back in 2014 🙏 Good luck everyone ♥️ — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) March 27, 2025 Ardoino’s declaration that “that’s why we’re unstoppable together” presents this adoption approach as a grassroots movement and not a typical corporate growth. The referenced “stablecoin multiverse” with “hundreds of companies and governments” launching stablecoins further contextualizes Tether’s position.

Bitcoin (BTC) Targets $90K Breakout as Bulls Hold $85K Support for Three Consecutive Days Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrated resilience on Thursday, maintaining its position above $85,000 despite renewed volatility stemming from President Donald Trump’s latest tariff announcement. Bitcoin Price Action, March 27, 2025 | Source: Coinmarketcap According to TradingView data, BTC price climbed 2% to reach $87,756 on Binance before retracing toward $87,000 at press time. Notably, BTC has now held above the $85,000 mark for three consecutive days, while Ethereum ( ETH ) has also established a support base above $2,040. This trend suggests that traders are opting to hold their positions in anticipation of another push toward $90,000 rather than taking profits prematurely. Why Is Bitcoin’s Price Rising Today? The 2% Bitcoin price uptick on Thursday coincided with Trump’s confirmation of a 25% tariff on auto imports, set to take effect on April 2. In response, investors rapidly shifted capital away from U.S. stocks expected to be affected by the new trade policies. S&P 500 performance after Trump confirmed 25% US automotive imports on Wednsday March 26 | Source: NASDAQ Within 24 hours of Trump’s announcement, Tesla shares dropped 5%, while the S&P 500 fell 65 points, a 1.12% decline. This suggests that Bitcoin’s rally was fueled by investors reallocating funds from traditional equities into cryptocurrencies, which are perceived as more resistant to trade policy pressures. Investors Withdraw 6,000 BTC as U.S. Macroeconomic Sentiment Improves Bitcoin and the broader crypto market experienced significant volatility in early March 2025. The market initially surged following Trump’s proposal to establish a U.S. strategic crypto reserve on March 2. However, within 24 hours, he announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, triggering immediate sell-offs amid inflation concerns. As negotiations progressed, the Trump administration introduced waivers to mitigate inflationary impacts on key domestic markets. These adjustments, along with positive signals from the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports in mid-March, paved the way for the Federal Reserve’s rate pause last week. Since then, investors who had previously exited risk assets have returned to a bullish stance. This shift is evident in CryptoQuant’s Exchange Reserves chart, which tracks the total BTC held in exchange-linked wallets. Bitcoin Exchange Reserves as of March 26| Source: CryptoQuant Investors have been withdrawing significant amounts of BTC since mid-March as inflation concerns eased. On March 13, BTC exchange reserves stood at 2.48 million. At press time, that figure has declined to 2.42 million BTC, indicating a net withdrawal of over 6,000 BTC—worth approximately $525 million—within the past two weeks. This reduction in short-term supply has helped Bitcoin maintain its $85,000 support level for three consecutive trading days. Why the $525 Million BTC Outflow Is Bullish for Bitcoin’s Price A decline in exchange reserves is often a bullish indicator, as it suggests two key market dynamics. First, traders who are optimistic about Bitcoin’s short- to mid-term outlook tend to transfer their holdings from exchanges to long-term storage options. Second, large investors, or “whales,” often move newly acquired BTC into cold storage or multi-signature wallets for security and compliance reasons. Both factors reduce Bitcoin’s short-term supply, increasing the likelihood of a rapid breakout toward $90,000 when the next major demand surge occurs. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Holds $87K as Bulls Eye $90K, but Rejection Risks Persist Bitcoin price forecast signals currently suggest a cautious bullish outlook as BTC holds above $87,000, with critical resistance emerging at $88,761, as indicated by the upper Donchian Channel (DC). The price remains supported by $82,680, highlighted by the mid-band of the DC. Bitcoin has stayed above the $85,000 support for three consecutive days, reinforcing the bullish case. However, consolidation near resistance raises the risk of rejection if momentum weakens. Bitcoin Price Forecast The Parabolic SAR at $78,746 remains significantly below the current price, signaling that bulls still control the trend. A clean breakout above $88,761 could set the stage for BTC to test the $90,000 psychological level. Conversely, failure to break this level could invite profit-taking, leading to a potential retracement toward $82,680. If bears gain control and push BTC below $82,680, the next key support lies at $76,598, coinciding with the lower DC band. Until then, BTC remains in an uptrend, but the next move depends on whether bulls can sustain momentum above resistance.

Chris Jensen, the mayor of Noblesville Indiana, says there is a growing demand for affordability, safety, and walkability, things that many feel are disappearing from the metropolitan areas. “There’s something about Midwest value, there’s something about community that we have here, and I think we should sell it.” Noblesville is welcoming new residents with a $5,000 relocation grant, an annual membership to the town’s coworking space and chamber of commerce, plus a $500 health and wellness stipend.

MakeMyMove, a company that offers incentives for remote workers to relocate – such as free cash or land – says there’s now a huge demand to leave cities in favor of the smaller, more affordable towns.

On March 27, the team behind the Solana-based meme coin confirmed it had acquired Exchange Art in a move that aims to “preserve and elevate the culture around creating, collecting, and appreciating art on chain.” With this acquisition, BONK plans to integrate its token directly into the Exchange Art platform, giving artists the option to sell their work in BONK alongside USDC. For creators, this addition hands them more control over how they price their work and shields them a bit from the volatility of SOL, which has traditionally been the go-to token on Solana NFT platforms. Artists will also be able to gain exposure to the BONK community, a highly active and enthusiastic user base that could lead fresh eyes and new collectors to their work. While little has been made public regarding the project’s long-term roadmap for the platform or how exactly BONK will function as a payment option, what we do know is that the transition will be led by JT Liss, a digital artist closely affiliated with the BONK team. A new leadership group is also stepping in to help shape the next chapter of Exchange Art. This team will be “dedicated to the longevity and success of not the just platform but of the creator economy as a whole,” the project wrote on X. NFT artist Topo Gigio lauded the acquisition on X, stating that it benefits both the community and artists while adding credibility to the meme coin. “This is good for everyone. Artists have a champion in their corner and BONK continues to solidify its place as Solana’s culture coin.” Meanwhile, Nom, a core contributor for Bonk, highlighted that combining the existing efforts of Exchange Art with BONK’s Art Masters initiative opens up new possibilities for artists on-chain. “It’ll continue to expand the reach of artists creating works on the platform, improving the financial incentives for both creators and collectors, and help people make cool shit on-chain,” Nom wrote in a March 27 X post. BONK price fails to react While the news was well received by the community, it did little to push the meme coin’s price beyond its monthly high of $0.0000155, a level it had already failed to breach the previous day. At press time, BONK was hovering around $0.0000139, down 2.8% over the past 24 hours. The token remains roughly 76% below its all-time high of $0.00005825, reached during the peak of the 2024 bull run in November. However, according to pseudonymous analyst FOUR, BONK could be eyeing a “3- 4x” rally soon. In a recent X post, the analyst flagged that BONK had broken out of a descending triangle and could rally higher once “FOMO” sets in. Others believe BONK might not be out of the woods just yet. Trader Travis, who shared a daily line chart of BONK, pointed out that while the token has broken its downtrend, it’s currently just “going sideways.” According to him, the market could remain flat for a while, and the rally could be delayed until April.

This decision falls under the bank’s ongoing efforts to nurture the experimentation of blockchain technologies and the growth of the digital asset market in France. The initiative signals a proactive approach to securing France’s position in the global cryptocurrency market, especially as international competition intensifies. Bpifrance Bank Unveils $27Million Fund Bpifrance has been an active participant in the development of blockchain solutions in the past having provided more than €150 million in the blockchain industry in the last 10 years. These have been focused on market making entities comprised of blockchain startups and ventures as well as any solution that includes the use of blockchain technology. Today, Bpifrance is taking an even more active position and is organizing a dedicated fund specifically for the direct purchase of cryptocurrencies with an emphasis on French blockchain projects. This fund will focus on tokens that are relatively fresh in the market, often before they are traded on the leading crypto exchanges. Arnaud Caudoux, the Deputy CEO of Bpifrance pointed out that through investing in these emerging tokens the fund will offer a seed investment to French based blockchain startups. This was the first time that Bpifrance will directly invest money for acquiring digital assets as all the previous fund investment was made in blockchain companies or other crypto type companies. Focus on Smaller Crypto Projects Instead of betting on asset, popular coins such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, Bpifrance will target mid to small sized coins. These will be mainly from France most of which are still at the concept stage or at the development stage. In purchasing and investing in such tokens before they go mainstream, Bpifrance wants to back the growth of local crypto businesses and ensure France’s competitiveness in the quickly emerging market. Bpifrance’s preference for smaller tokens is more of a part of its long-term vision to support innovative projects in the country. In his opinion, it will create more convenience for users and adapt to their needs due to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency services and the role played by digital assets in the global economy. These projects will also find some support in the bank through assistance in listing on cryptocurrency exchanges, thus expanding their market presence. Role of U.S. Cryptocurrency Policy Bpifrance’s new crypto strategy is partly motivated by the rapid development of cryptocurrency policies in the United States. The U.S. government, particularly under the administration of President Donald Trump , has made substantial efforts to embrace the crypto industry. These initiatives have made the U.S. an increasingly attractive destination for global crypto companies, potentially drawing them away from Europe. In response, France’s Bpifrance is taking steps to ensure that crypto companies remain within the European Union. By fostering the growth of France’s own crypto ecosystem, Bpifrance aims to prevent these companies from relocating to the U.S. Caudoux emphasized that it is crucial for Europe to retain its innovative edge and not fall behind in the development of digital assets and blockchain technology.

However, the actual market impact is expected to be more limited, as BTC's drop below $90,000 caught investors off guard and invalidated many bullish positions. This shift gives Bitcoin bears a crucial opportunity to escape a potential $3 billion loss, a factor that could significantly influence market dynamics in the coming weeks. Bitcoin options open interest for March 28, USD. Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, the total open interest for call (buy) options stands at $10.5 billion, while put (sell) options lag at $6 billion. However, $7.6 billion of these calls are set at $92,000 or higher, meaning Bitcoin would need a 6.4% gain from its current price to make them viable by the March 28 expiry. As a result, the advantage for bullish bets has significantly weakened. Bitcoin bulls pray for a “decoupling” if QE restarts Some analysts attribute Bitcoin’s weak performance to the ongoing global tariff war and US government spending cuts , which increase the risk of an economic recession. Traders worry about slower growth, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector, which had driven the S&P 500 to a record high on Feb. 19 before falling 7%. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Meanwhile, Bitcoin bulls remain hopeful for a decoupling from the stock market, despite the 40-day correlation staying above 70% since early March. Their optimism stems from the expansion of the monetary base by central banks and increased Bitcoin adoption by companies such as GameStop (GME), Rumble (RUM), Metaplanet (TYO:3350), and Semler Scientific (SMLR). As the options expiry date nears, bulls and bears each have a strong incentive to influence Bitcoin’s spot price. However, while bullish investors aim for levels above $92,000, their optimism alone is not enough to ensure BTC surpasses this mark. Deribit leads the options market with a 74% share, followed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) at 8.5% and Binance at 8%. Given the current market dynamics, Bitcoin bulls hold a strategic advantage heading into the monthly options expiry. For instance, if Bitcoin remains at $86,500 by 8:00 am UTC on March 28, only $2 billion worth of put (sell) options will be in play. This situation incentivizes bears to drive Bitcoin below $84,000, which would increase the value of active put options to $2.6 billion. Related: Would GameStop buying Bitcoin help BTC price hit $200K? Bitcoin bulls will have the edge if BTC price passes $90,000 Below are five probable scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances but exclude complex strategies, such as selling put options to gain upside price exposure. Between $81,000 and $85,000: $2.7 billion in calls (buy) vs. $2.6 billion in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $100 million. Between $85,000 and $88,000: $3.3 billion calls vs. $2 billion puts, favoring calls by $1.3 billion. Between $88,000 and $90,000: $3.4 billion calls vs. $1.8 billion puts. favoring calls by $1.6 billion. Between $90,000 and $92,000: $4.4 billion calls vs. $1.4 billion puts, favoring calls by $3 billion. To minimize losses, bears must push Bitcoin below $84,000—a 3% drop—before the March 28 expiry. This move would increase the value of put (sell) options, strengthening their position. Conversely, bulls can maximize their gains by driving BTC above $90,000, which could create enough momentum to establish a bullish trend for April, especially if inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) resume at a strong pace.

In a message last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that after four years, the SEC had ended its case by dropping an appeal of a judgement that found that the company’s sale of XRP to retail buyers were not securities sales. “Reflecting on four years ago, it seems very clear to me that this case was doomed from the start,” Garlinghouse said. “In so many ways, it was the first major shot fired in the war on crypto.

The delay follows the committee’s traditional process of allowing candidates to answer questions submitted for the record before moving on to a vote. “Senate aides have announced that the Senate Banking Committee will not vote on Paul Atkins or any other nominees today. Nominees will be asked to answer questions for the record prior to the vote. The vote will be held at a later date and the exact date will be determined,” crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

Atkins reportedly has around $6 million in cryptocurrency assets and a total fortune of $320 million. Eleanor Terrett tweeted that Paul Atkins said he would abandon the previous administration's heavy-handed approach to law enforcement: “Industry experience and focused enforcement are necessary to ensure that customers and investors benefit from efficient, effective, and well-designed regulations.

Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $89.57 million. Ethereum ETFs saw outflows of $5.89 million . Only BlackRock's IBIT fund recorded an inflow of $107.89 million on March 26. Bitwise's BITB product faced an outflow of $18.32 million. No movement of funds was observed in other ETFs. Ethereum ETFs saw outflows of $3.21 million. ETH and FETH funds lost $4.9 million and $996,090, while the other ETFs saw no capital flows. No activity has been detected in the Hong Kong sector of spot bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin whales have accumulated over 129,000 BTC since March 11 Large holders with more than 10,000 BTC in their accounts are actively accumulating bitcoins, Glassnode experts said. Since March 11, the balance of their wallets has grown by more than 129,000 BTC ($11.2 billion). According to the portal's report, the Accumulation Trend Score for this group is more than 0.5. This indicates that investors who are in this category exclusively accumulate bitcoins. At the same time, traders with smaller balances follow mostly the reverse strategy, selling crypto-assets, Glassnode noted. However, the overall indicator value for the market stands at 0.235 as of March 25. This is a new maximum since January 4, indicating a change in trend among holders in general: As you can see in the chart below, whales started accumulating bitcoins starting on March 11. The trend accelerated towards the end of the month: The average volume of the first cryptocurrency per major holder also continues to increase. However, the indicator remains below the values of December-February, which, according to experts, leaves the potential for further growth if the trend continues; The trend towards bitcoin accumulation by large holders has emerged amid a decline in the supply share of the first cryptocurrency on the accounts of cryptocurrency exchanges. Since March 9, the chart shows a consistent decline: Other metrics also point to a change in trend. In particular, it is the share of bitcoin addresses that hold the first cryptocurrency for a year or more. This indicator began to fall in mid-January 2025.

To read full editions, subscribe . DAS was incredible. It was a jam-packed session of inspiring and motivating discussions about how the institutional adoption of digital assets is unfolding. I was honored to be at the center of it all, hosting a number of panels. Here are my top takeaways from the conference: Stablecoins are taking over I had the good fortune of meeting Austin Campbell a couple of times during the week, and we discussed, at length, the innovations around stablecoins. I came out of the conference incredibly bullish on them. The climax of this discussion emerged during a panel I hosted with Campbell and Joseph Wang. We nerded out on the cross-currents between macro and digital assets. Austin’s explanation of how he thinks about stablecoins: “So if we think about marginal buyers of US debt, a lot of foreign governments have been reducing their holdings of treasuries. And the great irony…[and] countervailing weight is that the people in those countries are increasing their holdings of US Treasurys through stablecoins. “Generally, people overcomplicate the discussion around stablecoins, and also call a lot of things ‘stablecoins’ that shouldn’t be called stablecoins. But a properly constructed stablecoin is just a box that basically holds stuff that looks like T-bills and treasuries. Very simple. And it’s just represented on a blockchain. Now the important part of that is, there’s two criteria. One is that you’ve got the internet, and the other one is that you have something of value to exchange for it.” If that quote got your wheels turning, check out the rest of the panel here: Institutions are just getting started One of the biggest themes for me was just how bullish institutions are on the digital asset industry. This bullishness comes at a time when the entire retail industry has been imploding via the nuclear detonation that is memecoins. The dispersion between the two worlds is quite incredible. One of my favorite institutional bullposters is Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. Matt’s good at eloquently explaining why digital asset adoption by TradFi is just beginning. We sat down to discuss this dispersion, to which he said: “That’s the biggest dichotomy in crypto right now. The crypto-native, degen world is in existential depression, while all of the institutional players are coming into the market thinking that this has never been better and [that] we are on the cusp of a multi-year bull market — the scale of which you haven’t even imagined. And I think that’s absolutely true. “Look, I think memecoins will always exist. I also think they were great stress tests of this infrastructure that we’ve built, and they showed it can handle real throughput. But…from an institutional perspective, when I look at what’s happening on stablecoins, tokenization and institutional investment — those are all up and to the right. “The crypto-native world will come back to that in the future.” To listen to the rest of our interview, check it out here: Chatting with a fixed income legend Interviewing someone like Mohamed El-Erian in front of tens of thousands of listeners was a career highlight for me, full stop. The way El-Erian can clearly and simply explain complex macro topics shines a light on how much more I can improve within this realm. The context for our conversation was fascinating. It feels like every major trend of the last 30 years is being reversed. For the first time in decades, investors are more excited about European equities over US ones. That is a wild change. El-Erian unpacked just how unique this situation is right now: “We are living in a really fluid world. I mean, the word ‘uncertainty’ is used a lot, but ultimately, there are three things that people care about. Fundamentals, technicals and valuation. And all three, Felix, are being upended right now. And that is a world [the likes of which] we haven’t seen for quite a long time. “[In terms of fundamentals], these are things that are being created internally, endogenous to the system. That means that the operating paradigm on fundamentals is in play. What does the trade regime look like? What does the public sector look like? How would other countries react? Lots of uncertainties [including] the positive ones, the innovations…[like] how quickly will it take for AI life sciences and quantum robotics? “Then you have the technicals. Before, it was ‘The US is better’; now we’ve had the largest drawdown in the US relative to Europe. “And then even when you go to the third one, valuations: it’s no longer clear what valuations should be in a world like this. So this is a really, really tricky time, and it doesn’t surprise me that gold is at a record high.” El-Erian’s excerpt really hits home about how significantly the world is changing right now. When you have fundamentals, technicals and valuations all going through regime shifts at once, you need to pay attention. Find the rest of our conversation here: This was by far the most exciting and inspiring digital asset conference I’ve ever attended. I’ve seen a lot of chatter from people saying this was the best conference they’ve been to and that the vibe was completely different from the crypto native corners of the internet.

This slump f ollowed the announcement of a strategic pivot involving the issuance of $1.3 billion in convertible bonds to finance the acquisition of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The video game retailer plans to offer these 0% convertible senior notes, maturing in 2030, in a private sale. The proceeds are intended for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of Bitcoin, as part of an updated investment policy approved by the company’s board earlier this week. GameStop shares spiked over 14% in yesterday’s aftermarket hours but opened the day at $25.78 per share and slumped to a low of $21.16 per share on the day.

Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro, questioned the company’s direction, stating, “There are question marks with GameStop’s model.

During its recent upward movement in late February and early March 2025, the asset formed a bearish rising wedge pattern. XLM Technical Analysis and Price Action Meanwhile, as market sentiment shifts and the price continues to decline, XRP has reached a crucial lower boundary of its rising wedge pattern and now appears to be consolidating. This ongoing XLM price momentum seems to be driving sentiment in a bearish direction. XLM Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, XLM is at a key level of $0.285, which now appears to be a make-or-break situation for the asset. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if XLM fails to hold this key level and closes a four-hour candle below $0.28, there is a strong possibility that it could decline by 15% to reach the $0.236 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View On the other hand, if sentiment shifts and XLM’s price soars, closing a daily candle above the $0.31 mark, it could pave the way for a massive upside rally. XLM’s daily chart indicates that the asset is in an uptrend, as it continues to trade above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. XLM’s Current Price Momentum At press time, XLM is trading near $0.286, having recorded a 1% price surge in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 10%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors, possibly due to unclear market sentiment. Traders Bearish View With this bearish price action and market sentiment, traders are strongly betting on short positions. Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.28 on the lower side, where they have built $995K worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $0.297 is another over-leveraged level, with traders having built $2.50 million worth of short positions.

42494131,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=701332,1743105020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42494131.jpeg,Binance delisting decisions pushes struggling Linear Finance and Vite Labs over the edge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-delisting-linear-finance-vite-labs/,"Linear Finance, a non-custodial cross-chain protocol offering decentralized financial services, has shared a notice of closure. The decision, which the platform attributed to various financial challenges, was significantly accelerated by Binance’s delisting of its native token, LINA, from its platform. According to its announcement post on X , Linear Finance stated that the platform has been plagued with financial challenges for most of its existence, the only exception being a brief period of profitability during its initial launch in 2020. Binance’s decision to delist the Lina token resulted in a 65% reduction in its market capitalization, causing a significant loss and dealing a final blow to Linear Finance’s operational viability. The impact of Binance’s delisting on Linear Finance and Vite Labs Linear Finance isn’t the only project facing these difficult times. Vite Labs, a zero-gas layer-one (L1) blockchain, also announced on X that all its remaining development funds were wiped out due to Binance delisting its token amid the recent blowback from the DWF Labs’ market-making scandal. Vite Labs also announced that it will only maintain the network for as long as it can until it can no longer support it. Effectively, all roadmap plans tied to the platform are canceled. A recurring theme in these shutdowns is Binance’s role in determining the fate of smaller crypto projects through delistings. A pattern of delistings Binance had announced on February 17, 2025, that it would delist VITE among other tokens such as AirDAO (AMB), CLV (CLV), and StormX (STMX) on February 24, 2025. About a month later, on March 21, 2025, Binance announced that it will delist LINEAR Finance and others: Aergo (AERGO), Airswap (AST), BurgerCities (BURGER), and COMBO (COMBO) from its platform by March 28, 2025. This led holders of the various tokens to liquidate their assets before the set delisting date. According to Binance, it reviews digital assets periodically to ensure that they continue to meet a high standard and industry requirements. For coins that are found wanting in terms of these standards and requirements, Binance says it will review and potentially delist them from its platform. Some of the metrics Binance reportedly looks at when considering delisting a digital asset are trading volume and liquidity, community sentiments, commitment of the team to the project, evidence of unethical/fraudulent conduct or negligence, and new regulatory requirements, among others. Linear Finance’s reaction and Vite Labs’ accelerated demise In its initial reaction to the announcement on March 21, Linear Finance tried to reassure its community, stating that it had been in discussions with Binance and that the delisting decision came from the highest levels. The platform also mentioned that a significant portion of its trading volume was generated on a variety of platforms such as Bitget, Mexc, Kucoin, Gate.io, HTX, and many other exchanges, informing users to also access their perpetual contracts on Kraken, Phemex, and more. Linear Finance didn’t give any hint of its impending shutdown, having reiterated its commitment to continue according to its roadmap and also focus on its new AI-focused strategy, which, according to them, will drive the next phase. However, in its latest announcement, Linear Finance revealed that all key stakeholders had exited their positions. The platform also added that its operations teams will be in touch with users with active positions across its dApps on how they can make their exits with clear timelines. Vite Labs, already aware of its situation a month prior, announced in February that due to the delisting event, it was going to close down its gateway in April. The platform then made another announcement on March 3, 2025, calling all users to withdraw their assets as the gateway was going to be closed on March 10, 2025, a month earlier than the initially planned shutdown. Binance’s new delisting mechanism raises further questions Binance’s latest moves come after it announced that it will be trying out a new delisting mechanism where users will be invited to participate in what it called “Vote to Delist” and “Vote to List” campaigns. It shared a list of criteria to qualify for the voting, adding that only verified users will be allowed to vote on whether certain tokens that find themselves on the Binance monitoring zone should be delisted. Today, @binance delisted $AERGO , $AST , $BURGER , $COMBO , and $LINA — then moments later posted: “Binance values community input and recognizes that it is a key driving force in the course of our development. We recently introduced two community co-governance listing mechanisms,… — Linear Finance (@LinearFinance) March 22, 2025 In reaction to that announcement, Linear Finance posted an excerpt of Binance’s community voting announcement and added that it wasn’t accorded any of those courtesies by Binance, saying, “there was no vote, no warning, and zero transparency. We’re disgusted by the hypocrisy. The community deserves better.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

According to the data shared by the Bitcoin proponent, Bitcoin appears to be severely undervalued at this time, with its long-standing rival, Gold, outperforming. While Bitcoin’s overall market value sits at $2 trillion, Gold’s market value is a staggering $20 trillion. Highlighting another notable difference in value, PlanB observed that “Bitcoin scarcity (S2F-ratio) is 120 versus gold 60 years.” Anticipating a potential surge in market value, PlanB expressed optimism for the near term. “Let’s see what this halving cycle will bring.” He asserted. Bitcoin halving-expectations and the broader crypto market The Bitcoin halving event occurs once every four years and cuts circulating Bitcoins by 50%. It was last observed on April 20th, 2024, with block rewards reduced to 3.125 BTC. Post-Bitcoin halving expectations are usually bullish, as historical data displays a massive price value increase in long- and short-term cases. In 2016, Bitcoin soared by more than 271% in price value after halving. In 2020, the asset recorded the highest post-halving price rally, with gains increasing more than 234%. Bitcoin has since recorded a 36% increase from last year’s $63,825 pre-halving price in April. However, it is important to see how macro factors affect price in the long term. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading at a press time price of $87,361. The asset remains in a critical position, as long liquidated positions hit $400 million. According to market analyst Amr Taha, BTC holding above the short-term realized price could signal a rise in demand. On the flip side, a breakdown below these levels suggests a potential reversal.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-27 19:50:40

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Inmoral tells his 230,800 followers on the social media platform X that the crypto king will make a pit stop around the $85,000 level before shooting up to $100,000. “$90,000 > $85,000 > $100,000.” Source: Inmortal/X The trader’s chart indicates that the top crypto asset by market cap will once again cross into six-figure territory sometime in May. According to Inmortal, the $90,000 level is where the flagship digital asset will be tested . However, before it can cross that barrier, its monthly open – or the price it opened up the month with – needs to be retested. BTC is trading for $87,015 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours. On March 1st, BTC opened up with a price of $84,373. Moving on to the smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ), Inmortal says the Ethereum ( ETH ) rival is primed to bounce back from its recent dip of over 60%, as it did in 2021 before it sparked a massive rally. “In 2021, SOL did a -67% right before a +1200% Just a reminder, the current -61% dip is not a game over.” Source: Inmortal/X Solana is trading for $134.60 at time of writing, a 1.2% decrease during the last day.

A press release on March 26 states that the offering consists of zero-coupon convertible senior notes maturing in 2030. Investors will have the option to convert the notes into GameStop’s Class A common stock at a later price, and GameStop will retain the flexibility to settle conversions in cash, shares, or a combination of both. Following the announcement, GameStop stock (GME) surged over 11% to trade at $28.36. Strategic Shift Toward Bitcoin While the debt offering aims for a $1.3 billion raise, it could go as high as $1.5 billion. As stated in the release, the company plans to give the initial purchasers the option to purchase up to $200 million in extra notes. “GameStop expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy,” the company said in the release. The Fortune 500 company had earlier hinted at a decision to add Bitcoin to its treasury reserve. On March 25, the company said that its board unanimously approved an update to add Bitcoin to its investment policy. The approval came over a month after CNBC reported that GameStop is considering investment in alternative asset classes, including Bitcoin. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen also signaled this growing interest, meeting recently with Michael Saylor, Strategy’s co-founder and leading advocate for corporate Bitcoin adoption. GameStop’s Crypto Push GameStop has now joined a growing list of public companies raising funds via debt instruments to acquire Bitcoin. The move is led by Strategy, a US-based software company that has bought over $40 billion worth of Bitcoin. Semler Scientific, MARA Holdings, and Riot Platforms have also taken similar routes. GameStop previously explored crypto through its NFT marketplace, which launched in 2022. However, the company scaled back in 2024 due to regulatory uncertainty.

Could This Emerging Altcoin Be Set To Flip XRP?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/where-next-for-ripple-xrp-1-50-or-5-could-this-emerging-altcoin-be-set-to-flip-xrp/,"XRP is still in the region of $2.39 and trapped in a narrow trading range of $2.35 and $2.55. Most people prefer the outlook, recently pumped in many traders by SEC recent dismissal suit against Ripple Labs along with the sensible targets of many analysts. Some analysts predict XRP to reach a high of between $6-$27 in 2025-2026 and up to $10 by 2030. Still, the bullish sentiment leaves door open to questions — can XRP’s momentum be maintained, or is it merely a prelude to newer, more vibrant altcoins overtaking the token? A promising prospect is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new DeFi project that is already gaining rapid traction. As XRP traders discuss its future, MUTM’s presale is generating headlines itself, with what remains of Phase 3 nearly 80% sold out at $0.02 a token. The next phase will bring a 25% price increase to $0.025, so early investors will start with immediate upside just by holding before the next stage starts. XRP at a Crossroads: Breakout or Breakdown? XRP’s recent period of sideways movement leaves it primed for a volatility spike. We have seen formation of symmetrical triangle patterns which has resistance around $2.40 and support around $2.28. A firm close over $2.55 could send it up towards $2.88, while a fall below $2.28 may trigger a dip to $2.00. Technical indicators are mixed—RSI at 51.45 implies balance between buyers and sellers and MACD shows a weak bullish crossover. The possible Ripple IPO compounds the speculation. The company’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently suggested the company might prepare for an initial public offering, a prospect that is fueling bullish bets. But critics caution that previous overly optimistic projections have not always been realized. Should XRP fall flat on its face, investors might redirect themselves to altcoins with less abstract upward potential. Surge of the Presale: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As the motion for XRP is still in limbo, Mutuum Finance has been catching the eye of the community with an ostensibly attractive lending model and bold tokenomics. Now in Phase 3 of its 11-phase presale, MUTM has raised $5,000,000 and secured 6,900 holders already. The token’s $0.02 price will rise 25% to $0.025 in the next phase — that’s a guaranteed gain for early participants. The actual attraction is its original starting price of $0.06 and a potential 200% return for Phase 3 investors. That’s just the beginning, with post-listing predictions showing a potential squeeze to $1.50-$5.00 which would deliver an ROI of 7,400% to 25,000% to ground-floor purchasers. In contrast to speculative assets, refinanced on the demand of the project fund, the utility of MUTM is further reinforced through buy-and-distribution mechanisms. Here revenue generated by the platform is directed towards the repurchase of tokens, thus forming a point of steady demand. In Perspective: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) vs XRP While XRP’s future depends on regulatory clarity and adoption, MUTM already has utility. Its lending protocol enables users to deposit assets, mint yield-bearing mtTokens, and generate passive income — a functional edge over many DeFi projects. The team is also wrapping up a Certik audit of its smart contracts for an extra layer of security and trust. As Phase 3 sells out quickly, the time to get the best prices for MUTM is running out! So while XRP might have legacy appeal, for some investors − the type purely looking for explosive short-term gains to be backed up by long-term utility, Mutuum Finance makes for a very tempting prospect. Time to Decide The future of XRP remains uncertain — will it moon to those previous highs again or will it dump again? With a presale that’s seeing momentum and deflationary tokenomics, Mutuum Finance is a high-growth prospect. However, for those looking to catch the next altcoin breakout, MUTM’s phase now is a rare opportunity to enter before prices begin to climb. It’s not just where if not when XRP will go — it’s whether you’re missing the boat on the next big mover.

SHIB Burn Rate Up 112% & Monero Faces Price Uncertainty,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdags-ambassador-program-accelerates-growth-presale-hits-207m-shib-burn-rate-up-112-monero-faces-price-uncertainty/,"Monero (XMR) continues to be influenced by the movement of the broader crypto market. While its strong privacy features make it appealing, there’s no certainty that its current value will hold. In comparison, Shiba Inu’s burn rate has jumped 112%. However, only 57.6 million SHIB were burned in the past week, which is relatively low considering its massive supply. This keeps SHIB’s circulation volume high. Despite the rise, the inconsistency in SHIB’s burn rate leaves room for doubt about its long-term impact. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has climbed 2,380% since Batch 1 of its presale. It has now crossed the $207 million mark, as excitement builds around its expanding reach. Much of this growth is fueled by its Ambassador Program, which is rapidly bringing in new communities. With adoption growing and supply shrinking, BDAG is gaining recognition as one of the most talked-about platforms in crypto. Monero Price Prediction: Can XMR Hit $316? Monero (XMR) keeps transaction data private, making it a go-to option for those seeking confidentiality. Because of this, many are paying attention to Monero price prediction updates. Analysts forecast a possible increase in XMR’s value in the upcoming months. Currently, Monero sits at $207, with a total market cap of $3.8 billion. According to the latest Monero price prediction, XMR could rise to $316 if favorable market conditions continue. On the downside, if the market turns bearish, it could fall below $194. Analysts expect the average price in 2025 to be around $255, though long-term growth will rely on usage and market activity. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Climbs but Overall Volume Stays Low Over the last 24 hours, the Shiba Inu burn rate rose by 112%, even though just 1,813,008 SHIB tokens were burned. The previous day saw only 851,788 SHIB burned, marking a 63% drop. Overall, weekly burn activity is still minimal. Burn activity continues to shift with market volatility, making consistent SHIB reductions unpredictable. Weekly data shows 57.6 million SHIB were removed from circulation, though that marks a 47.47% drop from the week prior. While the Shiba Inu burn rate does reflect active community participation, whether this will lead to a lasting price effect remains uncertain. BlockDAG Presale Reaches $207M as Global Expansion Picks Up Speed Rising at a rapid pace, BlockDAG’s presale has now raised over $207 million with 18.9 billion BDAG coins already sold. The coin’s value has jumped 2,380% since the start of Batch 1, signaling massive interest. Its growing Ambassador Program is helping BDAG move into new areas and build momentum. This program is increasing BlockDAG’s exposure by connecting it with new audiences across various regions. Ambassadors help explain BDAG’s purpose and benefits to wider communities, making it easier for people to get involved. As more discover BDAG, demand keeps increasing, and adoption widens. This strengthens its image as the best crypto platform currently. With more than 170,000 people holding BDAG now, its growing user base is creating scarcity. As availability goes down and interest grows, prices are expected to rise. Batch 27 is almost gone, showing just how much belief there is in BDAG’s potential. Those who buy now are gaining early access to the growth before it becomes more expensive. The mix of presale success and a fast-growing Ambassador network shows BDAG is on a major upward path. With demand on the rise and more people joining daily, BDAG is proving to be one of the strongest picks right now. In a Nutshell! To sum up, the Monero price prediction is still unclear, as its future depends on continued privacy usage and general market movements. While it could climb higher, a drop is also possible. Shiba Inu’s burn rate rose 112%, but actual burn totals remain small. So, it’s still difficult to tell whether this will have a lasting effect on SHIB’s value. On the other hand, BlockDAG continues to gain speed. With a presale that has topped $207 million and a 2,380% rise since its launch, BDAG is gathering momentum fast. Its Ambassador Program is helping it grow even further. That’s why, for those watching closely, BDAG stands out as the best crypto platform before its price rises again.

However, a critical invalidation level stands in the way of this bullish scenario, threatening Bitcoin’s projected rally if breached. On March 26, Gert van Lagen, a well-known crypto analyst on the X social media platform, predicted that the Bitcoin price could hit a bullish target between $200,000 and $300,000. The analyst’s chart suggests that Bitcoin’s price action in the past few years has closely followed a classic market cycle structure, moving through the Accumulation, Redistribution, Re-accumulation, and Distribution phases. Bitcoin Price Eyes New ATH Above $260,000 According to Lagen, Bitcoin has successfully broken out of a seven-month re-accumulation phase, signaling the potential start of a powerful uptrend. Between late 2022 and early 2023, the cryptocurrency experienced an accumulation phase in which smart money entered the market at low prices when BTC had bottomed out. This was followed by a strong rally that led to a rapid price appreciation to new highs. Related Reading: Global M2 Vs. Bitcoin Shows Bullishness As Analyst Sets ‘Blast Off’ Date, Here’s When After consolidating for seven months in mid-2023 – early 2024, Bitcoin formed a range, allowing the market to absorb supply before another price breakout. Notably, this trend continued in 2025, with BTC breaking out of a seven-month re-accumulation phase. Based on the trajectory of Lagen’s price chart, Bitcoin’s next leg up is a sharp rise to $240,000, followed by a brief correction before rallying to a price peak between $290,000 and $300,000. After hitting this ATH, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin will decline and undergo a period of choppy trading, experiencing price fluctuations between $220,000 and $260,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s projected rise to an ATH and the following sideways trading are expected to occur during its distribution phase, which is typically characterized by increased sell-offs and market volatility. Once BTC experiences a final surge to $260,000, Lagen predicts a price crash toward $148,000 – $136,000, marking the possible end of the bull rally and the start of the bear market. Key Invalidation Level Threatening BTC’s Rally Lagen’s optimistic price forecast for Bitcoin is being threatened by a key invalidation level, which could halt the cryptocurrency’s potential surge to $200,000 – $300,000. Although Bitcoin’s bullish structure remains intact, the analyst warns that a weekly close below the 40-week LSMA would invalidate its breakout.

As long as it holds above this level, Lagen believes that its bullish trajectory will be sustained. However, a drop below $73,900, which already represents a 15% decline from BTC’s current market price, could postpone the projected surge or cancel it altogether.

In a new video, Turner tells 2.66 million subscribers of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel that Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the past couple of months, despite expectations that ETH would follow the flagship crypto asset’s lead and rally. “Ethereum’s performance has been so poor that it’s basically become a meme while BTC has rallied to new all-time highs… ETH has yet to reclaim its 2021 high of around $4,900. In fact, Ethereum is one of the only major altcoins yet to experience any price movements for us to get excited about. During this cycle, ETH’s price has struggled to break above the key resistance level of $4,000, significantly lower than its previous all-time high… You only have to take a look at ETH’s price against BTC to see that Ethereum has been bleeding against Bitcoin since September 2022, with no signs of that slowing down. All in all, then, it’s not looking good, bro.” Ethereum is trading at $2,066 at time of writing. According to Turner, the competition both within and outside the ecosystem is one of the reasons Ethereum is underperforming. “In the eyes of many, the biggest thing hurting ETH’s price is the massive number of layer-2s within Ethereum’s ecosystem… …many believe that liquidity fragmentation is the biggest reason why ETH’s price has underperformed. And layer-2s have arguably stolen some of the venture capitalist mind share… …another challenge for Ethereum – and that’s the growing competition from those aforementioned Ethereum killers. For anyone unaware, these are smart contract blockchains that threaten Ethereum’s dominance by effectively offering an alternative to Ethereum. Now, some of the leading Ethereum-killers by market cap include Solana, BNB Chain, Aptos, Avalanche and Sui, among many others.” Turner further says that the macroeconomic landscape is also negatively impacting Ethereum’s price. “Another major challenge comes from the macro environment, specifically high interest rates. That’s because higher interest rates are reflected in government bonds, which are popular among institutional investors… …the yield on US government bonds is 4.28%. Meanwhile, ETH staking offers a yield of just 3%. This means that institutional investors who love earning a consistent yield are much more inclined to stick with government bonds as a result.” ?

This marks Ripple’s second major partnership with a payments-focused African FinTech, reinforcing its presence in the continent’s fast-growing digital payments sector. Ripple And Chipper Cash To Transform African Remittances According to a March 27 announcement, Chipper Cash will integrate Ripple’s blockchain-based payment solutions to enable faster, cheaper, and more efficient settlements. With this integration, cross-border transactions will become much easier and instantaneous, as customers can receive funds from across the globe, around the clock, according to Ripple. With 5 million customers across nine African countries, Chipper Cash aims to capitalize on the region’s booming remittance sector. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, noted that the collaboration is a key step in the company’s expansion in the region. Merrick also emphasized that African consumers and businesses “are increasingly recognizing the potential of blockchain technology.” Besides the fast and affordable payments, the alliance will boost economic growth and innovation in the markets it serves, he quipped. “By integrating our technology into Chipper Cash’s platform, we’re enabling faster, more affordable cross-border payments while driving economic growth and innovation across the markets they serve. Accelerating Financial Inclusion Ham Serunjogi, Co-Founder and CEO of Chipper Cash, suggested that crypto-enabled payments can accelerate financial inclusion, offering greater access to global markets and empowering both businesses and individuals across Africa. Ripple’s partnership with Chipper Cash builds on its expanding presence in Africa, which started with a partnership with Onafriq , a payments network connecting African markets, in 2023. The Onafriq partnership seeks to enable digital asset-powered cross-border transactions between Africa and multiple new markets, including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the UK, and Australia.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,MARKET|XRP|TECHNOLOGY|SPONSORED|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-27 20:00:50

Trump nominated Atkins back in December, replacing former chairman Gary Gensler, whose crackdown-heavy term left a trail of lawsuits and regulatory hostility toward crypto firms. Until now, Mark Uyeda had been serving as acting chair. During his opening remarks, Atkins made it clear he plans to roll back the SEC’s existing approach. He told the Senate panel that “the current regulatory environment for our financial system inhibits investment and too often punishes success.” He called the rules “unclear, overly politicized, complicated, and burdensome,” and said they’re killing capital formation. Atkins said investors today are “flooded with disclosures that do the opposite of helping them understand the true risks of an investment,” and called for a full reset of the SEC’s priorities. Warren accuses Atkins of hiding $25 million Patomak deal Elizabeth Warren, top Democrat on the Banking Committee and long-time crypto critic, targeted Atkins over what she called “breathtaking” conflicts of interest stemming from his ownership stake in Patomak, his consulting firm that’s worked with major banks, trade groups, and investment giants. Warren asked Atkins directly: “Will you disclose who the buyers are and how much they pay, so that we can make certain that these are not people who are just buying access to the future chair of the SEC?” Atkins replied, “Senator Warren, I have abided by the Office of Government Ethics’ process.” Warren interrupted him, saying, “So that is a ‘no’ — you’re not going to tell us who you sell it to and how much money you get. Some people might call that a pre-bribe.” Her concern centered on Atkins’ plan to offload his ownership in Patomak, which is valued at over $25 million, while possibly landing in a position to make regulatory calls that could benefit his former clients. She said that Atkins would be “in a prime spot to deliver for all those clients” once he assumes the chairmanship. Earlier in the week, Warren sent Atkins a 34-page letter pressing for answers about his plans for separating from Patomak and navigating his potential conflicts. She said that his team only replied 10 minutes before the hearing, claiming, “no, you think you’ve done enough.” She told the room, “That is deeply concerning to me.” Despite the backlash, Atkins promised in his ethics paperwork to recuse himself for one year from any matters involving Patomak or its clients. That didn’t slow Warren or other Democrats on the panel, who openly doubted how much distance Atkins could realistically keep from firms he spent over a decade advising. Atkins pledges SEC overhaul, softer stance on crypto Atkins laid out plans to erase Gensler’s enforcement-heavy playbook. Instead of cracking down first and asking questions later, he said the agency should aim to support functioning markets and only use enforcement to “cure and rectify wayward actions.” He wants the SEC to help the system work better, not punish it into compliance. Atkins addressed the crypto industry directly by saying that one of his top goals will be to create “a firm regulatory foundation” for crypto by working with Congress and his fellow commissioners on what he called “a rational, coherent and principled approach.” Senator Tim Scott, the committee’s chairman, took a shot at Gensler’s tenure, telling Atkins, “One thing I can say about the SEC is that under your predecessor, there was no golden age.” Scott listed a handful of examples of what he called regulatory chaos and said the agency had lost its way. Atkins responded by saying the issues were “disturbing,” and added that he plans to “cure dysfunction and demoralization” inside the SEC and rebuild morale. “We need to get back to the mission,” he said. He wants to shift the SEC away from politics and toward clarity. Chris Van Hollen questioned Atkins about the future of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Atkins raised the possibility that the board might be folded back into the SEC but said he wasn’t in favor of scrapping it. “Its function is vital,” he told the panel. When Jim Banks brought up ESG investing and its rise under Gensler, Atkins responded that he plans to “get politics out of the financial markets and out of how the SEC interacts with the financial markets.” He added, “That will end and we will have protections in place so money managers are focused on investment strategy and not politics.” Kennedy, Hagerty, and Moreno go full unfiltered on Gensler and SBF The hearing wasn’t all policy. John Kennedy, never one to miss a shot at humor, asked Atkins, “Is it true that Senator Hagerty has a tattoo of the Backstreet Boys on his lower back?” before switching gears to demand answers about how Atkins will deal with Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the now-defunct FTX. Kennedy warned Atkins that every time he returns to testify, “I will pounce on him like a ninja” to check in on the SEC’s progress. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee and longtime friend of Atkins, vouched for his experience. “Paul has developed an unmatched understanding of financial markets and their regulatory challenges,” said Hagerty, who added that he’s used Atkins and his team at Patomak to help guide companies he’s invested in. Bernie Moreno torched Gensler’s reputation while praising Atkins by comparison. “You just have to be able to breathe and not be a complete raging lunatic and you’ll be the greatest SEC commissioner compared to the last guy,” he said, adding that Gensler was “objectively one of the stupidest people in government.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Meanwhile, Arctic Pablo Coin? It just entered Location 16, Crystal Cove, and things are heating up like never before. Prices are about to jump, and the clock is ticking faster than ever. For those hunting the best new meme coins to join for long term, Arctic Pablo’s mystical journey is more than just hype — it’s a whole movement. At $0.000083, with over $2 million raised and more than 9552% ROI potential by listing, this isn’t just a coin; it’s a legend in the making. Each presale “location” represents a new realm of opportunity, not just another stage like the rest of the market. This mythical discovery trail — from frozen cliffs to hidden crystal realms — is tied directly to Pablo’s price increases and token burns. That’s right: unsold tokens go up in flames every single week. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): Uncover Earth’s Mysteries Welcome to a whole new breed of meme coin. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t some recycled dog clone or pixelated joke. This is where narrative meets net worth — and right now, it’s roaring from Crystal Cove, Location 16 of its mythical presale expedition. Picture it: Pablo, the frost-bound adventurer, rides across icy frontiers on his snowmobile, unearthing ancient wealth locked beneath the Earth’s forgotten locations. And those shimmering artifacts? They’re $APC tokens. Each “location” marks a price hike, a fresh burn of leftover coins, and a countdown to the next leg of the journey. It’s not just deflationary — it’s theatrical scarcity on steroids. Currently priced at $0.000083, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an eye-watering potential ROI of 9552.41% when it hits its projected launch price of $0.008. What does that mean in dollar terms? That’s a one-way ticket from “meh” to the moon. And with over $2 million already raised, the public is clearly waking up. Here’s what makes Arctic Pablo one of the best new meme coins to join for long term : It doesn’t just promise rewards — it delivers an entire experience. Investors don’t just buy tokens; they step into a saga. There’s also that killer staking program delivering a fat 66% APY — coins staked now will be vested for two months post-launch, and early stakers will earn massively while riding shotgun with Pablo himself. Arctic Pablo Coin’s $0.1 Prediction Sparks Investor Frenzy Crypto analysts are eyeing Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) as a high-potential opportunity, with some forecasting a surge to $0.1 post-launch. With an initial listing price of $0.008, early investors could see massive gains. Right now, $100 at the presale price of $0.000083 secures about 1,204,819 tokens. If APC reaches $0.1, that investment could skyrocket to $120,481. As the presale accelerates toward its next milestone, investors are rushing to get in before prices climb. Floki Inu: The Viking Dog with a Long-Term Game Plan Floki Inu might’ve started riding the tailwinds of the Elon Musk hype train, but this Viking pup has gone from just another meme coin to a full-blown ecosystem. And now in 2025, it’s flexing with actual utility with long-term potential written all over it. Just this week, Floki rolled out updates to its flagship Valhalla metaverse and expanded its push into the DeFi and ed-tech spaces. That’s right — Floki’s educational arm, “Floki University,” aims to bring crypto literacy to the masses, which is a smart move in a market where long-term adoption matters more than quick pumps. This makes Floki Inu a legitimate contender among the best meme coins to join for long term, especially for those tired of rug pulls and soft floors. The coin runs on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, which adds flexibility, and with a vibrant community of “Floki Vikings,” it has staying power. Now trading around $0.00017 with a $1.6 billion market cap, Floki still has runway if it keeps executing on its roadmap. It’s not as early-stage as Arctic Pablo, but it’s still carving out fresh verticals. They’re also burning tokens regularly, adding some scarcity spice to their already-tight supply. Apu Apustaja: Nostalgia-Fueled Meme Madness with Room to Explode Remember those absurd little frog memes from the early 2010s? Apu Apustaja (aka “Apu Helper”) is bringing them back with a vengeance, not just for the lols. Apu’s $APU token is now trending among nostalgic Gen Z and Millennial traders who miss the raw chaos of OG internet culture. Apu’s secret sauce? That sweet cocktail of nostalgia, irony, and high meme-ability that gives it natural virality. It’s currently priced around $0.0000000117 and has a $120 million market cap, meaning there’s still serious upside for long-term believers. While Arctic Pablo offers the immersive narrative and Floki pushes utility, Apu is here to serve meme culture in its purest, weirdest form. Unlike other meme tokens that fizzle post-launch, Apu reinvigorates the hype with community-driven antics, viral campaigns, and new art drops. It’s a decentralized troll fest, but with actual tokenomics and plans to build NFT integrations and meme-themed mini-games. While not all of it is baked yet, that’s kind of the appeal — it’s chaotic and loud, and it might just be 100x if the community keeps doing what it does best: making noise. Final Thoughts: Time to Choose Your Meme Adventure Based on our research and market trends, one thing’s clear: meme coins aren’t dying — they’re evolving. And the most intelligent investors are locking into projects with vision, utility, and explosive growth potential. Arctic Pablo Coin is the heavyweight here, offering narrative-driven ROI with insane upside potential — 9552% from its current $0.000083 to its $0.008 listing price. That’s no meme; that’s math. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now — and step into a story that could change your financial destiny. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs : What makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the best new meme coins to join for long term? Its unique location-based presale, 66% APY staking, weekly token burns, and 9552% ROI potential set it apart from typical meme coins. How much can a $100 investment in Arctic Pablo Coin return? At the current price of $0.000083, a $100 investment could become $9,638.55 at the listing price of $0.008. Is Floki Inu still a good long-term investment in 2025? Yes, with ongoing development in metaverse, DeFi, and education, Floki is building real long-term value.

Speaking at a news conference in Virginia, Bondi said the specifics of when fighter jets would depart and when bombs would fall were “not classified.” Her comments come amid public debate over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s decision to send details of an upcoming attack on rebels in Yemen to senior administration officials in a Signal group chat that mistakenly included a magazine editor. Pam Bondi in a news conference in Virginia. Source: WQAD News 8 Bondi described the information as “sensitive, not classified, and inadvertently released.” She praised the military operation as a “very successful mission” and quickly shifted focus to criticize past administrations. “If you want to talk about classified information, talk about what was in Hillary Clinton’s home,” she said. “Talk about the classified documents in Joe Biden’s garage, that Hunter Biden had access to.” Bondi pointed out that while the Justice Department opened investigations into both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden, neither faced criminal charges. She made no mention of the earlier prosecution regarding Donald J. Trump’s handling of classified documents, a case that was dropped after his reelection. Former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Zweiback has handled classified info investigations. He said, “In terms of prior investigations, there were set-out standards that the department always looked at and tried to follow when making determinations about which types of disclosures they were going to pursue.” The Signal chat leaks don’t fall under traditional classification of military plans She emphasized that the details in question, though sensitive, did not fall under the traditional classification of “military plans, weapons or operations” as defined by decades of practice dating back to the Reagan administration. While the F.B.I. and the Justice Department still have the authority to investigate under the Espionage Act—which allows for charges over mishandling national defense information even if it is not classified—such prosecutions are extremely rare. The incident unfolded this month when, mere hours before military strikes against Houthi targets, Defense Secretary Hegseth texted the group outlining the plan of attack, including the specific time when “the first bombs will definitely drop.” After the operation was carried out, the details of the conversation were revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, who had been accidentally included in the group chat. Hegseth and other senior officials said that the information he shared was not classified, arguing that it was ultimately up to his department to decide what should be considered classified. National security experts, however, criticized this stance as contrary to basic common sense and longstanding practices among military and intelligence agencies. The debate over the leaked information spilled into Capitol Hill during a congressional hearing on Wednesday. Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, assured the House Intelligence Committee that “no sources, methods, locations or war plans” were shared in the text. In response, Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat from Texas, dismissed the claims, stating, “You all know that’s a lie. It’s a lie to the country.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Turbo rode the wave as a meme token born from GPT-4, while AI Companions (AIC) tapped into on-chain AI experiences. Both found early success by jumping on the latest tech, turning heads with their unique ideas. But behind the scenes, their momentum was more about novelty than sustainable design. Now enter Dragoin ($DDGN) —a project that flips the script. Instead of riding hype, it’s building around clarity, structure, and community engagement. For investors who are done with blind bets and chasing trends, Dragoin offers a plan—and it’s turning heads fast. Turbo (TURBO): AI-Built Meme Coin That Exploded from Day One Turbo (TURBO) made a splash in April 2023 as a meme coin designed using GPT-4, instantly setting itself apart in the crypto crowd. With a massive 69 billion token supply and no presale, it gave the community full access from the beginning. The AI origin story fueled intense interest, and by late May 2023, Turbo had rocketed nearly 1,800%. Its all-time high of $0.01436 came on December 11, 2024. As of March 24, 2025, Turbo trades at $0.002438—83.14% off its peak but still delivering for those who got in early. It’s up 6.64% over the past 24 hours, with a current market cap of $168 million. Despite price swings, Turbo’s AI roots continue to fuel investor interest, making it a standout among meme coins. AI Companions (AIC): Merging Crypto with On-Chain AI Utility AI Companions (AIC) launched in early 2024, aiming to blend blockchain with personalized AI avatars. Unlike typical meme coins, AIC had real features—users could engage with custom-built AI personalities straight from their wallets. This creative use of AI caught the attention of investors and technophiles alike. On February 4, 2025, the token hit a record high of $0.5446. Currently, on March 24, 2025, AIC sits at $0.215221, showing a 4.30% gain in 24 hours and a 2.50% increase over the week. It’s down about 60.5% from its peak, but early buyers have seen solid returns. With a circulating supply of 750 million tokens and a $161 million market cap, AIC continues to hold its place as a niche leader in the AI-token space. It’s a bold mix of future tech and functional appeal. Dragoin’s Presale Model Might Be the Reset Crypto Needs In a crypto space that’s often wild and unpredictable, Dragoin ($DDGN) is turning heads with something rare: order. No sudden token drops or vague promises—just a 25-stage presale plan, each with clearly marked price points. This format rewards early movers without springing surprises, creating a system where structure beats chaos. But the real difference? Dragoin spells everything out. Token allocation, referral bonuses, supply mechanics—it’s all on display. Investors don’t need to guess. And when the presale ends, any unsold tokens aren’t saved for later—they’re burned. That means less supply, more scarcity, and no inflation traps waiting around the corner. Even better, Dragoin’s team plans to give up smart contract ownership after launch. That move puts control in the community’s hands—not behind closed doors. For investors wary of projects that vanish overnight or change rules mid-game, Dragoin’s approach brings real confidence. This isn’t just another meme coin trying to go viral—it’s a project using structure as its superpower. For investors who want transparency, Dragoin may be the next move that actually makes sense. Dragoin’s Design Could Outlast the Flashiest Hype Turbo turned heads with its AI origin story. AI Companions added depth with interactive tech. Both succeeded by doing something different—but neither offered a clear path forward. That’s where Dragoin ($DDGN) stands tall. With a fixed presale model, supply control, and honest communication, it isn’t just trying to look different—it is different. No smoke, no mirrors. Just a transparent rollout with incentives, structure, and strategy. While some tokens rely on sudden spikes and social buzz, Dragoin is giving early adopters a reason to stay for the long haul. It’s built like a campaign—with rules, milestones, and rewards that make sense. For anyone scanning the horizon for a token that isn’t all noise, Dragoin might just be what comes next.

A Comparative Price Analysis and Presale Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/will-floppypepe-fppe-outpace-dogecoins-growth-a-comparative/,"Dogecoin has positioned itself as the pioneer coin in the meme coin arena, dominating the cryptosphere and showing the sheer strength of a community backing a project. With the help of meme culture, Dogecoin experienced an impressive surge in 2021 alongside the crypto trend, reaching the high of 0.74 USD, which also made several millionaires down the line. However, the current average price for Dogecoin sits between 0.18 and 0.19, which is its current price in the crypto market as of March 25, 2025. Experts have varying opinions on Dogecoin’s future growth, range, and trends. While projecting a price growth of anywhere between 0.18 and 1.07, these values would rely heavily on speculation. While on the other hand, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is expected to surge after its presale. FloppyPepe Is Expected to Fare Well Considering Key Factors; Focus on Advertising Boosts Consumer Recognition Unlike other meme coins in the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) managed to do something different from the rest—adopting AI into its project and offering development, making it ready to use, contrary to adopting inflationary policies. Currently in the presale stage, Floppy sits at a price of 0.0000002. The success of the private sale exceeding $900,000 in just 24 hours and surpassing $1 million in the public round indicates strong confidence from investors. Analysts expect growth to be exponential, with figures ranging from a 930% forecast to an incomprehensible 60,000% increase by the end of 2025. Some forecast a more immediate rise from $0.0000025 to $0.000005 during the mid-second quarter of 2025. FloppyPepe: AI Utility and Deflationary Tokenomics Advantages The potential growth of FloppyPepe (FPPE) lies on its AI tools, capable of generating memes, which helps to deepen user engagement vertically. Meanwhile, the market gives crypto-fluent AI agents and video content creators autonomous instruction-driven FloppyX, enhancing the user experience. Moreover, the defined tokenomics of FloppyPepe, driven by a 1% burn on every transaction, increases scarcity and demand. Holders of tokens are also rewarded through 1% redistribution on transactions redistributing wealth, thus securing long-term investors. The complete smart contract audit of the project done by SolidProof enhances trust among investors. FloppyPepe: Unique Potential Unlike Dogecoin, whose price movement and growth are based entirely on social hype, FloppyPepe ’s growth is driven by AI utility and steep, powered deflationary tokenomics. The presale value of FloppyPepe at $0.0000002 is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for profit compounding. The asset possesses unique AI capabilities coupled with robust community backing, marking it a speculative investment with strong upside potential, even outshining Dogecoin’s former reputation. Circumspection and thorough research on FloppyPepe (FPPE) , along with acceptance of the speculative nature of nascent cryptocurrency markets, are essential. Regardless, FloppyPepe’s innovative strategy in conjunction with its devoted community inflates the asset’s potential for capitalism, thereby appealing to risk-seeking investors.

The analyst outlined why he is confident that XRP could soon dominate the leading cryptocurrencies by market cap. Why The XRP Price Could Dominate Bitcoin & Ethereum In an X post , Dark Defender outlined reasons why the altcoin is the “One” and why the XRP price will dominate Bitcoin and Ethereum. First, he stated that the altcoin is the only coin with regulatory clarity, considering that Judge Analisa Torres has declared that the altcoin isn’t a security. Moreover, the US SEC has dropped the Ripple lawsuit, which is also bullish for the altcoin. Secondly, the analyst alluded to the fact that XRP could be included in the Digital Asset stockpile, which US President Donald Trump created through an executive order. He also remarked that ETF approvals are imminent, which also provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin. Market expert Nate Geraci also recently predicted that XRP ETF approval is only a matter of time. Polymarket data also shows that there is an 87% chance of an approval this year. Meanwhile, Dark Defender stated that Ripple stablecoins are coming including ones that will be pegged to other currencies, just like the RLUSD. In line with this, the analyst asserted that it was not Bitcoin and it has never been ETH but instead XRP. In another X post, Dark Defender stated that XRP has formed a great bullish rectangle pattern. Based on this, he asserted that this consolidation will be over very soon and that the next leg will welcome new all-time highs. His accompanying chart showed that the altcoin could rally to $11 when this consolidation period is over. Bear Case For The Altcoin Amid this bullish outlook for the XRP price, legendary trader Peter Brandt has raised the possibility of the altcoin dropping to as low as $1.07. He revealed that the crypto is forming a textbook head-and-shoulder pattern. The trader added that XRP is now range bound. Above $3, Brandt stated that he would not want to be short while below $1.9, he would not want to own the altcoin. He further remarked that the bearish pattern projects a decline to $1.07. However, other crypto analysts such as Javon Marks are still bullish on the altcoin. Marks recently suggested that the XRP price could witness a 570% surge as price and RSI break out to the upside.

That said, in the face of this adversity, Bitcoin (BTC) is still maintaining its gains of the last couple of weeks, as it holds above the important 200-day moving average. Decision time coming for Bitcoin Source: TradingView According to the above daily chart, the $BTC price is moving towards a major decision point. Below is the 200-day moving average, which generally provides support during a bull market, and below this is the $80,000 support, and then the hugely strong $70,000 horizontal support which marks the top of the 2021 bull market. Above the price is the descending trendline that started from the $109,000 top, and just above this is the important $91,000 horizontal level which most of the price action, since November 2024, had rested upon as support. The current battle the bulls are having with the $87,000 resistance is the first step to a break higher and a potential start of a trend change. While, if that battle is lost, a break down out of the ascending wedge, and another dip below the 200-day MA is the bearish scenario. Can MACD flip bullish? Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows how the $BTC price eventually burst out of the bull flag and came to a top at $109,000. However, since that time, a downtrend has been persisting. That said, the horizontal support at $80,000 has provided $BTC with the base for a bounce. At the bottom of the chart, the MACD indicator is showing that the blue indicator line is still below the orange indicator line, which is bearish. However, if one looks back at most of the previous 8-month bull flag, it can be seen that this was also the case back then, until the bull flag breakout. This time, if the descending trendline can be broken to the upside, and this could potentially take place as early as next week, a cross back of the indicator lines would likely signal green histogram bars once again, and a possible recontinuation of the bull market.

The move happens amid talk of shifting all confiscated assets to a national crypto reserve. The movement of funds is standard procedure for some assets, but this time, the transaction drew more attention. The transaction originated with a smaller government-controlled wallet. The address is tagged as holding the Sae-Heng confiscated funds. This is one of the more significant transfers of funds, after the government moved 298.93 AVAX linked to Brian Krewson to a new address. Arkham, the on-chain wallet tracking service, tracked the transaction for 93.96 BTC, valued at around $8M. Additionally, 884.33 ETH valued at $1.77M were shifted to a new address. ARKHAM ALERT: US GOVERNMENT MOVING $8M $BTC The US Government just moved $8.46M BTC from Sae-Heng Confiscated Funds. $10 of BTC was sent to: bc1qs0qhmlzh2wvs0n70vn7s6jj37zvek2e7t73kfg The remaining $8.46M moved to a change wallet: bc1q7qf075up5nkd6hejgkmr9ms0fal97w35asrs55 pic.twitter.com/oTBWxTD2pz — Arkham (@arkham) March 27, 2025 The original wallet spent $10 in BTC, then sent the unspent funds to a new address. The $8M is a relatively small sum for the US Government, but all coin movements are watched for intentions of building a reserve of confiscated coins. The main US Government wallet still holds over $17B in crypto assets, with 198K BTC as the biggest part of the reserves. BTC funds came from ‘pig butchering’ scams The Sae-Heng wallet refers to funds confiscated for an alleged ‘pig butchering’ scam perpetrated against US victims. The funds were seized from a Binance account belonging to Wanpadet Sae-Heng. The BTC were confiscated by the US Government two years ago, when Binance sent a direct transaction to the storage wallet . All the confiscated BTC was moved once to a new address in 2022. In total, the confiscated funds from Sae-Heng included 97.33 BTC, 2.56M DOGE, 884.33 ETH, and 85M ADA. In the case of personal scams, the seized funds may be returned to the previous owners, instead of being used for a government reserve. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act is still in the early stages of approval, but there are expectations that the bill may pass during the current US Congress mandate. If passed, the main source of coins for the reserve would come from forfeitures. On March 7, US President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a crypto reserve , which intended to use the BTC already possessed by the US government’s wallet. Crypto advisor David Sachs stated that the US government crypto holdings would undergo an audit to determine the exact holdings available for a reserve. The US Government topped the chart for the biggest state holders of BTC, surpassing China’s confiscated holdings.| Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The key takeaway is that the US Government has now signalled it will not sell its BTC reserves. The US Government is the biggest state holder of BTC, with China in the second place, holding around 190K BTC. The USA is not actively accruing BTC, but has decided against liquidations, despite plans to divest BTC around 2023. Since then, the government’s holdings have appreciated significantly. The US Government still splits its holdings based on the specific hack or exploit. Some of the funds may be returned to the affected victims, while others, like the BTC from the Silk Road wallets, may remain as part of a crypto reserve.

It’s not just the usual hype—these projects have all dropped major updates that are shaking up the crypto space right now. Helium (HNT) is holding strong at $3.37 while pushing forward with its decentralized wireless infrastructure. Story Protocol just dropped some game-changing news through Forbes, revealing a wild new layer of blockchain that’s built for the AI generation. And then there’s Qubetics, dropping jaws with its presale numbers and the kind of tech that fixes what so many blockchains still haven’t figured out—interoperability. Unlike most Web3 projects that get tangled in hype with zero follow-through, Qubetics ($TICS) is all about solving real-world issues that are slowing down crypto adoption. It’s positioning itself as the go-to infrastructure for developers, enterprises, and everyday users who need a seamless way to move assets, data, and contracts between chains. Ethereum? Solana? Bitcoin? Qubetics brings it all together without the usual pain of bridges or limitations. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg—its presale is gaining serious traction for good reason. Buckle up, because these three might just be the best crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics Is Fixing Blockchain’s Biggest Problem — Interoperability, Finally Blockchain’s biggest bottleneck isn’t speed or security—it’s isolation. Most blockchains don’t talk to each other, leaving users and developers stuck in fragmented ecosystems. Qubetics is flipping that reality by becoming the world’s first Web3 aggregator, connecting Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and more into one seamless, scalable network. No more switching wallets or using sketchy bridges—Qubetics is building real interoperability where it actually works. Imagine a gaming company that builds on Ethereum but wants to drop in-game assets on Solana’s cheaper, faster chain. Or a healthcare provider looking to verify encrypted records across different ecosystems in real time. Qubetics makes this happen without breaking a sweat. From enterprise applications to personal wallets, it’s all unified under one decentralized framework. This kind of power doesn’t just sound cool—it’s exactly what crypto needs to go mainstream. And right now, it’s one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics Presale ROI Is Turning Heads: One of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy Now The Qubetics presale is lighting up with some serious momentum, and it’s not just hype—it’s math. Currently in its 27th stage, the $TICS token is priced at $0.1300, and over $15.5 million has already been raised. With 504 million tokens sold and more than 23,900 holders, community members are locking in early before the next price jump. And speaking of that, every Sunday at 12 AM, the token price climbs 10% like clockwork. If that doesn’t build urgency, the ROI numbers definitely will. Let’s say someone dropped $100 right now at the current stage. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that turns into $769.00—a 669.13% ROI. But if it climbs to $5, you’re looking at $3,745.67% ROI. Hit $10? Now we’re talking 7,591.33%. And should it ever reach $15 after mainnet launch in Q2 2025, that same hundred bucks is suddenly worth $11,437. These aren’t pipe dreams—these projections are based on transparent stage pricing, fixed ROI multipliers, and a model that rewards early buyers. No wonder it’s being called one of the best crypto coins to buy now —this Qubetics presale is easily one of the best crypto presale opportunities on the table. Story Protocol Just Rewired IP for the AI Era Story Protocol isn’t just riding the AI wave—it’s building the blockchain layer for it.

This article delves into top digital assets poised for impressive gains before the next quarter kicks off. Discover which coins are set to lead the charge in the upcoming bull run and why they stand out. Upward Pivot Ahead? Sei's Key Levels and Past Price Trends Sei experienced a 20.66% drop over the past month and a steep 53.89% decline over the last six months. A modest 4.59% gain in the past week hints at brief recovery while overall trends remain subdued. Indicators such as the slightly negative Awesome Oscillator and near-neutral momentum reflect ongoing weakness, reinforcing a challenging longer-term outlook despite minor short-term gains. Current levels show resistance near $0.40 and a higher level at $0.55, with support holding at $0.11. The RSI reading just above 50 alongside mixed signals implies neither bulls nor bears are firmly in charge. It is wise to target trades within these bounds and await clear breakouts before making significant entries. Cardano Uptrend Amid Growing Bullish Sentiment Last month saw Cardano advance by about 8% while the six-month performance surged an impressive 84%. The numbers reveal a coin rising consistently after previous lows and building momentum over time. The price history reflects a gradual recovery and solid gains, hinting at a broader altcoin season in motion. Current trading has Cardano priced between $0.44 and $0.88, with key resistance near $1.15 and support at $0.25. Indicators show a balanced battle between bulls and bears, with momentum and RSI around the midpoint suggesting no clear trend yet. Traders may find opportunities by testing support or capitalizing on a break above resistance. Ethena (ENA): Steady Upswing with Bullish Technicals and Defined Levels Ethena showed a consistent rise with a roughly 15% gain over the past month and a 20% increase over six months. Weekly moves added about 10% to its momentum, taking the price from around $0.25 to nearly $0.68. These changes reflect steady growth and growing market confidence, suggesting a gradually emerging bullish setup. Currently, Ethena trades within a range of $0.2547 to $0.6806, with key resistance noted at $0.94 and a second level at $1.37, while support is near $0.09. Technical indicators show a balanced strength with a slight bullish tilt, as the momentum and RSI around 55 hint at buyers being in control. Traders might consider buying near support and targeting a break above resistance for potential gains. Conclusion SEI , ADA , and ENA show strong potential as investments before Q2. SEI offers innovative features that could attract attention. ADA continues to gain traction with its solid infrastructure. ENA shows promise due to its unique use case. Each has the chance to perform well in the market surge anticipated in Q2. Investing in these coins could lead to significant returns.

42496964,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144023,1743110412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether’s Audacious Diversification: Grabs 70% Stake in Adecoagro & Italian Media Firm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-diversification-adecoagro-media/,"In a move that’s turning heads across the crypto and traditional finance worlds, Tether, the entity behind the ubiquitous USDT stablecoin, is doubling down on its diversification strategy. Forget just digital currencies; Tether is planting seeds in Latin American agriculture and making waves in Italian media. Let’s dive into this fascinating development and explore what it means for the future of Tether and the broader financial landscape. Why is Tether Investing Heavily in Adecoagro? Tether’s increased investment in Adecoagro, a major Latin American agricultural company, is a significant signal. Raising its stake from 51% to a commanding 70% with a substantial investment, Tether is clearly serious about this venture. Adecoagro, operating across Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, is a powerhouse in sustainable agriculture, dealing with a range of products from crops to dairy. But why agriculture? Here’s a breakdown: Tangible Assets: In a world increasingly focused on digital assets, investing in real-world, tangible assets like agricultural land and operations offers a layer of security and diversification. Agriculture is a fundamental industry, less correlated with the volatile crypto markets. Inflation Hedge: Historically, agricultural commodities have acted as a hedge against inflation. As concerns about global inflation persist, this move could be seen as a strategic play to protect Tether’s reserves. Geographical Diversification: Adecoagro’s operations span across key Latin American economies, providing geographical diversification for Tether’s portfolio, reducing reliance on any single region’s economic fortunes. Long-Term Growth Potential: The global demand for food is only set to increase. Investing in a well-established agricultural company like Adecoagro positions Tether to benefit from this long-term growth trend. Venturing into Media: What’s the Deal with Be Water? Adding another layer to its diversification strategy, Tether has also acquired a 30.4% stake in Be Water, an Italian media company, for €10 million. This move into the media sector might seem unexpected for a stablecoin issuer. Let’s consider the potential rationale: Broader Asset Portfolio: Investing in a media company further broadens Tether’s asset portfolio beyond crypto and agriculture. Media, like agriculture, can offer different risk-reward profiles and potentially lower correlation with crypto markets. Brand Building & Influence: Media ownership can provide avenues for brand building and shaping public perception. While the specifics of Be Water’s focus are less detailed in the initial report, media assets can offer strategic communication and influence capabilities. Potential Synergies (Indirect): While not immediately obvious, there could be indirect synergies. For instance, media platforms can be used to promote crypto adoption or disseminate information about Tether and its ventures. Financial Returns: Ultimately, Tether likely sees Be Water as a financially sound investment with growth potential in the media landscape. The Big Picture: Tether’s Diversification Strategy Unveiled These investments in Adecoagro and Be Water are not isolated incidents. They are part of a larger, deliberate diversification strategy by Tether. For years, Tether has primarily been known as the issuer of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin. However, relying solely on stablecoin issuance carries risks and limitations. Diversification offers several key benefits : Benefit Description Risk Mitigation Spreading investments across different asset classes reduces overall risk. If one sector underperforms, others may compensate. Enhanced Returns Diversification can potentially lead to higher overall returns by tapping into growth opportunities in various sectors. Reserves Backing Holding a diversified portfolio of assets can strengthen the perceived backing of USDT, increasing confidence in the stablecoin. Strategic Opportunities Venturing into different industries opens up new strategic opportunities and potential partnerships for Tether beyond the crypto space. Are There Challenges to Tether’s Diversification? While diversification offers numerous advantages, it’s not without potential challenges . As Tether expands its reach, it will need to navigate: Operational Complexity: Managing diverse businesses across agriculture, media, and crypto requires a broader range of expertise and operational capabilities. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased diversification, especially into traditional sectors, might attract greater regulatory attention and scrutiny from different jurisdictions. Focus Dilution: There’s a risk that spreading resources and focus across multiple sectors could dilute Tether’s core competency in stablecoin issuance and management. Market Perception: Some in the crypto community might question if these moves represent a shift away from Tether’s core mission or if they are truly beneficial for USDT holders. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Tether’s foray into agriculture and media offers some key takeaways for crypto enthusiasts and investors: Evolution of Crypto Entities: This signals a potential trend of crypto companies evolving beyond purely digital finance and venturing into traditional industries. USDT’s Backing & Stability: For USDT holders, diversification could be seen as a positive sign, potentially strengthening the reserves backing the stablecoin, although transparency remains crucial. Wider Crypto Impact: If successful, Tether’s diversification could pave the way for other crypto entities to explore similar strategies, bridging the gap between digital and traditional economies. Monitor Developments: Keep an eye on Tether’s future moves in these sectors and how they impact USDT and the broader crypto ecosystem. Transparency and further details about these ventures will be important to assess their long-term success. Conclusion: Tether’s Bold New Chapter Tether’s increased stake in Adecoagro and acquisition in Be Water mark a significant and audacious step in its journey. It’s a clear indication that Tether is not content with just being a stablecoin issuer. The company is strategically diversifying its portfolio, venturing into tangible assets and new industries. This move presents both exciting opportunities and potential challenges. As Tether navigates this new chapter, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how this diversification strategy unfolds and shapes the future of USDT and the company itself. It’s a bold move that could redefine what it means to be a crypto company in the evolving financial landscape.

For the past three weeks, SOL has struggled to reclaim the $150 level, which is leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum that was originally driven by memecoin speculation and the rise of artificial intelligence sectors has come to an end. Some analysts argue that SOL price could significantly benefit from the eventual approval of a Solana spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, as well as the expansion of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) on the Solana network, including stablecoins and money market funds. Others, like Nikita Bier, co-founder of TBH and Gas startups, believe Solana has ""the fundamental building blocks for something to break out on mobile."" Source: nikitabier Bier highlighted the constructive regulatory environment from US President Donald Trump and the long-term impact of the memecoin frenzy, which introduced “millions” of new users to Web3 wallets and decentralized applications (DApps). Essentially, Nikita Bier believes Solana is well-positioned due to its streamlined onboarding experience for mobile users. The lackluster Bitcoin reserve announcement hurt all cryptocurrencies Despite the potential for establishing a “consumer-grade” marketplace for DApps, most traders suffered losses as the memecoin mania faded and onchain volumes plunged. This decline has led investors to question whether SOL has the strength to reclaim levels above $150. Beyond the waning interest in DApps, Solana is also facing growing competition from other blockchains. Additionally, the realization that the US government would not purchase altcoins for its strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile was a major disappointment for some investors. On March 6, President Trump signed a bill allowing budget-neutral strategies for the US Treasury to acquire Bitcoin ( BTC ), while altcoins in government possession could be strategically sold. In fact, there was no explicit mention of Solana or any other altcoin in the Digital Asset Stockpile executive order. Some may argue that the Solana ecosystem extends far beyond memecoin trading and token launchpads, as total value locked (TVL) has grown across liquid staking, collateralized lending, synthetic assets, and yield platforms. However, Solana’s fees and DApp revenues have continued to decline. Reduced onchain activity reduces SOL’s appeal to investors, thus limiting its upside potential. Solana 7-day DApp revenues (left) and chain fees (right), USD. Source: DefiLlama Solana DApp revenues totaled $12 million in the seven days leading up to March 24, down from $23.7 million just two weeks earlier. Similarly, base layer fees reached $3.6 million in the same period, a sharp drop from $6.6 million in the seven days ending March 10. Interestingly, this decline occurred while the total value locked (TVL) remained stable at 53.2 million SOL. Related: Specialized purpose DEXs poised for growth in 2025 — Curve founder Solana is no longer the dominant network in DEX volumes The drop in Solana’s onchain activity is particularly concerning given that BNB Chain surged to the top spot in DEX volumes, despite having 34% less TVL than Solana, according to DefiLlama data. Decentralized exchanges volume market share. Source: DefiLlama In terms of volume, Solana dominated the DEX industry from October 2024 to February 2025 but has recently lost ground to Ethereum and BNB Chain. As a result, part of SOL’s price weakness stems from a decline in Solana’s onchain activity compared to its competitors. For instance, trading volume on Hyperliquid increased by 35% over the past seven days, while activity on Pendle surged by an impressive 186%. Although fundamentals do not indicate an imminent rally above $150, the Solana network uniquely combines an integrated user experience with a degree of decentralization that has proven successful. For example, while BNB Chain and Tron offer similar scalability, neither has had a wallet or DApp rank among the top 10 on the Apple App Store—unlike Solana’s Phantom Wallet in November 2024.

Since March 11, large Bitcoin holders have accumulated more than 129,000 BTC, worth around $11.2 billion at a market price of $87,500. This is the most significant accumulation rate since August 2024, Glassnode said in a post on X, underscoring growing optimism among large investors. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty and mixed technical indicators that have raised concerns about Bitcoin’s recent price rally, the actions of major investors have been more bullish. After falling below $78,000 two weeks ago, BTC has rebounded amid dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and expectations that the tariffs the Trump administration will impose on April 2 may be less severe than initially feared.

The first quarter of 2025 has delivered a stark reminder of the ever-present risks in the crypto world. A staggering report from Web3 security firm Immunefi reveals that crypto losses from hacks have skyrocketed to a record-breaking $1.64 billion. Yes, you read that right – billion with a ‘B’. And the lion’s share of this colossal sum? It’s traced back to one major incident: the Bybit hack . The Devastating Bybit Hack: A $1.46 Billion Blow Imagine waking up to find over a billion dollars vanished into thin air. That’s essentially what happened with the Bybit hack in February, accounting for a whopping $1.46 billion of the total losses. According to a report by The Block, this exploit has been attributed to the notorious North Korean cybercrime syndicate, the Lazarus Group. This single event underscores the sophisticated and often state-sponsored threats that cryptocurrency exchanges and users face. Key Takeaways from Q1 Crypto Losses: Record High Losses: $1.64 billion in crypto losses in Q1 2025 marks a concerning peak in industry vulnerabilities. Dominant Bybit Hack: The $1.46 billion Bybit hack represents the vast majority of these losses, highlighting the scale of individual exploits. Lazarus Group Link: Attribution to North Korea’s Lazarus Group points to sophisticated, potentially state-backed actors targeting the crypto space. 40 Incidents in Total: While the Bybit hack is the headline grabber, there were 40 separate incidents contributing to the overall losses, indicating widespread vulnerability. Non-Bybit Losses Still Significant: Even excluding the Bybit exploit, $176 million in losses from other incidents is a substantial figure, emphasizing ongoing cryptocurrency hacks . Beyond Bybit: Understanding the Landscape of Cryptocurrency Hacks While the Bybit hack is undeniably the dominant story here, it’s crucial to remember that it’s not an isolated incident. The fact that there were 39 other incidents in Q1 alone, resulting in $176 million in losses, demonstrates that cryptocurrency hacks are a pervasive and multifaceted problem. What are some of the common types of attacks contributing to these losses? Types of Cryptocurrency Hacks and Exploits: Flash Loan Attacks: Exploiting vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols to manipulate prices and drain funds. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Bugs and flaws in smart contract code that hackers can exploit to steal assets. Phishing and Social Engineering: Tricking users into revealing private keys or sending funds to malicious addresses. Exchange Hacks: Breaching the security of centralized exchanges to steal user funds, as seen with the Bybit hack . Rug Pulls: Malicious projects where developers abandon the project after raising funds, often in DeFi space. Web3 Security: Is Your Crypto Really Safe? The Immunefi report serves as a loud alarm bell for the entire Web3 ecosystem. Web3 security needs to be more than just a buzzword; it needs to be a fundamental priority. With billions of dollars at stake, and increasingly sophisticated attackers, what steps can be taken to bolster security and protect users’ assets? Strengthening Web3 Security: Key Considerations Robust Smart Contract Audits: Thorough and independent audits of smart contracts are essential to identify and fix vulnerabilities before deployment. Multi-Signature Wallets: Implementing multi-sig wallets for projects and exchanges adds an extra layer of security, requiring multiple approvals for transactions. Regular Security Assessments: Ongoing security audits and penetration testing to identify and address new vulnerabilities as they emerge. User Education: Empowering users with knowledge about phishing scams, secure wallet practices, and risk management is crucial. Enhanced Exchange Security: Exchanges must invest heavily in advanced security measures, including cold storage, multi-factor authentication, and robust intrusion detection systems to prevent events like the Bybit hack . Collaboration and Information Sharing: The crypto community needs to collaborate and share information about threats and vulnerabilities to collectively improve Web3 security . Lazarus Group and State-Sponsored Cyber Threats The attribution of the Bybit hack to the Lazarus Group is particularly concerning. This North Korean hacking group has a history of targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms to generate revenue for the regime. State-sponsored actors like Lazarus Group represent a highly sophisticated and persistent threat, demanding a coordinated and proactive approach to Web3 security . Why State-Sponsored Groups Like Lazarus Group are a Major Threat: Advanced Capabilities: They possess significant resources and expertise, allowing them to develop and execute complex attacks. Persistent and Patient: They are often willing to spend considerable time and resources to infiltrate and exploit targets. State Resources: They benefit from the backing of state resources, including intelligence gathering and infrastructure. Evolving Tactics: They continuously adapt their tactics and techniques to bypass security measures. Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself in the Crypto Wild West So, what can you, as a crypto user or investor, do to protect yourself in this landscape of increasing cryptocurrency hacks ? While no system is entirely foolproof, taking proactive steps can significantly reduce your risk. Steps to Enhance Your Crypto Security: Use Hardware Wallets: Store your crypto offline in hardware wallets for enhanced security against online attacks. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Activate 2FA on all your crypto accounts for an extra layer of protection. Be Wary of Phishing: Always double-check links and be suspicious of unsolicited emails or messages asking for personal information. Diversify Your Holdings: Don’t keep all your crypto in one place or on one exchange. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest security threats and best practices in the crypto space. Research Projects and Exchanges: Before investing in or using a platform, research its security measures and track record. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Landscape with Caution The alarming $1.64 billion in crypto losses in Q1 2025, dominated by the Bybit hack , is a wake-up call for the crypto industry. It underscores the critical need for enhanced Web3 security , proactive threat detection, and user education. While the potential of cryptocurrencies and Web3 remains immense, it’s crucial to navigate this space with caution and prioritize security at every level.

Earlier today, ICE announced that it will study how these digital assets could be used across its exchanges, clearing systems, and market data platforms. This move shows that digital currencies are becoming more important in traditional finance. As big financial institutions start using stablecoins, digital currencies could soon be a key part of global transactions. USDC’s Growing Role in Crypto and Finance Sector Circle’s stablecoin, USDC, is gaining more attention in the financial world. It is the second-largest stablecoin after Tether’s USDT , with a market value of over $60 billion. The stablecoin is fully backed by reserves in the Circle Reserve Fund, a U.S. government money market fund. The fund is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Since its launch in 2018, Circle has launched USDC stablecoin in many countries and has been listed on several trading platforms. The digital asset is widely used for crypto trading, international payments, and as a secure way to hold digital dollars. USYC: A New Stablecoin That Offers Interest ICE is also looking to adopt USYC, a new stablecoin backed by short-term U.S. Treasury securities and other low-risk investments. USYC offers a 3.8% return on its financial operations. This stablecoin was originally developed by Hashnote, a crypto platform that Circle acquired earlier this year. While holding USYC, investors can earn passive income over time. Lynn Martin, president of the NYSE, is optimistic about the stablecoin market. She shared that stablecoins like USDC and USYC could become reliable alternatives to traditional money for businesses and institutions. Also, ICE’s interest in these digital assets shows that big financial companies are taking stablecoins more seriously. New Stablecoin Rules Attract Big Institutions Recently, U.S. lawmakers introduced a new bill to regulate the stablecoins sector . If passed, the law will require stablecoin issuers to be licensed as banks or state-approved financial institutions. The bill also calls for regular audits and requires that stablecoins be backed one-to-one with cash or low-risk government assets. Monthly reports will be needed to ensure transparency. Additionally, the new bill proposes to restrict algorithmic stablecoins and foreign stablecoins that do not meet U.S. regulations. The effort to create clear regulations in the crypto market is encouraging more traditional financial firms to investigate the stablecoins sector. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, recently commented on the growing interest. He noted that many companies and institutions are starting to create their own stablecoin , showing that the market is changing. With ICE and other big firms involved in digital assets, stablecoins could soon become an important part of mainstream finance.

Since March 11, XRP has jumped more than 35%, showing signs of renewed strength as bulls attempt to reclaim higher price levels and ignite a fresh rally. The move comes at a time when broader altcoin sentiment remains fragile, with no clear direction for the market in the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims Realized Price – Bulls Face Strong Resistance At $2,300 Despite the uncertain landscape, XRP’s recent price action has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike. One of the more notable developments is the sharp rise in capital flowing into XRP futures. According to on-chain data from Glassnode, total capital allocated to XRP futures contracts has surged 36% in just two weeks. This increase in open interest points to rising trader confidence and suggests that many are positioning for more upside. Still, macro headwinds and technical resistance levels pose challenges. For XRP to maintain momentum, bulls must hold current levels and continue pushing toward key breakouts. With volatility likely to remain high, all eyes are on XRP’s next move as market pressure continues to mount. XRP Bulls Eye Breakout Amid Market Uncertainty XRP is at a pivotal moment, with price action showing early signs of strength that could lead to a major breakout — if bulls manage to reclaim key levels. After a 35% surge since March 11, the token now faces strong resistance zones that could either trigger a powerful rally or confirm investor fears of a bull trap. The broader market context only adds to the uncertainty. Since late January, financial markets — including crypto — have been shaken by growing trade war concerns and erratic policy signals from U.S. President Donald Trump. This instability has made traders more cautious, with many questioning whether current altcoin gains can be sustained. Selling pressure remains a threat, and failure to hold support levels could quickly reverse recent progress. Despite these concerns, XRP’s on-chain and derivatives data suggest that bullish momentum is building. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared on X that the total capital allocated to XRP futures contracts has surged 36% in just two weeks, rising from $2.12 billion to $2.89 billion. This spike in open interest reflects increased confidence from traders and suggests that many are positioning for further upside. However, confirmation is still needed. XRP must reclaim critical resistance zones and sustain its gains to avoid a deeper pullback. Related Reading: Solana Tags Upper Bollinger Band For First Time Since ATH — Is Momentum Returning? Bulls Defend Key Support At $2.25 XRP is currently trading at $2.35 after several days of failed attempts to break above the $2.60 resistance level. This price zone has proven difficult to overcome, with repeated rejections keeping the bullish momentum in check. For XRP to initiate a strong upward move, bulls must reclaim $2.60 with conviction — a breakout that could trigger a surge toward the upper boundary of its current range. On the higher timeframe, XRP remains locked in a clear weekly range between the $2 support level and the $3.40 resistance. This range has defined price action for weeks, and traders are closely watching for a breakout in either direction. The $2.60 level sits just below the mid-range, making it a critical point for bulls to reclaim in order to gain control of the trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Accumulation Is Almost Over – Breakout Above $2,200 Could Trigger Expansion Phase However, if bulls fail to hold the $2.25 support zone, a move back toward the bottom of the range is likely. A breakdown below $2.25 could open the door for a retest of the $2 level — a key psychological and structural support. Until then, XRP’s next major move hinges on whether buyers can push past resistance or fold under renewed selling pressure.

The playful memecoin BONK is making serious waves in the NFT world. In a surprising yet strategic move, BONK has just acquired Exchange Art, a prominent digital art marketplace on the Solana blockchain. This isn’t just another day in crypto; it’s a potentially game-changing development that could reshape the landscape for Solana NFTs and digital art creators. And the captain steering this new ship? None other than JT Liss, who has been appointed to lead Exchange Art into its next exciting chapter. Let’s dive deep into what this acquisition means for you, the creators, collectors, and everyone in between! Why is the BONK Acquisition a Breakthrough for the NFT Marketplace? Acquisitions in the crypto space are always noteworthy, but this one feels different. Why? Because it’s a memecoin, often perceived as lighthearted and community-driven, stepping into a more structured and creator-focused arena like an NFT marketplace . This signals a maturity and ambition within the BONK ecosystem that’s hard to ignore. Here’s a breakdown of why this acquisition is a breakthrough: Strategic Diversification: BONK isn’t just content being a popular memecoin. Acquiring Exchange Art shows a clear intention to diversify and expand its utility within the Solana ecosystem. It’s moving beyond speculation and into providing tangible value for its community. Community Empowerment: BONK is deeply rooted in its community. By acquiring Exchange Art, it’s directly investing in a platform that benefits digital artists and NFT collectors within its own ecosystem and the wider Solana community. Synergy Creation: Imagine the possibilities! Combining the vibrant BONK community with the established Exchange Art platform could create a powerful synergy. Think increased traffic, new users, and innovative integrations between the memecoin and the art marketplace. Long-Term Vision: Naming JT Liss as the leader underscores a commitment to the long-term success of Exchange Art. This isn’t a fleeting venture; it’s a strategic play to build a sustainable and thriving platform. This move could be a masterclass in how memecoins can evolve beyond their initial hype and contribute meaningfully to the crypto space. It’s a bold statement that BONK is here to stay and build, not just meme. What Does This Mean for Solana NFT Creators and Collectors? For those immersed in the Solana NFT ecosystem, this acquisition is packed with potential benefits. Exchange Art has been a go-to platform for Solana-based digital art, and with BONK’s backing and JT Liss at the helm, things are about to get even more interesting. Let’s explore what this means for creators and collectors: For Solana NFT Creators: Expanded Reach: The BONK community is massive and highly engaged. This acquisition could bring a significant influx of new users and collectors to Exchange Art, meaning greater visibility and opportunities for artists to showcase and sell their work. Enhanced Platform Features: With new leadership and resources, we can expect innovation and improvements on Exchange Art. This could include better tools for creators, enhanced features for showcasing art, and more creator-centric initiatives. Community Support: BONK’s community-first ethos could translate into stronger support systems for artists on Exchange Art. This might involve grants, promotional opportunities, and community-driven initiatives to uplift creators. Long-Term Stability: Acquisition by BONK provides Exchange Art with increased financial stability and resources, ensuring the platform’s longevity and continued support for creators. For Solana NFT Collectors: Wider Selection: Increased creator activity and platform enhancements could lead to a more diverse and vibrant selection of NFTs available on Exchange Art. Improved User Experience: Investment in the platform likely means improvements to the user experience, making it easier and more enjoyable to discover, collect, and trade Solana NFTs. Community Engagement: Collectors can expect a more active and engaged community around Exchange Art, fostering a richer and more interactive collecting experience. Potential for Exclusive Drops: The BONK connection might open doors for exclusive NFT drops or collaborations, adding extra excitement for collectors. In essence, this acquisition is a strong vote of confidence in the Solana NFT space and signals a bright future for both creators and collectors within the ecosystem. Who is JT Liss and Why is He the Right Leader for Exchange Art? The appointment of JT Liss as the leader of Exchange Art is a critical piece of this acquisition puzzle. Who is JT Liss, and what makes him the ideal person to steer this platform forward? While the announcement is recent, bringing in a new leader suggests a fresh vision and approach. Here’s why JT Liss’s leadership is significant: Focus on Long-Term Success: The announcement explicitly mentions a new team “focused on ensuring long-term success.” JT Liss is likely tasked with building a sustainable and thriving future for Exchange Art, not just a short-term boost. Creator-Centric Approach: The emphasis on “long-term success for both Exchange Art and creators” suggests a commitment to prioritizing the needs and interests of digital artists. JT Liss’s leadership is expected to be creator-focused. Fresh Perspective: Bringing in a new leader often signals a desire for fresh ideas and perspectives. JT Liss might bring innovative strategies and approaches to platform development, community engagement, and creator support. Building on a Solid Foundation: Exchange Art is already a reputable platform. JT Liss isn’t starting from scratch; he’s inheriting a platform with an established user base and reputation, giving him a strong foundation to build upon. While details about JT Liss’s specific background and vision are still emerging, his appointment clearly signals BONK’s intention to take Exchange Art to new heights. Keep an eye on this space – JT Liss’s leadership could be transformative. The Rise of BONK and Memecoins in the NFT Space BONK’s acquisition of Exchange Art is also part of a broader trend: the increasing influence of memecoins in the wider crypto ecosystem, including the NFT space . Memecoins, often starting as jokes or community experiments, are proving they can be more than just fleeting trends. BONK, in particular, has shown remarkable growth and community engagement. Here’s why this trend is noteworthy: Community Power: Memecoins thrive on strong communities. BONK’s acquisition leverages the power of its community to support and grow an NFT platform. This demonstrates the potential of community-driven initiatives in the crypto world. Democratization of Finance and Art: Memecoins, by their accessible nature, can democratize access to both finance and art. BONK bringing Exchange Art into its fold could make NFTs more accessible to a wider audience. Innovation and Experimentation: Memecoins often foster a culture of innovation and experimentation. This acquisition could lead to novel integrations between memecoins and NFTs, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Challenging Traditional Norms: Memecoins often challenge traditional financial and artistic norms. BONK acquiring an NFT marketplace is a prime example of this, disrupting conventional expectations and opening up new possibilities. This isn’t just about memes anymore; it’s about community, innovation, and the evolving role of digital assets in our world. BONK’s move into the NFT marketplace is a testament to this evolution. Challenges and the Future of Exchange Art Under BONK While the acquisition is brimming with potential, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and consider the future trajectory of Exchange Art under BONK. No transition is without its hurdles, and navigating these effectively will be crucial for long-term success. Potential Challenges: Integration Complexities: Integrating two distinct entities – a memecoin ecosystem and an NFT marketplace – can be complex. Ensuring smooth technical and operational integration will be key. Maintaining Community Alignment: While BONK has a strong community, ensuring alignment between the BONK community and the existing Exchange Art community will be important. Different communities may have different expectations and needs. Competition in the NFT Space: The NFT marketplace landscape is highly competitive. Exchange Art, even with BONK’s backing, will need to continue to innovate and differentiate itself to stay ahead. Sustaining Momentum: Initial excitement around the acquisition needs to be translated into sustained growth and user engagement. Long-term strategies are crucial to maintain momentum. Future Outlook: Platform Growth and Innovation: With BONK’s resources and JT Liss’s leadership, we can anticipate significant growth and innovation on Exchange Art. This could include new features, expanded functionalities, and enhanced user experiences. Ecosystem Expansion: This acquisition could be just the beginning of BONK’s expansion within the Solana ecosystem. We might see further integrations and developments that bridge the gap between memecoins and NFTs. Creator Empowerment: If the stated commitment to creators is upheld, Exchange Art could become an even more creator-friendly platform, attracting top talent and fostering a thriving artistic community. Mainstream Adoption: The playful and accessible nature of BONK, combined with the appeal of digital art, could potentially contribute to broader mainstream adoption of NFTs. The future of Exchange Art under BONK is undoubtedly exciting, but navigating the challenges and capitalizing on the opportunities will determine the ultimate success of this bold acquisition. The crypto world will be watching closely. Conclusion: A New Era for Solana NFTs? BONK acquiring Exchange Art is more than just a business transaction; it’s a powerful signal of the evolving crypto landscape. It highlights the growing maturity of memecoins, the increasing importance of community, and the dynamic potential of the Solana NFT ecosystem. With JT Liss at the helm and a renewed focus on creator empowerment and long-term growth, Exchange Art is poised for a potentially transformative journey. This acquisition could indeed mark the beginning of a new era for Solana NFTs , one where community-driven initiatives and playful innovation reshape the future of digital art and collectibles.

Meanwhile, the US Senate voted to repeal the DeFi broker rule. Prospective SEC chair pressed on sale of FTX-tied firm Lawmakers in the US Senate Banking Committee questioned prospective Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member Paul Atkins on his ties to the crypto industry and how he might regulate digital assets if confirmed. Questioning Atkins at his nomination hearing on March 27, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the committee’s ranking member, said the former SEC commissioner had had “staggeringly bad judgment” in his role leading up to the 2008 financial crisis — Atkins served at the agency from 2002 to 2008. Sen. Warren also asked Atkins to disclose the buyers of his consulting firm Patomak Global Partners — which advised crypto exchange FTX before its collapse in 2022 — for transparency about potential conflicts of interest with the digital asset industry. “Your clients pay you north of $1,200 an hour for advice on how to influence regulators like the SEC, and if you’re confirmed, you will be in a prime spot to deliver for all those clients who’ve been paying you millions of dollars for years,” said Sen. Warren, suggesting Atkins’ judgment “will be influenced by more than an objective assessment of the data.” Paul Atkins addressing lawmakers at March 27 nomination hearing. Source: US Senate Banking Committee The Massachusetts senator sent a letter to Donald Trump’s SEC pick on March 23, calling on him to be prepared to answer questions related to his potential role at the agency based on his ties to the crypto industry through Patomak. At the March 27 hearing, Sen. Warren asked Atkins to disclose the consulting firm’s potential buyers — he said he planned to sell the company if confirmed — who might be “buying access to the future chair of the SEC.” Atkins said he would “abide by the process” but did not directly answer Sen. Warren’s question. She suggested that the sale of Patomak could be a “pre-bribe” for the former SEC commissioner’s services. Most EU banks fail to meet rising crypto investor demand — Survey European banks and financial institutions may be underestimating the demand for cryptocurrency services, with fewer than one in five offering digital asset products, according to a new survey by crypto investment platform Bitpanda. The study surveyed 10,000 retail and business investors across 13 European countries and found that more than 40% of business investors already hold cryptocurrencies, with another 18% planning to invest in the near future. Yet, only 19% of surveyed financial institutions said their clients showed strong demand for crypto products, suggesting a 30% gap between actual investor adoption and perceived interest.

Senate sends resolution killing IRS DeFi broker rule to Trump The US Senate passed a resolution on March 26 to revoke a Biden-era rule that would have required decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to report to the Internal Revenue Service, which will now head to President Donald Trump, who has supported killing the rule. The Senate voted 70-28 to pass the motion to repeal the so-called IRS DeFi broker rule that aimed to require DeFi platforms, such as decentralized exchanges, to file their gross proceeds from crypto sales and include information on those involved in the transactions. The White House’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, has previously said Trump supports killing the rule . Source: DeFi Education Fund Critics of the rule said it would lump decentralized platforms with too onerous rules, which would hamper crypto innovation, while those who opposed the resolution said it would create a tax evasion loophole.

Currently, yielding stablecoins represent only 6% of the total stablecoin market cap. However, JPMorgan analysts led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou predict that these assets could significantly increase their market share unless regulatory changes intervene. Panigirtzoglou said that since the US elections in November, the market value of the top five yielding stablecoins — Ethena’s USDe, Sky Dollar’s USDS, BlackRock’s BUIDL, Usual Protocol’s USD0 and Ondo Finance’s USDY — has increased, with their combined market value rising from around $4 billion to over $13 billion. Related News: Watch Out: There's a $12 Billion Option Expiration Earthquake in Bitcoin Tomorrow - Here's What to Know This trend is expected to continue, in part due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent approval of Figure Markets’ yielding stablecoin, YLDS. Unlike traditional stablecoins, YLDS is registered as a security, a move that analysts say could further accelerate the adoption of yielding assets. Traditional stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC do not distribute reserve yields to users. Doing so would classify these assets as securities and subject them to strict compliance requirements, according to JPMorgan analysts. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum price cracked $2,100 recently, driven by whales scooping up 470,000 ETH in a week and exchange reserves diving to multi-year lows. In the meantime, presale mania has gripped Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 3 currently approaches 95% sold at $0.02 ahead of a 25% price jump to $0.025. Analysts attribute ETH’s momentum to a potential rally targeting the $12,000 level by 2025, while MUTM’s tokenomics when structured should yield a 200% increase at its $0.06 exchange listing — then possibly reach $3.50 circa post-launch. Anyone aiming for $500,000 in July, for example, could achieve that target with a $1,000 allocation across these assets, perhaps this time releasing the exponential growth potential we’ve been waiting for. Ethereum Whales Show Confidence as Metrics Remain Bullish Ethereum resurgence above $2000 produced an overall euphoria, with the on-chain analysis uncovering that the large holders piled aggressively. As of now, over 6.12 million ETH sits in wallets with realized prices between $1,886 and $1,944, creating a solid support base. A well known strategist by the name of Crypto Patel is mentioned to stack ETH under $2,000, with the ultimate long-term price target of roughly $12k. There is another clue from the ETH/BTC chart, hinting at possible reversals. An explosion would bring pumped Ethereum to 0.0019 BTC which shows its dominance. Now, with the soaring demand for staking and 1.2 million ETH withdrawn from exchanges in 48 days, scarcity is growing. Futures open interest also recently topped $21 billion, as institutional bets for price appreciation have piled up. Phase 4 Presale of Mutuum Finance Nears as MUTM Demand Ramps Up Over 95% of tokens were claimed at $0.02, making Phase 3 a few tokens away from completion, with most of the presale noise going towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project’s lending protocol that connects token value with actual DeFi usage in the real world has gained 7,200 holders (at the time of writing) since the opening of its presale. With these participants locking positions early, they will be 25% in profit when phase 4 opens at $0.025. But the real payoff will be its exchange debut: a guaranteed 200% gain at the $0.06 listing price, and post-launch targets look to be in the $3.50 range — a 17,400% bounce from today. Tokenomics helps to elevate this potential. By paying for MUTMs from the revenue generated by the platform, that means any revenue which will be distributed to stakers, and this will create a strong demand. Alongside—with the aim of promoting the holding of user value over the longer term—mtTokens, interest-bearing assets that can be redeemed for user deposits. It is important to notes that security is the utmost priority, Mutuum Finance is currently going through the final testing phase of a Certik audit in order to confirm the integrity of the smart contracts. The numbers, which will be released soon through official channels, will be an additional source of comfort for investors. Strategic Allocation Unlocks Exponential Pathways There is complementarity between Ethereum and Mutuum Finance. ETH is a stable hold due to its enormous institutional adoption and technical milestones, and MUTM’s presale structure provides a unique opportunity for sub-exchange pricing. A split $1k — $500 in ETH $500 in MUTM captures both perspectives. If ETH does so and is also up 20% to $2,500 in July, the $500 at stake would become worth $600. In contrast, MUTM’s jump to $3.50 would turn $500 into $87,500. All part of a framework that could get the portfolio up to almost $88,100—the basis for repeating strategies toward $500,000. Timing remains critical. Mutuum Finance’s Phase 3 closes soon, and Ethereum’s RSI signal won’t last. Wait and risk losing out on the price explosion or breakout. For agile investors in a rapidly-evolving crypto market, split-second decisions translate to above average returns vs life-changing, generational ones. Positioning Ahead of Phase 4 The clock is ticking. Ethereum’s surge continues, and slots are running low on Mutuum Finance’s Phase 3 presale. Check out Mutuum Finance to buy MUTM tokens before the price goes up. Rebalance portfolios, take advantage of presale, watch ETH for $2,000 support. In a market that rewards audacity, indecision is the only real gamble.

42498489,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144049,1743112802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionize Bitcoin DeFi: Dolomite’s Exciting Expansion with Spiderchain Layer-2 Solution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dolomite-bitcoin-layer-2-expansion/,"In a groundbreaking move set to electrify the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape, Dolomite, the Arbitrum-native platform celebrated for its robust money market and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) functionalities, is charting a bold course into the Bitcoin ecosystem. This ambitious expansion is not just a minor upgrade; it’s a strategic leap enabled by a powerful alliance with Botanix Labs and their innovative Spiderchain – a Bitcoin Layer-2 Solution engineered to supercharge Bitcoin’s capabilities with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Are you ready to witness how this integration could redefine Bitcoin DeFi and unlock unprecedented opportunities? Unveiling Dolomite’s Bitcoin DeFi Ambition Dolomite has carved a niche for itself within the Arbitrum ecosystem as a versatile platform, seamlessly blending the functionalities of a money market and a Decentralized Exchange. Users on Arbitrum have leveraged Dolomite for lending, borrowing, and trading various crypto assets. Now, Dolomite is setting its sights on a much grander stage – the Bitcoin network. But why Bitcoin, and why now? Untapped Potential: Bitcoin, despite being the pioneer cryptocurrency, has largely remained outside the DeFi revolution primarily dominated by Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Bringing Dolomite’s established DeFi functionalities to Bitcoin unlocks a massive, largely untapped market. Community Demand: The Bitcoin community has long yearned for more sophisticated DeFi applications on their network. Dolomite’s expansion answers this call, potentially attracting a significant influx of Bitcoin holders eager to engage in DeFi activities. Strategic Growth: For Dolomite, this expansion represents a strategic growth opportunity, diversifying its user base and platform capabilities beyond the Arbitrum ecosystem. This move isn’t about simply porting Dolomite to Bitcoin; it’s about strategically integrating with the Bitcoin ecosystem in a way that respects Bitcoin’s core principles while enhancing its utility. And the key to this transformative integration is Botanix Labs’ Spiderchain. Spiderchain: A Game-Changer Layer-2 Solution for Bitcoin Botanix Labs’ Spiderchain is not just another Layer-2 Solution; it’s a meticulously designed framework aimed at breathing new life into Bitcoin. Layer-2 solutions are crucial for addressing Bitcoin’s scalability challenges and expanding its functionality without altering its foundational layer. Spiderchain stands out by introducing EVM compatibility to Bitcoin, effectively bridging the gap between Bitcoin’s security and Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem. Let’s break down what makes Spiderchain a crucial piece in Dolomite’s Bitcoin expansion: EVM Compatibility: Spiderchain’s EVM compatibility is a game-changer. It allows developers to deploy Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) on Bitcoin. This means Dolomite can essentially bring its existing smart contracts and DeFi logic over to Bitcoin with relative ease, thanks to Spiderchain. Scalability Boost: Bitcoin’s main chain is known for its slower transaction speeds and higher fees, especially during peak times. Spiderchain, as a Layer-2 solution, processes transactions off-chain, significantly increasing transaction throughput and reducing costs for users interacting with Dolomite on Bitcoin. Enhanced Functionality: Beyond scalability, Spiderchain enhances Bitcoin’s functionality. By enabling smart contracts, it opens doors for complex DeFi applications, such as lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, and more, directly on Bitcoin. Security Inherited from Bitcoin: Crucially, Spiderchain is designed to inherit the robust security of the Bitcoin network. This is a major advantage, as it provides a secure foundation for DeFi activities on Bitcoin, leveraging Bitcoin’s unparalleled track record of security and decentralization. Think of Spiderchain as building a high-speed, smart highway right next to Bitcoin’s secure, but somewhat slower, main street. Dolomite is now choosing to operate on this new highway, benefiting from the speed and smart contract capabilities while still being anchored to Bitcoin’s security. The Dolomite-Spiderchain Integration: A Symbiotic Partnership The integration of Dolomite with Botanix Labs’ Spiderchain is more than just a technical connection; it’s a strategic alignment of visions. Dolomite gains access to the vast Bitcoin network and its community, while Spiderchain gets a flagship DeFi application to showcase its capabilities. This symbiotic partnership promises to unlock significant benefits for both platforms and their users. How will this integration actually work? Bridging Assets: Users will likely be able to bridge their Bitcoin assets to Spiderchain, allowing them to interact with Dolomite’s DeFi platform using Bitcoin or Bitcoin-pegged assets. Deploying Dolomite Contracts: Dolomite will deploy its smart contracts onto Spiderchain, leveraging the EVM compatibility to replicate its Arbitrum-based functionalities on Bitcoin. User Experience: The goal is to provide a seamless user experience. Users familiar with Dolomite on Arbitrum should find a similar, if not enhanced, experience on Bitcoin via Spiderchain, with faster transactions and potentially lower fees compared to using Bitcoin’s main chain directly for DeFi. Expanding DeFi Use Cases on Bitcoin: This integration will bring a range of DeFi use cases to Bitcoin, including: Decentralized Lending and Borrowing: Users can lend and borrow Bitcoin and other assets, earning interest or accessing liquidity. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Trading: Trade Bitcoin and other assets in a decentralized manner, directly on the Bitcoin network through Spiderchain. Yield Farming and Staking: Explore opportunities to earn yield on Bitcoin and other assets through various DeFi strategies. Essentially, Dolomite is bringing its proven DeFi blueprint from Arbitrum and adapting it for the Bitcoin ecosystem, powered by Spiderchain’s innovative Layer-2 infrastructure. Benefits of Dolomite’s Expansion to Bitcoin This expansion is poised to deliver a multitude of benefits, not just for Dolomite and Botanix Labs, but for the broader crypto community, especially Bitcoin holders and DeFi enthusiasts. Benefit Description Increased Bitcoin Utility Bitcoin gains significant utility beyond just being a store of value or a medium of exchange. It can now actively participate in DeFi ecosystems, earning yield and engaging in complex financial transactions. Enhanced Scalability for Bitcoin DeFi Spiderchain addresses Bitcoin’s scalability limitations, making DeFi applications on Bitcoin faster and more affordable. Wider Access to DeFi Bitcoin’s massive user base, previously largely excluded from DeFi, now gains access to sophisticated DeFi tools and platforms like Dolomite. Innovation in Bitcoin Ecosystem This integration fosters innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem, encouraging further development of DeFi applications and Layer-2 solutions. Growth for Dolomite Dolomite expands its reach and user base, tapping into the vast Bitcoin market and solidifying its position as a leading multi-chain DeFi platform. Navigating the Challenges and Looking Ahead While the Dolomite expansion to Bitcoin via Spiderchain is brimming with potential, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and the path ahead. Adoption and User Education: Bitcoin users, traditionally more conservative, might need time and education to embrace DeFi concepts and platforms like Dolomite. Overcoming this adoption hurdle will be crucial. Security Considerations: While Spiderchain inherits Bitcoin’s security, Layer-2 solutions themselves introduce a new layer of complexity. Ensuring the security and robustness of Spiderchain and Dolomite’s implementation on it is paramount. Competition in Layer-2 Landscape: The Bitcoin Layer-2 landscape is evolving. Spiderchain will face competition from other solutions. Dolomite’s success will partly depend on Spiderchain’s ability to stand out and attract users and developers. Regulatory Scrutiny: As DeFi grows and expands to networks like Bitcoin, increased regulatory scrutiny is expected. Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape will be crucial for Dolomite and Spiderchain. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards are immense. Dolomite’s move to Bitcoin signifies a major step towards a more interconnected and multi-chain DeFi future. By leveraging Spiderchain’s innovative Layer-2 technology, Dolomite is not just expanding its platform; it’s contributing to the evolution of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Multi-Chain DeFi Future Dolomite’s expansion to Bitcoin, powered by Botanix Labs’ Spiderchain, is a transformative development in the crypto space. It represents a significant stride towards bridging the gap between Bitcoin’s robust security and the dynamic world of DeFi. By bringing its established Decentralized Exchange and money market functionalities to Bitcoin through an innovative Layer-2 Solution, Dolomite is poised to unlock new opportunities for Bitcoin holders and contribute to a more inclusive and interconnected DeFi ecosystem. As this integration unfolds, it will be fascinating to witness how it shapes the future of Bitcoin DeFi and the broader crypto landscape. This is more than just an expansion; it’s a bold step into a multi-chain future where the strengths of different blockchains are harmoniously combined to create a more powerful and versatile financial system.

Several well-known figures within the BTC community highlighted the event through posts on X , suggesting that the signal could mark a turning point in the market. The Ultimate Bitcoin Buy Signal? First introduced by on-chain analyst Charles Edwards, the Hash Ribbon relies on two moving averages (commonly the 30-day and 60-day averages of Bitcoin’s hash rate) to determine when mining difficulty and hash power may have capitulated and begun to recover. Traditionally, a “buy” signal is triggered once the 30-day MA crosses decisively above the 60-day MA, indicating that any period of miner-driven distress may be over. According to historical data, major buy signals have frequently appeared after sharp market downturns, sometimes coinciding with cycle bottoms. Although the indicator is not infallible, it has correctly identified several previous lows in Bitcoin’s history—most notably in 2011–2012, during the depths of the 2014–2015 bear market, around the $3k bottom of late 2018–early 2019, and near the $29k region in mid-2021. Related Reading: Now Is The Best Time To Buy Bitcoin, Says Investment Giant Shortly after the latest crossover was triggered, popular commentator Bitcoin Archive posted: “BITCOIN HASH-RIBBON FLASHES BUY SIGNAL – This is one of the most reliable ‘buy’ indicators. Significant price gains have followed 7 out of the last 7 times this indicator was triggered.” Edwards, the creator of the Hash Ribbon, retweeted this post, a move that many interpreted as an endorsement of the analysis. Adding to the discussion, a user noted: “Signal flashed only 20 times in Bitcoin’s history. 17/20 times the most recent local low was never violated on a closing basis. We can sweep the lows, or even wick below, but 85% of the time the low’s in and it’s up only from here.” Meanwhile, Jamie Coutts, chief analyst at Real Vision, stressed the importance of monitoring multiple on-chain metrics, even as the Hash Ribbon flashes bullish: “The widely watched Bitcoin Hash Ribbon signal just fired. While on-chain activity remains sluggish, the metrics with the strongest historical correlation to future price performance are flashing green.” Notably, many on-chain signals haven’t reached the levels of previous cycles even when the Bitcoin price hit almost $110,000 in mid-January. Also traditional technical signals haven’t reached peaks of the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Make Big Moves As Bullish Momentum Resurfaces Tony Severino, a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) and Head of Research at NewsBTC, has recently shifted from a bullish to a bearish stance on Bitcoin. Severino, who is also the founder of CoinChartist.io, argues that Bitcoin’s price action and on-chain metrics no longer support the bullish narratives common in past cycles. “The idea that Bitcoin HAS to reach past extremes on indicators is a dangerous way of thinking. Higher highs in price and lower highs on an oscillator is a bearish signal,” Severino stated recently. Severino warns against expecting Bitcoin to replicate its historical pattern of pushing certain momentum indicators (e.g., RSI or MACD) to extreme levels. Instead, he notes that divergences—where price climbs to new highs but technical indicators fail to confirm those highs—can signal market exhaustion. “The tools I use are bearish, period,” he remarked via X. At press time, BTC traded at $87,373.

Fartcoin exploded to a jaw-dropping $1B market cap in just weeks, while Dogwifhat turned heads with its quirky Solana-powered charm and mascot momentum. But here’s the twist—both still keep control behind the curtain. Now, enter Dragoin . This project is flipping the script by planning to renounce its smart contract after launch. That move isn’t just rare—it could be the ultimate trust signal. In a space packed with hype and rug-pull fears, Dragoin’s focus on decentralization is turning heads for all the right reasons. Fartcoin: From Joke to Billion-Dollar Juggernaut Fartcoin burst onto the scene on October 18, 2024, powered by an AI-generated meme concept that leaned hard into internet comedy. But it wasn’t just about laughs. The project rewarded users for sharing funny content, which supercharged its community—and its growth. In just two months, Fartcoin’s market cap rocketed past $1 billion. As of March 25, 2025, Fartcoin trades at $0.5245. While it dipped 6.94% in the past 24 hours, it’s still riding an 88.18% surge from the past week. With nearly 1 billion tokens in circulation, it now boasts a market cap of about $524 million. Fartcoin proves just how far meme power can take a token—but questions still linger about long-term decentralization. Dogwifhat: Solana’s Quirky Powerhouse Dogwifhat (WIF) made its debut in November 2023 on the Solana blockchain. Armed with a Shiba Inu in a knitted hat, it tapped perfectly into meme coin magic—and its community loved it. By February 2025, the token spiked 60% in a single week, marking its breakout moment. As of March 25, 2025, WIF trades around $0.5488. That’s a 0.49% bump in the past 24 hours and 16.35% over the past week. With about 999 million tokens in circulation, it holds a market cap of roughly $549 million. WIF’s rise shows how branding and Solana’s speed can fuel a meme coin—but just like Fartcoin, central control hasn’t been ruled out. Dragoin’s Big Move: Renounced Contract Brings Real Safety Now let’s talk about Dragoin ($DDGN)—the one that might actually be built to last. What sets it apart? After launch, Dragoin will renounce its smart contract. That means no developer can tweak, pause, or hijack the token. Once it’s in the hands of the community, it stays there—locked and unalterable. This isn’t just a promise. It’s code in action. With contract renouncement, there are no rug pulls, no sneaky changes, and no backdoors. What you see is what you get. Presale investors can breathe easy. Dragoin’s message is loud and clear: it’s not riding hype—it’s laying down rules that don’t change. While others might hold hidden keys, Dragoin hands them to the community from day one. With Dragoin’s presale priced attractively at $0.0000292 during Stage 1, investors are perfectly positioned for significant gains. The token’s intended launch price of $0.002 represents a staggering ROI of nearly 6,700%. As subsequent presale stages escalate in price, this early-entry advantage diminishes quickly. No guessing games. No what-ifs. The contract is set in stone—and that alone could make all the difference. In a World of Meme Coins, Dragoin Plays a Different Game Fartcoin and Dogwifhat have shown us what meme magic and social momentum can do. But behind the scenes, both still have centralized hands guiding the ship. Dragoin isn’t just another player. It’s rewriting the rules. By handing full control to its holders and locking its code in place, it creates something rare in this market: trust you can verify. So, as meme coins evolve from jokes to serious digital assets, Dragoin’s renounced contract could become the blueprint others follow. In 2025, the meme coin that stands out might not be the funniest—it might be the safest. And Dragoin? It’s making that bet—with code, not just words.

In a new announcement on the social media platform X, Coinbase says it’s adding support for decentralized roll-up protocol AltLayer ( ALT ), decentralized finance network Pendle ( PENDLE ), and gamified learning platform Layer3 ( L3 ) nearly a week after adding them to its listing roadmap. News of the additions sent all three altcoins flying, as AltLayer, a protocol that uses rollups to enhance scalability, went from a low of $0.037 on March 26th to a peak of $0.041 a day later. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.0407 at time of writing, a 8.3% gain on the day. Pendle, a project that tokenizes yields, also saw gains as it went from a low of $2.83 to a peak of $2.99 during the same time frame. It too has retraced and is trading for $2.95 at time of writing, a gain of 3.7% during the last 24 hours. L3, a program that teaches users about Web3 via interactive games, skyrocketed as well, as it went from a March 26th low of $0.087 to a peak of $0.106 just a day later. It is moving for $0.104 at time of writing, a 17.5% gain during the day. Coinbase first added the altcoins to its listing roadmap – which is used to increase transparency and prevent the front-running of new tokens – on March 21st, also causing the digital assets to rally at the time.

The ever-evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi) just got a significant boost. If you’ve been keeping an eye on Celestia (TIA) and the burgeoning universe of liquid staking, you’re in for a treat. MilkyWay, the protocol known for its innovative approach to TIA liquid staking, has just announced the launch of the MilkyWay Foundation. This exciting development signals a new era for the Celestia network and its community. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the future of TIA liquid staking. What is the MilkyWay Foundation and Why Should You Care About TIA Liquid Staking? Before we delve deeper, let’s quickly recap what TIA liquid staking is all about and why the MilkyWay Foundation’s entry is such a big deal. Celestia (TIA) is a groundbreaking modular blockchain network designed to scale with the growing demands of Web3. Staking TIA is crucial for network security and participation, but traditional staking can lock up your assets, making them illiquid. This is where liquid staking comes in as a game-changer. Liquid staking unlocks the potential of staked assets. Instead of your TIA tokens being locked away, protocols like MilkyWay allow you to stake your TIA and receive a liquid staking derivative (LSD) in return. This LSD represents your staked TIA and can be used in other DeFi activities, maximizing capital efficiency. Think of it as having your cake (staking rewards) and eating it too (using your staked assets in DeFi). MilkyWay has been at the forefront of this innovation within the Celestia ecosystem. Now, with the launch of the MilkyWay Foundation, they are doubling down on their commitment to fostering the growth and adoption of Celestia liquid staking . MilkyWay Foundation: A New Dawn for Celestia’s DeFi Landscape So, what exactly is the MilkyWay Foundation, and what will it do? While specific details are still unfolding, the launch of an official X (formerly Twitter) account signals the foundation’s operational commencement. Foundations in the crypto space typically serve as non-profit entities dedicated to supporting the development, growth, and decentralization of a particular project or ecosystem.
